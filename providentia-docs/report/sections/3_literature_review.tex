The following literature review aims to define the terms related to database technologies. This section begins by defining the following principles; ACID compliance and the CAP theorem. The relational model will be explained to show how classic relational database technology came to be. The shortfalls of relational databases will then be used to introduce what NoSQL technology is, and how this contrasts with the many variations of NoSQL databases including key-value, column family, and document stores. Based on our literature review, we will summarize the contributions of our research to spatio-temporal data mining, analysis, and visualization.

\subsection{ACID Compliance}
\label{sec:acid}

From an article published in \emph{Database Guide} \cite{acid}; Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) are the properties that can guarantee that transaction based databases perform reliably. These properties concern themselves with how databases recover after failures such as a transaction, system, or media failure.

\textit{Atomicity. }
A single transaction could be comprised of one or more steps, and if one of them fails then the transaction will only be partially successful. Atomicity guarantees that if one step fails, the whole transaction fails and the state of the database will be rolled back to a state prior to the transaction.

\textit{Consistency. }
Data may need to conform to a variety of rules and constraints, especially with regard to relational databases. If any data does not conform to these rules or the given schema, it will not be consistent with the rest of the database. Allowing this data to become part of the database implies that we cannot guarantee our predefined rules. This is one of the properties that NoSQL databases relax on in order to provide higher availability and partition tolerance. A consistent database ensures that any data being inserted into the database follow all predefined rules or else the transaction will be rejected.

\textit{Isolation. }
To avoid transaction conflicts, each transaction needs to be performed in isolation. This means that no transaction will affect another, and if necessary, a given transaction will take precedence over another in case of a conflict.

\textit{Durability. }
For a database to be reliable in the event of any of the aforementioned failures, it should be the case that if a transaction has been committed, it needs to be able to guarantee that the transaction has been stored permanently. Durability along with atomicity work together to keep a database reliable when faced with a failure either during or directly after a transaction has been committed.

A database that is ACID-compliant is robust against data being corrupted during a failure and guarantees that only successful transactions are processed.

\subsection{CAP Theorem}
\label{cap}
Gilbert \& Lynch \cite{cap} explain that, in distributed systems, there is often a trade-off between consistency, availability, and network partition tolerance (CAP). Eric Brewer presented this theorem in the context of geographically separated datacenters supporting web services, implicating that a multi-node database cannot ensure all three properties under CAP. Following this web service context, the three properties are described as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Consistency} means that the server will return the correct response to each request.
    \item \textbf{Availability} will guarantee that every request will receive a response.
    \item \textbf{Partition tolerance} refers to the system implementation allowing the database to be split into multiple groups unable to communicate with one another.
\end{itemize}

Gilbert \& Lynch, when referring to these properties, say:

\begin{quote}
    ``CAP states that any protocol implementing an atomic read/write register cannot guarantee both safety and liveness in a system prone to partitions.''
\end{quote}

The CAP theorem illustrates the trade-off between safety and liveness when considering an unreliable system. For the safety property to hold, every point in each step of a transaction should be atomically consistent. For the liveness property to hold, a desirable outcome should result as long as the execution continues for long enough.

\subsection{Relational Databases}

The \edt{relational} model's structure stores data in tuples with relations represented as tables. Each tuple has attributes, primary and candidate keys. Each attribute has a domain which is the data type of the attribute's values. The tuples became rows and attributes the columns for each row under their respective tables. Furthermore, the degree refers to the number of columns in a table whereas cardinality the number of rows in a table. An illustration of this can be seen in figures \ref{fig:relationalDatabase} and \ref{fig:foreignKey}.

    \label{fig:foreignKey}
\end{figure*}

The high level language concepts introduced are the algebraic operators we see in SQL today such as \verb|SELECT|, \verb|UNION|, \verb|JOIN|, etc. These operators allow users to convert relations (tables) into other relations (resulting in tables as output).

Since the 1970's, relational database management systems have been the leading database technology with a variety of capabilities and language dialects. This was until NoSQL obtained traction among large Internet corporations and was implemented in the form of distributed, non-relational databases in the 2000s \cite{dataInNosql}.

\subsection{NoSQL Databases}
\label{nosqlDatabase}

NoSQL databases were created to address the shortfalls in classic relational databases when used for data of large volume, variety, and velocity \cite{nosqlDb}. Many of these issues were introduced with the increasing popularity of the Internet and systems hosted in the cloud. Relational databases scale poorly over multiple nodes and on large volumes of data, which is why SQL databases could no longer be used as the data solution for major Internet companies such as Facebook, Amazon, and Google.

NoSQL database technologies are non-relational and use non-SQL languages to manipulate and query the data. NoSQL is designed to run on multiple nodes (distributed systems), scale horizontally, and some even implemented technologies such as massively parallel processing (MPP) \cite{tigergraphMpp} or in-memory processing (such as H-store \cite{hstore}). NewSQL is a distributed SQL technology which implements NoSQL features to achieve ACID-compliance (alongside partition tolerance). They will not be referred to as relational database technology when mentioned in this paper \cite{nosqlDb}.

A main challenge for non-relational database systems is the conflict between high availability in distributed systems and remaining transaction based and ACID-complaint (see Subsection \ref{sec:acid}). This results in NoSQL DBMS to typically choose availability and partition tolerance over consistency (see Subsection \ref{cap}) and have become BASE (Basically Available, Soft-state, Eventually consistent)-type systems to compensate \cite{base}. Not all NoSQL databases follow this trend and there are some vendors such as Neo4j and OrientDB that are fully ACID compliant \cite{acid}.

NoSQL databases fall under a broad scope and, in this paper, they will be classified under four categories; key-value stores, document stores, column family (or wide-column) stores, and graph databases.

\paragraph{Key-Value Store}

The basis of a key-value store is that the data is organized in the form of key-value pairs. The key is typically a numeric or string value whereas the value can be any data object or collection of data objects (where a list would be represented by multiple entries of the same key). Each document has a unique identifier with a list of attributes forming the key-value paired data. A simple example of this can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:keyvalue}.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \small
    \centering
    \import{img/3_litReviewFigures/}{keyValue.tex}
    \vspace*{5mm}
    \caption{An example of business entries stored in a key-value store.}
    \label{fig:keyvalue}
\end{figure}

Castellano \cite{keyvalueArticle} explains that key-value stores are designed to be lightning fast, simple, and unstructured. They expose three operations namely; \verb|PUT|, \verb|GET|, and \verb|DELETE|, with some implementations adding an additional operation, \verb|SEARCH|, that matches keys or key-value pairs given a specified search expression and key namespace. These databases are decentralized in nature so struggles to provide the transactional guarantees of ACID.

\paragraph{Document Store}

As the name suggests, document store databases store their data in the form of documents. Typically, the document formats are JSON, XML, PDF, etc. Unlike key-value stores, document stores are semi-structured and both keys and values are fully searchable \cite{nosqlDb}. Document stores are still schema-less and are well suited for data that is dissimilar such as those which do not fit well in a table with set columns \cite{docstoreArticle} or require many ``nulls''. These databases, like key-value stores, do not perform well if the data is highly relational and requires some kind of normalization.

\paragraph{Column Family Store}

Manoj \cite{docstoreArticle} explains column families as more structured data stores in that they store data in columns. They are a hybrid row/column store but store their data in distributed architectures instead of tables. Data is stored in a column-family (analogous to a table in SQL), but column-families have no relation to one another unlike in relational models. Column-families are less flexible than the previous key-value and document store databases as one will have to predefine a column family's attributes and are grouped together under keyspaces. A column-family model is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:colfam}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \small

    \import{img/3_litReviewFigures/}{columnFamily.tex}
    \vspace*{5mm}
    \caption{An example of user and business column-families.}
    \label{fig:colfam}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Graph}

Graph databases, the focus of this paper, applies a graph structure to store and manipulate data. Data can be stored as key-pair attributes on both the vertices or edges of the database (as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:graphDb}). Graph databases are considered as NoSQL databases but are unique in that they are significantly more structured than the NoSQL models aforementioned, can handle both semi-structured and structured data effectively, and concern themselves with relations. Edges can be unidirectional or bidirectional which may add more information about the kind of relation between two edges \cite{nosqlDb}. Graph databases typically persists the data using a storage back-end. This can be a NoSQL database, as in JanusGraph's case, or a relational database, as in Facebook Tao's case \cite{bronson2013tao}.

Graph databases are strong at finding patterns and revealing information about the relationship between vertices rather than aggregate queries on the data itself.

Within the category of graph databases we find three main subcategories; property (or attributed) graphs, hypergraphs, and resource description framework (RDF) triples \cite{socialData}. The type of graph databases focused on in this investigation are property graphs.

\subsection{Summary}

From the discussion above, we face the following questions:

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{What would make a non-relational solution more suitable than a relational solution?}
\end{quote}

Moniruzzaman \& Hossain \cite{nosqlDb} elaborate on the shortcomings of relational database technologies in terms of performance when distributed over geographically diverse datacenters due to their strong emphasis on consistency while maintaining ACID-compliance. As emphasized by Chen \cite{socialData} \& Makris et. al. \cite{mongoVsPostgres}, due to the trend of services hosted in the cloud and velocity of incoming data and requests, a horizontally scalable, distributed system would be best suited to address these issues -- which would suggest a NoSQL solution.

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{When compared among other NoSQL databases, what makes a graph database solution stand out?}
\end{quote}

Spatial data is often highly relational due to the ties between vertices representing physical locations and their association with other entities in the database. This means the data will be closely related and that trend will follow in how the queries are written. Chen \cite{socialData} explains that the queries in a graph database are designed to reveal hidden trends among the relationships in the data (especially when visualized) rather than within the data itself adding additional value in this implementation.

Time adds an ordinal relation among all entries in the data that hold this property. Graph databases are the most relational among the NoSQL databases and have the ability to be queried to answer complex questions on complex data. These complex questions would be multi join-style queries which are typically expensive, but due to a graph's relational architecture, graph databases should be better suited in comparison to other NoSQL database solutions in handling semi-structured data \cite{dataInNosql}.

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Why compare a relational solution to a graph database and not another NoSQL solution?}
\end{quote}

Relational databases should come close to what is required in our setting due to their ability to manipulate data based on table relations, but their lack of scalability may impact overall benchmark performance negatively when tested on large volumes of the kind of data we consider, especially due to how join-style queries scale with table size \cite{dataInNosql}.

Makris, et. al. \cite{mongoVsPostgres} compares how MongoDB (with GeoJSON) and PostgreSQL (with PostGIS) perform against one another on spatial data and show that PostgreSQL outperforms its NoSQL rival. Considering our discussion in subsection \ref{nosqlDatabase}, it does not come as a surprise, given the lack of suitability of relational queries in a document store databases. In general, complex queries perform poorly in databases such as MongoDB. One important observation that this paper does point out is how well PostgreSQL performs, despite the volume of data. This suggests that the scalability issue of relational databases was not as prominent in this comparison as much as how well these complex queries were handled.

\begin{quote}
    \textbf{Why spatio-temporal data?}
\end{quote}

Spatio-temporal data is constantly being generated by GPS-equipped devices everyday \cite{twitterData}\cite{clost}. This data has important applications in epidemiologic \cite{spatiotemporalEpidemiology}, marine, disaster relief, and social data investigation \cite{rao2012spatiotemporal}. Few papers address a graph database solution for spatio-temporal data, but due to its importance and abundance it would be important to seek an appropriate technology to store, model, and visualize these datasets.

\paragraph{In conclusion} The findings in this paper would answer which technology, graph or relational, would perform the best not only in benchmark performance but also in suitability in terms of querying, modelling, and visualizing of spatio-temporal data. This answer will be useful if one would like to perform analysis on not only a spatio-temporal dataset, but also investigate relationships in the data with a suitable database, and perform/write efficient queries.
