I highly recommend Umai Umai, and have been there more times than I can count. I found it comparable, if not better than Morimoto, and it's actually ruined other sushi places in the city for me because the sushi here always tastes so fresh and delicious. The pink shrimp tempura is amazing, and you can never go wrong with the chef's choice or the designer rolls. Even the Philly roll is way better than any one I've had elsewhere.
