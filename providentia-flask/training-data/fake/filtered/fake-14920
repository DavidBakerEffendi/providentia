I love this place. The food is delicious and service is great.  The staff is ready, willing, and able to explain the dishes to you and how to actually eat them.  We've eaten here several times already and have enjoyed it immensely each time.  (We've always ordered the vegetarian dishes.)  Parking can be a bit of an issue at times.
