I imagine this place is mobbed at happy hour.  So, wait until about 10:00 p.m., and enjoy a much more relaxed atmosphere.  We like to eat at the bar, trying several appetizers ("snacks" here).  It was still busy, but the bartender was skilled at getting everyone served without much of a wait.   The rosemary & chicken heart skewers were fab.  Juicy, fragrant, very tasty.  So good, in fact, I ordered a second one while my friend enjoyed his pork cracklings (ugh).  He said they were perfect. The Prosecco was good, but a little over-priced at $10/glass.  Still, it went well with the tiramisu, which was outstanding.
