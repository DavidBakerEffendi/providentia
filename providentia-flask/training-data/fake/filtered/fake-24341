I've always enjoyed this place - we love Mexican and it's around the corner. However, I was disappointed when I called to place a takeout order and found that they'd taken enchiladas off the menu because they aren't "fast" to make. I was truly bummed because it was the only place in West Philly to get enchiladas. **Side note - I didn't see that they'd changed their menu because their website requires that you download an app to your phone in order to the view the menu!** I ended up ordering green pepper tacos which looked amazing, but after taking a bite out of it my mouth was on fire! I LOVE spicy stuff, but this was to a point that I couldn't even enjoy it. I didn't request anything hot on the tacos and didn't put any hot sauce on it. By the time I got down to the last taco it was cold because it took so long to power through the burn. My partner got a burrito and he loved. But again, the salsa was WAY too spicy. Honestly, we love spice and literally house salsa at authentic Mexican places around the city. But this was to a level that it wasn't enjoyable - as much as I tried to just keep eating. :P I love this place and I'd love to see them put the customer first and not their need for speed - aka removing a simple dish from the menu. I mean - it's cheese, tortilla and sauce. The food really is delicious if you can get past the ridiculously spicy sauce, and if you aren't jonesing for an enchilada, you'll love their food.
