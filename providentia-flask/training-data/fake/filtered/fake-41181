Totto's makes a very nice bowl of Ramen, with rich broth, and perfectly done al-dente ramen noodles. They also have spicy or VERY spicy versions available as well. They didn't earn a 5 star rating with me because I've traveled enough and sampled enough ramen to know that it COULD be better. There was only one choice of noodle type, whereas top shops offer several choices. And the lines at Totto's which are usually anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours are ridiculous! However they serve up a very good bowl of ramen that is hot and satisfying, and the waitstaff are very pleasant. If you don't mind waiting, you will certainly get your money's worth and have a pleasant ramen meal. Very small place, few tables and they're small, don't go with a group of more than 4 people.
