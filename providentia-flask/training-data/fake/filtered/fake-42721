I don't write yelp reviews because I don't feel a lot of spots of worthly of my time. I eat out a lot and have been to some of the best resturants from manhattan to long island to miami to california and the list goes on; this resturant in particular deserves my time. When I saw this new italian resturant that opened up in my area (bay ridge) I asked my boyfriend to check it out with me. A lot of busy resturants always fail on service even if the food is good. This place is on another level. My very first time here we were seated right away and approached by an amazing waiter named Jimmy. This guy is by far my favorite waiter ever! Better than all of the waiters in some of the top resturants in the city. This place constantly has a great changing menu and they always add new things and specials so you never get bored of the same thing. I started coming here often and all the waiters are constantly serving the people and engaging and laughing with them. I feel like this is my second home. I have never felt such a strong bond to any resturant before. Just last night I went to have dinner and the food was so delicious. I recommend the bloody mary drink-- jimmy makes it amazing!!! And their personal pizza and baked clams the best combo ever! Special shout out to will, steve, arnold and eric you guys are all amazing....
