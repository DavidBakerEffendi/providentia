Hands down the best Italian food I've ever had.  The atmosphere is phenomenal and the staff is friendly, and SO helpful.  My boyfriend and I frequent Mulberry Street at least 3-4 times a week. My favorite drink is the Lime Ricky martini. It's fresh and very tasty! The best garlic bread, ceasar salad, and penne vodka that I've ever had! You are missing out if you dont go! My boyfriend could eat their veal every day of the week!
