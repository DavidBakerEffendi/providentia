I moved about a block away from Peppino's, and it quickly became my go to place for when I want a tasty margherita pizza.  The atmosphere is comfortable inside, the waitstaff (er, waitress - it's been the same woman every time I've been) is incredibly nice, and the bruschetta is to die for.  Seriously - my wife (a phenomenal cook) has been trying to replicate it at home, but something about the bread is hard to pin down. I recommend that you get a Caesar salad, a small margherita pizza, and the bruschetta to share if there are two of you and you're particularly hungry.   Also, if you want to split the salad, they go ahead and put it into two bowls for you.  How cool is that for the down the street pizza joint?
