Went two times. One after visiting the Christmas Village and the light show at the Wanamaker Building on a cold night. Seriously the perfect place to get hot chocolate (which is almost like melted chocolate in a mug) and a chocolate pizza which you can pick your own toppings and it's baked on a very lightly sweetened crust so it isn't too overwhelming of a dessert. This is all coming from the world's most obsessed chocolate eater by the way. The second time I went was the night before the Philadelphia Marathon and my sisters and I thought we would try their dinner menu. The mac and cheese, the alfredo and the risotto (the risotto isn't on the menu anymore I don't think) were all so so so good I seriously want to go back right now, one of my favorite places by far.
