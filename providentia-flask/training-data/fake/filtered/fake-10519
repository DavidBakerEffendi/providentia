Very pleasant surprise! Doesn't look like much from the outside, but step inside and step into a different world. I had the fish tacos and my husband had the mexican street fight. both were excellent. Food and atmosphere were both awesome. We will be back. so much more on the menu to try. Big thumbs up.
