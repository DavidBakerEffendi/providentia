In fairness, this review has nothing to do with the food because I didn't have the chance to eat there. Since they aren't on opentable, I made a reservation three weeks in advance for my mother's birthday by phone.  I received a confirmation email, but I didn't look at the text.   Fast forward to the night before, when I opened the email to see what time I needed to arrive, and I noticed it said two people instead of one.  I called to try to straighten it out.  I emailed the general manager.  (Apparently, they won't talk to consumers who have complaints.  Or even get back to them in a timely fashion.)  He offered me 5:30pm, which we couldn't make. (Our reservation was @6:15 on a Thursday night.   I offered to postpone the reservation, for a week, and he offered us 5:45, which was again too early.   When I said, no, he told me he would keep me posted about cancellations.  I am not that desperate to eat there.  I wanted my mother to have a good meal in a fancy place for her birthday.  That didn't happen because they mixed up my reservation.   Long story short, if you want to eat at this place, make sure that the confirmation email is correct.  And, if it is not, call them right away, because they will not accommodate  you.  Or even be nice about it.  And don't make it for a special occasion because if something goes wrong on their end, they won't be accommodating.
