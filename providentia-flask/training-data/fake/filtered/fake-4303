My son has been going here with his friend ( a half hour drive from our house), so we stopped in on Saturday to try it. I was not disappointed. My son had " godfather pizza" which he loves, my husband had sausage & pepperoni. I had chicken ceasar salad pizza sounds weird but oh so good. Their crust is perfect, just the right amount of crunch. the staff is friendly. You must try this you won't be disappointed. My only complaint is it's not closer to my house
