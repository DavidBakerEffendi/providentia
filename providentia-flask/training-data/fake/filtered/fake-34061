This place is amazing. Top notch soups, best Spanikopita in NJ in my opinion, and quite frankly some of the best grilled chicken I have ever had. The manager of the restaurant works tirelessly to make sure that everybody is greeted and that their food is just to your liking. I have been here about 10 times over the course of 5 months and wish I had the time to increase that ratio. On a recent trip I tried a new dish called skordalia and loved it. Bravo!
