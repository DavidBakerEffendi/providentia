Went recently for Dining Days menu. It was brutally hot outside so we were looking forward to drinking a cool glass of white wine with dinner. Unfortunately, the dining room was uncomfortably warm and they had run out of wine chillers. After complaining about the temp we were moved upstairs to a table right in front of the A/C unit which was great. The food: I had the escargot which came with a polenta cake that was way too salty. I spent most of the meal trying to get the salt taste out of my mouth.  For the entree I had the hanger steak. The steak was cooked perfectly but the dish came with no carb. Just wilted greens and a fried oyster. I also think it was supposed to have a raisin puree which was absent. Had the chocolate torte for dessert which was ok but nothing spectacular.  My partner had the salad to start and it was beyond bland.  Her pork entree was cooked to perfection but based on the description we thought the beans would have a more prominent role than a tiny bit of puree on the plate.  Also, the brussel sprouts had no flavor or texture.  I've had much better experiences at several other BYOB's around town that are at a similar price point.
