It's just as good as everyone says.  The pizzas are wonderful.  They'll make whatever changes you want,so it's more-or-less build your own.  The pizzas might be a little more expensive than other places, but you get more than what you pay for. And the $3/pint house beer (which is not bad) brings the overall cost down to bargain levels. The guys/gal who work there could not be nicer if they wore Valium patches, but they move too fast for that to be the explanation. I guess they simply are good folks.
