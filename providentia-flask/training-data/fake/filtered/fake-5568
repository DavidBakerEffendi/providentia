I went there with a friend for the Restaurant week event. The online menu said that drinks were included in the $35.00 price.  When we got there we were informed that it was a typo and they we had to pay extra for them. Classic bait and switch. I emailed the manager and she has not responded.  Not a fan of being lied to...would give less than one star but that is not an option.
