I love this seafood restaurant!!  They have a very nice selection for dinner and are reasonably priced. I recommend the Fish Market soup for starters followed by the most delicious Oysters, my favorite are the West Coast Oyster kummomoto - they melt in your mouth and are great energy boosters! Then if you're still craving more delicious seafood they offer Lobster, Crab and  fish made to your specifications. OH! and they also have the most YUMMY Key Lime pie I have ever tasted!! Seafood lovers I highly recommend Fish on Bleecker Street.
