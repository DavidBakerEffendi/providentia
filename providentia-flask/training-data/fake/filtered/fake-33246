Well... came back, benefit of the doubt type situation... luckily the loud and overbearing and egotistical manager who previously made my experience here very uncomfortable was not here and was instead couple owners who were so nice! HOWEVER: EVEN LESS GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS THIS TIME AROUND! it's like, they don't care about people with celiacs... was told the chivito completo was gluten free, totally misinformed because I literally became ensconced in the banquette by the bloat that followed quite rapidly after consuming the sandwich. Manager messaged me personally and said I could come back and was perhaps misinformed about my gluten free options but it seems like they don't know their own menu! Really wanted some pho that day but they couldn't deliver once again. Never coming back, essentially.
