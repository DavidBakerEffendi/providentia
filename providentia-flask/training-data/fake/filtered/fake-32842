We went twice in 3 months, it seems, they may have an excellent cook.  I already met the cook.  Very good food.  Also, we are very happy, that they are very close to our place.  I, my husband, friends,my real estate clients,  they all seem to like the food.  Their paneer item is delicious.  I also take my clients to this place too after we close  on the house. nita v/ ramesh s.
