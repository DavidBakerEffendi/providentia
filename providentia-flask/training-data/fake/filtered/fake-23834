The fresh mozzarella and basil pizza here was outstanding. Probably second to Di Faras, but giving it five stars because it is a little different than DiFara's. We braved the line on Valentines day thinking everyone was eating at fancy restaurants that night. Boy we were wrong. It was like a Single's appreciation event and the entire club went on a Pizza field trip- the wait was well over an hour. and well worth it. The white wine was horrible, needless to say. So I'd stay away from the wine!
