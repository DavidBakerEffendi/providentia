I had dinner at this place once and absolutely loved it!! Unfortunately, we were short on cash and kind of in a rush, so I don't feel we got to have the full "Balkan" experience. But the food is very authentic and rich. We started with the stuffed cabbage which was AWESOME and then I had the stew which was just the right spicy, very hearty. There was a Turkish wedding party there while we were dining, which was loud but entertaining. Definitely take a bottle of wine, great date place. The owner is very nice!
