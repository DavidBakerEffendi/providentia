Been here with group of six last night . Worried about previous reviews. But the way we got treated was simply awesome.. Descent atmosphere, respectful and polite  service .. And the most important thing is Food ..was simply amazing , we ordered five entrées and each dish was flavorful and mid spicy as we ordered.. The naan bread was better than ever.. I will be back for sure.. They deserve more stars..
