Been eating here for years, since the owners were just wee boys helping their folks out.  Never disappointed, always perfection!  The Old Fashioned Pie is out of this world, along with the Buffalo Chicken Cheese Steak.  Retired now and get their takeout with delivery - it's always quick, hot and delicious!!
