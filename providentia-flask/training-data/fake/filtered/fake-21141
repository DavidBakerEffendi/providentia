My family stopped in for lunch. Just saw it driving by. Very glad we did. Pizzas excellent. Liked that we could buy it by the slice. The Italian dishes on the menu looked good, and the arancini did not disappoint-very good. We ate in, and were Â very glad we did. Owners friendly, service great. When we are in the area again, will definitely go back.
