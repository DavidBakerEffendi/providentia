Let me start by stating the positive attributes of this place: the food is delicious, the prices are reasonable, and the atmosphere is nice. Major negative: the service is atrocious. You have to accept that if you are goingto come here. I used to frequent SriPraPhai frequently when I lived in Queens, and each time the service got worse. It's not so much that the servers aren't friendly (most I encountered weren't), but the fact that they are inattentive. After you place your order that is it--you will have to flag them down to get any refills, the check, etc. In a nutshell, if they could improve the service, I would definitely bump this place up to 5 stars.
