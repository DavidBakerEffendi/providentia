This was a disappointing meal. The appetizer I had (an eggplant tart) was fine but unremarkable. A side dish of broccoli rabe was flavorless and watery. While the pasta in the oxtail pappardelle was cooked perfectly, the ragu had very little flavor. I tried my friend's polenta and thought it was dull as well. Other elements of the meal were also disappointing. My friend had to send back his polenta because the egg on it was cooked improperly. The presentation of the food -- something I normally don't care about -- was unappealing. The servers also seemed overwhelmed by the large crowd. Overall, there are dozens of places in this neighborhood I'd rather go.
