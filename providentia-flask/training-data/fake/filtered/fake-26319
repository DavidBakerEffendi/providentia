Yes the food here is good. Yes they've been serving the neighborhood longer then you and I have been around. And yes definitely they are expensiivveeee for CTown standards. Sam Bo Fan which is 3 meat dish with rice is $6.50, hello that is insane! and it's not a big plate. Honestly you can find better options in butcher shops that also serve Chinese barbecue fare over rice for half the price. And it's bigger too. Today I only eat here whenever I have friends visiting and since they can afford it they splurge. Otherwise for the penny pinchers like me, you've got way more cheaper options then here.
