When we first arrived, we were told we'd have a fifteen minute wait.  Guess what?  It literally was fifteen minutes ... actually less.  It was 13.  And that was ALL we needed at 10pm to ensure a perfect rest of the night. Although our waitress was a tad busy, causing her to be a little forgetful/slow with the lemon for out water (the only drinks we ordered), the restaurant more than made up for it with complimentary appetizers from the executive chef. Not only were we comped edamame dumplings filled with delicious pea shoots, truffles, and sake broth, but immediately after we were brought the General Tso dumplings (chicken, soy, vinegar). These treats made us more than willing to pay for our already ordered Kim Chee fried rice. Definitely make a reservation today!
