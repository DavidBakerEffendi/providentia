This is my second stop at Vesta and the food and service were fantastic. I was served by Jackie and Allison who were attentive, quick and friendly. I had the Filet mignon special and every bite was heavenly. I would suggest this place to anyone looking for a great pizza place that also offers a great selection of beer in East Rutherford. If you are not in the mood for pizza then definitely feel free to try their other selections as you can't go wrong.
