mmmm. Bartender was extremely knowledge with the oyster menu and most importantly, the best drinks. I tried the "punches" which are their specialty tea infused cocktails. I arrived later in the evening and enjoyed the quiet atmosphere. I walked by earlier and the place was packed. Glad I coud wait several hours while the crowd died down.
