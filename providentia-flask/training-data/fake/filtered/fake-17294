If a place is packed on a random monday night, its good! Ended up being about a 20 minute wait, but the Host told us to go next store to Von, a busy hipster bar. Drinks $8 but I'd rather drink then watch other people eat. The host came and got us. Great Service!! We ordered Crispy Artichoke and Fried Parsely as an appetizer.... Very random I know..but very adventurous I had lasagna-very meaty on top she had-linguine with seaford with wine and a beer under $50 We sat next to the Designer of Pegleg
