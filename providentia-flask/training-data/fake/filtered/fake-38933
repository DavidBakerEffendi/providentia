Here we go....two thumbs up! So i am actually not a huge fan of Indian food, mostly the way you smell after you eat it. I mean, do you really want to go on a hot date and leave smelling like Ekta? Nope...didn't think so. But, since i was forced by a friend I gave in and was pleasantly surprised....not over seasoned, which I find often with Indian restaurants in the US. As if they are trying to appeal more Â the taste buds of an American, and also so the customer can find the food more relate-able, so i can understand the train of thought, anyway...i did not have this problem with this establishment. price:totally reasonable service:no complaints xxxxx BT p.s- i like it better then Tiffin
