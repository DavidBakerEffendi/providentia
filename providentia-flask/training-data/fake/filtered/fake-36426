I'm a recently graduated Yale student, and I've been eating the Thai food in New Haven for the last three years.  In terms of quality of food, this is the best Thai restaurant in town.  Their pad thai beats the pad thai at other places, and many of their other curries and noodle dishes are superior.  Ambience could use a little work, especially when they go a little heavy on the incense, but the dining room up the stairs is quite nice.  Overall, the best Thai in New Haven because of the food.  Definitely recommended.
