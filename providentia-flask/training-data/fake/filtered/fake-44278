Lee's Deli's carrot cakes are UNREAL and, arguably, the BEST carrot cakes in PHILLY! Unlike many of these reviewers, I frequent Lee's Deli solely to pick up carrot cakes for the week because these treats vanish as soon as they hit the shelves! These cakes are PERFECT. The not-too-sweet cream frosting balances with the moist richness of the cake texture. Each bite hits the buds with tidal waves of flavor. This humble, award-winning recipe transcends your ordinary supermarket-cakes. Whether you have a fierce sweet tooth (like me), or if you are not a carrot-cake fanatic, you are in for an addictive treat. I am absolutely in love with Lee's Deli's carrot cakes! BEWARE: the carrot cake craze is contagious! =)
