After walking across the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan, my friend and I waited in line for almost an hour before we were seated at Grimaldi's on a Sunday afternoon. While waiting in line, I did notice that the take-out line and the dining line are now one and the same. This was clearly stated at the entrance of the restaurant. I have to say the thin-crust pizza remains one of my favorites in NYC. However, I was put off by the service charge that was inserted into our bill. A review on another website said that the "service charge" was inserted because the diners looked like "foreigners". The simple one-page menu did not state that a service charge would be levied for 2 people dining at the restaurant. Has anyone else have had service charge levied on their final bill? Because of the wait and the service charge inserted, I am giving this a 3-star.
