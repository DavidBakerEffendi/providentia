Went to try this place yesterday and will definitely be back soon! The place was adorable and had so much charm! The food was wonderful! Went to this place with three of my non vegetarian friends and we were all as equally pleased with our meals. I had the roasted artichoke panini which was very good. My friend had the portobello sandwich which was so amazing! Definitely the winner of the night. My other friend had a kale salad which was pretty tasty, Our other friend had the chicken in a garlic sauce, which was so yummy! Unfortunately, her brown noodles had no flavor at all. Aside from that one dish we Â all really enjoyed our meals! I can't wait to check out the tofu scramble for brunch soon!
