I'm not one to write reviews, and This is actually my first time.  But I just had the worst experience ever... I frequented el almecan at least once a month, but sadly that's all over now.   We went at saturday evening (we had friends visiting from germany and they really wanted steak)  The hosted told us an hour wait and to go some place else for a drink and when the table was ready and that they would call us.   An hour and 1:15 minutes passed and we went back, and she said it was going to take just a bit longer.  We went for another drink, at this point starving, no call, I went back to check (2 hours had passed at this point).  2 new tables where sat.   I asked the hostess about them and her response was they are friends of the managers... then a large party was about to leave, I asked about that table, her response was another party just called and they were coming in.  She just told me to go try to see if there sister restaurant down the street might have seats available. My problem is not that the restaurant was busy, but the rude mismanagement of the place.  If you know there are multiple large parties coming in, then deter the customer away from the start,  Don't make them wait hungry for over 2 hours.  I've worked in restaurant all over the city, and we never treated the costumer with such rudeness.   Luckily we ended up going to marlo and son's afterwards where not only are they pleasant, but the food is alway excellent.
