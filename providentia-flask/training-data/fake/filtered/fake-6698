Fantastic food! Great atmosphere even if the tables can be a bit cramped (but, hey, it's New York! so deal with it). The $5 dates covered in bacon was delightful and a personal favorite! The place can be a tad pricey, but as is often the case, you get what you pay for. The waitress was also really nice and accommodating, and helped us get a good table. Although I neither tasted all the food my friends ordered nor drank the sangria, the place has been a local fave for a lot of people I know and rightfully so. Plus, where else can you get really tasty octopus? :)
