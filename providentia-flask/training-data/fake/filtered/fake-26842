I been there twice.  I ordered the Carne Asada Taco for a snack, which lead me there another time to order Carne Asada Burrito.  I absolutely love the place and they were very friendly.  The only complaint that I have is no, Coca Cola soda.  I settled for a Boylan Ginger Ale instead.  I became a big fan of Mexican food, since visiting Vegas. Dos Toros Taqueria definitely have my approval.
