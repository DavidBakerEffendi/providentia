Frankly I do not like to eat all that much, but when I do it is nice to have something special to eat. That is why I like to come to eat. It is a nice place that I call a "Gastro-Pub", but very dark. I #$%@ love it! I work for a company that works for a government. I sell tunnels! basically. So I don't get to eat out all that much. I wanted to get the family pack but we couldn't afford it so I got a black bean burger with a bunch of fries. I didn't like the burger so much but I ate the fries all up! I even asked for more fries and the waitress got them, just for me! I wish I could eat fries all the time, but I need to eat other food too. I will come again when I get done working for the government. See you tunnelmorrow! Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye!
