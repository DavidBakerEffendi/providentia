I cant imagine a place elsewhere that i can get so much food for under ten bucks. I could feed over 2 people and my son. Just putting it out there the steak has to be tried by everyone and the falafel samples that got me to come in the first place, wish it was baked but amazing either way. The amount of choices you get for salads and rices and toppings I was totally blown away. For the price and the load of food I was impressed; I will defiantly return for more. The food is as impeccable as the service, there was two employees, Julien/Umberto that made my day, very patient, polite and as well funny. If it wasnt for the pita I would give one more star; was kind of old and hard. Def 4/5 stars EDIT: EVERYONE TRY THE FALAFEL WITH BEATSALAD RECOMMENDED BY THE EMPLOYEES AND ITS MARVELOUS! OH AND TIHANA.
