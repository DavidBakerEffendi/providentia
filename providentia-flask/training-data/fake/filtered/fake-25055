For sure, the one of the best bars in Philadelphia.   I have been going to Sidecar since it opened and I lived right next door to the place.  First of all, they have happy hour from 12-2am.  How awesome is that?  The beer list here is always perfect, they have a ton of great beers on tap and more in bottles.  It has only gotten better since they opened the upstairs, which was necessary because the place was always crowded.  The staff always did a good job of making sure you have space, even when it is crowded.   The food is awesome, great bar food with a twist.  The honey chipotle wings are the best wings I've had in Philadelphia, not your typical bar wings.  The absolute best thing on the bar menu is the pork nachos.  Get them between at least 2 people, they are are a meal in and of themselves.  One thing: order extra pineapple salsa with them.  If you have been there you know what I am talking about.   They have a great brunch also, so get there early and if it is nice, bring your dog and sit outside and order the extra large mimosa.  They have this farmers skillet that is a great morning brunch after a late night out.  Again, this place is one of the best bars in Philly.
