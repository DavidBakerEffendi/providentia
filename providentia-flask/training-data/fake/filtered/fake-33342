What a disappointment. Â We arrived at 5:30 (there were only 3 tables filled) and did not finish until 7:00; and that's not because we were enjoying our food. It took 20 minutes for my salad to arrive, and after another 10 minutes, my friend had to ask the waiter for her cold fruit soup -- which he scooped from the refrigerator near our table. The soup, which had been forgotten, was basically a regular fruit smoothie in a bowl. Then we waited another 20 minutes or so for our entrees. Place was still not that crowded. Friend had grilled shrimp -- they were lukewarm with basic fruit salsa seasoning. My meal was awful. I ordered the duck breast medium rare as suggested by the waiter. Meat was lukewarm and cooked medium. When asked, the waiter offered to take the meat and heat it up. Meat comes back to the table medium well and very dry. Waiter graciously takes it back and has chef prepare new piece of meat. Again, medium and dry. By this point I am am ravenous, so I decide to eat it. The waiter was very gracious and did offer to get another dish when I told him that the meat was just "good" but again dry and medium. I declined his offer. Lastly, the waiter did take the soup ($8) off our final bill, which was a thoughtful touch. And, did I mention that the place had a mild odor of bleach/cleaning solution throughout the meal? We sat near the open kitchen but could not figure out where the smell was emanating from. It was awful. Finally, the place is incredibly noisy. Time to get some noise-absorbing panels for the ceiling.
