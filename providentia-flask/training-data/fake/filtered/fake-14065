I love this place! I have eaten here many times and have never had anything bad. Everything is very fresh and delicious. The portions seem perfect. I can usually just finish my plate, but then some how manage to enjoy one of their intriguing desserts as well. The staff are friendly and very cute. The atmosphere is simple and understated. And the back patio is brilliant for brunch in the warmer months. A definite must for anyone in the neighborhood.
