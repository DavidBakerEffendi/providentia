I wanted to go here simply to try the cheesecake....the irony is that I did not even have time to try it!   My initial thought was that this place would be a tourist trap with lousy food since it is located right in Times Square.  Junior's was near the the theatre of the Broadway Show me and my mom went to see and so we decided to give it a shot.  We each ordered salads; BBQ Chicken for her and Poached Salmon for me. Turns out, the couple at the table adjacent us ordered the same 2 salads!   The server seemed very rushed at first, but when he came back with our drinks he started talking some time to chat us up which was nice. You could tell he was making an effort to actual give customer service even though the place was extremely busy, which I appreciated. What I also enjoyed was that he asked if we wanted some beets and pickles while we waited for our food.  I love Beets (it also came with dill pickles and pickled cabbage....so much healthier than a bread basket!) The food came out pretty fast and tasted fresh and fantastic.  Nice big salads and the price wasn't too steep considering it was Times Square.  My only regret was being too full and not having enough time to sample the cheesecake. The next time I'm in the city I will have to go back and edit my  review once I taste it. I'm leaning toward the devil's food cheesecake or the choco mousse.....mmm.....
