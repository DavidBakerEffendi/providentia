I came on a Saturday night with a reservation and the place was absolutely filled. The whole waiting area was crowded and there were people sitting at the bars waiting for tables. We were told the wait for our party was going to be about an hour. We waited for an hour and a half before finally getting seated and waited an additional half hour for the chef to come out. Our server Shirley was super nice. Sometimes it took a little longer to find her since she was running around to her other tables but that was understandable. The sushi we ordered arrived a little bit later than we would have liked but our server explained the sushi bar was a little bit backed up. As for the actual hibachi, the chef was extremely funny and was worth the wait. We had a birthday party and he made us laugh the whole time. The food was alright. You are charged for fried rice there which is a little bit odd since many other places have it come with the meal for free. Refills are also extra and aren't complimentary so be careful. At the end of the meal, we had a fried ice cream for the birthday boy. Our server brought someone else with her and played the drums which was really nice. We definitely enjoyed our first visit here, but probably would not come back on a Saturday night since it is so busy and the wait is so long. Overall though, we had a good experience with our server and with the food so definitely try it out.
