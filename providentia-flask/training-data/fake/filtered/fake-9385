Make your reservation before coming here.  Small place with fantastic menu.  Lovely intimate place in the West Village, a must for anyone looking for those nook restaurants. Love the kale and wine selection.  Hostess had us stand around for quite a while longer than she had led us to believe, but worth it when we finally sat down.
