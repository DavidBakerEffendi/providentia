My husband and I visited the wine room at Maialino for our anniversary dinner this past weekend. The Sous Chef Jason made a meal accommodating a few of our requests and our server, Amanda, was friendly and very passionate about the food. Out of all of the courses, I loved the homemade pasta course with ricotta and pecorino. Wonderfully spicy kick, but not overwhelming. My husband's favorite was probably the lamb - I'm kind of surprised he didn't eat the bone. The wine room was definitely worth it for a special occasion!
