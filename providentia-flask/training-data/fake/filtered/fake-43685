I love Five Leaves. The food is fantastic, service is attentive and fast. The only draw backs for me, and I am tall but not crazy tall, are the incredibly tight seating arrangements and the fact that the drink order always comes out when I have already had my food for a while. Somehow the bar speed doesn't catch up with the kitchen speed. Oh yeah, and why did you have to change the mushroom toast recipe? That was my favorite. That and the granola...hands down.
