Short wait for a table for 2 late on a Friday night. Â Got family-style seating at big table in back, which was fine. Packed and noisy and dark (needed my phone as a flashlight to read the menu) but service was great as was the food. Menu is mostly interesting take on comfort food. Good selection of craft beers from all over including several I'd never seen before. That said, I'd forgo the beers for the cocktails - especially the rosemary vodka lemonade.
