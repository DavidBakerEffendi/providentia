This is my favorite restaurant in Philly.  My wife and I have been around 10 times by now, and we have never had a subpar meal.  The wait staff is stellar--very efficient and just good all around.  The food has lots of flavor.  Great prices for what you get.  Among our favorites:  the Prosciutto Wrapped Chicken Breast, the Orecchiette, the Autumn Vegetable Risotto (or whatever risotto they happen to have), and the Short Rib Ragu.  Definitely a must tru!
