I would have to disagree with most of these comments. I am from out to town and had a sausage pizza delivered. It was as bland as the cardboard box it came in. Also, there was a HUGE, BURNT dough bubble. that took up half of one of the slices. I also order the Terriaki bonless wings. The chicken was undercooked. Very disappointed.
