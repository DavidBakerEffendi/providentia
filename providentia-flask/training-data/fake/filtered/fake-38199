Greek Lady is a favorite hang out spot among students in the University City area anytime of day. The atmosphere is warm and pleasant with clean facilities, comfortable booths, and a spacious layout. Everything on the menu is great, but my personal favorites are the pancakes, made-to-order omelettes, and colossal chicken platter. The prices are very reasonable as well, and large portions guarantee that you get your money's worth. Service is every bit as good as the food. You can always expect a crowd at the restaurant, but orders are filled quickly by friendly, attentive staff who enhance the overall dining experience. I've also had great experience with take out and delivery--my food has always arrived promptly and exactly how I ordered it. If you're in the area, definitely check this place out!
