We went there 2 weeks ago with our family. It was great ! You close your eyes and you're in Paris. Busy, tables every where, nice tablecloth on the tables (that's really how we apreciate restaurants). The food was delicious, the service was fast and very politely handled. We will go back for the oysters, the duck confit was excellent and...the profiterolles were.....well, close your eyes, you are in a bistro in Paris.
