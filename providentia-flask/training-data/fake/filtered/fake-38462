The only Panamanian restaurant I've ever been to in NYC. Contrary to the stereotypes, not all Panamanian food is composed of tails and feet, though some people may find some of the cuts of meat in some dishes questionable. Anyway, Kelso is fantastic, and a great deal as well. The vast majority of the entrees, and all of the soups, are under $10, and these are reasonably large portions. The appetizers are cheap too, most of them are $1-$3. The braised pork with plantains and the chicken stew are both excellent. The empanadas are delicious and they serve Sorrel! Recommended.
