This Empanada Mamas has the best vibe, it is also centrally located. The Empanadas are very good. The cheese and caramel ones could be a little more filling. I've been here many, many times. The guacamole is horrible. They do not know how to do it. Don't come here to eat guacamole. I think their guacamole is pre- made it chances are, they buy it Â from Restaurant Depot. Come here to eat empanadas and have a beer. But if you come during peak lunch or dinner time, be prepared to wait more than an hour outside. This place is very small, with only a few tables.
