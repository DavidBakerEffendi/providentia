I was recently in Philly for the UFC show and decided to stop by Genos. I can flat out say that was easily one of the worst cheese steaks I have ever eaten in my entire life. There was nothing special about it other than the long line and the 45 minute wait. The steak had no flavor, it was cold, the cheese wasn't even close to melted and the slices of meat weren't to far off from steak um's quality. I was greatly disappointed. I ended up getting a better cheese steak at the downtown Marriott. Â I would give Geno's a negative rating if Yelp had the option.. Don't fall into the tourist traps!!!!! IMO Philly Cheese Steaks are vastly overrated and you can find a good cheese steak just about anywhere in this country.
