We ordered take out from Cubanu because it had good reviews and was near our hotel. When we called the restaurant to make sure they did take out, they said to check out their menu online. After picking from the online menu, we called in and they didn't have either of the main dishes we had selected. The hostess said it was an outdated menu. One of the items was seasonal and the other was no longer served there.  She was friendly and went through through the menu over the phone and helped us pick out a few things. We got the chicken and rice, the black bean stew and the beef empanadas. The chicken and rice was so bland we didn't even eat it. The rice was mushy and overcooked. The potatoes tasted old and gross.There didn't seem to be any flavor at all in the dish. The black been stew was so bland, it tasted like they poured a can of beans straight into the to go container. The portion was so small it only half way filled the already very small container. At $4.00 for each tiny portion, I felt totally ripped off, paying $8.00 for bland, tasteless bean "stew". The empanadas were the best out of everything, and the only things we ate, but were still very bland. When I went in to pick up the food I noticed that the atmosphere seemed really nice and would make for a fun night out, but as for their food.... it got four thumbs down my husband and I. We did call the restaurant and they refunded us half. The manager claimed the food was fresh. When we said the bean stew was bland, he said, "that's what you get when you order a side of beans." The black bean "stew" is listed under soups and salads, and was explained to me earlier to be a stew with spices, onions and peppers. The description  of the black beans and being labeled under the soup section is very misleading if it really  just is a $4.00 side of beans. Bland, soggy, gross food, great atmosphere and nice staff. If you are going to this restaurant I would suggest to stick to the bar and entertainment.
