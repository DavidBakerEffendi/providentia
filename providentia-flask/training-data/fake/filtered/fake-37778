Just ate there for the 2nd time.  The only good thing about this place is its beer list.  The burger was dry and had no seasoning and the roll it came on was stale.  The chicken dish we also ordered was also overcooked.   Would not suggest to eat here.  Service was also poor,  we waited 20 minutes for our drinks.
