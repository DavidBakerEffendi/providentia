When I heard that each slice was five dollars i thought their pizza should feel that way or better. Instead it felt like a moderately good pizza with basil and a little Parmesan . I'd rather buy basil and spread it on cheap pizza then go hungry by buying overrated pizza. Personally I think their slices are so pricey because of the praise it gets and their history.
