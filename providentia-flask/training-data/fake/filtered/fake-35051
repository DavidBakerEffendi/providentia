I've walked past Saigon Shack a bunch of times during my lunch break, and today decided to try it after popping in and out of a few places on MacDougal trying to make up my mind.  I ordered the Crabcake Bahn Mi and it did not disappoint! The balance of the crabcake, carrot, daikon, cucumber and spicy mayo sauce was perfect and the bread was a fresh crusty baguette. The ingredients were fresh and delicious. I picked up a menu on my way out,  they have a nice selection of Pho and Vermicelli dishes as well as salads and an espresso bar. Yep, I will be be back to try their other menu items as well as the espresso bar. And most definitely the lychee shake!
