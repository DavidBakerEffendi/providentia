I've been to Marisilio's a dozen times, and also gotten takeout a dozen more.  Here's what I think overall: Pros: Amazing specials, and the regular menu is good too.  The Sunday dinner thing (pasta and various meat--meatballs, bracciole, sausage)is outrageously good.  Don't miss the stuffed hot peppers for an appetizer in season, or the broccoli rabe on the side. Cons: The restaurant is frequently really cold.  The tables for two are stuck out in the middle of the dining room, and very close together--not a great arrangement for when I'm looking for a quiet date with my spouse.  The people at the next table are well within your personal space, and the table itself is too small for much food--if you want to keep picking at the app during dinner, you're out of luck. Just weird: The service is completely inconsistent.  There was an older woman working there who was one of the best servers I ever had, we saw her several times.  The last time we were there was a Sunday--early evening, not at all busy-- and we were marooned in the middle of the dining room for hours before ordering, then again before getting served, then again before being able to wrestle the check out of them.   We haven't been back since.  I would give them another try but my husband won't.  Also, takeout (even if you order from the regular menu not the carry out) is much smaller portions but at the same price as eating in.
