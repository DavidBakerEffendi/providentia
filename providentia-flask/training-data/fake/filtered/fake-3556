I do have a lot of respect for Mr. Danny Mayer...he has opened a lot of amazing restaurants Â but really if you want to eat real Roman food you should be going somewhere else....the cacio e pepe and the bucatini all'amatriciana were the worst i have ever had and believe me...i grew up eating these dish as i'm from Rome. You want to try the real deal? Go to Bocca on 19th street
