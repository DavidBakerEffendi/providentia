Astoria definitely needs more bars of this type. Here you will not find local alcoholics or losers who talk loud and wear union jackets.Unlike 30 av "lounges" here you drink will be prepared by experienced bartender not some" Blondie " which only purpose is to pose behind the bar so local albanians can enjoy in their coffees while playing with car keys trying to impress local cheap bimbos.Places like Sweet Afton,Pachanga,Brick cafe are oasis in desert.
