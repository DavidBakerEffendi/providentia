Great food but lousy service and music is too loud. We love the food, especially what is accompanied by black beans and plantains. But who wants to be ignored, have to find a waiter to ask for water again, beg for the music to be turned down so we don't have to shout at our table and be dismissed,  find that  you can't get any bread to soak up the delicious sauce, and look for the waiter again to get the check? We never got checked on once. Even great food is not worth the poor service. And we had to wait 45 minutes for a table standing on steps in an overcrowded foyer. They don't seem to care about whether on not they take care of their customers; they just ride on their reputation for the food.
