Seriously Over Priced! Not only are the prices insane...so is the owner (short white, black curly hair women) she will get in your face if you question the price of anything( i.e.  getting charged for simple modifications) ! She is an aggressive small restaurant owner that doesn't care about her customers at all and only cares about  the income that comes from them! Do not support Sketch! They are not appreciative of their customers!
