They were amazing and they made my day amazing!!! I planned my wedding from the other side of the world, with no option to visit my wedding city until 3 days before the day. From that precarious position, I chose the Moshulu for my venue & food. Over a year of emails and plan-changes and updates, they were incredibly responsive (nearly always answering my emails in detail within a day or so, sometimes within hours) and helpful - I haven't attended many weddings and really had no clue what I was doing and they were fantastic. They were welcoming and sweet for our rehearsal, where my group was boisterous and probably annoying but they were always so accommodating even though we didn't do the dinner there! They made the wedding day itself like a dream come true, better than I would ever have expected. Amazing service, beautiful premises, every stupid thing I asked was done with a smile (like when I asked for bread because my stomach was a little iffy to eat a real meal, our PERSONAL SERVER!!! brought me warm, soft rolls and artisan butter made in-house.) That personal server, Nick, was fantastic. Husband and I are not fancy people used to being served and at first we felt a little uncomfortable with what amounted to a butler but he put us at ease and by the end of the night, boy were we glad to have him around! If the Moshulu is reading this, GIVE NICK A RAISE AND A BONUS!! Everyone complimented us on the food and we thought it was wonderful too, not your usual rubber chicken, but unique and rich and delicious. The cake in particular really wowed me, I'm not a big fan of cake and wedding cake nearly always disappoints, but not only was the cake beautiful (EXACTLY the way I wanted it, even though it was a weird design) but it was delicious too. I was a bride on a budget and I feel like I got so much for my money, all night we were saying how every single penny was well spent. If you are considering Moshulu for your wedding, do not hesitate!
