I know I'm giving this place high marks, but let me put it this way. The prices are very reasonable, the empanada's are filling, but the menu is way better than other places that charge 3x the price and are not even decent. I have brought family and friends here, and they also love it. Most Spanish restaurants up town are so arrogant and comfortable with their food that they don't even care or bother, but New Yorkers can tell, we just don't come back and bad mouth you to everyone we know. How can you not even try?
