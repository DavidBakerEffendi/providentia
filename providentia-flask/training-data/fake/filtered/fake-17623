Superb experience. Selected this restaurant for a Bridal brunch due to the great reviews and was not disappointed.  The staff was attentive, accommodating and extremely friendly.  The pink champagne drink was a big hit with the group and the food was very good. Could not have asked for a better experience for the bride and bridesmaids.
