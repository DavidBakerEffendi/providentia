wow, what  a night... a lady recomended this cozzy spot in tribeca so i said we should check it out together.. must say it was great idea.  by far the most creative drink menu i have ever seen.. def try the tequila drink... and the gin drink.. both excellent..   excited to go back as i was told the menu changes often , cant wait to see what they will have next time.   chicken is chicken right? wrong!! i ordered the chicken for 2 and ate it all to my self... was a very large portion.. great.. will be going back to this spot for sure.. i almost wanted to keep it a secret.. but what the hell.. enjoy!
