I am from Virginia and wanted to expreince a "REAL" Philly steak and cheese. I must say PATS has wonderful cheese steaks...CHEESE WIZ...Who would have thought!?!?!? A little taste of heaven I must say. Now for the service...they were total A-Holes but hey I was not there for them! Hospitality defiantly was not there main priority hahaha!
