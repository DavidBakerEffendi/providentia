Our server was terrible . My cousin ordered the large shrimp and if the server was any good he should have asked her if she meant prawns. Instead he came over 3 times and said she was wrong. Then to add to the insult he charged her for 2 dinners because while she waited her husband ate 1 shrimp. Tonight was disappointing service was terrible. In 15 years it has never been like this . My family has brought many people here and this isn the way customers should be treated. It was insulting! .
