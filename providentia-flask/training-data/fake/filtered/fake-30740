I was just there a few days ago!  This place has a warm "family" vibe.  The owner and waitstaff are all incredibly nice.  The Penne Vodka is one of the best around.  I also had a pear pizza, which sounds strange, but was VERY tasty.  Another great thing is, there is hardly ever a wait!  Great spot, I will be back.
