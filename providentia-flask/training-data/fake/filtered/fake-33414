The gluten free accomondations are almost as good at Max's Oyster and Max's Fish. The food is normally superb, the service top notch, the managers always check in during dinners and are a pleasure to speak with. I have had salmon which was a tad dry once, but mostly, the food is 5 stars ridiculously good. Unfortunately, Max's Downtown doesn't use Dee's Gluten Free bread which is AMAZING (but other Max's establishments mostly use Dee's GF Rolls) and the Chef at Max's DOwntonw insists on making his own. They are crumbly and dry, made of corn maybe, and not delicious like Dee's GF Free Bread Rolls. I always look forward to the GF Rolls at Max's Restaurants and was a disappointed with the corn dry odd Chef's GF version of the rolls. Can't go wrong with the food here - or the atmosphere. Fantastic date night spot or special occasion place. Always dress up and don't forget to valet your Lamborghini in front of the restaurant so patrons can take pictures with your car :). {True Story}
