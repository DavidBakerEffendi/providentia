was looking for somewhere reasonably priced for lunch. discovered local burger in northampton ma ordered the farmhouse turkey burger it came with lettuce tomato and bacon  with honey dijon maple mayo  also had sweet potato fries with same sauce. the burger was very juicy with just a small amount of the char broiled flavor loved the dijon maple mayo gave  the burger that extra  special flavor . recently ate at another burger place in spfld ma a d local burger was much better hands down and less expensive too. also the staff was friendly and the food was served quickly at a busy time of day, what more could you ask for. definitely will be back
