Coming from DC, I didn't quite know what to expect from New Haven. Got a recommendation to go to Zinc and absolutely loved it! Appetizer: smoked duck nachos - I usually don't like nachos but these were delicious. Entree: pan seared duck breast - as good as it gets! I have had duck breast multiple times, sometimes it's too chewy, too fatty, or too dry. The one I got at Zinc was just perfect. The sweet potatoes and the sauce that the dish came with were very tasty too. I would definitely go back and get the same dish again. Wine: wasn't too impressed with the red wine they had by the glass. Tried the pino and the cab. They have a wide selection of wines by the bottle, but I didn't get to try any of these. Desert: pumpkin mousse - not too heavy, pretty good overall. Service was great too! Def recommend Zinc.
