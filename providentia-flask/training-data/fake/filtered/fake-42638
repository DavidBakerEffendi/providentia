Stop . go somewhere else..This was a place i would stop in 2 times a week on way home from work as a last resort ,. This was the LAST . I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich to go .I got home ready to eat my $10 sandwich and that was it Just a piece of dry chiken on a stale roll nothing else no not a thing but dry chicken and stale bread . Now i'm not one to complain at all but i figured i'll call since they know me by face and i alway order the same thing maybe it was a mistake just let them know . WELL after I tell her she said thats what you ordered and I should of oredered a "lady godiva" then put me on hold ..of course now i wait just to hear again the dry chicken was my fault .When she comes back on saying "yea what do you want" Â I just told her I expected at least a tomato maybe lettuce ,again she repeated "well thats a godiva you should of ordered that" then hung up.. Okay so I ask how does any place even serve that nevermind charging a ridiculous price for it . My advice to anyone that thinks of going there .DON'T . there are 3 other diners within 5miles go its worth the drive . This place is run down and so is the staff .
