I've been going to Joya since 2004. Before it got really famous, this was without a doubt my favorite restaurant. Cheap, great food, nice atmosphere. Nice bar. Great crowd. But, sad to say, it has declined since maybe 2010 or so? Definitely not as great a place to eat as it once was. Mainly because the food has gotten really bland and not as fresh tasting. Still, for the price it is hard to beat. Great place to take a date. I have taken many, many women here for first dates.
