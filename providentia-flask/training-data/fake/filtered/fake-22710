Carmela's pizza is the real deal. If you want true Italian pizza, hand crafted, by a true Italian, look no further. Rick and his wife came direct from Italy and opened this family operated establishment. The love good food, and they love making good food. When good people, with a passion for food open a restaurant, there is nothing but gourmet bliss. I live in Texas, where Chuckie Cheese is essentially the pizza standard, but I grew up in CT so I know a good pizza. Hands down, this is without a doubt, the BEST pizza in CT, and quite possibly New England. Don't let the location, or the modest decor fool you; these guys know what they are doing.
