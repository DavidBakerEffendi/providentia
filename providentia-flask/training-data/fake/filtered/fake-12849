For pizza and grinders..it is just fine.  The restaurant side for lunch is also pretty good.  But my last and final dinner there, which was tonight, was AWEFUL!    My first taste for calamari was at Carbone's in the south end of Hartford when I was 10.  I loved it!  I have had some great calamari in many places; Chowder Pot, J Gilberts, even 99 when it first opened.  But the crap we got tonight, no one could even eat.  It was from frozen and the size of the rings looked like they must have come from Architeuthis, giant squid.  It was worse then chewing on a rubber band!  My father's soup was microwaved, you can always tell that taste.  My mom's baby scallops where a joke.  There were 4 real baby scallops and the rest were normal scallops cut up...really do you think people can't tell.  Not to mention they were also not fresh and from frozen.  The waitress acted so surprised about the calamari being aweful...told us that it was always cut and breaded fresh..in your dreams maybe!  When you walk in there is a dessert case and the desserts looked wonderful..and I know they are good because we get them in our kitchen from Sysco for our special occasions.  I know that chocolate cake anywhere.  And when we ordered dessert to go..the waitress had the nerve to tell us that they come in FRESH daily.   Well they come in frozen and you may take them out of the freezer daily...wow!  Also, my daughter got the shrimp scampi and even the shrimp was from frozen.  The bread was stale.  The best part of our meal was the salad we got and the dessert we took home that has nothing to do with Angelo's.
