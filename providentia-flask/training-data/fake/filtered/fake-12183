For the most part, an excellent restaurant. Would visit again. Pros: -innovative rolls, many of which are surprisingly delicious -Chinese firecracker sake is amazing and has to be tried -wait staff is friendly and often pretty funny -practice of using invasive species in a lot of their dishes is admirable and (in terms of taste) successful Cons: -lengthy wait for food, even on a Tuesday night -the menu is HUGE, and while that's not necessarily a bad thing (large selection) this Bun guy who owns the place wrote an essay on every page. There are 50 pages. EXTREMELY irritating and pretentious, and as a result takes way too long to read through and select food -some dishes priced very reasonably, some inexplicably overpriced (the owner charges $5000 if you want him to cook for your party in the form of some ridiculously named meal. Luckily the other sushi chefs seem to be pretty competent). All in all a good place. 5 stars for the liquor, 4 stars for the food, 3 for the service and a hearty "shut the hell up" to the owner. Restaurants are about food, not telling everyone how great you are via the menu.
