Tapas! what's not to love.. you get to select various dishes to share with others at the table.. perhaps I'm just to generous, but it really is one of my favorite ways to eat... and for a lack of traveling to  Spain ,  Casa Mono does a good job at it.  Especially the Sweetbreads.. well so far most everything I've tried.  only once did i find one dish just a bit on the saltier side.. but presentation ,decor, service.. all rate first on my list.  A loyal customer, yes.. especially with a wine list like theirs..
