OK, I never do these 'review' things, but tonight I had a great experience I want to share. It was freezing walking down Church St. in Burlington, VT. I had attended UVM about 35 years ago, and was visiting for business reasons. I had a list of various restaurants from a Vermonter friend, telling me the best places in town. I walked down Church St (SO different from my days here!), and looked into her suggestions. None of the other places 'called' to me'. I came upon Sweetwaters, and instantly loved the menu selections (posted outside), and upon peeking inside, liked the ambiance. As I was alone, I was psyched to be able to grab a bar/cafe table. The waiter was very friendly, and helped me with the perfect cocktail selection. (Manhatten, no bitters, with Makers Mark ...yum!) He complimented my choice of the Asian Salmon Salad for dinner (OMG ... so yummy!) and when I asked him for rolls/bread he brought me the most amazing little crusted bread ever. The meal was a taste treat. To add to the evening, the manager came over to say hello, and it turns out he is from Â Burlington, so we had a lot of stories to share of how things had changed over the years. He was kind and friendly, without 'taking out too much of my personal space'. Again, this is not my thing to write reviews, but I wanted to give Sweetwaters my total thumbs up for my evening dining experience.
