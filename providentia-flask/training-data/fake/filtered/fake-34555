We needed to find a hotel that could accommodate our family members who were traveling to Springfield, VT to plan a memoriable a family re-union and Hartness House Inn just perfect! It was the ideal family reunion site with over 40 rooms; a large beautiful 100+ person dining room with complete catering capabilities and it also had a large wooded estate with nature hiking trail that offer families unparalleled value. It could not have been any more perfect then it was that weekend. We loved it!
