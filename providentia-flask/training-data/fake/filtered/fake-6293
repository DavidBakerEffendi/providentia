Wow. That's a lot of 5 star friends you have. I tried 2 sandwiches: Super Club and Mean Green to compare them to real Vietnamese banh mis. Â They were just OK, but seemed lacking for flavor and brightness. I don't think the semolina (I think) bread works for these two, it's too heavy. I would suggest you cook your own BBQ pork to add to your sandwich instead of relying on somebody else's seasoning. As far as your coffee, OK again, but, have you had Vietnamese coffee? 5 stars for service and friendliness.
