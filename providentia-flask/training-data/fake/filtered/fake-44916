We went there for Karaoke which was a BIG mistake the sound system was horrible, Their microphones are garbage, and don't try to sing too loud cause they'll turn you down.... Unless you work there cause get this, some of waiters/waitresses go up to sing and they showcase them like their on a broadway play.. Pulling up a chair and sitting down to is so cliche and trite.. Now for the food... Â Worst pizza ever! The pizza could only be distinguished because it said so on the box. Flat as a paper and hard as a rock. I had ordered spinach and feta pizza and what I got was far from it. They skimped out on the feta as if they were paying it from their own pocket. And not to mention the wait staff is completely rude, full of themselves, and stuck up! Never going to Brix again!
