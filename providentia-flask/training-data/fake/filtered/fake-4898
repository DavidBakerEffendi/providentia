Unfortunately I can't review the food But I can mention the violence and rude way the owner treated us when we went to his restaurant In more than 20 years of living in Manhattan it is the first time I have ever been treated this way My friend made a reservation for our annual Christmas dinner and when we arrived to the restaurant we found out that they didn't have our reservation It was frustrating to wait outside in the cold but we accepted to wait 30' as suggested by the receptionist, when 45' went by and we asked for updates on our table the owner started screaming that we lied about our reservation and in front of everybody that we should get out of there Normally I would have expected an apology for loosing our reservation and not to be treated the way we were
