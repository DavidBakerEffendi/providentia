We had never been to Staten Island and found this little gem after walking into town from the Staten Island Ferry.  What a great little place.   My husband  had the Meatball Parmesan with Pasta and it was amazing!!  The homemade meatballs were wonderful, the sauce very tasty  and the homemade fresh mozzarella was awesome.  I had the Fried Chicken, roasted peppers, fresh homemade mozzarella with Balsamic reduction panini and it was amazing.  The sandwich was warm and fresh and no oil or butter was used on the bread, which I loved.    Friendly Staff.
