Just returned from our second trip to The Belgian Cafe. While my girlfriend and her friend had a good experience, mine was abysmal. My order was simple: chicken fingers and pomme frites. The fingers were OK, but the frites did not come as requested. I asked for well done -- with an accent on EXTRA CRISPY -- frites. They came out soft, soggy and not even close to resembling crispy. Soon after we began our meal, a man I could only assume was the manager delivered some BBQ sauce for my chicken fingers. I very politely asked him if they could please make the frites more well done, as I had requested. He goes, "Well, certain potatoes aren't meant to be cooked like that, and doing so would burn them." Before I even had a chance to say, "Dude, I like them burnt; please do that," he had walked away. I found this to be a completely rude and inappropriate response for a restaurant employee. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? Hell, whatever happened to letting the customer respond? Common courtesy be damned -- The Belgian Cage will never receive my business again.
