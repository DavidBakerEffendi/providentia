Very disappointing... After reading reviews and looking at the menu I was very excited to dine there. Unfortunately it was one of the most disappoinitng meals I have had in a while. The chili lobster was ok at best, with an after taste that was too overwhelming to actually enjoy the lobster. The ribeye was also sub-par. Salty and un-nuanced.. On the other hand the service was superb and the waiter was very charming. Not charming enough to make up for the food and make me want to go back there...
