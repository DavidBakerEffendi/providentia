I've been to Saraghina at least ten times and have gone there with large parties to celebrate birthdays, but they may be losing me.  Bigger crowds and inexperienced and snooty wait staff made the last visit less than pleasant.  Add to that, the pizza was undercooked and not nearly as good as usual.  I'm giving four stars based on past experience and hope they manage to cope with their success.
