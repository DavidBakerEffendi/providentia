Came with my wife last week and we loved it! It was a Tuesday and we arrived at around 8:00 pm not expecting it to be that crowded at the time but we notice the packed parking lot.  As we walked in, we saw to our left the packed bar scene (not rowdy) but a little loud so we requested to sit in the middle room which didn't bother the maitre'd at all.   They have a nice wine list but we ordered cocktails instead.  For appetizer we had the French onion soup and the fried calamari which were very tasty.  For dinner we had the Angel Hair Pommeray and my wife had the Herb Crusted Salmon.  I would like to add here that the dinner portions are very generous!  Neither of us finished our dinners but we took them home.  The salmon was done perfectly, crispy on the outside but very moist on the inside (in fact our waiter told us that's how the chef does it and he was spot on).  The angel hair pommeray was delicious; it had a little touch of mustard seed which offset the subtle sweetness of the sauce.  LOt's of scallops and shrimp too.   No room for dessert... so we sat a few moments to enjoy the music and took off.  On our way out we noticed dancing and a great singer/sax player had arrived later on the night. at the bar.   Overall a lot of good food and seems like fun entertainment, I'm glad I tried it out
