I live near this restaurant and I have been at this place numerous times. For starters the atmosphere is very nice however it is extremely noisy and very hard to keep a conversation. This is even if there is not a large crowd. The service is absolutely horrible and I would have thought that the owners would have gotten it right by now, considering all the negative reviews regarding service that was posted over a year ago. Once you place your order for drinks it takes over 20 minutes to get them and then when you want another one, you have to hunt the waitress or waiter down. As far as ordering your appetizers it takes forever to get them.  Just to bring the bread over to the table takes about a half hour. I am not exaggerating!! When your main course arrives and you are sitting at a table for more than 7, you can expect half the table to be served and the rest of table to wait at least 10 minutes. And while your sitting at the table, expect servers to come by your table with dishes that don't even belong to the table.  Another nuisance!   The staff there looks lost.  Management should get their act together.  It is ashamed, because the food is really good and I could live with loud atmosphere but the service is so bad, it kills the experience.
