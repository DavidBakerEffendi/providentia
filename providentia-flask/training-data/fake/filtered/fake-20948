They make my absolute favorite Vietnamese sandwiches.  I always get the original BBQ pork sandwich. The flavor is so delicious- sweet mixed with salty, and the pickled vegetables add another dimension of flavor.  They are generous with the meat and fixings but the price is so reasonable.  Many other places are mostly bread with very little filling but they cost more too.  I've been eating Banh Mi Saigon sandwiches since I was a kid, so around 30 years, give or take.  I have always found their sandwiches consistently delicious.  This is the place I always recommend to friends and people who want a great Vietnamese sandwich.  Try it!  You will not regret it!
