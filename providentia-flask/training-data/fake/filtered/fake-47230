My wife and I had heard good things about this diner so we decided to try it out--what a disappointment. We ordered the disco fries for an appetizer but they were nothing to write home about.   My wife ordered the chicken francese and she was underwhelmed.  I ordered the turkey dinner and found a thick black hair in the stuffing.  Needless to say, I lost my appetite immediately. Thick black hairs aside, there was absolutely nothing special about this place.  It reminded me of the dozen or so other run-of-the-mill Jersey diners I've been to over the years.   We won't be back.
