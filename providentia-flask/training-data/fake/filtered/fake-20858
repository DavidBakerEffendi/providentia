My husband and I love the Farmacy. We have been coming here consistently (every week!), mostly for brunch. Brunch is my favorite meal, and I have not been disappointed with the Farmacy's awesome brunch options. I love their chicken and biscuits, which is probably my favorite thing of the menu. The chicken and waffles are my husband's favorite. Great coffee and free refills is a major plus, too. We have also been to dinner there, and have always been pleased. Excellent cheese board, delicious bread and butter, and my favorite dessert, chocolate mousse. I ordered the burger, which was one of the best I have had. My husband had the mussels, which were also delicious. It is frustrating to see the negative reviews because, while all places have their ups and downs at times, the Farmacy is a place that we want to come to again and again. The service is always friendly and we love talking to the great people who work there. I understand that some folks don't like spending much time waiting for food, but I have always had such a great time that I have never noticed or have felt the need to complain about service. I like my brunches to be laid-back, slow-paced, and enjoyable. Also, I know that other reviewers have mentioned the duck fat potatoes in a negative way -- I always thought that they were a delicacy, so I am not sure what the issue is there. They're delicious, and, in our experience, the fabulous staff is always willing to ensure that the food is up to great standards. All in all, I highly recommend this place. Wonderful people, delicious food, and a very cozy vibe. Love it!
