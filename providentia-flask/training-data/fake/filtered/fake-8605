Hey everyone, I could spend a long time reviewing this very good place but I won't because simply put, the pad thai dish is great.  Price is reasonable.  Customer service is fine.  Just what I want in a thai place: convenient location (for me), reasonable prices, great tasting food, and nice people behind the counter.
