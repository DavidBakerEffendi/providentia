You don't have a lot to spend? And you want a ton of food? Well this is the spot. Literally a hole in the wall, with practically no seating and a line out the door. Prosperity Dumpling is a legendary spot out here. The women who are taking the orders are shouting to get you in and out as quick as possible. It's rude but it's the real deal. The pricing is dirt cheap and you really get your money's worth. I got the pork dumplings boiled and fried. Both were spilling out with juices. YUM! And we got the egg sesame pancake. Greasy goodness! I spent about 7 bucks and it was enough food for 4 ppl. Impressive. These are the places I love.
