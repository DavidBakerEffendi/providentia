You know those occasions where you have a memorable evening that you know you will recall in the future.  This is what I experienced at Sofia Wine Bar.  My wife and I just moved to Manhattan and have toured the Midtown East neighborhood having frequented a number of establishments along 2nd Ave.  While many of the places have earned a memorable spot in our 'return to' list, Sofia offered the right balance of service, atmosphere, and food quality.  Our server's name was Jeremy, but he let us know that we could also ask for Leo.  The service was perfect.  Jeremy was attentive, and available...but did not hover over us.  The music was perfect...the setting was perfect, and as other posts have pointed out - they have a fine wine list.  I would also note that a number of places along 2nd Ave. have good wine, but Sofia serves their wine (red and white) at the right temperature.  The menu is sufficient to address a dinner appetite, but is more geared toward those wishing to have a nice bottle of wine with some nibbles (that are quite tasty).
