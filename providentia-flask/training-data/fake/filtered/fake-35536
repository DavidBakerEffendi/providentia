Now THIS is pizza!! Brick-oven, fabulous pizza!! My family and I went and had just a bit of everything! Try their crab pizza, or the bacon/sausage: too good for words! The dough is soooo delicious! In the mood for pepperoni? Theirs is the best in town! You might want to call ahead. The wait can be long but SO worth it! Definitely coming back! Excellent service and friendly atmosphere:)
