Enjoyed having brunch here, wait staff very efficient and helpful, food excellent. A little heavy on the pork choices, would have liked more protein variety. Had the pancakes with ricotta cheese, which was excellent. Nice friendly restaurant, would recommend it as a place to go with friends and family!
