i went here tonight for dinner...not only was the staff gorgeous and attentive but the whole place has an adorable vibe. the food...i thought was well priced and very tasty. i had the five leaves burger which was amazing and my friend had the hanger which was i wanna say the best in brooklyn. i will def go back
