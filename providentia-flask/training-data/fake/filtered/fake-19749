Came for a good pre set menu dinner before a show. The service was terrible! We waited 20 minutes between courses and they poured the wrong meal. Ordered a steak and didn't receive a knife to cut it until the beef was cold. Ordered coffee and was served 2 cold cups 10 minutes later. Never. Come. Here.
