Buffet style is not usually my choice in a Chinese restaurant, but I have to admit the Grand Buffet in Essex Jct., VT is well worth your trying.  I have been there several times over the past 2 years and each time I have been very pleased with both the quality and price of the food.  As a kid and young adult, I was a frequent customer of Lee's in Chinatown in New York.   So, I enjoy good Chinese food. . . . but I got to say the Grand Buffet does a darn good job. There are always 3 or 4 Chinese soups,  They have an incredible number of hot food selections. . . seafood, beef, chicken, pork, and plenty of veggies, dim sum, dumplings, egg and spring rolls, crab rangoon, and various deep fried selections.  Also sushi and an additional buffet set up with extensive selection of salads, fresh fruit and desserts. With such a wide selection in dishes, you would have to be extremely fussy to not be able to find a nice selection for your taste. As for kids who could care less about Chinese food, there are plenty of dishes for them too.  Mac & Cheese, Pizza Slices, Chicken Fingers, Veggies and many dessert & salad selections. . . .not to mention a CREEMEE machine. I have only been to the Grand Buffet during lunch time when it is usually very busy.  We have always been seated immediately and the food was always plentiful, hot and very fresh with quick turnover.  And they offer take out by the pound.  The place is always packed all day long, so that's worth a lot in getting a good review.
