WOW! What's with all the negative reviews? I also live in the neighborhood and I love it here. They're not trying to be le bec fin people. It's good, consistent food, really nice cocktails and a great beer list. To whomever said that this place is pretentious, you might need a dictionary to help you with that word. And if you think it's too expensive, you're cheap. I don't know the owners, but I've been in and out of "the biz" for some time and know people that know the owners, and they all say how much they love them. These people want very badly to make us happy, so let's give them a chance. On that note, I too have never had a hankering for marrow, so I don't order it. DUH! The burger (I got the double) is delicious. Really juicy and perfect after a long day at work. Also, the BBQ duck is amazing, but might need to adjust the bread situation. I chose to eat just half the bread, but some people are not that smart and will probably give a negative review because of it. The fried guinea hen (buffalo-style) is probably the best thing EVER! Eat it! Love it! Here's a list of other items you don't want to miss: -sweetbreads -whipped tofu (sounds boring, but it's delicious. Almost like "guacamole" said our server.) -clams & sausage. A little spicy, but the broth is great. More bread for dipping. -lamb gravy -scallops. Love the cream of wheat underneath. Such a throwback to my childhood. The service has always been great, both at the bar and in the dining room. It seems like they chose a very experienced group of people. Again, good food and great drinks. Go to the industry, you'll not regret it. Oh, and drink the pennsport fizz!
