Still hands down my favorite restaurant.  The menu varies to include local fresh products and produce, which is something that draws me.  Also, staff have always been very helpful with describing the food or making suggestions about wine to pair with entrees.  The food is creative and delicious.  The portions are good for me.  I don't like being overwhelmed with heaping plates to make up for lack of taste or good ingredients.  I have celebrated a few special occasions here and the experience at Zinc helped elevate those events in the moment and in my memory.
