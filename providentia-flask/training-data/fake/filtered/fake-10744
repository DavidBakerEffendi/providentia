Love this place!!  I've probably been here 50 times since its opened.  Usually stop in after our baseball game for dinner and drinks.  Management is great!  Jeff and Liz work hard and make sure you're taken care of.  Bartenders are friendly and personable and will put whatever you like on the tv for you to watch.  Food is excellent!  Wings are great.  Not greasy and very crispy.  All the burgers are very good.  Steak is fantastic.  Cajon chicken with pasta is outstanding as is the seasfood pasta dish.  This place is a diamond in the rough on the busy Turnpike!  Love this place!  Keep up the great work and food!  We love Tunxis Grill in Newington!!
