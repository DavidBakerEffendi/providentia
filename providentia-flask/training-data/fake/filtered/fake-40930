My husband and I visited Lombardi's Pizza, after reading good reviews beforehand and we were not disappointed. We were seated immediately and ordered a small half and half pizza to share (Marguerita and White pizza), which actually was quite large.  This was some of the best pizza we've ever had.  Would definitely recommend!
