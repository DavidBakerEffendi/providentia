We had dinner at this restaurant on a Thursday evening based on a recommendation.  Here is our experience.  The venue is small and noisy.  It was hard to have a conversation.  The menu is very limited.  Side salads are not available.  You can choose a salad high in fat and calories if you wish for about ten dollars.  Two of us ordered the scallops.  They were plump and juicy.  The dish does not come with a vegetable, only a prepared grain mixture.  All of the food was heavily salted.  We could not eat the grain mixture because of the strong salt taste.  When we commented on it, they explained that  salt helps to bring out the flavor of the food.  We responded that one can always add salt if desired. So what I had to eat was four scallops and nothing else but bread and water.  The bill for this was $27.  The total cost for the three of us was $108.  This included three entrees and a dessert of baked peaches over ice cream which was tasty. Our only beverages were tap water.  We will never return.  If you have high blood pressure or are watching your weight, I suggest you find a different restaurant.
