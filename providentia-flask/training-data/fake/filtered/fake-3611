Started going here about 7 years ago and is always my first choice for polish food in Greenpoint.  Better quality and preparion and less kitschy than King's feast or Karzma. Atmosphere is eclectic and cozy and instills an all-in-the-family feeling. The vegetable soup and blintzes are mind-blowing; golumki just like my babcia used to make.  Since it's a smaller place and usually only 1-2 front-room people performing different jobs, service can get a bit slow if it's crowded.
