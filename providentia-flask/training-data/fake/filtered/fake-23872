If you are looking for an intimate dining experience, forget it.  We had heard great things about the food and went for our anniversary.  The noise that hit us from the bar was deafening and the restaurant consisted of a few tables that looked like an afterthought.  No warmth or coziness or sense of intimacy - we decided to leave without trying the food.  Too bad.
