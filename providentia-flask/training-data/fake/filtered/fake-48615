Stopped in for pizza during the snow storm on 2/8/13...the special pizza was so good we decided to go back on Sunday for dinner.  Wow, the food is sooooo good,  I had the Panko breaded chicken special, my husband had linguini with shrimp in vodka sauce, the food was great, the portions huge.  I had it for lunch today and still have enough for lunch tomorrow.  And a bring your own is also great.  Will keep going back, loved it....
