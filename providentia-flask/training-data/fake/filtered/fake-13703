I've heard some mixed things about this place from friends who live the area. First of all it reminds you of being in Little Italy with the hawking from non-other than Mr. Grimaldi himself. Well, that a nice impression of what's to come. All I can write is this: The number 1 was almost indelible. The pancetta had a really strange odor to it and we felt that it was well cooked. Plus our soup taste like warmed over water. And table service is nothing to talk about but just take the order and walk away... not all too friendly. All you have is the very disheveled looking Patsy the pizza master play the game of small talk with you. On the bright side dessert was the only good point I can make about Juliana's. Some of my friends that are long time residents of dumbo call both Grimald's and Juliana's tourist traps.
