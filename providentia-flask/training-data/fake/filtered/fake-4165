Great "lock" back yard, which is a great name for the bar, but you don't know it until you go in.  It is great for a date, (sit by the fake fireplace) and a meeting with friends (big picnic tables).  I hope they keep the backyard open as long as the weather holds out.  The outdoors is a special treat, the gas heaters really keep it comfortable.  The decor is rustic, purposely done that way with a pipe for a "TP" holder in the bathroom.  The design is genus as long as they keep it clean!   Try the beers on tap, they are fabulous, my friend was not a big fan of his canned beer, even though it is artisan variety.  I like the serving size, so you can try two beers without getting too full.  The beer prices are always a happy hour price, how can you go wrong at 6 dollars a beer?   Fabulous ideas in the menu, they even have vegan brat choices, be aware that the vegan choice is not gluten free if that is important to you, instead try the falafel it is great!.  Be aware that their menu is a little different than on the website, which they warn might change. Great service, they really care if you are warm and if you are happy with your food.   The forks and knives are wood, probably reclaimed/recycled.  Very little plastic waste, so the owners are thinking environmental and low waste.  We should all be impressed with that alone! Parking is easy after 5pm unlike some spots in Bay Ridge.
