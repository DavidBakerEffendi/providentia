I absolutely love Zaroka, the interior is so beautiful , warm and inviting. I hadn't been to Zaroka since last summer and my experience then and yesterday was very Â different. All the staff were incredibly welcoming! Amongst all the dishes we had, we have to say that the nirvana mixed grill were our favorite since it had all the different varieties of kebab for our family!
