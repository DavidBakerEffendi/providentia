Came here on the recommendation of the 1st reviewer and wasn't disappointed! However, we did bring to the attention of the server and on duty manager a few concerns and will wait to see if they get addressed. Upon being seated, the complimentary basket of bread was cold; fair enough but do not give me diner packets of butter that were freezing cold and could not be spread! There was no wine list available and we were told that the most popular wine in the US, White Zinfandel, was not available until "next week". My wife ordered the Atlantic salmon which she said was delicious. I had the 20 oz.  rib eye steak which was served on the bone and cooked to perfection. My only complaint was with the side orders because they did not offer garlic mashed potato which is customary in most steak houses. I would also like to see a wider choice of vegetables to include broccoli because I ended up just ordering French fries. The desert menu was extensive and the crème brulee is the be recommended. On receiving the bill, I was surprised to see that a gratuity of 15% had already been added to a table for 2 diners. A final thought is please don't publish a website if it is not  fully functioning i.e. the menu page doesn't open! All that being said, the food is  "Wonderful" and we will return again soon!
