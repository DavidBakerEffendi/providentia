This is a great sushi place-by far the best in the area.  Prior reviews referred to Ahiji or Kanoko-both are mediocre and dirty.  Sushi Palace is very clean, the waitstaff very friendly and the food is great.  You cannot get a better bang for your buck.  We go at least once per week.  I would highly recommend it!
