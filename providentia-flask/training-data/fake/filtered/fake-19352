We were headed to Manayunk, but construction detours diverted us into town so we figured we'd check out the new 20 Manning.  We were greeted by a very welcoming fellow at the door; the decor has been totally updated and there's a renewed, high-energy vibe.  We sat breifly at the bar for two drinks before being seated outside surprisingly quickly for a Friday night.  The drinks were really good and same price as months ago- rare because I've often found some restaurants recoup renovation costs by subtly or not so subtly increasing drink prices. Our waiter was sharp & attentive.  Food was awesome- one of the best meals I've had in town for a long time (& I've had way too many!).  The mussels were fantastic- plump, tasty & properly done.  My girlfriend's meal was excellent too- I think she had the steak frites The place is really good and fairly priced...check it out.
