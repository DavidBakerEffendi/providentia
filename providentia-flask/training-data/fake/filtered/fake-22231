Very nice place to eat. Cool atmosphere, very nice wait staff, attentive owner usually on site. I have eaten there dozens of times and probably order take out 20-30 times per year. I am a sushi eater and the fish is always fresh. Never had a bad piece of sushi. Some great specialty rolls. Try the Zebra roll...my personal favorite. Soups and salads are fantastic. BYOB...which in my view is a big plus- saves lots of money. Â Price competitively. The main room is a great place to eat. Comfy booths, relaxing, etc. The back room is not that enjoyable of a spot to dine. A little like a bar side room...the ugly sister. There is a big, wall mounted TV with a table underneath. So, if you eat there not only do you have a TV flashing right above you, but 10 eyeballs staring in your immediate direction. Why people stare at a TV while dining out is beyond me.
