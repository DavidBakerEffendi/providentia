Wine and seafood are what brought me here. I must say, not too disappointing at all. The atmosphere was pleasant to say the least, the wine as well. The seafood, quite nice, I ordered oysters and a Sauvignon Blanc to pair. The oysters took a while to reach me, a bit longer than I had hoped, because I had already finished my first glass of wine and was soon halfway through my second. Mind you I am a person who savors their wine, and so I drink it slowly. Â All in all, service was not bad, I had a polite waiter, a little superficial, but then again, I am very picky about my servers.
