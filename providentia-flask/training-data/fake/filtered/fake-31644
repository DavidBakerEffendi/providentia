we went in randomly. no reservation. the pork cracklings caught our eye on the menu (they were out though) service nice but didn't make any attempts to check on us or sell us anything on the menu. The drinks were tasty but th pours were embarrassing. we are quality over quantity but this was ridiculous and also the first time i have ever openly complained about poor pour at a restaurant like this. sophisticated comfort food, quality appetizer selection. pork pot pie was nice. pork chop is bone licking good. we'd go back but probably not til they sort out their opening kinks.
