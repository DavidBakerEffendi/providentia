I've eaten here twice, maybe I need to give them another shot but so far I have been less than impressed.  My chicken filled pita immediately fell apart and not because the chicken was so juicy and delicious, that would have been acceptable.  I did not try the hummus so I can't offer an opinion. The staff is nice.
