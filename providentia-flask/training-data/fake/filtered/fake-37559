I come from the Middle East. I've been trying out falafel since I am 5 years old. It is part of my identity, my cloture, my memories. It is what I fantasize of when I'm locked in my office and too busy to grab lunch. I will never be able to lie to myself when it comes to falafel. And with no doubts, I found the best place in Manhattan in that great place called Nish Noosh. They were smart enough to bring the authentic taste and texture of these tender chickpea balls, and skipped no ingredients that are kept in my collective DNA, those unique ones that I seek so much after when I choose my food. And when the service is so fast and professional, the tahini sauce so fresh and lemoni, and the taste so familiar and addictive, you can never go wrong. You are now part of my DNA too, Nish Noosh. What an honor for us both.
