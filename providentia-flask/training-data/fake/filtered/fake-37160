Went with family on a Friday night.  Busy but not mobbed.  Love the decor, especially the "Last Supper Table" in the back.  Great spot for a big group to eat, drink & be merry.  Was very impressed with the beer selection both on tap and in can.  The can handles were way cool.  Our table also enjoyed the paisano table red in mason jar, lime rickey and cilantro mojito, all lip smacking refreshing on a warm summer night.   Food was amazing with a wide range of fare from Alligator Sausage to Lamb Sliders to Veggie Spaetzle.  I read alot of hype about the Thanksgiving Balls and am now a true believer.  The stout-vinaigrette salad dressing was also a big hit.  Prices were good, especially for the area and the staff couldn't have been nicer or more attentive.  I need to thank the ninja waiter who managed to keep my water glass full at all times.  Would highly recommend The Pig to anyone who hasn't had the pleasure yet.  Will definitely be back for more!
