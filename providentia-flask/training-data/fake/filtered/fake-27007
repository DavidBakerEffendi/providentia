i have been to this place 4 to 5 times since open. food is consistently amazing last time i ordered chicken n rice but it seems little dry for me so they recommend to put more white sauce which is their special and it taste amazing with that. PLZZ PUT WHITE SAUCE IF YOU EATING PLATTERS!!! i see people complaining about tap water but you are in rittenhouse square center city no restaurant will give you tap water unless u are in fine dining so stop complaining and RATE THEM ACCORDING TO FOOD NOT FOR THE TAP WATER AND I THINK THEY ARE EXCELLENT. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!! i am very disappointed with some of the reviewers this place is above great my first review goes to SPICE END.. keep it up!!!
