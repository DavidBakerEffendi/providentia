The pizza is good, BUT the service is the worst we have ever received. The drunkard at the door, Ralphie, randomly selected people to be seated; order didn't matter. He yelled at one person in our group, which caused many people in line to leave ...in retrospect, we should have done the same. The servers were if the grumpy kind, too. Go to the place next door, they'll greet you with a smile.
