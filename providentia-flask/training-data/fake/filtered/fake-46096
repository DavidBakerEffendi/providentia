I've been a loyal customer for 3 years- eating there 3-4 times a week. Today was the worst service ever. Groups of 4 have a $20 per head minimum, which the waitress told us we did not reach half way through waiting for our meal. We order a dish to cover the difference, and our food shows up packed with the bill after a 80 min wait. The only explanation we got was the chef wants us to leave. Turns out our bill was 2.50 short of the 80 minimum. We complain about the mistreatment to different waiters and the chef finally comes out himself to tell us to leave. His exact words were: we don't want your money, don't ever come back. Absolutely appalling. If you go there in really small groups, I'm sure you'll be treated decently. The owner/chef seems to have something against Princeton students, and treats most of us quite poorly. In fact, I've seen the restaurant turn down groups of 4 or more people numerous times. I would definitely go elsewhere to spend your money on sushi that is of equal quality, personal recommendation from a sushi lover would be Jo Sho.
