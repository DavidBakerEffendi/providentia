My husband and I had dinner here last night for our anniversary. I must say I'm really shocked by the disappointing reviews. We had a great dinner for a good price.  The server was delightful and quick to read us the specials, take our orders, serve our drinks, etc.  The dishes came out in a reasonable time.  For my meal, I had the arugula salad (large for the price) and the flounder which was excellent! My husband had the lobster ravioli (definitely getting those next time, very rich in flavor).  We finished dinner with espressos and the homemade apple tira misu (Delicious!)   We will definitely go again soon.
