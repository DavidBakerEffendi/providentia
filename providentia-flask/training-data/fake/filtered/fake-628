my experience in this jamaican restaurant was the most disgusting experience in my life you pay what you get for 4.99 cents the jerk chicken tastes like pure sugar not even at all not even a bit what kind of restaurant Â is this a peanut butter sandwich is better than this so called meal never ever will recommend this place to anyone i have tasted and no what good local food is all about you people need to find either a new cook or a new recipe from jamaica thanks.
