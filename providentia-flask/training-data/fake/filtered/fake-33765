Really great food.  In the 90s my office was a mile away from Jose Tejas and I ate lunch there at least once a week.   It's very hard to find restaurants that haven't changed in two decades, screwing up a great thing, but this is one.  The food is still delicious.  I stop in whenever I'm in the area. I agree with the reviewer who said there is no better Tex-Mex in NJ. My favorite is the Cadillac fajitas.  All the fajitas are excellent.  Highly seasoned, smokey, heaped with lots of tasty onions, served on a sizzling hot platter.  The fajita salad is perfect for a lighter lunch.  Chicken Guadalajara is another favorite.  And for a side, always get the jambalaya, it's so tasty!  The bountiful free tortilla chips are freshly made, you can watch the one guy they have devoted to frying them.  And the iced tea is top notch, comes in big gulp giant size glasses, with free refills.  The overall prices are very modest, especially given the quality of the food. I've seen some comments from people saying it's not authentic Mexican.  Well, duh!  It's Tex-Mex, not Mexican.  I even saw some people saying the fajitas are not the real Mexican ones.  Fajitas are a classic Tex-Mex dish that originated in Texas.  Good grief people! The only drawback now is that it's so popular that just about every evening I've been there is a wait.  Usually though if they tell you it will be 45 mins, I've been in with about a 30 min or so wait.  Plus, you can hang at the bar and have a Mexican beer (no domestic) or a margarita. If you have the opportunity, don't pass it by.
