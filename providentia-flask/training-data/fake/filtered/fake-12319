We had mint lemonade and mint watermelon drinks.So refreshing. Yummy three bean salad and a gorgeous ceviche. Ended with  artichoke and leek and barbeque braised short rib quesadillas.  All wonderful.  They made grilled cheese and simple quesadillas for my two little boys. BYOB. Clean, pleasant place. You cannot go wrong here!
