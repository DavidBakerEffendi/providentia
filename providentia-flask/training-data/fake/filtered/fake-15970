Went there with my family tonight. We sat down and the wait staff completely forgot about us. 15 minutes later I had to find someone to tell them we were waiting. The food came out and had absolutely no flavor. Over salted hamburgers that were simply slopped on a plate. I asked for the Con. fries and were given regular. My wife got a mozzarella sandwich that was suppose to had a sauce on it, but they forgot. When I asked the waitress about it she was extremely rude and seemed annoyed at us. They took the fries back and slopped some old bay in the middle of them. Wow!!! Why don't they just put the old bay on the table. I could have done that. My suggestion...save your money and got to Vince's. If you want more of a bar atmosphere, head over to Newtown and got to Isac Newton's. It's worth he drive.
