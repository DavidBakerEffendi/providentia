Stopped by at around 10:30 on a Friday night. Really excellent beer selection, which is my number one priority in a bar. Didn't order any food, so can't speak to that. The acoustics are a bit off--it was quite loud even though there weren't all that many people there. Or maybe it was just the one super annoying drunk guy next to us. Bartender was friendly, there was a hook for my purse--maybe I'm just easily pleased but I will absolutely be back for a beer or twelve.
