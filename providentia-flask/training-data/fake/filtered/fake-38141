The food, coffee and beer selection get 5 stars but the their barista situation lowers my rating. 75% of the time I go to Kickshaw, which is at least once a week, the barista acts like I have a problem because I am waiting to order and interrupting their very important conversation with their buddy sitting at the bar. Or if they got my order incorrect, they are offended that I don't just take what they gave me. I'm not a jerk, nor a complete idiot - I've worked in coffee shops for years. I have worked in customer service longer than that. I don't understand why people just can't be cool. That said, the servers are delightful, the chefs (both I've ordered from) quite awesome. The owners seem to be great, too. You have an amazing product, Kickshaw. You don't have to blow sunshine up my butt for me to like you. Just don't act so smarmy.
