One of the worst service experiences I have had in this city!  The host was rude, unprofessional and just downright mean.  We were seated at a table, had ordered drinks and he told us we had to move tables with apology.  And he publicly made a scene about the move.  We left and honestly will not go back.  Cafeteria used to be one of my favorite places.  Not anymore because of this rude host.  We were seated in the new downstairs .  This happened at 12:50 on Saturday, January 7, 2012.  This host needs a reality check on customer service!  I hope management reads this and deals with him!
