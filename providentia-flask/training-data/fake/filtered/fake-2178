HORRIBLE!!  RACIST Assholes...I went there Sunday Morning with my GF and her neice.  I am white they are black.....the WHOLE place got quiet and looked at us from the minute we walked in..THEN the manager took 3 menus, walked over to a booth, threw them on the table and walked away.  this behavior is totally UNACCEPTABLE.  Be aware if you go there that you are defending a racist pig who (by the way) isnt from this country EITHER  but hes white so I guess he thinks its ok
