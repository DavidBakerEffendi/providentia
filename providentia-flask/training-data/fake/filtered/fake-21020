My friend and I went here for dinner recently.   We started with an appetizer with wonderful warm fresh pita and an assortment of delicious dips.  I ordered the rabbit stew - it was incredible! the first time I had ever had rabbit (never considered eating one, always thought it was too cute to be eaten!, this dish changed my mind!).  The braised rabbit came in a bowl of rich broth w/figs and pieces of cured spicy meat along w/a melt in your mouth dollop of what tasted like homemade yogurt to me.  I thought the whole dish was well balanced and in perfect harmony.  My friend ordered the Chicken Pouleriko- which he completely devoured, and he did use his hands as the chef suggested! He loved it!  There were no remains!  To finish off, we had a special dessert of the day - chocolate hazelnut fondant w/ice cream- very rich and decadent!  Our waiter was very attentive and extremely polite, and delivered our food very quickly to us.  The chef's passion and love of his work clearly shows in his food.  He is extremely gracious, and cordial, and checked on us several times to see if we were enjoying our meals (which I have rarely ever seen a chef do? is this normal? this polite behavior among chefs? if not, he should serve as a role model to other chefs on how to treat their customers!).  I would highly recommend this unique restaurant, stands out from the rest of the restaurants I have been to in Philadelphia.
