I cross the bridge to Morrisville whenever I want barbecue, Mike the owner is an awesome guy, and he knows his barbecue and remembers all his customers. Best ribs for miles, great chicken and I don't know WHAT he puts in his cole slaw, but it's smokin'. Other things we love are the mac n' cheese and red beans and rice. I keep meaning to try all the other offerings on the menu, like the Jambalaya or chopped BBQ, but I love the chicken and ribs so much that I never get around to it! Check himt out, there is nothing in the area like it. But hurry, he closes for the summer in June!
