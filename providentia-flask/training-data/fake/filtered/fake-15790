Didn't even try the food, just had the cheesecake, which seems to be what Junior's is known for. It was a bit pricey but very good, much what I expected. I recommend splitting the cheesecake, though. I'm a glutton and even I couldn't finish my whole piece. If you walk up and get the cheesecake at the counter, there is some seating outside, but it is limited, so you may have a hard time finding a table in the rush after the Broadway shows get out.
