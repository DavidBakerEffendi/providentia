Im definitely a fan, this place is really great. I really enjoyed the unique floating island dessert. The fat kid in me wishes I could eat here every night,haha. I got a reservation easily and lucked out with parking as well so the entire night ran smoothly. There is a lot to do in the neighborhood afterwards, so we took a stroll and enjoyed bars in the area.
