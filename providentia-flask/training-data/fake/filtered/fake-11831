I was looking forward to trying this place, but was disappointed by several things. The diner itself wasn't very clean. When I ordered the turkey sandwich, he asked how I'd like it cooked (it's not beef!) I replied "All the way through, please." Scary. They seemed confused when I asked for my lunch order to-go. They weren't knowledgeable about the menu. Getting the small cup of soup to-go adds when up-charge. The sweet potato fries were very soggy (my drive home was 2 minutes.) And halfway through my meal I found a long hair in it that wasn't mine. The only positive thing was being offered a glass of water while I waited. Get your act together, Duchess!
