Great place! A long list of wine selection to chose from and some great French dishes, especially from the South, to enjoy with some wine! What a great combo! I tired the aioli that was excellent! They also have a big knowledge when it comes to wines so you can get some great recommendations for the best wine to pair with your meal! They have a great space upstairs that can be used for special events such as birthdays. Went there to enjoy a game for the World Cup, it's a great place to go to as they have a bar but also the upstairs space with couches and they give you a shot when the team they are cheering for scores! also a special on cocktails (50%) so, once again a great combo to have a good time!
