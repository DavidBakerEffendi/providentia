First time trying the place , heard it was a great place for girls to get together and drink! Kind of a long wait, but totally worth it , we had some drinks called bahamaraitas, yum. Our waiter was sweet and answwered any questions we had about the food, i had a shrimp linguine which was a little oily but tasted amazing.   Thought it was the cool that the manager andy? or something, stopped over, he was hotter than the waiter we had and comped my girlfriends beverage.   I would go back just to see him. very jamaica like atmosphere.
