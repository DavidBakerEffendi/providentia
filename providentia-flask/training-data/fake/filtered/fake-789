Ok so after hearing all the stories about Tom diner I had to take a visit . I was by for brunch on a weekday. Not so crowed the waiter was super nice. Thankfully they weren't alot of people because it a bit small. Love my eggs and pan cake was oh so delicious. Definitely a place to visit once. With all the rush story it crazy. Unless you are living in the neighborhood and you can consider to be a regular there. Worth the experience and delicious food
