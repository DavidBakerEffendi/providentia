Went there for the first time today.  I live within a block of this restaurant and I am so glad it's here.  I love northeast kingdom's food but have been disappointed with the attitude of the staff. No attitude at all in this place.  Food was also amazing.  I had the grass fed burger and it was cooked beautifully and delicious. Everyone is super nice and the place has a lot of charm and personality. The bathroom has family pictures and pictures of the prior owner.  I like that the owners are carrying on/ respecting the previous history (maintaining the old sign etc.) while definitely putting their own stamp on things.  Very personal and warm.  My hope is that they expand somehow - it's a bit snug!  But that will come if they keep up their cheery service and excellent offerings.  Well done Cafe Ghia!  I love Wyckoff Starr too.  Nice to see the success continuing.  Really contributes to the neighborhood.
