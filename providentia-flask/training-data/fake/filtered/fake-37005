A virgin to NYC and what a way to close out my visit to such an amazing city.  This tour (walking) was fabulous and let's just say Scott has his pizza PHD.  He was extremely friendly and ever so knowledgeable about pizza from literally start to finish!  You just need to experience for yourself.   If more people took this tour, all the chains like Papa John's, Dominos and Pizza Hut should just immediately go out of business.  Shame on those swindlers...lol  This tour will give you deep appreciation of the mom and pop feel where the great USA should revert back to. Keep up the excellent work and passion Scott!  Thanks for your time sharing NYC from a unique perspective.  Thanks too to the pizza places and other businesses during the tour that were so accomodating.  Scott's passion and enthusiasm was contagious so no wonder you made us feel as welcome!   NYC rocks!!!
