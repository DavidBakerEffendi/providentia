Such a welcome addition to tribeca! The neighborhood's strangely lacking in good lunch places, considering how many restaurants there are. this place always has delicious, wholesome food, with a fun mix of spices and flavors. Filling, but healthy, with conscientious-foodie feel (plenty of gluten-free options, too). I hope they'll start rotating their menu eventually, as I have had their turkey Bolognese and kale salad a million times now. But that said, I'm still loving it!
