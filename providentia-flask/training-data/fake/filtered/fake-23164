Horrible experience! I'm a pretty patient person but this was ridiculous. Sat down fairly quickly. however, took them 15 min for a glass of water, another 10 for my coffee. The thing I can't stand is the table next to us came way after we did and they got their food first. So we walked out. As we left the couple at another table was still waiting for their check from 15 min ago!
