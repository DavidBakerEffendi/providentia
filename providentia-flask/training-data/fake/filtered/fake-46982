I'm a sucker for Danny Meyer restaurants. Breakfast - believe the hype, it really is one of the best breakfasts in town.  Usually slow (if you avoid weekend brunch) and great service.  Best soft scrambled eggs and the crispy headcheese (which I think they have now renamed pork terrine) is also good. After Breakfast / before lunch - serving baked goods mainly, great for just a snack.  Good coffee.  Lets call it elevenses. Where else are you going to go for elevenses? Lunch - great sandwiches and pastas usually crowded Dinner - my least favorite time of day to dine.  It gets crazy and with the new arrangement of tables in the bar area (cramming them in) if you don't have a reservation in the dining room it get s a little too loud and crazy. Late night - my favorite time to be here after breakfast.  Great snack menu that isn't just rehashed stuff from the rest of the day's menu - these are distinctly different items from what is served during the day.  Had some amazing pork ribs and also pig heart salad.  Sadly they don't open very very late.  Downside you get some weird hotel guests late night.  Also despite everything Danny Meyer does about service, I still feel annoyed being the last guy eating at the bar while the staff count their money at the other end of the bar.  Seriously?  you have a great big restaurant with lots of other tables to be doing that! Generally I find this place seriously awesome - I was going to give 4 stars for all the little things that bug me (like the host/hostess always makes me feel like I'm being done a favor) but the fact is I keep going back so 5 it is.
