We have been customers here for many years. After my last order I will never be a customer here again. We ordered food for delivery and was told it would arrive within 30 minutes. About two hours later after numerous phone calls our food finally arrives COLD Like it's been sitting for two hours. When I spoke to the "manager," he blamed everything on the driver. Take some ownership in your place. They didn't even apologize for the delay. To bad because their food WAS good when it wasn't cold. Â Besides the food showing up two hours late cold our order was completely wrong. My meatball parm sandwich didn't have any cheese on it, they forgot to give us the fries with the chicken fingers, The nachos had lettuce and jalapenos on it when we specifically said not to put them on. And the worst thing about the whole situation is how nasty they spoke to us. We were very polite and asked what the delay was about we also brought up the fact that our order was completely wrong and they did not offer anything. They didn't offer to fix the order, they didn't offer to bring us warm food they didn't offer anything. As a business owner in the area I will make sure that we do not order from here anymore. We will not have them cater for us anymore we will not order anything from them. I understand that one person doesn't matter but we are not one person
