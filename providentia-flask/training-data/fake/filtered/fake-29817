had dinner at this place last night and... YUM.  the fish dinner was skate with caper brown butter and done to perfection!  comes with 2 sides, i had the broccoli rabe and red potatoes, too much had to take the rest home but i'm not complaining.  also, heavy on the butter but as butter is my favorite food group, also, not complaining.  my date had the same but with onion rings and they were terrific also--crunchy, not soggy.  nice wine selection, a little pricey but worth it. friendly wait staff (it's counter service but a runner brings your food to your table) and the garden out back is so relaxing; pleasantly lit, quiet, perfect for a summer evening out.  can't wait to try everything else on the menu.  great addition to the neighborhood and glad that lower manhattan avenue is finally opening up with great places like this!
