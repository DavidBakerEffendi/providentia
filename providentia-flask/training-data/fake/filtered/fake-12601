Party of four aged 22-60. All enjoyed the chef's excellent dishes and mixture of textures and blends of flavors. Scallops and Duck Confit the best - crispy on outside but so moist and full of flavors. Desserts with the sorbets to complement each finished the evening. Service superb; made the tight squeeze almost unmentionable.
