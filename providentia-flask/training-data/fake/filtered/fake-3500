We hosted our rehearsal dinner for our wedding at Sabrina's because we wanted to give our family and friends a taste of one of our most frequented brunch spots.  I had never had dinner there previously but BOY did they deliver! First of all, their manager was an absolute PLEASURE to work with.  After being told numerous times by other restaurants that they could not accommodate our size or budget, the manager (Kevin) just totally blew us away with his flexibility and hospitality.  They put together a fabulous menu of ridiculously generous portions.  We had the meatloaf, a chicken dish and a fish dish all three of which were huge successes amongst our guests.   The atmosphere was very warm and lively (there were still other dinner guests at the point that our event started, we did not buy out the restaurant).  The staff got appetizers out to us immediately upon our arrival and allowed us to drop off our case of wine prior to the event.   Everything about the experience was positive.  They only thing I would point out is that if you are looking for a very private event this may not be the best space unless you are able to buy out the dining room.  This did not bother us but if others are looking for that kind of experience for your rehearsal dinner it may not be the right fit.   I would highly recommend this venue for rehearsal dinners.  Our guests are still talking about the food.
