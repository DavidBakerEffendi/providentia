One of my favorite restaurant's in the city!  Indoor/outdoor garden is beautiful.  Food is lovely.  A hidden gem in the heart of the Villge.  I've been eating here for years and it remains one of my all time favorites.  My personal favorites- the Lamb chops or the homemade Gnocchi. They recently added a new place next door called Aperitivo...just as quaint and comfortable- here you can get tasty bites and wine out of beautiful etched glasses.   I feel like I'm at home every time I visit.
