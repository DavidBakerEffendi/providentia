My family  came to this restaurant last week when we visited K town. We decided to choose this place because we like the same branch in Flushing. We ordered seafood Sundubu  in hot pot  , vegetable Sundubu and Korean pancake.  The tofu broth was rich and tasty  but  too hot spicy for me . I will ask them to make less spicy next time. The pancake was crispy and delicious.  The service was good . The place was filled with people . It was a little noisy. I guess I have to endure it for good food
