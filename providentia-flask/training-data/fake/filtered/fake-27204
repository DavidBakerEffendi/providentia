Before I start explaining how amazing the food at Masa Sushi is, let me first tell you guys how everything else impressed me. The whole interior is very appealing. Once you go inside, you'll see a host table that was designed and made (as I found out) by the owner himself. How much time must he have spent to stick all of those rocks to the table, paying attention to every detail? Also, the music is perfectly chosen, as are the servers. Masa has the nicest staff I've ever had. They will never make you feel ignored. This place is simply unique. The sushi is incredible just as the kitchen entrees are. I recommend their crispy calamari and chicken hibachi. Everything is freshly prepared and nicely served. With AYCE restaurants, there's always worry that food might be old and expired, but not at Masa Sushi. Food is always tasty and original, especially when it comes to fish. Their AYCE menu provides a variety of rolls and special rolls. Personally, my favorites are City Roll and Crazy Tuna roll. I recommend this place to everyone, whether it's a date, big party, or buisness meeting. It will surely satisfy all your needs while not emptying your wallet, which is always an added bonus.
