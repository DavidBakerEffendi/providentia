LOVE THIS PLACE!  Took my girlfriend here multiple times when we were in the area.  You can feel the history when you're inside this place.  Even though they remodeled and the new style is a little too modern looking.  I liked it better the old way but it's still the same Fraunce's.  The dining room menu can be pretty pricey but the pub fare is reasonable and the drinks are average price.  Not sure how much a beer was when George Washington was here but it was probably less than $6-$8 which is what it costs now.  All and all, great place!
