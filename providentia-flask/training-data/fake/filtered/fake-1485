2.5 stars because The food is good in the rare times I have eaten here, but the service is complete bullshit. There is no such thing as a "quick bite" at the bar. Trust me. I've tried. Â I have never spent under an hour in here. Like last night, for instance. Two hours for 2 appetizer-size caesar salads, a mushroom soup and some warm pita and hummus. Two hours. TWO!!$*&(@#^$)&*@#^. If I have hours upon hours upon hours to kill, I'll make the trip. Maybe. But the service makes my blood boil. Ruins the experience... Sorry.
