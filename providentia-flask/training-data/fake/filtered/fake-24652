As most people have confirmed, the food is good to excellent but portions are way too small and way too expensive.  I like eating tapas but in Spain these portions would be considered mini tapas. If they charged about a third less it would be more appropriate for the size and I'd likely return because most of the dishes were excellent. We ordered 6 dishes for two of us and one glass of wine (I was driving so I drank tap water).  The total bill was $69.  That would not have been bad for a good meal but on the way home, my partner was so hungry we broke our rule about fast food and stopped at Wendy's for a burger and fries...  My favorite dish was the calamari salad.  Close second the filet and pomme frites... We will likely not return unless they lower the prices or double the portions so you don't have to order as many.
