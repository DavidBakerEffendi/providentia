Great place considering I don't have to go far to get a decent drink and a good meal at the far end of Greenpoint. The cornmeal crusted fish tacos and the black bean dip are to die. The GPH lemonade is delicious. The beers are always new and interesting and its clean. Bartenders personality is a roll of the dice. But they need more nights like last Halloween that was fun. I appreciate that its a low key place but hopefully at least one night a week can rev up a bit more. It is kinda of lacking on energy.
