Waitress was not worthy of tips as she was slow and paying more attention to another table with 6 guests which was served by another waiter! Had to ask 3X for a glass of water, 2x for a small bowl and 10 min for the check after the meal. And their food is getting more salty each time. This will be our last visit to this 'Fine' dining establishment
