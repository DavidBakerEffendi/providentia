This is my first review on Yelp so I'm excited!!  After frequenbting Continental many times I just had to write about it.  I try to go there at least once a month.  I've pretty much tried everything on the menu at least once, but the past couple of times I've been ordering the cheesesteak eggrolls...absolutely delicious!  I'm not a big fan of their brunch, but I've never been let down by any of the meals there.  The servers can be a little unattentive, but that doesn't take away from the whole dining experience.
