I couldn't wait for Pj's to come to West Windsor. I am sorry to say they have work to do. First, there is a musty oder at the inside entrance. Because of this we ate outside. I had a 1/2 order of blueberry pancakes. They arrived hot but too thick and heavy. My sister had an egg dish with home fries on the side. I tasted the home fries, which were an off color somewhere between pink or orange. I doubt if they were freshly made since they had the texture of mashed potatoes and were served as if they were scooped with and ice cream scoop. Not very appetizing. I will go back again, I hope they just need more time to work out the kinks.
