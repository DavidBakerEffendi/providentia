The first time I came here, a man, mid 30, short hair, who worked at this restaurant and claimed that he was the boss said rude marks to us just because of a little misunderstanding. I've never seen anyone who serves in a restaurant does this. It's just terrible! As for the food, they did it OK, but as a Chinese living in China for more than 20 years, I can tell you they still don't get the right way to cook Szechuan Food. I'm definitely NOT gonna come here anymore.
