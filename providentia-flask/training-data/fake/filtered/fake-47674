I think it's so funny how Grimaldi's is in Brooklyn and not Manhattan. It's almost a testament saying "New York is too expensive for New York's greatest pizza". Well, they still live in one of the five boroughs so I guess that counts. I really had a good time at Grimaldi's. The food was excellent, although I think I ate like 2 pizzas by myself. The ambiance is good, feels very movie style Italian. I walked across the Brooklyn bridge afterwards and wasn't hungry so that's good. However, I did have to eat 2. I like the pizza because it really brings out the flavors in the toppings versus dousing you with a sauce and bready explosion like Gino's East in Chicago. Being from San Francisco, I get to say both are my favorite. But Grimaldi's is definitely a spot any tourist must visit.
