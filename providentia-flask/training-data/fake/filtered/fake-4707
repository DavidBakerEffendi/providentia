Very cool little joint. Awesome concept in the kitchen, they bring in different Italian "nonnas" every week I believe. The atmosphere has a city vibe, subway tiles, industrial lighting, cool music. The owner knows his wines and is constantly helping people make selections and indulging in some himself. A very fun place and the food, well, I keep going back!
