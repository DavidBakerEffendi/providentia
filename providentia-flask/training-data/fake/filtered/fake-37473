Two thumbs up to JoJu!!!  Service with a smile!  The sandwiches extend from authentic Vietnamese style to fusion style Bulgogi baguettes.  The bread, which is always my priority, is as fresh as they get!  The appetizers, especially the fried wings and Summer Rolls with marinated pork chop, are my favorite.  This Banh Mi place really offers a fully satiating meal at an affordable price.  The entire place is clean and comfortable, not to mention the awesome smelling handsoap in the bathroom..........absolutely worth the trip from Brooklyn!  Will definitely be back.
