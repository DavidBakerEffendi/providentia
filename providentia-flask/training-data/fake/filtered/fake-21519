Best bar in the city! Not an understatement either.  I have been in there numerous times and whether you get the pleasure of sitting at the bar and talking to proprietors Michael, Kenneth, or Abdul who also bartend or move over to a table in the lounge you will be treated to an extensive list of cocktails and liquors.  This IS THE COCKTAIL LOUNGE of NYC.   Try the bespoke cocktail menu or come by Monday for a tasting of rare and unique whiskey's.   I have had a celebration and birthday party here in the last six months and they are always accomodating and caring.  They seem to remember every face and name.  The men of Ward III are on top of their games and I will go back any time to have a great glass of scotch and beer and a good snack to eat with.
