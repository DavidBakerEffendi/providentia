I was skeptical when Luigis opened in the neighborhood.  Aside from the seemingly cursed location, there were already a number of decent pizza joints in the area.  Nonetheless, i was pleasantly surprised by the friendly staff and the quality of their food.  The pizza is, in my eyes, now the best in the neighborhood.  While the rest of the menu seems to be lacking the large selection seen in nearly all other pizza shops, the quality of sandwiches was solid.   Highly recommended for take out, delivery, or eat in.
