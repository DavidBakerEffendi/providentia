My favorite Japanese ramen restaurant in town! Great, high-energy atmosphere and a very trendy layout. Service is very quick and efficient, and the food here is fantastic! Make sure you come an hour or so early to put down your name as this place gets very busy! Meanwhile you can hang out at the crowded bar or take a walk to kill time, but it's definitely worth the wait!
