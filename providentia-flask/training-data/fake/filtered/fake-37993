Maybe this place is great for young folks.....it is packed with them.  My experience with Jacob's Pickles is that the food is just short of horrible.   I ordered the fried chicken and got two deep fried chicken tenders in which the white meat was totally dried out. If you are going to serve fried chicken, serve fried chicken.....I can go to McDonalds for better chicken tenders than here.    So I think that if you are young, like to drink and want relatively inexpensive food that is very filling, this might be the place.   However, if you have any notion of what good food is, look elsewhere.  PS:  Could not find a single pickle that appealed to me either.
