We went last weekend and had a very good experience, they had a polenta and gorganzola special appetizer which was sssssooo good-all three of us raved over it. We also ordered the pizza with sausage and all of us really liked it. Place is small but cozy, people were friendly and by the time we left every table was occupied. They must be doing something right! We will definitely go back-we didn't try the salads or anything other than the pizza but they looked very good coming out-the person next to us was raving about the calamari.
