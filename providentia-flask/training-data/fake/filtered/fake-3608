I only been to this restaurant once but I love it.  The food is great and maybe really great....oh, that's called delicious.  The service from the owner is very appropriate and friendly.  The wine we ordered was out of stock and the owner actually took the time to let us try a few until we are happy with one.  I did not expect such service from a such restaurant.   The location is a little out of way but will still visit again.
