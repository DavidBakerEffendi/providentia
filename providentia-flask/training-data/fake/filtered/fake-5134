Went last Sunday for the New Year celebration with friends and family, party of 18.  Service was non-existent...had to get our own utensils, napkins, and ask repeatedly for beverages including refill of tea and water pitcher, which we never received.  When finally got a server's attention and made request, he never returned.   Food was greasy and bland.  Dim sum carts did not stop by table.  Had to chase down and ask to see.  Used to be such a good restaurant, I don't know what has happened.  Apathy perhaps?  New ownership?   Will not be returning.
