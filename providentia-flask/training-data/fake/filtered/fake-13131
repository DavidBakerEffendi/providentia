First off, it's hard to nail down what type of restaurant it is. It's more of a generally "Asian" place, so nothing is really authentic. That doesn't mean it's not good. The food is probably the best in the area given how cheap it is (it's very wallet friendly). Spicy Wok Basil is my favorite. However, beware of the service. Sometimes it's ok, but it can be truly awful at times (especially downstairs.) It literally took over an hour to get our food once, and all the employees are gruff and to the point. But the food is very good for its price. As a result, I've come to use this place as a takeout place, for which it is very well suited.
