Fabulous restaurant.  No bar but to hang out at but they do serve liquor.  Some of the best food around.  If you like Italian food, you can't miss here.  Their Margarita Pizza is the best.  Consistency is their game and these guys do it without fail.  The waitstaff has been there a long time and know how to make you feel special.  Owner/Chef, Gerry, often makes the rounds through the dining room.  My favorite place.
