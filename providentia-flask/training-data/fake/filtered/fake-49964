You can't judge this place by what you see on the outside cause until you eat a hot dog here, you don't know what a hot dog is! It's so greasy and good and genuine. I can feel it making it's way down to my tummy and I don't care how long it takes for it to digest, I LOVE THIS PLACE! Alot of people rag on Rutt's for not renovating or upgrading or changing up their appearance but these people don't even understand what it means to eat at Rutt's. You gotta judge for yourself. Good prices. Good food. It's just an overall chill place. Go with friends. Have a food fight. You won't regret it.
