Would not recommend this place, although the food is not terrible their customer service needs some help! Our order was incorrect and when we gave the waitress our credit card to pay for dinner she lost it then came back and said we never gave her a credit card. After several minutes of her looking for the credit card she claimed we never gave her we paid with another and immediately canceled the credit card that was lost, with the thought that she might have returned ours to the wrong customer. Upon arriving home my Husband gets a call that they found the credit card the waitress claimed we never gave her.  Of course now too late because we already canceled our credit card. The following day my Husband went to pick up the card and was not even so much apologized for his inconveniece. He asked that for his inconvenience perhaps they could give him a gift card, the Owner in a rude manner said she wasn't going to give him anything. POOR MANAGEMENT ,POOR HOSPITALITY, and POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  My  Husband had to be inconvenieced without a credit card for 10 days and they so much could not even apologize or give him a gift card for a return visit.  I guess they don't value their customers! WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN!!!!!
