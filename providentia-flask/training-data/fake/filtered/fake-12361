I moved here from new haven connecticut and while vermont outdoes ct in many ways, pizza is certainly not one of them. This is why I was very happy to find a wood fired pizza spot that doesn't add weird stuff like butternut squash. It's no modern pizza but it satisfies my cravings! Best I've had in vermont.
