I've been to many places that proclaim to have authentic Greek food.  However, Pylos is the real deal.  Pylos does it right.  Great atmosphere, attentive staff and superb authentic Greek food.  Definitely get a reservation and avoid the dinner wait.   Grilled octopus was so tender and flavorful, egg lemon soup hit the spot, and do not miss the whole grilled fish it is so satisfying.   Terrific Greek place with mouth-watering food. The best Greek restaurant I've been to.
