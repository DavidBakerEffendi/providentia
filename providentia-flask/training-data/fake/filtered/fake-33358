This quaint restaurant just off of Rittenhouse Square is a perennial favorite. Their menu changes seasonally and reflects whatever's fresh at the moment. Particularly good dishes include: 1. PEI Mussels 2. Flatbreads 3. Rice Pudding Arrive early to get a good table as it fills up quickly, especially in the summer. They don't take reservations, but you can put your name down in advance
