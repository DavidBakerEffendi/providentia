Went because I had to see for myself. I'm no foodie but this really is a tourist trap. Guys working seem totally uninterested in what they are doing and it shows in the cheese steaks just slapped together. I'm used to talking if i've got to wait in line. Everyone in line was out-of-town which was good since I'm new but bad since it really let me know that it's for tourists. Will try the other place everyone's talking about.
