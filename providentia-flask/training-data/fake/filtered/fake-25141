The sandwiches (breakfast and lunch) are fantastic and huge portions too. The salads are quite good as well and they are happy to tailor them to your liking. Breakfast is yummy too, they make a great omlette. The breads, bagels and spreads are on point. Â Schlesingers does the basics just right. They are always open, the service is friendly and its a nice clean and pleasant place to have a causal lunch. Stick to the basics and you'll enjoy it . Sidenote: the cake is not that good, I repeat stick to the deli basics.
