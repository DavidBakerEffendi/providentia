Six of us arrived a  few minutes after opening on a Sunday night.  First time there.  The shrimp oreganto was out of this world, the cavetelli and pot cheese was better than the ziti with pot cheese.  Long green peppers were really hot.  The chicken savoy and chicken murphy were ok.  Not a big fan of chicken on the bone, prefer boneless.  Silly that there is no dessert menu or coffee, only espresso.  Became extremely crowded around seven o'clock.The woman owner/hostess was very rude.  After spending over $200 she actually came over to our table and told us to move to the bar because they had alot of people waiting.  (We had three 8 year old children with us) why the heck would I want them to sit at the bar????  Not only that there was no room at the bar.  NOT MY PROBLEM LADY!!!  Next time I will just sit and not hand over the mola until I am ready to leave.  Can't understand the reasoning for the rudeness of the owners.  Never witnessed anything like it in my life!!!
