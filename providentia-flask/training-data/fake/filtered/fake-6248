If you love beer, you'll love it here.  It's pretty dark, and kind of has a "man bar" vibe.  But as a girl I love this spot.  The bartender I've had the couple of times I've gone there is really nice and funny.  I can't imagine there being a beer that they don't have here.  If you are unsure of what to choose, just ask.  This place is staffed with beer geeks.  If you like fries, they have some of the best.
