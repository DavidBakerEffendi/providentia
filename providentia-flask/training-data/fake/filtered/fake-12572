Sashimi and sushi was not fresh.  Tasted like it had been frozen.  Watery and tough.  Would not recommend, their food is not fresh. Went here twice and both times got sick. Their sushi gave me gastroenteritis, not something you want to go through.. even making me sick (my assumption was food poisoning). All around poor choice.  Not returning.
