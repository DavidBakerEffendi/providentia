Context: Went for good-bye dinner with a bunch of my girl friends (5 of us total) for a dinner about two weeks ago. The place is petite and really nice decor. The seating was a bit tight- but overall created a really calm atmosphere. The waitress was really friendly and took the time for us to complete or selection. There was probably about 1-2 other parties that were at the restaurant. My meal: They served us a couple rounds of bread (because we were all carb lovers) with olive oil. I asked for balsamic vinaigrette which made a very nice touch that complimented the bread. We had the grilled octopus for appetizer. I had the 3-course seasonal meal with the butternut squash soup, wild mushroom risotto, and with a dessert of peach cobbler. I also had their Hibiscus ice tea. Two of my friends follow suit  but had roast poussin (chicken) instead of the risotto. Another friend of mine got salad and braised beef short ribs. Positives: The little dish (appetizer) was really small. It was barely enough for even one person. However, the butternut squash soup was creamy and rich. It went really well with the bread. The entree for everyone was very satisfying. I had the opportunity to try to meat (chicken and beef) and it melted in my mouth. The salad looked appetizing and you can definitely taste the fresh ingredients in the meal. Howevers: The chef needs to go easy with the salt. Every bite left everyone at my table thirsty. The waitress took forever to fill up our water cups and the hibiscus tea was OK ( not the best I had). Not to mention, the dessert was not so great at all. To much cinnamon! We had 3 peach cobblers for 6 people and all of us only had one or two bite. Very disappointing- perhaps they should hire a pâtissier? P.S. Overall a good once in a blue moon experience. Would only go back for the main dishes. Plus, the waitress were really nice and lovely.
