Luce' is our favorite restaurant where we always experience  savory food, exquisite service, and the spirit of Italian and American cultures blended into meals created wtih  the finest ingredients.  Chef Steve always  prepares the most delicious homemade pasta dishes, Italian-style seafood, and superb deserts A few specialties we always enjoy include the salmon, Chicken D'aosta, Bershire pork, mushroom risotto, and pear salad. Enhancing the total dining experience is the beautiful, relaxed ambiance and the attentive staff.  Owner Joey is always available to ensure your dining experience is flawless while Gina makes sure your table is ready on time. Whether we dine at Luce' on a Saturday night as a couple or host one of our many family gatherings, we are always thrilled with the delicious food and courteous service! Yesterday ,we just hosted our daughter's graduation party at the restaurant , and as always, every detail was perfect!!!
