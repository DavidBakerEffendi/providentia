Being both a fanatic of roast chicken and pasta, Barbuto is a dream come true for me.  I am so grateful to have such a great place in my neighborhood and with a cool, casual and relaxing atmosphere to boot.  I have tasted countless roasted/rotisserie chcikens in both NYC and France, and, eaten loads of pasta on my many extended trips to Italy.  And I still think Barbuto is # 1 for their roasted chicken and love their pasta.  Chef Waxman only disappoints me when he seasonally changes the menu taking off some of the seasonal dishes I've come to crave...
