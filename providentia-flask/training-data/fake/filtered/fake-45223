I really love the food that Abyssinian makes and actually was a regular, but the service isn't just not good, it's kind of terrible, meaning that I won't be anymore. The last time I went with a friend, the wrong dishes were brought out for both of us. When I asked for some more injera, it was never brought out. Finally, when I asked to pack up my leftovers, I realized after I got home that I was never given a piece even to go with my meal. While I feel bad that they are clearly struggling to stay in business, the very subpar service has turned me off.
