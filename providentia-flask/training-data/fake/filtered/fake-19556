A&J was one of the best Chinese/Taiwanese cuisines in town. The price is reasonable and the food is delicious. I've been there a couple times and noticed the quality of food is improving and stabilized. The waiters are slightly inexperienced, but I have to say they have pretty good spirit of serving customers.
