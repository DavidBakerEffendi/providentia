Due to the many positive recommendations on yelp, i had much higher expecations. But actually the food was just okay. Not great but just okay. I had the famous noodles with pork soy sauce and it looked like spaghetti bolognese. My noodle soup with beef was also okay. I dont like the fat on the beef. But in the end you only pay about 5-7dollar each portion and one portion is big enough.
