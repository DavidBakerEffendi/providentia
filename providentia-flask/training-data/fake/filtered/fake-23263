Went to dinner here and ordered the yellowfin tuna which arrived mostly raw and cold. Additionally,the portion could not have weighed 4 oz. The mashed potatoe was luke warm and tasted like instant potatoe. Very expensive for the poor quality and unacceptable temp. Will never frequent any Max enterprise again
