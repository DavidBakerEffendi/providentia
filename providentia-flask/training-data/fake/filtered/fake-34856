As an Asian American from the Upper West side who ate there six months ago, here is my experience. The food was excellent, just his friendliness was palpable to everyone except our party. And when we asked to take a picture with him he was very rude and just said no and ignored us. We felt disrespected and did not know why. We wondered if it was something we said and or done to deserve this poor treatment but now that this has come to light, it explains everything. We just did not think this type of behavior happen in our own neighborhood in this day in time. To all the non believers and defenders, believe it.
