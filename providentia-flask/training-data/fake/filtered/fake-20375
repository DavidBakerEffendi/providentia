What a find!  Good to have a coffee house nearby that has a good selection, good service from staff who really seem to enjoy working there, and live music.  GREAT COFFEE!  SMall intimate tables-probably not a great place for kids at night.  Groups...not really if live music is playing.  No complaints, except I wish the menu had more dinner type stuff.  We stop in often late, so the lighter fare actually works well.  Just don't go there looking for a steak dinner...LOVE that they have good music to listen to.
