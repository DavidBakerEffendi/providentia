Ive been to calle ocho many times and the food has been great... not amazing but still pretty great. the service has always been  somewhat lax, but my girls and i came in for brunch this morning just as ladies day out and we had the best time ever! the food was perfect (usually other people cant make pollo ranchero without dousing it with salt). the sangria was delish but i have to say that the best part was our server. short tan thing with glasses and a bit of accent (i couldn't place it either england or south Africa), but he was energetic and SO genuinely enthusiastic. he made our entire meal seem like he was more a friendly host more than a  robotic waiter. You will definitely be seeing me around again grazias chicos!
