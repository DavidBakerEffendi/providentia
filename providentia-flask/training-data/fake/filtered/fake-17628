One of Park Slope's best brunch spots. Great Mediterranean food and decent prices. Everything is fresh, delicious, and filling. My favorite is the steak & eggs option with a side of labneh cheese & pita bread. Small and intimate with a bit of a wait on weekends. Check in on foursquare for regular meals and they offer a 50% off coupon off dinner!
