HORRIBLE SERVICE!!! I have been going to taste since I was a little girl and before it was burned down and after the renovations. However recently the service has gone down exponentially to the point where I had to call the better business burrow because I had been robbed. A server misunderstood my order and refused to take blame though I have been ordering the same order for take out for about 10 years now. The server, an extremely rude woman in her thirties with short black hair and a lot of eye makeup, basically told me I was a liar, that the mistake was mine and they have absolutely no responsibility and that I couldn't really do anything about it. When I spoke to the manager he apologized and told me I could come in the next day and pick up my order all I had to do was return the mistaken order. However the next day, the same server was there and said that the manager was not and that like she said on the phone there is nothing that will be done because I was wrong, not mistaken or confused she told me in my face that it is weird that I make the same order all the time and got it wrong that day. I was extremely offended and tried calling back later to speak to the manager but she picked up and when she transferred the call the manager or man she transferred the phone to hung it up in my face. THEY DO NOT VALUE THEIR CUSTOMERS!!!! ESPECIALLY OLD LOYAL CUSTOMERS!!! My advice is to go to SOL-MAR, IBERIA, or ADEGA instead.
