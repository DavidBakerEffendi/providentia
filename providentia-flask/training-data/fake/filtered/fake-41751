The new management def knows how to service their customers. I have to say that I have never enjoyed sushi as I did in this place, it was delicious you can taste the freshness .. because to me is about quality & they def have it. The service is amazing & the staff is just as amazing and loving as the food itself.... they go out their way to make you feel at home and have spectacular service. I will def recommend this place to anyone .. I mean wouldn't go for sushi anywhere else !!!
