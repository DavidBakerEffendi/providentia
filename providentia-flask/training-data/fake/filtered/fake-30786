The past 5 years I have been searching for an upscale italian restaurant that wows in every way possible. Yes you SHOULD make a reservation, but please note the bartenders there make the wait(if any ) very welcoming. The staff was exceptional, the food was amazing. My date and I ordered by the glass champagne , from an amazing list. I've been back twice and I'm still completely satisfied . The price is high but the service, art in the subtle flavors of the food, and ambiance makes Ai Fiori worth it's weight. Enjoy!
