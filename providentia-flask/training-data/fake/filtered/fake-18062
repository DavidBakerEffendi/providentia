Placed order at 8:20, picked up at 8:50pm. Gave them my name and paid. So I went home to notice I was given the wrong order, so i called and was asked to return it.. The cashier didn't even make eye contact or didn't even offer to make the experience any better.. One of the other worker was trying to find out what happened and she was completely ignoring him. So after an hour and six minutes later I was finally able to eat my meal and yes the food was cold.. So this was my first and last time I will order from here... ROMA'S
