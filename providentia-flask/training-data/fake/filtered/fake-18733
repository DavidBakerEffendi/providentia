Everything was impeccable, as usual. Foie gras custard appetizer was served like a dish of pudding, delicious and rich, but almost unbearable without something to spread it on. Too intense without copious bread. So if you are ordering this, save your dinner roll. I had a kind of fish that started with the letter T, and it came with ramps and mussels I think - perfectly balanced, refreshing and almost citrusy. The bread pudding is always a winner.
