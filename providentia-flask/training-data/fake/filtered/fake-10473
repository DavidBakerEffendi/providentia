BEST THAI IN NYC. The food at Up Thai has always been a 10 / 10.  Favorite dish is Chicken Krapow but the Green Curry is also amazing.  Extremely attentive service and great atmosphere... this was a much needed addition to the Upper East Side.  Order the Thai Tea ice cream for dessert - can't go wrong.
