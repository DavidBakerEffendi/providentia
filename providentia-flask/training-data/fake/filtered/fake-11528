Dinner wasn't bad...standard dinner plate. The sushi was by far the worst I've ever had. If I had a choice between asian grill or shoprite, I'd be at shoprite. The soy sauce was way too salty. The wasabi was definitely old when they gave it to me. I've been to many sushi places and I've never left sushi on the plate! Worse still; I've never left food on the table when I was still hungry. Worst sushi experience I've ever had.
