Main Points: Amazing food. Get the Turkish lamb meatballs and the appetizer dipping sauce platter. Great personable service. All around fantastic experience and most certainly coming back. Last night we had a groupon for s&h. When we arrived at the restaurant the owner Sal was outside with a phone in his hand and the restaurant was closed for a quick renovation. Upon seeing our distress and disappointment Sal told us that if we came the next night he would make it well worth our time by giving us a few free items. So we come back the next day and he remembered us immediately. He was dedicated to us all night, while still being an attentive host to all the other guests. To compensate us for our disappointment from the night before he served us 5 different dishes for free. He said that he never wants to see a customer leave without a smile and that he was sure that after we tried his food that he would be back again. It was one of the most fantastic meals I have ever had in Philadelphia. The lamb Turkish meatballs were a personal favorite and I also loved the dipping sauce platter with the babaganoush and the the hummus'. I will come back any day. Sal does it best!
