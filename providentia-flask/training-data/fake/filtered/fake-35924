the kind of place that entrances you for the first couple visits until you realize dealing with bemused twenty-something waiters with bigger things on their minds than prompt service isn't all that great. (a few of the female waitresses are actually pleasant, refreshing.) roberta's boasts a seeming inability to keep up with a high volume of orders. even in a takeout situation, i've been left waiting for twenty minutes after i was told to arrive. the situation isn't help by the dour faced owner manning the oven who looks eternally troubled by something, though it certainly can't be the confounding logistics of running a pizza joint. that being said, the pizza's quite good. still, roberta's is one of the only places close to where i live and the deplorable service was enough for me to swear the place off.
