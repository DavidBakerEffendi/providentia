Came here on Saturday night with a reservation for 4. They said they had me down for a 2 person reservation when I got there. When I told the host that I called earlier at 1PM for a reservation for 4 people, he told me there was no record of any reservation...even though he already told me that they had my name down for 2 people. He then told me that there was no way I called earlier because he was at the phone all day which was interesting to me because I made the reservation with a woman. He made NO effort to accommodate me and was extremely rude. I understand that people can mess up reservations, but the host took no responsibility and rolled his eyes at me as I walked out.
