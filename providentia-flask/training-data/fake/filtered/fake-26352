The food is probably the best for lunch in the area and I have ordered from here a number of times, but the service is deplorable. I used to order over the phone but was consistently met with a rude employee. I began ordering online but now am faced with an excessively long wait for delivery. Today I ordered at 11:24 am and was notified food would arrive approximately 12:22 pm. At 1:00 pm, I still had not received food and called and was told "I think it went out." Food arrived about 1:20. I keep saying this is the last time I will order from them but the food is really great. It is unfortunate the service is so bad.
