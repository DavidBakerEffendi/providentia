Me and my wife were staying at the Hotel Monaco, which is great by the way, and decided to try the Red Owl Tavern.  The food was decent but not great. Hummus appetizer is a must.  We both had steaks and my wife's was overcooked and mine was above average but nothing to write home about.  Drinks were good, try an old fashioned.  Worth a try.
