I can't say enough about this place.  You want atmosphere, Hendrickson's has it.  You want a great open-face sliced steak sandwich, Hendrickson's has it.  You want a pint of the perfect Guinness?  Yeah...they got that, too!  I believe there's a piano player on Friday or Saturday nights.  Add a great staff and you've got the perfect night out!
