Without a doubt the best atmosphere and beer selection in New Haven.  I love the ambiance, with the vintage beer you can see at the back of the bar and the low lighting and comfortable seating.  The food is also very good.  Everytime I go, I have a good time.  And everytime I have a friend visit me from out of town, I always take them there. But I have to say, the best part of Cask Republic is the service.  My bartender, John, was incredibly friendly and had a great deal of knowledge about the various beers that Cask has on tap.  He was eager to answer my questions and help me find the beer that most suited me.  I cannot speak highly enough of the excellent service and all-around classiness of this place.  I highly recommend it.
