Went to the Manor the night before Mothers Day. The food was very good and the selection was fine. The only negative was that I was very surprised to see that they were not sticking with the dress code. I always thought that it made the Manor special. I was in a beautiful room and saw 3 males dressed in flowered and other casual shirts, no tie or jacket. The evening was still great but I always enjoyed the formal feel that the Manor had. All else was great and I will absolutely go back.
