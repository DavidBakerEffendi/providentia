Really not good at all. I liked the appetizer, it was pretty decent, the cucumbers where a bit old but still pretty decent. The peanut sauce was great. But the Pad Thai...it was horrible! It tasted like the chicken was old, not well cooked, and had a fish flavor on it. Ironically the people near me had ordered the fish and I assume they cooked it in the same pan. I hated it...couldn't even finish it. But the tea was awesome. But I didnt like the place. Never eating here again.
