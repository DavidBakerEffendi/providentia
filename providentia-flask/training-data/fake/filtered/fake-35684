This joint used to be the ish...but alas times have changed. Sigh...my wife and I used to look forward to coming here on my off days for the chicken afghani biryani and the mix grill rice but the chicken isn't the same. Don't get me wrong, the rice is still outstanding but the last two times we went the chicken felt like tuna out of a can instead of the grilled feel. When we told them about it, the looked at us like a deer in headlights and put more "canned tuna chicken" on our plates...yeah thanks. Oh yeah they raised the price on the malai ice cream by 50 cents so now they're two bucks. You can get it for 50 cents on Newark Ave.
