Delicious!!!! I took everyones advice on here and went with the modern ramen dish. It was soooo great, highly recommended! Also the pork buns were fantastic!!! Two $$ signs is kind of stretching it, not that inexpensive... I would definitely say it is a $$$ place, I paid $31 for ramen, pork buns, tax and tip, with no drink.... But well worth it!!! Can't wait to go back again! :-)
