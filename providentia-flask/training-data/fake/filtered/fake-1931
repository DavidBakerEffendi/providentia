Not your typical panini!  Gaia makes this unique bread from scratch every morning, and yes, it is amazing.  You will not find this type of bread anywhere, except if you are in Italy.  I always order the prosciutto and brie panino as it is my absolute favorite.  Her homemade Italian style (al metro) pizza is amazing (the pizza tends to be the Monday special).  Gaia works her *** off and is always so nice to us when we come in!  Coffee is also very good!   This establishment is "hidden," so be sure not to miss it!  One of the best panini spots in NYC...well, the BEST panini spot in NYC...authentic Italian...from an authentic Italian!
