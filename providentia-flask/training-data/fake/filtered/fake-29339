I have travelled in the Middle East extensively, espeically the Levant/Meditteranean region. So I know the taste of good Falafel when I eat one. And Mamoun does a worthy effort in competing against the amazing flavor of the Middle East's Falafel. I don't think its fair for us to strictly compare the New York Falafel on the same par as the falafael in the big ME. However, it should be taken into consideration that even my Middle Eastern friends (whom have been raised with the aura of authentic falafel) have noted that Mamoun does remind them of the divine taste of the truth (true falafel). Food in New York will never taste like the originals back from old country (of wherever that specific ethnic dish comes from). But we should less harsh on the food that does a fine challenege in trying to preserve the authenticity. and Mamoun does exactly that. Sahten (thats Bon Appetit in Arabic for the ignorant Orientilst out here) ;)
