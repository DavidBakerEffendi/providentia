Ah, Butcher Bar. Love at first bite. I'll never forget: Dessert was on you! I never expect that, especially when everything prior was already so fulfilling. No small and disposable gesture, either, was your last touch. A piece of your special apple pie. The portions were small but thick. This left me hungry, afterwards, in a pleasurable way. I didn't want to collapse and end the night, no matter how late. I said, hey, that was matter-of-factly good. Dead of winter, body stiff, tummy half-empty, spending the night with ________. My heart was satisfied. Now I don't recall exactly what I ordered, but it was one of the main dishes. Just pick one, you won't go wrong. I licked the plate after, the sauces were so savory. Until next time...
