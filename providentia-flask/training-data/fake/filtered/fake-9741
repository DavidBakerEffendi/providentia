Went to Goodfellas Restaurant on Thanksgiving day. I ordered the thanksgiving dinner special with turkey and all the fixings for 34.00. I was disgusted when it came out. No gravy, spoonful of potatoes, dark meat, and the portion was very skimpy. I watched the news that night and saw the homeless people received more food and fixings at the homeless shelter for FREE.
