This place is a GEM!  It has the tastiest, freshest, flavorful falafel in the city in my opinion!  Taim's hummus is creamy, has a really great combo of spices and fresh ingredients - and they have really awesome drinks like mint/ginger lemonade which I have to get everytime I go. The only drawback, is that there aren't that many seats, so you'll likely have to take it to-go.
