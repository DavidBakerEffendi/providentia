Not just the best pizza I ever had in my life , If I was on death row and had only one meal I would take a Grimaldis pizza !!!! Went on a Wednesday afternoon in May , only waited about 30 minutes . The place is small , but who cares ! We all ate like a happy family in the place , smiling at complete strangers at how good it is. Can't wait to go back to New York so I can hit up Grimaldi's again.
