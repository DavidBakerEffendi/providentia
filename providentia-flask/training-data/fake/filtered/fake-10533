I have been going to Junior's for about 15 years and have always loved it.  In the last couple of months, things really seem to have gone downhill.  I am really unimpressed with the new staff, (who appear to be 15 years old)- the last few times I have called to order take-out, the young kid that answers the phone is completely clueless and has to ask someone about every item that I order.  In addition, the last 4 or 5 times I have ordered take-out, there has been an issue every single time.  Either they get the order wrong and I have to sit and wait a half an hour for them to fix it, or I show up after 30 minutes (the amount of time they tell you) and have to sit and wait 15 minutes for the food to be done.  The food itself has also taken a turn for the worse.  While the portion sizes are huge, the food is overpriced and not very good.  The vodka sauce (one of my favorite Italian dishes) has way too much proscuitto in it.  The pesto has so many pine nuts in it (surprisingly, as I know how expensive pine nuts are), that it completely overpowers any other flavor in the dish.  The food is not authentic Italian.  Unfortunately, there aren't really any other options for Italian food in Colchester...but I do not plan on coming here ever again.  I would eat Olive Garden over this!  I don't know if the issue is the new staff?  Or if they have hired new chefs?  Not sure what is going on here but it is not working.
