I've been to this place twice to take non-Venezuelan people to try our food. The first time I did not find it great but my friend and I liked the ambiance and service. For the second visit my husband and I were in the area, so we went to have some drinks and tapas. Their sangria is horrible and unworthy. I never had such a bad sangria anywhere in my whole life, and I believe the person who made has never tried one in his/her life. We ordered a parrillada. Everything was fresh, but you do not expect sauteed beef to be served as parrilla, or to have the guasacaca thrown on top on the food with no care for the look of it. I never complain to a waiter/ess unless I need to change the food, so we just did our best to have a good time and decided not to come back. Finally, we were charged a 20% tip up front, even though we never expressed our discontent to anyone. I usually find this to be upsetting, especially when you have gone with American friends to the same place and were not charged the tips up front. People who have worked at restaurants will know what I mean. In sum, I wished they worried about the food served as much as they do about the decor, which is really nice. Anyway, I will never go to this place again, and will tell anyone who asks to stay away from it.
