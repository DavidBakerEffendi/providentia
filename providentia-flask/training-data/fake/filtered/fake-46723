We just visited the place with my family and friends very excited to check the place which is suppose to be well known . Sorry people it is very disappointing !!! The menu is very limited for brunch like longsilog, tapsilog . the TAPA was burnt and bitter, the longanisa is not caramelized !! it is better to have the frozen one from the filipino store than what they served . Some food we order is also not recommended. The place is so small and loud but it was nice to see the design which remind us in the philippines. We would like to see a successful filipino restaurant that we can be proud of..........
