Well I went to this restaurant for the first time with a bunch of friends about 5 months ago and although the food was very tasty, the service was not that good. However, last week I had to stop there for a business meeting and I had to say that many things has changed since then; now it's a 5 star resturant with a high level service, a friendly staff and the food as good as always... even better! We really enjoyed the time there and I will surely go back with my friends... I definitely recommend this restaurant, you need to go there, go check for yourself the quality and then come here to leave your review, it's a great place to eat, drink and meet
