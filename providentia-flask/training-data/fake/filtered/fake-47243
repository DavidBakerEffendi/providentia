I recently celebrated my birthday here. It was a larger party (16 people) but the staff still had no problem accommodating us in every way possible. Appetizers were preset and were on the table within ten minutes of taking our entree orders. We started with large orders of both the calamari and fresh figs. We also pre-ordered a few plates of the antipasto misto. After appetizers were cleared it was only a short wait before our entrees were brought to the table, all of which were plated beautifully and looked absolutely delicious. I myself, ordered the Veal Gremolada. All ingredients tasted extremely fresh and were well prepared. Once everyone was finished the staff came around and wrapped any dishes that guests weren't able to finish. Shortly after that, coffee and deserts were brought out. Guests were able to choose from cappuccino,espresso, and regular coffee. But our desserts were preset (cannolis, tiramisu, and cookies) all of which were made on premises and were delicious. Overall truely a 5-star experience. Service was outstanding as well as the food. Definitely will be returning on multiple occasions. P.S.- portion sizes are very generous, dont worry about leaving hungry.
