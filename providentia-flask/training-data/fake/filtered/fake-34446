Awesome sushi.  The specialty rolls, especially Godzilla and Pingu, will knock your socks off.  I LOVE sushi.  Love it.  And Umai has become my favorite sushi restaurant in the city.  The service is outstanding, and the wait staff and chefs are all so friendly it's mind-boggling.  Love that it's a BYO.  You can have an immense amount of sushi for $50 (for two, of course).  Their fish is always perfect, the atmosphere is the perfect combo of cozy/trendy.  Located in a great neighborhood, with a bunch of art museum area bars within a block or two. This place deserves more hype than it's getting.   If you like sushi, and you haven't been to Umai yet, make a reservation NOW.  You won't regret it!
