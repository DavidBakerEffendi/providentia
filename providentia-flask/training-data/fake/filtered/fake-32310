I agree with all the complaints of the other posters. The place was LOUD. Could barely hear the person sitting next to me. Half of the orders were messed up or lacking of food. And by lacking I mean, when you order a chicken sandwich you expect there to be chicken on the whole sandwich not just half. I mean come on "Where's the Beef (Chicken)?"  Someone even ordered a burger with bar-b-que sauce and I believe onion rings on it, they got a plain burger with nothing on it. They are over priced for the quality and quantity of the food you get. It's a typical overpriced chain restaurant. Our waitress came to our table once to take our order and we didn't see her again till she brought us the bill. The manager did come to our table and asked if everything was OK with our meals, When we pointed out all the things they did wrong, he just said, "Really? I'm sorry."   Really???? that's your solution. How about comping something off the bill, or offering a discount on our next visit. SOMETHING. Nope, Nothing. I will never go there again. I really hope this place falls to the curse of that location and goes bye bye REAL quick and gets replaced by something better.
