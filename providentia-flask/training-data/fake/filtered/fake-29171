I've been to Maison Mathis a few times now - the avocado egg sandwich is what keeps me going back (seriously, stop in at least once and get this) and occasionally a waffle. It seems to have become a popular student work zone, so be prepared to be surrounded by macs. Great interior with great hours makes it an enjoyable and easy place to spend some time. Service is generally pretty good, albeit a tad slow on occasion. I've also noticed that almost each time I've been in here that the waitstaff are either uninformed of what the kitchen has run out of or they've forgotten and have to end up telling you after the fact. There was one incident that has stuck in my mind - there was a manager (or someone in charge who was doing work at a table) and the barrista sent some students her way who were fundraising for something. She declined, but then proceeded to make fun of the students to that barrista after they left. Loud enough for us to hear several tables away. It's incredibly rude and unprofessional, and leaves the rest of us wondering what you say about us when we leave. At least save those comments for the back room where we can't hear you.
