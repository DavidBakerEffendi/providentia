Few years ago i had a big project in fishtown, and stumbled on this place.  Spent a few months grabbing breakfast and lunch here, and it is one of my favorites now.   occasionally, I'll go out of the way just to grab something usually a cheesesteak w/sharp prov. Awsome place, clean, good staff,  just all around well run place!!!
