Need a GPS to find. Apples lining walls of the entrance over the top. Cocktail area user unfriendly. Delightful front dining area, small back portions loud because of acoustics. Stay out of back room - dark and sad. We were overfed between unique appetizers/wow type entres and all the extra "chef treats" added along the way. Service, while cool, five star. While expensive, well worth it.
