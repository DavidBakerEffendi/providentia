A manufactured atmosphere, kind of like a Cheesecake Factory but not as grandiose.   It's a Stephen Starr production, not your neighborhood bistro.  So a little pricey, and we were disappointed there were no Happy Hour specials even at 5:30pm.  We had the guac and a seared tuna, both very delicious, so at least the chef is worth it.  Attention guys: the place was packed with women!
