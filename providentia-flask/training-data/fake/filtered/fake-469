Real tasty..not a huge sandwich but meat was tasty and the bread was excellent. I was impressed especially after reading some of the negative reviews. Went there on a Sunday afternoon waited maybe 10-15 minutes in line. Staff that I dealt with, the cashier, was okay but I wasn't looking for pleasantries. Just wanted a cheesesteak. Good experience.
