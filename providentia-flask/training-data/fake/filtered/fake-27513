You have to be a TOTAL fool to go to this dump.. The guy charges a LUDICROUS 5 dollars per slice.... yes, the pizza is good but NO WAY near that price... You do not live in a rural town... You can go to other places like L&B which has great pizza, great hang out, ices, spumoni, and other things over this DUMP... You feel like you need to take 10 showers after being in this place... So much hype... Only in New York... Went years ago... Never again... back then it was a rip off dump too.. Now??? are you kidding me?? The guy is jesse james without a gun... A total ripoff... Do NOT GO... Â PS... one of the funniest things to see is when the customers lean over to watch the guy make his pizza.. They talk to him like he is doing them a favor.... Hilarious.... Wake up people.. this is pizza, not the invention of a rocket ship to get you to work in 2 minutes.... lol
