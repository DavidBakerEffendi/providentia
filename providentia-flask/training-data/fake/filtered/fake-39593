What can I say that hasn't been said already! This place is amazing!  The ropa vieja is $&@@in off the hook!  There's no glitz and glamour (no guy rolling cigars, no live band) just a uncle and his nephew rolling out amazing food and creating a homely atmosphere!  Parking sucks, but that's to be expected, it queens for gods sake!  If your foodie this is the place to go! Filled with locals, you know they r doing something right! Get there early to avoid the wait! Small restaurant so it fills up quick!
