We loved this restaurant, but maybe that has something to do with the fact that about ten mins after we arrived (at around 10pm Monday 9th January) Robert de Niro, Sean Penn and Naomi Watts came in and sat on the table right next to ours. Was a bit starstruck to say the least so to be honest, didn't really notice what we were eating or drinking. I think the wine was nice though. Had ravioli and I think it was pretty good from what i can remember. We actually got engaged that night too so was a magical night all round! The staff were very helpful and attentive (again, though, maybe because de Niro himself was present and they needed to work extra hard) and the price was very reasonable. Thoroughly recommend (although from what I gather, de Niro dining there was quite a rarity so don't be disappointed if he doesn't show up and sit next to you!)
