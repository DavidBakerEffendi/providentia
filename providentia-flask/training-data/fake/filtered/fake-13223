I absolutely love Nauna's. My wife and I have been a "regular" at Nauna's since we moved to the area in 1999. Our neighbor recommended we order pizza there when we were moving in and we have been hooked since then. Besides pizza they have a wide variety of pasta, my favorite being the whole wheat penne primavera with fresh mozzarella. My wife loves the shrimp francese and we ALWAYS get calamari as an appetizer. Try the balsamic calamari if you want calamari but want to try something different. It has a balsamic reduction drizzled over the fried calamari and as awesome! The service is good and the prices are less than other comparable Italian joints in the area. Make sure you call for reservations on the weekends because they are always packed. Weekdays you can usually get a table without a reservation you just might wait a few minutes to be seated.
