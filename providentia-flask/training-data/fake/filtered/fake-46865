Love Paesano's BUT hate that they don't use gloves when assembling the sandwiches.  When I went to Paesano's I ordered the Arista (the best) after assembling the cheese on my bread the gentleman behind the counter stopped making my sandwich and cashed out other guests - receiving cash and returning change - then went back to assembling my sandwich without washing his hand or using gloves.  Do you know how many germs are on cash.  Cross contamination Jackass !! Send these donkeys to a ServSafe class - they're bound to get some one sick !!
