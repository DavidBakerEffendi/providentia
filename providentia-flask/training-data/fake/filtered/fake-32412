This restaurant was completely horrific while I dined there with my mother and little brother. There must have been ten flies flying around my table, all the silverware was dirty and had not been checked for cleanliness. I had gotten the $9.00 endless refills of breadsticks, salad and soup. The breadsticks were deep fried and brought before the rest of our food when it should have been brought with all of the food. After waiting for a while, we realized that we were filling up on the bread and not getting our moneys worth. After waiting for fifteen minutes for a cup of soup that should have taken two minutes, it the soup was very salty and when it was brought out to my table, i could tell that it had been sitting for a while and was room temperature. The salad was below average in taste and quality, and the whole meal altogether was not worth the money. This was a horrible, horrible experience and we will never come back to this Fridays restaurant again in market fair. I highly recommend that nobody does.
