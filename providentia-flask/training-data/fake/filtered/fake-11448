i am a food critic traveling around the states tasting great foods. i am also vietnamese.i've landed here in pho dang and order a couple of dishes and i thought it tasted ok but not great. the restaurant is very old and dirty. i give this place no star cause of the rudeness of the owner. she ignore me while she was making a phone call to a friend speaking in her broken vietnamese language and mind u i was standing right in front of her. the restaurant Â seem very busy yet she chose to speak on the phone with her friend chatting very loudly about gambling. i felt bad for the young waitress, she was very nice. if the owner have no sense of urgency then she should not be opening a restaurant this busy . this has to be the worst owner i've seen in a long time. for this reason i will not even give it 1 star. your personality reflects your restaurant and she has a bad one.
