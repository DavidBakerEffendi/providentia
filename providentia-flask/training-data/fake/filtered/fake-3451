We went for Sunday morning brunch.  Told that the wait was 45 minutes, checked after an hour and was told 20 minutes more.  Continued to see parties who arrived much after we did get seated.  Explanation that they called ahead.  Still couldn't get seated after almost an hour and a half.  Also, none of the hostesses really appeared to have a clue.  An iPad,  a computer, and a piece of paper to manage the waiting list.  Very unprofessional over all.  They will never see any of my money and, with luck, none of yours either.  Don't care if the food is good or not, sloppy handling of customers indicates sloppy operation overall.
