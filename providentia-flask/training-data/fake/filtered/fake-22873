First and foremost, the interior is tremendous and whoever designed the inside of this restaurant has an eye for good taste. Secondly, the staff treated me like i was royalty with the way they took the time to explain the WHOLE menu to me in depth and explained everything to me. they have a new item called sauce and toss which includes 5 wishbone wings dipped in delicious asian sesame soy sauce and topped with fresh herbs which was hands down delicious to the point where i ordered 2 orders of it. their classic dark and white meat hit the spot, it is very juicy and tender, it makes you not wanna stop eating and every dipping sauce was ordered that day which complimented the chicken tenders. as for pastries, the italian and bananas foster pie definitely hit the spot after eating such wonderful food, Kudos to the employees and owners of this place for providing such wonderful service and mouthwatering food, keep up the good work! :)
