Rolled in with 30 hungry soccer kids (17-18) and families. They took us in 10 at a time. Let the feasting begin. We ordered 4 apps/salads, 3 pastas, 3 chicken/veal dishes. Â SO GOOD! Pasta was exceptionally cooked to perfection! I'll be back. Family style is the way to go and the service was excellent - really had a truly superior experience.
