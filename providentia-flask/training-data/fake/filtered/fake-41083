Best pizza I had with my visit to NYC! There was more mozzarella on this pizza then anywhere else. Waited in line for about 35 minutes and it was totally worth it. Ordered a large for me and my gf and ate or leftovers later in the day while touring the city! Very good cold pizza! I was come to Grimaldi's every time in visit NYC!
