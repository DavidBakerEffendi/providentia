WARNING!! SOMETHING HAS CHANGED!!  And the change is drastic. Fort Defiance's most famous brunch menu items have gone away and been replaced with overprice variations of egg plates, and they suck.  I'm pretty sure their once famous gravy is now coming from a jar.   It's like they are trying to lose customers.  It's really upsetting.
