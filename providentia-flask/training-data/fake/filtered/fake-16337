This restaurant should be ashamed of themselves ,charging high prices for poor quality food.Never in my life was I disappointed like this.The bread was stale and baked,the seafood salad was far from fresh,and the entrees were not of traditional Italian recipes.They do not have an Italian chef for sure.The worst meal I have ever experienced by far.
