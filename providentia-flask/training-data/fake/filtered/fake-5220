I am a frequent visitor to Marzullo Brothers Restaurant. I see that someone had a bad experience there because of the crowsing. But that is because the restaruant is very popular and the food is excellent. Weekends tend to be crowded because of the quality of the food and the reasonable prices. When the weather is warm there is plenty of al fresco dining available. I never had a meal there that I did not like. I recommend it to all my friends and acquaintances. Tony L.
