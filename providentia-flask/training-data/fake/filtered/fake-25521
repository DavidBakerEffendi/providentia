This place is really really good.   I pretty much agree with most of the comments already posted... I guess the first thing you should know is that it's a little expensive/pricey for the average meal out.  That said, there are available discounts posted on the internet.  (students check out this early bird & late night special w/ an additional gift certificate for your next visit:http://www.studentrate.com/StudentRate/all/­get_all_student_deals/Leunigs_Student_Discounts/53­48) I've tried several of the menu items and haven't really found anything yet that didn't leave me fully satisfied.   I really loved the curly fries.  If you're in the mood for something different I too recommend the duck fritters.
