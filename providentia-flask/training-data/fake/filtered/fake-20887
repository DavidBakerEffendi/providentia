i had such high hopes for this place!! i got the chilorio brisket + cole-braised pork. the meat was obvs high quality and it was tasty but it just didn't WOW me like i wanted it to. there was pepper in the cola-braised pork, which i didn't enjoy but it didn't mar the taste of the tacos overall. the chilorio was better and i liked the pineapple salsa. i guess i'm just disappointed that it was suppose to be AMAZING and it was okay for me.
