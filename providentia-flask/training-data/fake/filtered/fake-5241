I strongly disagree with the other reviews of Marzullos. My family and I are long time customers of Â the restaurant and have never had any problems. The wait staff have always been extremely friendly and curtious. The food has never been anything below excellent and it almost seems these reviews are jokes. Only makes me wonder what your true motives are for leaving these negative reviews. My family and I go there at least once a week and find the prices and food portions to be amazing.. An A+ in my book.
