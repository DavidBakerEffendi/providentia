When I experience great Italian food, I want to utter profanities. Modo Mio definitely took me to that place. Our server was very helpful, with it being out first time there. Â He was also very patient with us, as it took forever for us to make our decisions for the turista menu (four courses for $35; completely worth it). The gnocchi with sweet and sour rabbit ragu, and the pork loin with a creamy chickpea sauce, topped with a fried egg and radicchio salad especially made me want to curse out of a temporary lack of eloquence brought on by the delight in what I was eating. When we finished our dinner, I said that had been the best meal I had in two years. I'm looking forward to a return visit. This is a great BYOB.
