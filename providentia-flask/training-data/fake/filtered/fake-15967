I just don't get it. I've been here a couple of times. The place is always busy but the food is awful! I went a couple of times thinking maybe the few times I've experienced bad food was a fluke. Sorry to say no. I'm not in the food biz but everything seems cheap. The soups are bought not made. The apps are frozen. I just don't get it. Perhaps it's the social place to get a drink because the bar is busy most times. Everyone whom I've gone with agreed. It's just bad.
