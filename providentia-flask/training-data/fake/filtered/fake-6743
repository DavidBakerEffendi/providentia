Had a disappointing experience here prompting me to post a very rare Yelp review.  Called in advance to make a dinner reservation with my wife's family.  When I called, I told them we would have a small, well-behaved baby with us in a car seat.  I said I wanted to make sure that was alright.  The guy I spoke to was very nice and took the reservation for 7:30.  He said he would make a note of the baby so they could accommodate us at an appropriately-sized table. At 3:30 the day of the reservation I got a call from the hostess saying there had been a "mistake" with their reservation system and they could only seat us at 6 pm or 9 pm.  Of course neither of those worked, so she cancelled our reservation.  Surprisingly, she wasn't particularly apologetic about the cancellation.  She seemed to regard it as our fault for not being prepared to accept the offer of a 6 pm dinner reservation.  (Who gets home from work by 6 pm?) The odd thing is that a few weeks before, I stopped by in person and asked the hostess about making a reservation on a different night, also mentioning we would have a small baby.  At the time she also told me they could accommodate us only at 6 pm or 9 pm. It's perfectly fine if the restaurant isn't kid friendly.  (Although maybe a bit surprising, since Jack the Horse bills itself as a neighborhood institution in a neighborhood that is full of families with young kids.)  I certainly don't think all New York restaurants have an obligation to be kid friendly.  And I don't mind if they have a policy of trying to seat parties with kids before the dinner rush (or after it).  But taking a reservation with full knowledge that it includes a kid, then calling back to cancel a few hours before dinner strikes me as very poor form. Try Sociale instead.  The food is better, the staff more accommodating, and you don't have to worry about the restaurant drumming up a phony excuse to cancel on you a few hours before your reservation.
