Always a good meal and a fun time Nice bar area in the front, checkered red table cloth dining area in the back and a take out pizza counter to the side. Love it! Entrees are equally as good as the pizzas and pitchers of beer are very reasonable Staff is always warm and inviting- I'm very glad to have a decent establishment in the hood!
