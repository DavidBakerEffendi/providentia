Elegantly casual.......this new spot in Harlem is Wonderful.  As you enter, you feel like you are in walking into a European Bistro.   The service was charming.  The food was outstanding. From the generous appetizers to the main course, every thing that we tried was delicious.  The Ox Tail was perfectly prepared and the casual Turkey Burger Sliders were the best we have ever eaten.  Bravo and welcome to New York.
