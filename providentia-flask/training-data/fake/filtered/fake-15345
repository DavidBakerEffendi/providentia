This place rocks.. It used to have really cool staff but it seems to have changed recently. The new guys seem cool enough time will tell i guess.. I'm a big fan of the Blueys burger, i generally customize by adding avo as they call it... Which reminds me that their avo toast is also awesome i get it for breakfast with an egg on top..Easily a five star spot hands down..!
