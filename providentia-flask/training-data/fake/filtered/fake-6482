I love, love, love it here. I love that there are only a few options. When I'm hungry, really hungry, I don't want to sit down, look at a lengthy menu and try to determine what I'm hungry FOR -- when I go to Pho 501, the decision's already made. All I have to say is "small beef, please," and minutes later a delicious bowl of soup ready for me to eat (or customize to my tastes) arrives. It can get busy, but the turnover is usually startlingly quick. You're also welcome to take out your soup if you want, making the wait nonexistent. They do accept credit cards. My ONLY complaint is that they aren't open 24/7, and that I don't live right next door.
