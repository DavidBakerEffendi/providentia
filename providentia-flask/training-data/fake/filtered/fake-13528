Ok so I've never written a yelp review before but I wanted to write one now. I figured my first ever visit to Catfish warranted my first ever yelp review. I went on a Sunday and I'll be honest- it was realllly nice to have a place in my neighborhood for brunch instead of having to brave sunday transit in to the city or, even worse, in to williamsburg. So, Location: good job. Ambiance: LOUD and i hate when a place has music *and* tvs adding to the volume level. pick one. Service: off and on. My waitress was super sweet and polite and attentive. I'm not sure if maybe she was all by herself but she was seriously hustlin. When i asked for hot sauce she magically produced it out of thin air in about 3 seconds. win. Bartender- totally ignored me when i went up to the bar to ask about a wine list. I guess maybe he was busy? It was sunday brunch, so ok. It might be one of those places where you get the best service if you're friends with the barkeep. Â  food: meh. it was alRIGHT but exPENSIVE for what it was. The poboy was good but i feel like i could have gotten it from a cart on the sidewalk (and not paid $12). The gumbo was kind of bland and the portion was not New Orleans sized. If a friend absolutely wanted to go to this place and it was her birthday, I wouldn't say no but I don't think i'll be a regular.
