Great selection of food with a well stocked bar with wine on tap.  Yes, please.  The bartenders are super friendly and very eager to share any knowledge of any drink should you have questions. I expected a Sloppy Joe to be messier but it held together surprisingly well. They don't take reservations for on weekends for large groups which is a shame, because I wanted a beer/burger birthday bash but I wasn't about to coordinate a group of 10 and wait for an hour for a table.  There are too many good alternatives for B&B to uphold a policy of no reservations for parties or groups.
