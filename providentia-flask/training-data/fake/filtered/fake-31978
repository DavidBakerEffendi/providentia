Excellent food and service: Thin crust (and I do mean thin) with gourmet toppings to die for, excellent panninis and delicious soups topped off with sinful, yet heavenly cheese cake or tiramisu. Cozy interior...pub like even. Wait staff is friendly and attentive. Features daily lunch specials. Try their house salad with a cup of soup or half of grilled sandwhich of the day!
