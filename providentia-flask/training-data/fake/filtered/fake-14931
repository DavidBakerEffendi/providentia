Great pizza, great prices. They also have discounts for students and a Monday night special of two cheese pizzas and a two-liter soda for $16+tax. (You have to pay extra for toppings.) Also check out the coupons on their website. The ambience isn't bad but it isn't fantastic either. This is just a really good place to grab a really good pizza. We usually take it home but ate in the restaurant once as well and it was just fine. You can also BYOB if you eat here. We've tried Mama Palma's around the corner (see my review about that place), and you couldn't pay me to eat at MP over Gusto--Gusto would win, hands down, any day of the week. It's become a weekly tradition at our house. (Also, good to know, it's a cash-only spot, but they have an ATM inside.)
