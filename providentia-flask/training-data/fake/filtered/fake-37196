very beautiful place, nice decor and atmosphere. The food is very well prepared and the burgers are really quite amazing. I get my burger well done and its usually a bit on the dry side but the one at Hillstone was still juicy and perfect. The only thing I didn't really enjoy was the huge chunk of shredded lettuce on top of the burger. It made it soggy and unpleasant and I wiped most of mine off. If they are using such top quality ingredients, what's with the shredded iceberg? Â other than that delicious and I would certainly go again and recommend it to others. Will ask for my burger without the lettuce this time.
