Fantastic.  Journeyed up from Lake Placid through the Vermont lake region planning on hitting Burlington.  Stopped in winooski on a whim and then Our House on a bigger whim - food was terrific.  Known for a little deist on classics - macs and cheese and blt for example - I tried a special clam & crab Mac/cheese and wife had blt with Cajun bacon, grilled arugula and grilled to tomatoes  with garlic aoili on terrific toasted bread with side of killer sweet potato fries and cinnamon based side relish.  Worth a stop.  Friendly service, good background music, regional beers and good wine list.
