Great , great MEAL.  The food is excellent.  And I eat out ALL.THE.TIME. so, my standards are pretty high. Their menu is smart, simple and creative, with something for everyone, but is especially amazing for people who love a great steak. We went with a big group of us, and everything we ordered was fantastic and super flavorful.  Expect delicious food and warm hospitality.   Try the beef short ribs, truffled Meal chips, mac & cheese, and tuna tartare to start. They had a special: potato, wrapped with applewood smoked bacon -- and I'm still dreaming about it. I hope they consider making this dish a staple on the menu.  The oysters: fabulous. The porterhouse, lamb chops and pork shank were brilliantly cooked.  For people like me, who gorge themselves on the appetizers, the menu gives you plenty of options on the cut and size of your meat, and the wait staff helps you decide on the best temperature to suit your liking.  The flavor and crust on the porterhouse - seriously perfect.  The steaks are accompanied by a variety of sauces, but the chimichurri and horseradish cream stand-out.  The quality and variety of the meats and fish on the menu are top shelf and you can tell the chef knows what he's doing.   As far as ambiance is concerned, it is warm, modern and inviting, and a place you can sit and enjoy company for a while.
