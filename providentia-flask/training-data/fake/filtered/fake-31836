My girlfriend and I live in the area and we definitely consider Pepe Giallo as one of our canteens! In the summer, try to get a table in their lovely gardens! We especially like this place as it is casual and you really get good food for the price you pay. My favorite entrees are their salmon pasta and balsamic chicken! They also serve some wine in carafe for a very decent price. There is a European vibe in this restaurant which is really pleasant! Service has finally strongly improved! As we were speaking a foreign language, one of their waiters filled twice the tip for us 2 years ago, which obviously was unacceptable!
