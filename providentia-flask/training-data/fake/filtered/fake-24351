Had breakfast here, overall a great experience. Everyone there was extremely friendly, and the food (various kinds of tacos) was excellent. The highlights: delicious refried beans, quality chorizo, and the hot salsa was the best I've had in a long time. It has a nice burn to it, but it has a multidimensional flavor and if you like spicy you can pour a fair amount onto your taco (it's so good you will want to). Will be back to try dinner... Hopefully tonight!
