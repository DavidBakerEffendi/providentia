OMG... How delicious. Took my boyfriend to this nice secluded little spot. We started off with the oysters and a bottle of saki. The moved on to the tasting menu. Everything was delicious but our favorite had to be the branzini. $55.00 for a five course tasting, you can't beat that. I strongly recommend this place that seats about 20 to 25 people. Just a relaxing place to have a wonderful meal. Service was excellent and servers were knowledgable and helpful. You should check it out.
