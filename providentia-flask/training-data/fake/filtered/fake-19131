My fiancee and I decided not to have our event here. This review is based on the rude and pretentious event staff that we met during our appointment. They were uninterested in seeing us and would not answer our questions; it seemed like talking to us was a chore. I would go as far as saying that they were being racist. I know people who have had events here in the past, which is why the Manor was initially a potential option for us. However, after this experience I would never go back there. Truly a bad experience.
