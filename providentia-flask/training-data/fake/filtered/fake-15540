I dinner the week of the grand opening. My friends and i shared appetizers and main courses.We sampled all the wings, the goat cheese salad, side of truffle fries, and the "proper burger. Â Everything was outstanding. The server was attentive and on her game. The decor is trendy and inviting. Love the wall paper. There was a great bar crowd for Wednesday evening. I had a wonderful dining experience.
