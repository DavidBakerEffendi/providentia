After seeing so many pictures from friends of the dishes there, I just had to go with some friends. It was busy when we got there (around brunch) , so there was a bit of a wait. The place is cool and they sell little chocolate things to the side. The food is good, i especially like the juevos rancheros burrito they have, which is weird because the restaurant is known for its chocolate! The waffle fries are good (although some are burn or dry and hard) and I really enjoy the ranch dressing that comes with it. The price is a little high for some of the dishes, which is a con for me, seeing as how the place is nothing classy or upscale (its more casual). Overall, great service, good food. Will I go again? not sure. Maybe if i'm in the area with friends and I have nowhere else to eat.
