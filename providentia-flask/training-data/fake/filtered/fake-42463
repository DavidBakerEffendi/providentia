We have visited Palma twice so far. We originally stumbled upon this quaint gem while roaming the street with hungry stomachs. On a Tuesday around 8:00pm the wait for two was about 45 minutes but we found a seat at the end of the bar, chatted with a couple locals and sipped a Lemon Bail Martini (Fantastic) and Rosemary Rye (good as well). Before we knew it we were shown to our seats in the garden area. The ambiance of the garden is exceptional. We were seated in a quiet corner, above is a glass celling open for a cool breeze feeling surrounded by the perfect ambiance of florals and soft light by candlelight. It is truly romantic. Our service was also wonderful, he carefully explained the technique and products used to create the dishes, homemade pasta, fresh ingredients, etc. We ordered the calamari (delicious), the special of the night, which was spinach infused linguini with tiger shrimp, fantasy eggplant, garlic and grape tomatoes in a white wine sauce (a little too spicy for my taste but my boyfriend loved it!). We ended our culinary experience with Cappuccino and the Italian Cheesecake (out of this world!). Palma is a great place to unwind, enjoy unique food, along with a great conversation. We look forward to coming again!
