Pizza was soggy in the middle and somewhat greasy. The onion rings were thick, crispy and not very greasy altho they did lack flavor that the sauce with the full order may have helped with. Service is five stars with staff interested in the their customers Look forward to trying other menu items than the pizza. Their pizza and their onion rings are much superior to the other new pizza place in town, Z.....s!
