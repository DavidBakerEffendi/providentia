I ate at this restaurant this past Sunday. While the food was very good, the kitchen didn't seem too concerned with serving a scallop entree with either 3 fairly large scallops (our table) or 4 scallops of equal size to an adjacent table...at $26.50 I want another scallop.   It was also very annoying that the snapper entree arrived 5 minutes after the others.  After dropping the check, there was no further communication with the staff.  No thank you or goodbye from the wait staff (which seemed to have disappeared by the end of their night) or the kitchen staff.  A sad end to an overall decent meal.  By the way, there is a reason why they don't list the menu prices on their website.
