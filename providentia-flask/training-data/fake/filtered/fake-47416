I gotta say, this was such a pleasant surprise.  I'm not a Top Chef fan and had no idea who Jonathan Waxman was before I went to dinner with a friend last night.  Simply put the food was very good and the service was great, friendly and prompt.  The hostess updated us and gave us an accurate ETA of when we'd be seated.  The eggplant bruchetta was also a welcome surprise and did it's best to tide us over before our Pollo al Forno & Sausage Ragu entrees.  Both were the extremely satisfying without being overstated or too complex.  I don't agree that the chicken's only ingredient was salt.  This was a unique dining experience that I enjoyed without overblown expectations.
