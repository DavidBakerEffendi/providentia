IM ARGENTINEAN and I HATE THIS PLACE...   why? i'll tell ya...    I just moved to brooklyn and I was looking for an Argentinean spot to simply go and have lunch at least three times a week...  So i Tried some in manhattan but it's to far... Went to EL ALMACEN and sat down.. pretty nice place I have to say..  but everything else from then on was just a wreck.. I ordered a Palmito Salad and a "Asado de Tira" which is a short rib steak..  20 minutes later the salad came... and there was two other tables only... well the salad had NO palmitos!?!? i was like WTH!??!  they did bring more palmitos on request after she told me that the kitchen didn't want to give me more.. lol.. 20 mins after that by watch, my steak came and it was RAW...  i ordered Medium-Well  but this was RAW RAW...  so It grossed me out...  I immediately ordered the check...  Payed $38 plus $8 tip.. and left, crossed the street and got some PIZZA...    geez... I hope that that was just a bad day for them..  but for sure i'm not coming back...
