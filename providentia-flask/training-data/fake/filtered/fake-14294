this is my favorite place to eat, I LOVE this restaurant BUT.....the waitress never listens to me (either one of them). I always tell them to please NOT crack my lobster claw because it makes the meat stick to the shell, but yet they almost ALWAYS do it and on top of that they always rush to get plates off the table. The owner is really nice, very social and always present when open, which makes one feel like the business owner is actually there for the business (to take care of it) and not only for the profit. The only thing I can't stand is not being listened to when I go out and have to pay $100+ for my dinner and they don't hear me out and repeatedly do it. For that price, I expect them to listen to a small request like "Don't crack my lobster claw, please." I hate Â to give it 2 stars because I love the food and the owner, but they have to listen to the customer too, it's not like it's a doctors office where they only listen for 15 seconds and then space out
