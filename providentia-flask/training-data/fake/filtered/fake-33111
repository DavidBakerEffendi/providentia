I literally just signed up for yelp to rate this restaurant. I heard good things about this restaurant, and because I was two blocks out of the delivery radius, the restaurant refused to deliver to me. Even worse, the "manager" hung up the phone on me after about 45 seconds. It was a pretty lousy display of customer service.
