Oh man. Food is always good, service is quick and friendly and its cheaper, tastier and overall better than its competitors (IM LOOKIN AT YOU CHIPOTLE). I always get the carne asada plato. Sure, there isnt much seating available but whatever.  You still want to eat here, trust me.   Oh- dont go to the Dos Toros in the west village if you can help it.  utter disappointment compared to this one.
