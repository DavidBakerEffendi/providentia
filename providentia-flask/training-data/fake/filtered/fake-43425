Years ago the Yardley Inn was the go to place for a good meal in a nice setting at a reasonable price. Having not been there in a while I suggested it for dinner with a friend. Wow, how times have changed. We were seated right away but didn't see a server for a good 15 minutes. We ordered and got our 1 app about 10 minutes later and then about 5 minutes later got the bread basket. Entrees arrived immediately on clearing the appetizer, definitely on the lukewarm side. I had rack of lamb ($32) which was just that, an unseasoned tiny rack with about 1/4 cup of vegetables. Really good meat, well cooked but cold and very little else. The bill for 2 entrees, 1 cheap appetizer, 1 glass of wine, 1 sparkling water and 1 coffee was $100. Service was friendly, but disinterested. They need to step up their game big time. And BTW, the place could use a good cleaning. It looks fine, but has that old. dirty carpet smell
