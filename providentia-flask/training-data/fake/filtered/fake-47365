Great atmosphere, excellent food, ribs are to die for.  Ventured into the bar on a Saturday night recently for after dinner drinks, but the girl behind there was more interested in entertaining friends and had to wait for a while, just to get a drink.  If it wasn't for that, would have gotten 5 stars.
