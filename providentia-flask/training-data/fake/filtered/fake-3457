Only complaint--and a big one--is this place is  a bad  choice for a large group --we had 9.  Restaurant has good food and our waitress was terrific but  the manager/restaurant  is not considerate of difficulty of cramming large group in just to save another table for others.  I has at one end and my back was flat against the center of  a 2 table behind me facing other direction.  Those in my party on either side of me had to share plate space.  I was left with no sensible place for my plate / drink /utencils even though the waitress put my food on a much smaller plate.  I did ask  the manager when I saw the set-up if those of us at the one end would even be able to eat--no problem he said when I brought it to his attention.  Since I was with a group of family who get together annually I kept my peace .  My advice--don't take a group of this size there as the restaurant is  more interested in the volume of diners they can cram in  than the comfort of diners.
