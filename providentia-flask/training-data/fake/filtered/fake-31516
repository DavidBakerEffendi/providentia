Great restaurant with a gorgeous view of the New York Skyline. The food had a lot of flavor. Blend is really for the customers. Since I am a vegetarian they did everything to my taste and altered many of the meat appetizers. I ordered the vegetarian paella. It was really good. The meatless arepas and meatless tostones nachos was very tasty. The person I was with ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and thought it was delicious. The service was definitely great. The only thing I didn't like was the really long wait. I went on a Saturday night and the wait was more than an hour and a half. So I definitely recommend making reservations. But it was worth the wait!
