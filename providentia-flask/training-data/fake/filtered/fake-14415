I would NOT recommend the place. The atmosphere was just OK. The dining area was cramped and I was touching other people as I was moving to my table. I ordered the Mole De Pollo which was supposed to be a specialty, but it was a disaster in reality. The food was pre-cooked but it took them forever to serve it. It was not hot either. It did not smell great and the food was very bland as well. The chicken was over-cooked. They served salmon with the fish tacos. Frankly, I have never tasted something like it. The shimp tacos were good, and hence the 1 star with the rating. I have had mexican food at tacobell, moes, Chipotle, Sol and they were all better in terms of food and service. I wish you luck if you are dining in or take out!!
