I just move from bronx, and i love eating pizza. The pizza at romeos is one of the best pizza that i taste so far in passaic, but i stop eating there because of what i seen one day that i was there. The register employee was handling pizza and money with his hands, and he would put pizza in oven with his hands after he had counted money. I am the type of person that likes to eat the crust of the pizza but seen this i did not feel like eating pizza anymore at romeos.
