Just returned from our dinner at Ibiza in Hamden Ct. We arrived before the restaurant was busy, about 5:30.  Ordered our drinks and food.   We waited for an hour, 6:30 before we received any of our dishes and over two hours, almost 8:00, before our final dish arrived. We watched as tables that arrived after us got their food.  When we inquired about our food the wait staff did not seem concerned . Finally when our food arrived it is tasty though the tapas portions are quite small.  On two occasions the wait staff tried to remove food and drink from the table before we were finished. A little strange. The restaurant gets quite crowded and the room is very small and drafty. There is not much space for people to wait comfortably for tables. Overall we waited much to long for our food.  The room gets very crowded with anxious people who want to sit down and eat hovering over those already seated.  The wait staff tries. I am not sure if the staff in the kitchen can stay on top of the orders.   It is truly a shame.   My advice SKIP IT
