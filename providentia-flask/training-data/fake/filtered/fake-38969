This place is BYO!  For the West Village, that should say enough in and of itself.  Also, the pastries / desserts in the window are so delicious -- true french pastry chefs in the kitchen there! The dinner menu pretty much never changes and neither does the brunch, but it has a fabulous brunch.  Just by sitting down, they will bring you coffee and OJ.  The eggs benedict / hollandaise sauce is so good!  You can also make your own omelette with any vegetables / cheese on the menu.  Sometimes there can be a wait, but they usually get people and out very quickly for brunch.  For dinner, you can end up waiting a while because it is BYO so people will linger over their wine -- but they will let you hang out outside and start drinking your wine before you are seated.
