This restaurant features a fabulous menu with all fresh healthy made to order authentic dishes.  We especially love ordering all of the fresh fish dishes because they are swimming in the morning and fresh on your plate for dinner.  The owner, Muri, is always present and personable and goes above and beyond to make sure each and every guest is satisfied.  We look forward to returning each week for a fabulous meal with Muri.  The best part is that it is a BYOB allowing us to drink our favorite wine with dinner. If you want a great meal then go see Muri at It's Greek To Me in Clifton and you will not be disappointed.  Be sure to make note of the directions because I guarantee you will return if you give it a try.
