best ramen in nyc - best pork buns too - get there at 4:45pm if you want to walk right in - 1 hour wait @ 5:15 - 2 hours @ 6:15 - 2-3 hours @ 7:15 - or go at lunchtime and it's not that bad a wait - it's quick - get in - order - food comes - get out - i'd say they turn over tables every 45mins - 1hr - never rushed out though - they're just a finely oiled machine - can't wait to try the new one in midtown. oh - no take out and no taking home leftovers, so do not over-order - 1 app - 1 ramen - that's it - you may have a tough time finishing that even
