popular.  but for good reason.  long waits at dinner time on fridays and saturdays obviously so pick a random weekday to try it out with little fuss.  energetic atmosphere - you walk to your table and the entire staff shouts in glee.  maybe not glee.  maybe in japanese.   pork buns are delicious.  and ramen is... eh. just kidding.  good stuff, not for those on a low sodium diet.  i like the egg.  and the beer.  yum.  go there.  with parents. with a date.  alone.  just kidding, maybe not alone cuz they sit you at a communal table and you'll be the loser who went there alone.  unless you are extremely confident.  or pretty.  because beautiful people can do whatever they want.
