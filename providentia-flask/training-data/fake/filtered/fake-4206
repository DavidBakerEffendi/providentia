After my first time going here I was hooked. However, the second time around wasn't as pleasant. The food is great I'll give them that Shout out to there cooks; but the staff could do better. @ 9 would have gotten 5 stars, but after being followed out the door by the waiter to get asked if I don't know how to leave a tip and was I Â from a different state; they get 2 stars. Last time I checked a tip was up to the customer. Now I have to find a new Thai place. Oh and before you think I'm cheap and don't leave tips, I gave her a tip but she looked at it like I was insulting her, so I took back my money.
