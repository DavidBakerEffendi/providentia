This restaurant was a big disappointment.  We went there on a Sunday night and by 7:00 they had run out of bread, the special for the day (rabbit) and the roast chicken.  Really?  To compound this the service was especially poor.  The waiter did not come by once to refill our wine or water.  They could do much better!
