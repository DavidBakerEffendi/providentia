Went to Cheryl's for brunch on a Saturday afternoon. Got there at 1:30, was not seated till 3:15. Once we were actually seated no one came over to wait on us for about 10 minutes and I took matters into my own hands and grabbed some menus from the bar area. I think the waitress noticed how ticked off we were and was extra nice during the meal. I got the french toast which was good, the other two dishes were good as well. When we were finished with the meal it took about 20 minutes to get our check, and after we handed over our payment it took another 15 minutes to get our receipt back. Overall, the food was good but not worth the stupendously inept service.
