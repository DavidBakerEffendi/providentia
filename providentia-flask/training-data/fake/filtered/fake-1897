Finally an authentic Cuban restaurant in Morris County!  Have only tried the Cuban Sandwich, the Croquetas and the Chocolate flan.  They were excellent!  No imitation here!  Planning on going back and trying everything on the menu. The taste is very authentic and I should know. I am Cuban. Tastes like your Cuban grandma in the back cooking your favorite Cuban dishes. Reasonably priced and has great atmosphere. Feels like you are sitting on an outdoor cafe in a tropical island. Check it out!
