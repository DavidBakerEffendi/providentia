Awesome place, so glad it finally opened! I've been here 3 times, and I hate to say it, but I've ordered the same thing each time: Vermicelli with marinated flank steak.  I mean, come on - would you not get it? s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com… The combination of beef, spice, vermicelli and fresh cut vegetables is amazing - filling but still "light fare" that doesn't leave you wanting a nap after.  I also tried the Sriracha buffalo wings, which were as good as they sound like they'd be.   If you see Juan bartending, check out the Cucumber Margarita.  I'm not a mixed drink guy, but last time we were there my girlfriend got one and I took a sip, then proceeded to ordered 3 more.  They are out of this world - think like a margarita, but now with the strong sour bite.  Uber-refreshing. They also have a good selection of bottled beers, but the taps were not yet installed when I was last there (about a week ago).   The ambiance is very nice.  After work was comfortable, service was fast, everything was clean .  The construction of the bar and venue itself comes off as thought through and very "finished" with an attention to detail.  I'd like to see it again as well on a Friday / Sat late night. And the prices are great. While the beer and drinks are pretty typical downtown prices, the food maxes out at (I believe) $12.95 for a dinner, and apps and Pho are something like $6 to $9.  Considering a martini most places costs about that much, an evening out here for dinner and drinks wouldn't cost any more than a night of drinks anywhere else.
