TREASURE OF ALPHABET CITY! Dinner Cocktail:  Spy Cup- if you love ginger and spice-this is better than nice- its naughty:) Starter:    Winter Squash Soup- smooth texture - not too rich, subtle sweet and savory Main:       Squid and Mussel Ragout- PERFECT and very fresh, i was so pleased Side:       Glazed Carrots- cooked to be devoured,- it was my dessert I think the flavor in the food comes from their awesome chain of good karma; from farm to table....and of course the chef! Intimate setting, great for dates or roomy dinners:) ... and they have fudge for a dollar! get it!
