The food was delicous BUT it was too bad that after having to book a month in advance and anticipating a nice relaxing meal, our food came out rapid fire and simultaneously - primi with antipasti, pasta with secondi. Servers hovered about just waiting to grab our plates and sometimes putting a hand on them before we finished.  It ruined the experience.  Diners next to us experienced the same race.  They won't be back and neither will we.
