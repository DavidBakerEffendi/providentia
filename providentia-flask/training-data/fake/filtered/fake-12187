Unique dining experience. Different than regular sushi, but still very good. The drinks are fun and delicious. On the pricy side, but worth it! Servers are nice but always VERY slow. My suggestion is to order drink, appetizer and dinner when the waiter first greets you. Also, you may have to ask for water, often. As long as you order quick your experience will be great!
