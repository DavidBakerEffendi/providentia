My wife and I recently went to the Montville Inn, but this was not our first visit. We went a few years ago when the original chef was working and the food was a disappointment, and the prices were outrageous. Our friends referred us again to the Montville Inn assuring us that under a new chef and new management, the place had made improvements. We figured why not try it. Although the service was good, and the food had made a bit of improvement, the price of the food increased. It cost me almost $80.00 for an appetizer, two salads, and two chicken entrees( this is not Â including drinks or the tip). I wouldn't have minded paying that money if the food was exceptional, but it was nothing special. So if you're in the mood for overly expensive, mediocre food, while sitting too close to the table next to you, I HIGHLY suggest the montville inn. But if you enjoy good food at a reasonable price, I suggest you take your business and your hard earned money elsewhere.
