I have lived in Claremont for 8 years & have tried all the Chinese restaurants here. The Crown Garden is the best & has the most reasonable prices. It is not a buffet restaurant but the portions are very generous, even for the $4.50 lunch combo & a pot of tea is included. Dinners are even more generous...I can only eat half. The tasty vegetable soup is a hot clear broth with freshly blanched vegetables. There are lots of appetizers to choose from. Mixed drinks are available. Take out orders are fast & very popular. Service is average. The family owners work very hard to satisfy your needs & keep you coming back. The Chinese cousine has been around for thousands of years...I think they have it worked out just right...it's simply delicious.
