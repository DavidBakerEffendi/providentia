In followup to Jan T below regarding band startup times: I just called to try to pin them down on a startup time, was extremely persistant yet kind to the employee I spoke to, and learned that they are absolutely forbidden, and resistant, to putting out that information.  The message is" we don't know anything, we cannot tell you if there are any opening acts, we don't want to give you any helpful clue whether the act you want to see will be on stage before midnight on a worknight, because, frankly, we'd like all of you to show up at 8 pm when we list the starting time so you will spend money on drinks and food all night"  This is a SHITTY ATTITUDE and UNJUSTIFIABLE in light of the fact that a fairly hefty cover charge exists.  Why not just f--'in helping out your customer a little with information that you obviously possess?  Why all the secretism?  As if you didn't negotiate a start time with your band?  I play in a band and know damned well that DOES NOT HAPPEN.   They need to cut the Bullshit and just be honest.
