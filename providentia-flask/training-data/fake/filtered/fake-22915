Amazing! Me and my friend walked in for a drink..  The place was cozy and welcoming. We decided to get few little things.. The food is outstanding here.. We had the hummus with wild mushrooms, shrimp, spicy feta dip, chopped salad, homemade falafel, We were just keep ordering .. it was that good.!!!!!!!!!! And the bread ...!!!!!!  I have never had something better than this bread.. its made by order and it comes with the dips.. The bartender suggested to try a different bread with feta that i forgot the name with was Delicious .. This was the best meal i have had in a really long time and i will be differently coming back.. Give it a try you will not be disappointed .. Did i mention the bread ?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
