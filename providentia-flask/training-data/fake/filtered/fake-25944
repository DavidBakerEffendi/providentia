Not only would I not recommend this restaurant to a friend, but I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. The service was abysmal. We waited more than 10 minutes to be seated (we had a reservation and were on time) at the hostess station, another 10 to receive menus and a waitress, who told us she "should have come earlier" because they ran out of pastry baskets as appetizers. In addition, every time she came to serve us, which was only two or three times, she served the two men at the table before the woman -- and repeatedly reached over me to refill the table's water glasses. My mimosa came only when we complained to the manager our experience wasn't the best. But don't dare do that because the experience went downhill FAST and we were literally stared-down by the ENTIRE wait staff and kitchen staff as we left the restaurant. You've been warned!
