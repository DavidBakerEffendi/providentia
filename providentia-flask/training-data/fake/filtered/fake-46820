Wonderful food and great service but a couple things need improvement. When the place is packed (which it often is) it's super loud in the dining room. I think some acoustic treatment on the ceiling would help substantially. They also play their music a little too loudly as well. While I've enjoyed my food both times I've been there I had trouble conversing with my wife who was just a couple of feet away. The second issue is they allow people to smoke at the outside tables and out front on the sidewalk. There were several idiots smoking out there last time I went and the smoke was drifting right in. The manager needs to keep on top of this sort of thing.
