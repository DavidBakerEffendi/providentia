I have been going to this restaurant for the past couple of years! The food is great, service is good but the folks at the check-in are Racist! Every time I go there or am compelled to go there, the racist courtesy of the front desk folks leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. For my fellow Indians who want to experience Racism in modern day America should visit Jose Tejas! Whether you complain to the management which I did to "Tyler " the manager who didn't give a damn! Afterwards spoke to another manager "Charles Hunter" who promised to enquire. I highly doubt any improvement Â  Every time I feel that by raising my voice, I can improve the attitude! Hypocrisy of the folks working there but I am sadly mistaken. My last visit to Jose Tejas left a very bitter taste in my mouth which I had hoped would not be the case.
