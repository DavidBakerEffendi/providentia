My hubby and I went for lunch today after reading many positive reviews on this site.  Started with the tom yum goong (shrimp soup) and loved it; it was among the best I've had, just the right amount of spice and sourness.   Unfortunately, things went downhill from there.  I ordered the lunch combination #7 with the pad thai, ginger chicken, and spring rolls.  The rolls were okay.  The ginger chicken had no flavor besides the ginger, and the chicken was very dry and rubbery.  The only redeeming feature was the fresh vegetables.   The absolute worst part was the pad thai.  Upon first sight, I could tell I was given the bottom of the barrel!  The noodles were translucent and super short.  On top of that, there were a few dry clumps of pad thai that must have been reheated over and over.  I was happy to find a shrimp on the bottom of the pile, but regretted eating it because it was even drier than the pad thai clump. I don't know who I'm more upset with--the cook for putting the pad thai on the plate, the server for allowing it to leave the kitchen and for serving it to me, or myself for eating my plate clean!  (Did I mention that I was super hungry, and I was cold and wet from getting caught in a storm?) Needless to say, I'm never going back.  Personally, I'm offended that Thai Taste had the audacity to serve this kind of pad thai; my guess is that they've done this before and gotten away with it.
