Stash's played a big role in my life.  Went to junior high a few blocks away, and maybe it was walking passed The Soprano's film shoots on the way, but Stash's seemed like a magical place where you wanted to belong.  My best friend Jake and I would regularly go with the hope that Stash would remember our orders.  I was a ham, american cheese, lettuce, and mayo guy.  You'd grab a Clinton Ice Tea and sit at the table under a decades old poster of Tony Meola, signed I think. If Kearny has a culture, Stash's is where you can find it.
