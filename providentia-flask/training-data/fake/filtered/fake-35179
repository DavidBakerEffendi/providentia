Based on the high reviews of this deli, I thought I would go check it out and get some of that prosciutto de parma as a nice snack with cheese and Dom's Hoboken Baguette I had purchase at the farmer's market. With everything I had being of great quality, the one that totally ruined my taste bud was the hideous looking of the prosciutto I purchased from Michael's Salumeria. It was dark looking, thick, and salty even though I was told this was cut paper thin. Really?? And you call yourself a "Salumeria" I had my share of great Italian Salumeria with one my favorite being "Salumeria Rosi" in New York. I wouldn't compare the two but if you can even provide decent looking and paper thin prosciutto then you are not worth the name "Salumeria". Sorry, but I really tried to like this one since it is much closer to me but it was a very disappointing experience.
