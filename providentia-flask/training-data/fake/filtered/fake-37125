A friend who had an Italian boyfriend recommend this place to us and we tried it once and we have been hooked since.  This is a traditional Italian restaurant, in the middle of Newark, NJ but dont let that discourage you.  They have parking lot so your car will be safe.  The food is always fresh and authentic.  You may have to wait little but keep in mind that everything is prepared at that moment.  You will not be disappointed.  Have the calamari as a starters, its always amazing.
