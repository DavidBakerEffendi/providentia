I used to go here regularly. The food is pretty decent as New Haven sushi goes, and there's some good Korean fare on the menu, but after a recent comedy of errors I doubt I'll return. The food took forever to arrive, pretty typical here. The waiter apologized and said the food was coming soon, and it still took a long while. One friend was served an incorrect roll...the waiter argued with him about what he'd ordered before getting the kitchen to make the correct roll a few minutes later. The waiter realized he placed my order wrong (or not at all?), and after checking with me 3-4 times (over one minute) to be sure he had it right, he either didn't or couldn't move it to the top of the line and it took over 20 minutes for two simple rolls to arrive while my group of friends sat waiting. We always use the student discount but we were told that because the academic year had ended earlier that afternoon, the discount was gone until the fall, which we'd never heard about. We asked to talk to the manager about all these problems and the waiter said the manager wouldn't talk with us because her English is poor. I don't think I've EVER had a manager who was unwilling to come to the table. Isn't that the manager's job? She eventually came over to talk to us, after much persistence. After offering free desserts we didn't want (we'd been there 2+ hours) and a bottle of wine (very few of us were drinking), she asked us how we thought the restaurant should address these issues. We suggested taking off the items that took so long to arrive, which she did. We all thought it felt absurd to have to argue for Â what many places would graciously offer. I was so underwhelmed with how this place fixes problems. I don't see any reason to give them my business in the future.
