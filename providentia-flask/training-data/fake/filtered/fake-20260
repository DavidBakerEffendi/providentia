Not really sure what Ramona is talking about. I lived a few blocks away form the place for half a year. The service is familial and the staff knowledgeable. Music comes in the form of ipod, jukebox and vocal locals belting out 80's tunes. There is an ample supply of readily available activities from drinking, pool, darts, video games to board games (Jinga is the best). Place is owned by Texans, so beware of the occasional country song here and there. Cheap drinks and ability to buy drinks for friends (on chalk board) is a splendid feature. Off the beaten track this is one of Williamsburgs best kept secrets. If you want Â a great local hangout than venture over to the Levee for a good time.
