I stopped by Country Girl Cafe over the weekend for my initiation into their delights.  I had the savory pancake that had cheese, scallions and ham for $4.95.  Put a little butter on that baby, a touch of local maple syrup and Wowza!  The bottom of the pancake was slightly crispy with the cheese settling to the bottom layer of the pancake. The top showed off the scallions and ham.  I don't think it took me 5 minutes to eat and I can't wait to go back.  They're now offering dinners on Friday evenings.  Wonderful food, friendly and efficient waitstaff and in charming Chester, VT!
