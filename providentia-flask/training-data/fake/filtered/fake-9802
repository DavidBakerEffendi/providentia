We received a very warm greeting upon walking in. Service was friendly and attentive. I had the Hummus wrap and it was really good. The curly fries were also yummy. My boyfriend ordered the Texas BBQ burger. We couldn't believe the size of it! He loved it. The desserts were very tempting, but we were too full. Next time I'll make sure to leave some room to try them. Overall we had a great experience. The new owners have greatly improved the diner. We already look forward to going back.
