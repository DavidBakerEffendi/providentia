5 star...as good as it gets. the stars are for the crab/pork soup dumplings. frequent visitors to NYC, we love to try new places, and there are so many options.  next visit (next week), we're going back. We were lucky enough to sit at a table with two sets of Chinese-speaking patrons, who advised "crab/pork soup dumplings" and showed us how to eat them.  Truly fantastic and unique flavor. we (the two of us) ended up cancelling what we had ordered and replaced with a second serving.   Crazy but not chaotic, memorable, the shared table perfect place to get recommendations and help. Can't wait to return.
