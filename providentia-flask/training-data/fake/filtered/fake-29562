Hated it so much. Still trying to get the nasty mac and cheese out of my mind. I am from the south and I know southern comfort food. It's not hard to fuck up mac and cheese and boy did they do tI. And that was not friend chicken. You can use shake and bake at home and do a better job plus save money. I feel like if you want mac and cheese stay home and make it yourself. Also don't order the bland fries. I will say at least the delivery girl was nice. Will NEVER ORDER AGAIN. PEOPLE GIVE IT NO MORE THAN ONE STAR I WENT OUT AND GAVE MY FOOD TO Â A HOMELESS MAN..........I FIGURED BETTER HIM THAN ME.
