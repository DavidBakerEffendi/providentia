Burger was just OK, so for the price it was definitely not worth it. More disturbing was that this was a business luncheon and I used my corporate card and this is another sneaky place that just assumes you don't check your corporate credit card that closely.  They only stole an extra 50 cents from what I authorized on the printed receipt I took. But stealing is stealing right?  50c or $50...I wouldn't go back there or recommend it to anyone as a result.
