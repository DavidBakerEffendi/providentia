Having lived in the neighborhood for awhile now I must have eaten here about a dozen times. If the stars were based on getting a table for dinner I would adjust but having just eaten recently, I have to say the food is always delicious, and can always say have walked out being satisfied. Taking credit cards finally is an added bonus too!
