I absolutely love this place! We don't get to go often because it's so far but I'll travel for them! Their seafood is always so fresh and delicious. Every time I go usually have the seafood salad, which is octopus,calamari,shrimp lightly seasoned and it never disappoints! The Lobster Fra Diablo is another one of my favorites! Their staff is also very friendly. We had a young girl take care of us last time, I think I remember her name being Leslie. Well, she was so sweet and professional that my husband and I had an amazing time on our date and everytime we go back we ask for her! Check this place out if you haven't already!
