I tried this place once and will never go back again.  The cheesesteaks are overpriced and mediocre at best.  You can get a better cheesesteak, plus a can of soda and chips, for $5 from any street vendor, while Geno's charges $7 for just the sandwich.  Plus, there is very little meat on the sandwich and it is not that flavorful. Price and mediocrity aside, the owner is obviously a major jerk.  "Order in English" signs are all over the place, and he actually sells T-shirts that say it, too.  Now, keep in mind that Geno's is a MAJOR tourist attraction.  Tour buses routinely stop there because it is such a legendary place (don't ask me why.)  Many of these tourists are visiting from other countries and probably do not speak English very well, if at all.  Anyone who goes out of his way to make a major portion of his customer base feel unwelcome certainly does not deserve to be patronized and raised to iconic status, especially when his food sucks. Finally, I agree that those who immigrate to this country should learn to speak English.  However, I am also aware that learning a new language, especially a difficult one like English, takes a bit of time.  I am sure that even the great Joe Vento's parents took at least a year to become reasonably conversant.     If he seriously wanted people to learn to speak English, he would take down the "order in English" signs and instead post signs advertising the local English language instruction center - you know, signs that actually inform people where to go to learn English instead of simply demanding that they do so.
