The presentation of the food is spot on; nevertheless you are paying for the ambiance and hype, not the food.  I would not return unless someone else was footing the bill.  Our service was perfect.  Portions are small.  The "legendary" guacamole was small for $13- and no better than I have made at home.  The shrimp ceviche only had 3 shrimp and tasted like the jicama sat too long in the marinade.  While it is subjective to some degree, I found the truffle oil and huitlacoche so strong that one of my crab tacos was inedible.  I recommend the pulled pork tacos and sea bass tacos!  Margaritas were fine, but nothing special, and small.  It is outrageously loud and crowded.  Do not go there if you want to talk and if you mind loud drunk folks crowding your table.
