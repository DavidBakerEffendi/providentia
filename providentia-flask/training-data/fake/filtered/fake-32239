I am a huge supporter of local owned restaurants. HOWEVER, IT NEVER fails that I entice my co-worker to order lunch from here they tell me 15 minutes at 1pm... she is still there at 1:44pm and all they say is "sorry we are backed up". This is extremely frustrating because it has happened a couple of times. I have not ordered take out from them inthe past 2 months because of this problem and apparently it has still not changed. I will take my business else where! THANKS but NO THANKS!
