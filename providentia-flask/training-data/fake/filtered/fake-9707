Been trying to shop here since they opened up. I say trying since I spend most of my time waiting for service in the deli and meat department. Attitudes of the employees behind the deli and meat counter is terrible. Stood at the deli counter for 5 minutes, only one person behind the counter, and I was the only one standing there. It took me that long to finally get the guys attention. I was served with a big dish of attitude. Told the manager, said he would look into it. Went back last night and lo and behold that "happy" employee was still behind the deli counter, this time talking away to another employee while 3 people waited to get help. Same with the meat counter. One employee helping 3 people at the seafood while 2 people had to wait for help at the meat counter. Whole Foods, I'm on my way back!!! Management needs to be updated.
