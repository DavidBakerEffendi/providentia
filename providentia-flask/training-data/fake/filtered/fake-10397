The Mojitos are delicious and the ambience is sensual, and fun. after 4 Mojitos left there feeling fabulous. I would have stayed if i was dressed for friday night. The portions are so tiny, but delicious. they make up for it in the cocktails. Good LAtino music which we enjoyed. True to its culture. Just needs bigger portions and it'll get 5 stars
