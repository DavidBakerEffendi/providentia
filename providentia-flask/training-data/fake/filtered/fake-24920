I absolutely love this place. I'm personally a vegan and this place food-wise is just amazing. Instead of using soy, tempeh, or seitan for their "meats," Positivitea uses both black beans and chickpeas. The burgers are made with the black bean patties, while the wraps are made with the chickpea patties. Positivitea is nice enough to let you switch them up if you want though! The chickpea patty is also gluten-free, and they can prepare your entire wrap gluten-free as well. Food: If it's your first time eating here, definitely go for the Big Bean (what was once known as the "Big Wac"). It is a double-decker, black bean burger that comes with a side of either kale, or tortilla chips. The green sauce (ahi sauce) for the chips is to-die for! If you are gluten-intolerant, but still want to try the Big Bean, I suggest asking for it in a wrap! It's still delicious! Drinks: Positivitea has an assortment of different teas ranging from pina colada to berry blast to regular black teas such as earl grey or even masala chai. All of these are great. You can ask for them to be iced, or hot. Aside from the tea, they also make awesome smoothies! If you're looking for a quick energy boost, go with the I am Incredible. If you're looking for something fruity, go with the I am Positive, the I am Happy, or the I am Berry Radient. All of these are fantastic and delicious! Desserts: As a vegan, it is often times difficult to find a good ice cream. I have tried various other vegan restaurants with ice cream, I have tried coconut ice cream from Trader Joe's, and even soy and rice ice cream from Whole Foods, but nothing tastes better than Positivitea's ice cream. Holy crap! It's made primarily from tapioca powder with a little bit of soy, sugar, etc, but oh my gosh, it is PERFECTION! They also make the ice cream into milkshake form, which is my absolute favorite! If you're hardcore into cookies like I am, go with the Cookies n' Cream milkshake- you won't regret it!!
