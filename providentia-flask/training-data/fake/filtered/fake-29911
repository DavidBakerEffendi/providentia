Beware this place is "Cash Only" and no I'm not going to use your ATM with the huge fee to buy a sub. Get a friggin credit card machine. Oh they don't even have a soda fountain so you have to buy bottled soda. The pizza tastes horrible and with so many other places to go for lunch I won't be back. I don't know how places like this even stay in business!
