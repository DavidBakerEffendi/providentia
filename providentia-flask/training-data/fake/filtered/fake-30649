Just stopped by with my wife last night and ordered the Forbes Waggensense (pepperoni). It was PACKED! (Friday night), but our pizza still came out Â fast (bout 15 minute wait) which was pretty impressive considering the massive throngs of hungry customers they were navigating. We ate it at home, and I must say it was the best pepperoni pie I've had in my life. Favorite part: the sauce. I always get bummed out when parlors under-sauce their pies. This was certainly not the case with my Forbes. Just the right amount of fresh, crisp, garlicky tomato goodness to cut the saltiness from the pepperonis and pull the other ingredients into balance. We ordered a large pizza, and between the two of us, we could only eat half. I just had a slice cold for breakfast and it was just as satisfying... so much so that I thought it worthy of updating my review to sing its praises. I'm already looking forward to lunch. Well played, pizza men.
