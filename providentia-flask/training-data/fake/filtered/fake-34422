Restaurant reviews are sketchy and a tad personal. I love this place. It's my birthday place and my mother's day place. The only criticism is that the ambiance leaves much to be desired. But you can have great ambiance and crappy food. It is the closest thing to the real deal. Many complaints come from Hispanic/Latin customers who are as picky about Mexican food as Italians are about Italian food. Nothing is as good as "mother use to make" or "the neighborhood cantina in Bahia Kino. Ignore the rubber tire smell, get yourself a straight up margharita and enjoy.
