We had not been to Porcini in quite awhile due to a move so my husband & I were looking forward to trying their food again.  We stopped in at 6:30 before a theater performance.  There were 3 open tables.  The maître d' rudely asked what we wanted.  We asked for a table so we good get a couple of appetizers before curtain.  He refused us.  He said, "No.  We are a full-service restaurant."   So we walked down the street to Il Pittore where we had a glass of wine & appetizers.  The attitude was friendly & welcoming.  The complete opposite of Porcini.  So thank you, rude guy.  If not for you, we would have missed out on delicious food with knowledgeable friendly staff.
