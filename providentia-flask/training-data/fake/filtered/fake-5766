We went here for lunch in Valentines weekend. The place was super cozy! From our table we could see the snow falling in little Italy and the Main Street. Really nice. Service was incredible. Italian Americans serving the place, and an authentic Italian place to dine. The food was also a surprise because for the price, it was really good and tasty. We will be surely going back and recommend it to anyone wanting to have an excellent Italian meal while not spending too much.
