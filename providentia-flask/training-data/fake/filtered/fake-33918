Enjoyed an outstanding meal on a quiet Monday evening.  We ordered immediately but it seemed like we waited a long time before we actually ate anything. No bread basket but wine and an amuse bouche (lightly fried zucchini blossom) kept us content. Also, from my seat, I could see the chef meticulously prepare each dish. It clearly would take awhile to get served but it was obvious it would be worth the extra wait.  Everything was delicious and prepared with imagination and a beautiful presentation. The smoked eggplant soup with a frothy goat cheese topping - a good way to warm you up on a chilly autumn night.  My husband's veal chop - perfectly cooked and more than an ample portion.  My bronzino served in a cast iron skillet was flaky, spicy, gorgeous and enough for one dinner and a few lunches.  The entrees came with generous side orders (but a tad salty). We had fingerling potatoes and the zucchini/carrot hay.  The piece de resistance was the "DIRT" dessert - a sampling of  mousse layered in 3 narrow glasses with chocolate carmel, pumpkin and red velvet cake in a wonderful powdery, cookie like texture.  A nice closing touch was the free Irish cream. The chef was so personable and even let me taste the risotto. One more great touch - even the server had a beautiful voice when she sang "Happy Birthday" to one of the customers. MS in Montclair
