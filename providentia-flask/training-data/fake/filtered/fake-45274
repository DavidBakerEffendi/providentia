We went for lunch and sat on the deck. The view was beautiful and the service was attentive. The food on the other hand was another story. The tomato bisque had no flavor. My wife had the chicken quesadillas which again had no flavor, other then a burned chicken taste. I had a lobster sandwich, the lobster was okay but the sandwich was bland and the fries tasted like they had been sitting around a long while. If the food had been better the prices would have been okay.
