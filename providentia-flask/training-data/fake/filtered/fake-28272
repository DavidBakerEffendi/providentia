Yes, the portions are enormous and almost everyone takes lots home.......Yes, there is always a wait. We waited an hour and fifteen minutes for a table for two at 5:30 on a Saturday night. Yes, they offer free house wine to those who are waiting.....and yes the meal concludes with a bonus, custard desert. As for the food....it was average at best. The half a loaf of crispy, warm Italian bread was sopping in oil.....The peasant salad was OK but nothing extraordinary.....The fried calamari was chewy and the chicken kebab was overcooked and charred.The lemon potatoes were horrible........Would we ever return again.......absolutely not.
