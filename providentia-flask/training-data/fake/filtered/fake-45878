This place was a huge disappointment. I took my husband here for his birthday dinner, and it was so bad we had to redo his dinner somewhere else. First off, the service was VERY slow. Yes, the place was busy, but there were at least three waiters and one busboy in a dining room with ten tables. I've worked in restaurants and tend to be forgiving of service, but it shouldn't take 20 minutes for a cup of coffee to arrive. As for the food--our starters were ok, but my husband's dinner was absolutely abysmal. The lamb was horribly overcooked, and the beans it was served with tasted like plastic. He looked so disappointed I felt awful, since I had encouraged him to try this place after a writer I know talked it up. I encouraged him to send the dish back, but he was reluctant to do so, so he ate what he could. My other beef with this place is the prices and the ambiance don't match. If you're going to charge double digits for a salad or dessert, there shouldn't be paper covering the table. I wish they'd either choose to be a deli or be a nice restaurant and be done with it. If they were to choose the latter, they have some serious work to do.
