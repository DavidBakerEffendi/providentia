I would rate Yama six stars if Yelp would let me. Everytime I come here, they never fail to impress me. I've tried all kinds of things from their menu, and I'm never left disappointed. In addition to generous portions, the service is wonderful, and you get free starters (you have no choice in what they give you, but everything is fantastic). The sushi is VERY fresh and always perfectly rolled (my favorite is the spicy tekka maki) and every dish arrives promptly after being prepared (i.e. piping hot!). My boyfriend usually orders one of the tempura meals, and says its THE BEST restaurant tempura he's ever had (and he's had tempura prepared by a Japanese national). I care rarely pronounce the names of the dishes, so let's just say I order #55 on the menu. It's a nice, saucy, spicy chicken dish. They give sooooo much, with little slices of carrot cut into stars. I'm always full when I leave. My favorite menu item, though, is only available from noon to 3pm. The spicy ramyun soup is a lunch only item, though it's so incredible that I wish it were available all day! Yama is far and away my favorite restaurant in Lebanon. I'd eat here every day if I could. The prices are also stunningly low for the quantities and the quality that they give you. Each meal costs between $8-$15. But trust me, you'll get A LOT of food for your money! There are also no dessert options, they give you fresh, seasonal fruit instead. Which is cute.
