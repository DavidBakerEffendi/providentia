With unassuming facade, I didn't have high expectations but menu items had caught my eye.   All in all, I was glad I ate where I ate when I ate.  Being alone and in town overnight on business, the bar seating sufficed, although my experience would likely have been 5 star had the bartender gone home for the night and the bar back covered the shift.   What had caught my eye was the walleye.  Having grown up in the great lakes area, it was a common plate but having moved much further west, it is a rareity to come across in fine dining establishments I visit in my locale these days.   The fish was perfectly cooked, with the accompanying ingredients/sauces providing great balance - compliments to the chef.  For my other plate, I chose the foie parfait.  I love to see foie gras on any menu, and while it's tough for me to get excited about cool foie gras/torchons/etc., the parfait was above average.   A.kitchen has a good location, tasteful menu, and relatively good service (bartender aside - no surprise to see the other raters speak of lackluster service - perhaps time for new front of house manager?).  Despite the service, I would recommend giving it a try - seemed to be a perfect spot for light apps after work if you live/work in the neighborhood.
