Don't order wine! It was the smallest pour I have ever had.  Sipped about 1\3 and realized there was approximately 2 table spoons of slug in the bottom of my very short pour. So I ask the waitress if I could have another. She took it to the bartender who poured me another glass  exactly the level that was in the glass I returned. I have had larger pours at a wine tasting. I mean really for 10.00 I had a wine tasting and it was cheap wine, wouldn't  it be better to have a happy customer.
