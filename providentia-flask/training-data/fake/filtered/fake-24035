I had a private party in the Whiskey Room at Woodrow's.  The service and food were exceptional.  We ordered a bunch of finger food that was passed around and everything was delicious.  Very upscale of what you'd expect from a pub.  There were very accomodating to any requests as well. Also, the beer and whiskey selection is quite extensive.  Definitely a great place to hang out with friends or have a get together.
