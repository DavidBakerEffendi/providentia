Service was excellent.  Atmosphere was very nice.  As others have noted, if you want authentic Chinese, ask for their "secret" menu.  I had their Crab Meat and Fish Maw soup (delicious) and Dry Pot Style Beef (which is also on the regular menu, spicy - yum!)  I'm very happy some real Chinese food is available in Lawrenceville.
