Great place, great atmosphere. I went to this place on it's opening night and waited for a solid hour in line for the twelve-person ramen bar to free up so I can stuff my face. When I was in line, I overheard a lot of those who just finished their meal comment on how wonderful the meal was. I ordered two bowls of ramen: the chicken totto ramen and the spicy totto ramen. Both were amazing. The chicken broth was just right and the noodles were perfect: cooked to the right degree of chewiness. In short, I felt as though I was in Tokyo stuffing my face with delicious ramen. Staff was great too. Highly reccommended. 5/5!
