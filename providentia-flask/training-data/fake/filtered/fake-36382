Food was AMAZING! My cousin took me and husband here while we were visiting NYC and it did not disappoint.  Even the bread basket was delish!  There is a roll with salami or some kind of meat and cheese in it. Divine!  We started off with the polenta. Omg! So creamy and cheesy! I think I could eat a whole tub of it. For our entrees we got the spaghetti and the duck and foie gras ravioli.  Seriously, the best pastas I have ever eaten hands down.  We literally licked our plates clean. Definitely would recommend this restaurant to anyone who lives/visits NYC.
