I don't know about their food, but their service could use a total overhaul. They said that they deliver, but they would not (not could not... they Would Not) deliver to my house which is less than 4 miles away. Word of mouth travels quick and unfortunately for them, they lost not only personal business, but also a huge opportunity to have business from a local corporate company - on a weekly basis. I am in charge of finding the best pizzeria in the area for our weekly Friday "pizza days" and they definitely will not be it. Thanks Red Moon Pizza!
