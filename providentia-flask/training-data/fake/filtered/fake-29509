I have lived in the South for nearly 15 years, so believe me when I say that Amy Ruth's food is not only authentic, but some of the best that I have ever had. I had The Rev. Al Sharpton fried. The chicken was very crispy and the waffle very light and airy. Perfect. For a place in New York, their prices are reasonable. Someone else mentioned the sweet tea being extremely sweet. That is true, but that is how sweet tea is supposed to be (at least in the South). I also dilute mine too. The service was friendly, but a tad bit slow (the restaurant was NOT busy at this time). That is my only real complaint. I did order the banana pudding, which was awful. They used store-bough banana pudding (you should always make a vanilla custard), which tasted like banana-flavored Laffy Taffy. This is not how banana pudding is supposed to be made. Overall, great place. I would go there again.
