BEYOND TERRIBLE SERVICE... JUST EXTREMELY RUDE. I took my girlfriend here for her 24th birthday with all her friends expecting a good time.  From the second we sat down the waiter was extremely rude asking "what do yo want?" (this should have been a red flag for what was to come). We ordered drinks and he gave me the wrong beer.  When I asked him about it, he said "are you fucking serious?"  He then replaced the beer and slammed it on the table, I am not even exagerating this... its UNBELIEVABLE that you would pay to go to a restaurant and THIS HAPPENS.  This was the worst treatment I have EVER recieved as a customer, at this point we had to change our plans and go somewhere else as everyone felt extremely uncomfortable after this.  DO NOT VISIT THIS PLACE... BEWARE.
