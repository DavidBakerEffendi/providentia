I went on Sunday to blend on the water with my brother. I had a great time and we both loved the food . But best of all was the service I received as a customer. Syeda the host was the best because of her I would go back anytime !!! Even though Valet took. Forever but the host made me forget about it and I had one of the beat time Sunday night. I would go back to blend on the water anytime. The atmosphere was incredible including the service and the food.
