Found this place when searching online for gluten-free philly-style sandwiches on our way through town.  Wow, absolutely wonderful.  So personal and friendly...and the best sandwich I've ever had.  I can't wait to go back through Philly again.  I would suggest going during an off-hour (I hear it gets pretty busy)...we only waited behind one person and then had the place to ourselves.
