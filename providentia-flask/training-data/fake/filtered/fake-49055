Finally decided to check out Nikko's after hearing so many great things about it and I am so glad I did.  The environment is completely inviting whether you are on a date or just want to bring your family over for a great time while you are enjoying great sushi or hibachi.  The staff is extremely courteous and their chefs sure make your hibachi experience an exciting one.  My 3 year old daughter enjoys the whole show and loves hanging out at their wish fountain.  Their menu has a great variety and very balanced food combinations at a reasonable price.  I've been back 4 times since I first tried it a month ago and have made it a my favorite hibachi spot.   If you are looking for a good time while you eat great food definitely try this place!!!
