I have been going to this place for many years and I refer clients there as my business is in the neighborhood. I have probably sent hundreds of people there over the years. (I have been in SoHo for over 2 decades.) Yesterday as we were going in for the umpteenth time, I heard a lady outside refusing to go in because she felt they were rude and arrogant. I was quite surprised to hear this. We sat down and ordered but was told by an icy waiter that the salad I wanted couldn't have the asparagus it normally came with as they were out of asparagus. I said it wasn't a problem and asked for some extra avocado instead. Well...you would have thought I had asked for the world. He told me to find something else on the menu, pretty much refusing to take my order. I said I preferred the avo but he got snootier and snootier. We're talking about a $9 salad here folks...and so I asked for the manager. He sneered at me and told me it would take a long time to see the manager as he "was too busy" and so I got up to go to him myself but he "got to him" before I did and again was told there were no substitutions and if I didn't like it, I could eat somewhere else. Well we did...across the street at the ever fabulous Peep -- and let me say this, I will never eat at Il Corallo ever again, and nor will I refer the dozens of hungry tourists that seek our advice for an eatery in SoHo. Horrible, unfriendly service that doesn't deserve the loyalty of an old timer and all of his referrals.
