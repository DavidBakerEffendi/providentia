Waited almost two hours and wasn't hungry when we finally sat down. Apparently if your whole party isn't there at the same time, you can't sit down so we missed a whole round of seating. Maybe it was because I wasn't hungry by the time I sat down but I've had better pizza at Bertucci's. And watch out for the individual prices of the salads. My son asked the waitress what the little 3 was above one of the salads. She said, "that's a $3 charge for the feta cheese. My eyes were focused on the pizza cook's hat that was sitting on the oven above the opening. Bad experience and I'll never go back!
