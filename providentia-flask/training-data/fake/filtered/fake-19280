i live 5 minutes away from this restaurant, so expect me and my kids to be there almost every day! for starters, the price is great! it's only $5.99 on weekdays and $7.99 for weekend lunch. the Food was ok, theres not much selection but you know that all food was cooked fresh, and they dont let a tray stay empty. The only bad thing is, the waiters would come to your table to refill your soda once every 20 min. so expect our table to be filled with empty plates as well. The Lady in the front desk was rude too. We were coming there so often that one time, I brought all my 5 kids and she said to me as soon as we came in not to let my kids make a lot of mess coz its hard to clean out the carpet, "what the F#@%??? I knew from then on that it would be the last time I'd eat there. FUCK FUN BUFFET...I can go to other buffets that wont discriminate!
