Every time I go to Eataly, I never want to leave. I love the fresh food, the gelato is amazing. Prices are a bit high but you are getting top od the line food. Try Lidia's amazing marinara sauce that they sell in a bottle, you will never want to try another sauce again. The breads are super fresh. They have a fresh cream butter that it's simply to die for. Â It's pretty busy but if you are used to NYC you will be fine maneuvering around Eataly.
