Can't say anything bad about the food because was never seated. Was under the impression that having a reservation meant that you were to be seated when you walked in, not asked to wait because the people at your table weren't finished yet. Also very distressing as there were other tables available being filled by guests who arrived AFTER you. Didn't make sense complaining to the manager as he was the one who didn't seat us. Was very disappointed in the lack of customer service and respect, so we left.
