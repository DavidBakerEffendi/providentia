It's like having a second kitchen, where the food served is never the kind you would prepare yourself. The fare comes with a pleasant twist, with a conscious, and with care. It is no surprise, therefore, that the restaurant attracts an unusually large amount of regulars and following. Cheryl, Chef, is the owner, and her roots come from the Food Network. Hence, her menu competes with the best of New York, but with a home feel. Enter her house, and you will be treated like anyone else, and with the same purpose; to enjoy a great meal in a great atmosphere. My favorites include the Salmon Hash, French Toast and Pancakes. I don't think I've ever experienced a more fluffier pancake than Cheryl's pancakes. Dinner fare include her Tamarind Chicken. Also, all of their pastries are baked in house, including their homemade scones. The waitstaff is incredibly accessible, and there is a sense that they have a stake in the restaurant's success. Its a bit cliche, but it seems there is a lot of brotherly and sisterly love going on in there. You may walk into Cheryl's for a great meal, but you might walk out with a great book suggestion or a great Mickey Spillane story. And although, some of the staff appear incredibly malnourished, I am told, through hearsay, that they appear quite large, when seen outside, running, in shorts, and with their dog.
