I love the decor in Tuk Tuk, It really sets the mood - fresh, pleseant, elegant, Â casual, peaceful and modern. The food is always delightful and very reasonably priced. Lots of vegetarian options. Lots for everyone. I've taken a few different groups there and everyone has really enjoyed it - which in my experience is quite unusual!
