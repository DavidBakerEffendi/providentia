The pizza side is terrific - cannot think of one negative thing to say.  The restaurant side - well DO NOT go and sit at the bar.  The 4 X 4 woman (and I use this term lightly) is ANYTHING but a gracious host.   Talks like a truckdriver and gets around to you when it suits her.   We will definitely be back for the pizza but will NEVER go back to the restaurant side of the house.   Fire that woman - she is doing you NO FAVORS !!!
