I returned to Saveur Creole , after a long absence, for dinner with 3 friends one evening recently. I was very pleasantly Â surprised to find much improvement since my last visit. There are not many places in the Montclair area where one can sample Haitian cuisine and this one is very definitely worth trying. While the food was always interesting, the new chef is preparing tastier and more ample plates. The service used to be very disorganized and is now much more efficient. The host, Ron, is now and has always been a pleasure. Handsome, debonair, and suave. The soups we tried were all excellent, especially the Gumbo and the Black Bean. We shared an appetizer of the Conch Ceviche accompanied by Tostones. So good we wanted more! The Goat Stew was delicious as was the Chicken Creole. Can't wait to go back. Try it! you won't be sorry!
