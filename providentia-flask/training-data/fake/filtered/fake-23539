Came in with a group of nine and the waiter refused to seat us, for reasons as of yet not understood.  No waiting time or queue or anything.  Simply told we weren't going to be seated.  Something we did must have set them off, but we don't know what Were not able to see the manager.  Just a moody staff, apparently.  So, we couldn't taste the food, but I won't be returning.
