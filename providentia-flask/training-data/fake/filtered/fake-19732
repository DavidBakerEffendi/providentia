Work right next door, and frequent Peaches at least once a week. I highly recommend the Brunch Punch to drink, and either the Cobb salad, french toast, or turkey meatloaf to eat. Sweet potato fries and grits are great. I've never ordered anything that I haven't liked. My coworkers report the same experience.
