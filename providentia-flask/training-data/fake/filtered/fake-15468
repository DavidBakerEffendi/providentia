Stopped by last night with a few girlfriends before our Friday night romp about town. From the outside you wouldn't expect much, but the inside was super chic but still really comfy. We sat on the first floor, but I'm told that the upstairs is also pretty cool. Although I wouldn't pin this place as a burger joint, my burger was excellent - a perfect medium, still juicy and covered with blue cheese and bacon. My friends split a little bucket of sweet potato fries and bbq sliders and between the three of us I think we tried most of the (very solid!) draft list. Seriously hit the spot, especially before a night out and about. The service was great, not too pushy but still attentive. We'll be back for sure!
