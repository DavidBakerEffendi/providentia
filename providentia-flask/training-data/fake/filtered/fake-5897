We ve been here this night. With out any  pretension, i had the swordfish (nobody asked me the point), it was ok, the side salad with carrot was also ok. My girlfriend ate the vegetables and they were really good, the flatbread was very nice. Two disgustin observations, i was seating near the window and some water from the raín was giving me some lightly shower. The other was that another coatumer stole our umbrellas and the concierge said something ohh sorry somebody might have token because of the heavy rain, as if it s a common thing.
