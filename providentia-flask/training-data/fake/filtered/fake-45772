Panini's Trattoria is one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia.  The food and service is the best!  I love this restaurant.  Have had lunch and dinner here a few times and can't wait to go back.  I always feel like family and friends as soon as you walk in the door!  The food is outstanding!  Attended the Wine Festival on 8/17/11 and want to compliment the chef.  The 5 course meal was outstanding.  The argula salad was wonderful and the Tuna Tartar topped with fried Qual egg was excellent.  The main course was Filet Mignon topped with jumbo crab meat in a wonderful saurc.  The main course was the most tender Filet I have ever had in a restaurant in Philadelphia.  For Lunch - love the Paninis.  The chicken with roasted red peppers and provolone cheese is great! The Italian dipping oil is also the best!  The previous reviewers don't know good Italian Restaurants!  Jennifer, my waitress, is awesome.  She is the best.
