LOOOOVE LUZZO'S!! I have been going to Luzzo's for the best pizza since my Italian friend brought me here years ago. In the past four years, I have been here numerous times for birthdays, going away parties and just for fun. It's especially great for out-of-town visitors. The staff is friendly and fun, the pizza fresh and delicious! My fave is the Buffala pizza with extra garlic...droooool
