When you first walk in, the place looks dark and has a cold feel to it. After being seated, the waiter was very pleasant and knowledgable about the menu and recommended some of the specials on the menu and we took his advise. We were extremely happy with the flavors in the food and the amount that was served. If you do decide to visit this restaurant I highly recommend you start your meal with their own version of the Hummus, you will not regret it. To end your meal with a great dessert, you really should try their Bananas Foster, Yummy!!!!!!
