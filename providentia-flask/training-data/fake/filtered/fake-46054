love love Love... everything was great and delicious. waiter was so kind and helpful. i think that the Astoria has really really cool place after MP's grand opening.we have some great places which are cooking really good tasty food but unfortunately they are not fancy at all. I can't take my girlfriend for a dinner in Astoria( except the Italian restaurant on 31st street) but now i do. They have pretty good wine selection but still needs to improve.  appetizers are amazing especially octopus. it was the best octopus that i have ever had. I will go another time to get only some seafood and their Greek white wine. Thanks for everything...Those five stars for the food and my responsible waiter... other things will be okay  for a while I think because they just opened up the store that is why I am not judging them badly since we have so many disaster store around when I compare with them MP is doing great job.
