This place is absolutely HORRIBLE. I recently attended Cuban Pete's for my sisters birthday. There were 12 of us on a Friday night. We called earlier in the week and were told that they do not take reservations. Fine. We arrive at 8:15 and were told it would be a 2 hour wait. After waiting an hour and becoming relatively friendly with "Pete" he said to check back in 30 minutes. 30 minutes later he said our table was ready. I got my entire group together and by the time we got inside the restaurant he said there was a mistake and there was no table ready for us, to check back in 30 minutes. 30 minutes later, he said it would be at least another 40 minutes. After talking with my group, we decided we had had it (it was almost 11pm by that point) and decided to leave. I told pete and he could care less. As I turned around to leave, I figured I would give it one more shot. I asked, hey, will it really be 40 minutes or are you pulling my leg? He said that we were off the list and they just gave our table away!!! What table??? He said we had to wait another 40 minutes!!! As I turned around I saw they were seating another large party as we were speaking that had just arrived. My mom went in to complain and his only response was "YOU F***ING WHITE PEOPLE." I have never been treated so poorly by a restaurant manager in my life. He does not care if he has your business because there are a million people lining up to get in, and absolutely does not care how he treats his customers. STAY AWAY from this place. There are better restaurants in town. We walked over to Fresco at 11:15pm. They were happy to seat us, even that late, and the food was amazing.
