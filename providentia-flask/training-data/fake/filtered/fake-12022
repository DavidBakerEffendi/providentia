Went here for first time today. Things were slow as they are still working out some kinks with the opening (they ran out of squash and I had to wait), but the food was worth it! Sooo much more flavor than Chipolte or Qdoba and more vegetarian and 'toppings' options. I will definitely be back and hope to be able to upgrade my review. Would be great if they could do brown rice for the whole grain fans...
