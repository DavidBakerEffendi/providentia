The hostess is the rudest person in NYC. She got a dudes name wrong and he said ooh maybe you mean you kevin. She was like whatever that's you. She obviously can't read. Which is fine but don't be mad at me. My major issue is that she tried to fit me and my friend in between a group of people. Upon entering the restaurant where people are people are smoking at the door! She said with no greeting "how many" Â  The place is unorganized and the food is okay.
