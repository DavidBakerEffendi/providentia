It is average food with bad service. It is not children friendly restaurant even owner claims it is. Poor decoration. Chicken is very greasy. Would never go back. don't waste money for this restaurant. They are plenty of better restaurants in Chelsea area..for example,Trestle on 10th, Collichio and sons, Morimoto, and Bottino
