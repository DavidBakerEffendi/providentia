My family went to there last week. My daughter said us this restaurant is very popular one. Pizza is delicious but too salty to me. Â I don't like pizza frankly. But is was good time with my grand children. I think this restaurant is not good place with children. Because restaurant is small and a lots of seats. But we very enjoyed and my grand children very liked the pizza. I like mushroom pizza in this restaurant.
