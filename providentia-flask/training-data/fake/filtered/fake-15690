A caveat to my review. I've only ever sat at the bar, and never ordered a full dinner. That said, it is one of my favorite places to go, the bartenders are amazing, and they have a brilliant selection of drinks, try the Vesper with Barr Hill and Grey Goose, a complete treat and a great way to relax. My friends who've been with me have been shocked, we may not be the normal cliental, but hopefully I can bring more people interested in good drinks and a place you can actually sit, and have a conversation, a rarity in Vermont Bars it won't be so intimidating. Yes, you will be paying more than average, but the drinks you get will be stellar, the bartenders welcoming and fantastic, and to be honest, the best steak tartare I've had in town!
