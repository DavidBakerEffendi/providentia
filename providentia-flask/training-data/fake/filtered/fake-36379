Amazing. From the taste to the presentation. A great spot to take friends from out of town or anyone you want to impress! The spaghetti dish is definitely one of the best I've ever tasted- even including spaghetti in Italy! I came here for my birthday with a group of 4 girls and we were seated promptly and served amazing cocktails. (Mine was so good.. all I remember is that it had tiny strawberries in it along with champagne). Our waitress was so sweet.. she overheard us talking about my birthday and have us a complimentary dessert platter that said happy birthday! Go here, you will not regret it!
