I've been here for a pre-theater dinner (reservation was at 6:15, had to catch the show before 8:00). We were seated promptly and treated with some warm, crusty complimentary bread and butter. I ordered the Mista Salad (very good) and my mother ordered the Caesar Salad (decent). As for chicken dishes, I recommend the Chicken Trefunghi, which has a fantastic flavor and generous portion size! The Spaghetti Carbonara was really Â good too, but I kind of wish that they put a little more on your plate. Their desserts are especially tasty; try their Tiramisu or Cannoli! Our waiter tried his best to quickly pace our meal, but at times we had to remind him to check and see if our food was ready. We were kind of cutting it close when it came to making the show on time. The atmosphere feels like authentic Italian, especially when it came to the waiters and their hospitality. As for attire, try to aim for a dressy casual outfit. Overall, a really nice experience. Will be coming back soon!
