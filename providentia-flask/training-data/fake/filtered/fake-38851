Fabulous date place or foodie friend dinner spot....enjoyed the 5 course tasting menu and it was phenomenal!! Creativity of flavors and textures, presentation and overall experience would make this spot one of my new FAVORITES in NYC!!! Atmosphere, music and set-up were a delight as much as the food! I will make myself free any evening for someone that wants to go explore this hidden gem!!! ***not snobbish Foodies preferred! Enjoy Xx
