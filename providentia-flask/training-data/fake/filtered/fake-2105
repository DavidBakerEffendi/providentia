Northern Spy Food Co. is as good as it gets when it comes to a neighborhood staple. Luckily for me, I live two blocks away. While they don't have a full bar (beer/wine only) they always come up with delicious and innovative cocktails highlighting different aperitifs. You've all heard about the kale salad, and it really is that good -- try it with two poached eggs for an even bigger delight. But the rest of the menu is worth checking out, too. Exceptional vegetarian dishes alongside hearty meat plates really offer something for everyone. Do not miss the pork sticky buns -- something you never knew you wanted, but won't stop thinking about for a few weeks after you try them. The room itself is cute, but small. If you're over 6'2" you'll probably have trouble sitting in the two back booths. My 6'4" boyfriend couldn't fit in the tight space, and the staff didn't seem terribly pleased about re-seating us, but since there were tables open, they did (with a time limit). Other than that instance, I find the service to be very pleasant. I will definitely be back -- and soon.
