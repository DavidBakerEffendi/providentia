After reading some of the reviews on Yelp, I want to add my comments of what I consider the most comfortable Italian restaurant in New York On my first visit to Piacere,I felt I was in Tuscany @ a local restaurant where everybody knew each other and greeted you as an old friend, like an Italian Cheers, where everybody knows your name Lots of community tables so you can sit where you want, for the more intimate inclined, you can sit at an individual tables, although I like sitting outside looking at the Broome Street traffic, observing downtown life.   The owners, Marco (Tall) and Marco (short) are what makes this restaurant fantastic if you're lucky you might meet Amanda, the Brazilian wife of Marco S,who adds more glamour then one needs in a given day. I consider this the friendliest restaurant in the city The food and wine ... Excellent, I'm trying to work my way through the entire menu and still haven't found fault in any of the dishes I noticed someone mentioned they spent 3 hours over hors d'oeuvres and several  glasses of wine and questioned why no one paid attention to them, i guess they prefer a waiter hovering over them with the check, rather than a relaxing time at Piacere also said person, wondered why the ATM machine located in the bathroom? Why not? i must have bought 20 people here ,now i walk in and everyone knows my name, "Yves"
