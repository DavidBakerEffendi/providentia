I went to Grouchy Burger and did take out. I ordered the Pulled Pork with French Fries for two. Plus I ordered an order of onion rings. The Pulled Pork was dry, not enough sauce mixed into the meat. The onion rings were burnt. Unless I hear the have improved I won't be going back. I gave one star only because the French Fries were good.
