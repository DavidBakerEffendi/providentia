One of my favorite restaurants. GREAT food, great service. I recommend ordering a taster's menu. They will ask you how much you want to spend and chose various dishes for you. It is a great way to sample the menu especially if it is your first time. Also, the Tofu Salad is one of the best things that ever went into my mouth. There is a better ambiance when they are a bit slower. It can get crowded around prime days/times which makes the seating a bit awkward.
