I really can't bring myself to order Chinese food anywhere else. The chicken fried rice with pineapples and pan fried chicken dumplings are my mainstays. Homemade iced tea is also a must. The couple that owns the place is super friendly and even puts up with my boyfriend's corny jokes. They're VERY busy so bring your patience but you'll be rewarded.
