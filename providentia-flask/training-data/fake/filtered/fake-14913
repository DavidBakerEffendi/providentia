We loved it... We went on a Saturday night  had the nite to ourselves without the kids.  I say this because the wait for our table was long, so we hung out by the bar and talked and then finally we were seated.  The waitress was knoweledgable , attentive and friendly.  Individual pizzas were delish!!!!! would go back again.
