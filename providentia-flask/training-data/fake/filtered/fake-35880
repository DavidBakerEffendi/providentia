We have been regulars of Canal Street Grill for many years and have loved going there frequently. Recenlty they have changed their menu and their attitude! The owner, or manager, at the front desk was very rude when we asked about many of our favorites that were on the old menu and are now gone from the new menu. My wife ( On her Birthday) was told to shop at giant in the frozen food section if she wanted the Item that used to be on the menu. I was in SHOCK!! This is another buisness gone bad with the changes of ownership. Some people were just not cut out to own a happy and succesful buisness :( Â Needless to say, we will NEVER go to this restaurant again or recommend it to anyone. What happened to being nice to customer?
