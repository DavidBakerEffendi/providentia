Excuse me yuppie foodies who have posted on Pat's Yelp. This isn't fine dining, so adjust your expectations and enjoy the experience. Don't like being rushed at the window? Read the sign and be prepared. This was my first Philly cheesesteak. Got wiz and one w provolone. Wiz rocked. Much better compliment to the greasy onions. "wit and wiz" baby!
