This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in New York and that ain't an easy title to gain because if New York is good at anything it's fantastic restaurants and this place has really raised my expectations of other restaurants too. The atmosphere in the restaurant was great and the staff were tremendous, they were ever so friendly and helpful and it was nice to talk to them which really has made the whole experience of going to this particular restaurant so much better. The food there was fantastic too which is obviously a huge element of why the restaurant is great. There was plenty of options and we weren't waiting long for our meals either. I think it was something like 20 minutes, which is exceptionally fast compared to some restaurants so that was great. I would definitely go there again because it was a great restaurant with awesome service and delicious food.
