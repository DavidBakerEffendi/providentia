Was there for the first time last night. At first I thought the prices were high but after ordering an appetizer and my meals and then seeing the size of the portions they give you it was well worth the price. Food was very tasty and we were impressed with the free antipasti and Â free fruit tray after our meal. Can not wait to go back. Except for the classless people that were sitting next to us that we're very loud,drunk and vulgar would recommend this place to anyone.
