Food is good and the staff is very friendly my only problem is with the female who runs the front end. I would like to see her stay behind the desk all night because she is VERY RUDE and is not good with people. I thought It was only me that felt that way about her until some of my neighbors said the same about her and now I see some of these reviews and now I can see it's not only me.She sticks her face at your table as soon as you sit down and wants your order as soon as you get in the door. We were coming here at lest 2 or 3 times a month but we now go to Thai Essence in nutley where the food is very good and your not rushed out in 40 minutes.
