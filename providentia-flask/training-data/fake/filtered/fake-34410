I had two large gatherings at Supper and each time me and my friends were treated like kings. We had about 15 people for each celebrating dinner and they went above and beyond to help us out. We originally were told we would have to do Price Fix but when we got there they said they could make us anything that we wanted. Also, got to do unlimited wine and beer which was amazing. Each of us ended up shelling out about $100 a piece but it was well worth it. We even got to play our own music from my iPod so it was pretty cool.
