I'd been wanting to try Ancora as I understood it to be a long-time downtown establishment which moved to the hotel across the street after Hurricane Sandy. Unfortunately the food was just as bad as one would expect from a Doubletree hotel. Wilted salad with commercial dressing, bland pasta with "pomodorini" (but only a shred of tomato), overcooked fish with an unripe tomato slice and none of the accompanying vegetables described--and this is just the food. Â The waiter treated us like we were completely ignorant (perhaps he thought we were tourists) and spent ten minutes describing "specials" that just turned out to be the menu. (We had to ask for a menu, ask to place our order, and ask where the food was--it was 45 minutes before we saw a salad, and this was lunchtime! There are so many staff but it's not clear what any of them are doing.) When the waiter asked (or rather told us) whether we liked the food we could not lie, at which point the owner came out and offered us more food, free wine, dessert and coffee. For this I add one star, but I will never return!
