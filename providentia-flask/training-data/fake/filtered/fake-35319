BEWARE!!  Unlike every other place in Manhattan, this one will not allow you to pay for it when it arrives at your door.  You MUST pay for it with a credit card online before they will deliver it.  No matter how good your food is, we'll never know because I refuse to be indebted to creditors.  What kind of an idiotic place advertises delivery in a city like this, but puts unexpected walls up.  Not a place I want to do business with.  Screw them.
