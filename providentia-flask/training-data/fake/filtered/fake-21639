I have been to Kamal Palace many times over the last two years and it is one of my favorite Indian places in the area, especially because I live five minutes away.  The food is always fresh and aromatic.  My favorite is the Chicken or Lamb Kadhai- such a wonderful sweet pepper and curry aroma. You can order as mild or spicy as you want, but the food is authentic, aromatic and Indian! The naan and other breads are fresh and fantastic. The wait staff is very friendly and efficient.  Best of all is that my clothes smell like Indian spices when I leave- that means quality!
