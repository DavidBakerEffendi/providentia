Disgusting!!! Im surprised this place hasnt shut down already... The food is not fresh its all pre made and frozen!! the owner allows frost bitten food to be served to customers!! Food is almost spoiled and still used!!! Food is dropped on the floor but still used !!He doesnt pay employees ..He is a cheap criminal !!!!!! yeah google his name... JOHN MELCHIONNA!! he was convicted of fraud twice ...and only hires fellow Â criminals!!!! Read the other reviews this place is disgusting and if you chose to still order if they get it wrong and you call and are unlucky to get him on the phone he will argue and belittle you into believing you are in the wrong and still not replace your food! I would recomend Any other pizzeria !!! Only order if you enjoy eating frozen crap !!
