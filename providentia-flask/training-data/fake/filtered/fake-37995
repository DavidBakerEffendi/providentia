If i could give less than 1 star-- i would. I made a yelp account just to write this review. This place is NASTY. It has a NYC letter grade of "B"... but my friends and I literally saw a RAT INSIDE THE RESTAURANT. I get that were in NYC, but if customers are SEEING rats, God knows what that kitchen or freezer looks like. EWW. The manager or whoever tried to keep us quiet by offering us a free drink. thanks??? Will not be back, and hope this place gets inspected soon!
