Motivated to go based on advertorial/article in Philly Biz Journal about recognition earned by Exec. Chef, Man Wong.  Very extensive, ambitious, and eclectic Asian menu; beautiful dining room with nice-looking private dining room(s).  Attentive and inobtrusive service.  Good wine and beer list; reasonable prices for a community that is accustomed to BYOB. Overall, prices were quite reasonable - hopefully the owners will resist the urge to raise them, as the location is quite marginal, even for the 'burbs and the town of Morrisville. Nice presentation: we sampled 3Thai salads and 4 entrees (2 Thai; 2 Malaysian) Salads were tasty and light; each featured a different dressing.  Only criticism is that the main element of each salad was in short supply; duck should have been cut into more bite-sized pieces for ease of eating and sharing.  Entrees were excellent and generous; vegetables could have been cooked less and separated from the main dish/sauce so they could have stood-out visually and played a larger role in the meal. Would definitely go back and try their Sushi & other signature dishes.  Competition seems to be Duck Sauce in Newtown (also Asian Fusion, but not nearly as large and not able to accommodate as large a private dining party as would Concerto Fusion).
