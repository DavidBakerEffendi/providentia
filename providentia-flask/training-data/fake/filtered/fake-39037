I have an excellent experience every time I eat at Corner Bakery. It is a lot like Panera but better. The food comes out quicker and they serve you. In addition the ingredients taste fresher and they have bigger quantities. I feel more relaxed when eating at Corner Bakery, unlike the hectic and loud environment at Panera. They both have similar prices but I would definitely go with Corner Bakery. It is now my go to place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.
