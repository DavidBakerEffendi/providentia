Visiting NYC today.. from southern newengland...I am not originally from the Northeast region..bust since ive been here for the last several years..i cannot find any good tasting soul food restaurants. ...but this is the best soul food i ate in New England by far..i looked up best breakfast spots in nyc and this one popped up along with a few others..This was most appealing..with the chicken and waffle pics...so i decided to go there today                                                        i had the southern honey dipped chicken with yams and collard's sooooo delicious! !! It tasted just like grandmas..my.Chicken was extremely crispy and juicy..usually 2 combinations that don't always happen together. ..The cornbread was sweet, hot and very moist. Staff was friendly. .food was prompt and hot! Music was great..atmosphere was relaxed... am definitely a fan now!!! I will be back to try a few more menu items !!
