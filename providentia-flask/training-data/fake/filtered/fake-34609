Not sure why I'm giving 1 star....probably for the waiter, Manny,  This was not a good experience at all.....I ordered chicjen francaise and got the wrong dish. Of course my dining companions were practically done eating by the time the right dish came out, and it was god awful.  Undercooked chicken, no color, appears to have been poached rather than sauteed, no flavor, no lemon, no capers, processed mashed potatoes.  Joel was apologetic, but really, there should have been something offered by way of apology.  If you like run of the mill, old-school NJ neighborhood Italian American same old cuisine, you might like this.....MM B, Jaime R andLouis M must have been paid to write their reviews, or else they have never eaten quality food!
