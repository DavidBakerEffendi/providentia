This place is the best!  Georgian food is an experience and the owners are passionate about sharing it.  Everything about this restaurant is quality and the owners are cutting no corners on delivering the very best food at reasonable (for NYC) prices. If trying a cuisine you've never heard of seems a little daunting, just stick with the Khinkali (think dumpling, but better than anything you are used to) and Khachapuri (think delicious warm bread with eggs and cheese and other goodness baked right in).  It's like eating comfort food while trying an entirely new cuisine - delicious through and through. Georgia is also famous for its wines, and now that Old Tbilisi Garden has its liquor license, I can't wait to go back and check out what they have to offer!
