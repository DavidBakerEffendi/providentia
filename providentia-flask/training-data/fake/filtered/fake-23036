Was here on a Sat night with a party of 7. Food was overpriced...can get the same items for half the price at other area restaurants. A friend ordered the chicken parm entree and found both a bone and a piece of plastic in the dish! The waiter's quick response was, "The bone is from the wing. A piece of plastic is put over the dish when it's being prepared, but I'll tell the chef." Since when is there a wing in chicken parm? And no apology for the plastic! Luckily, he took the dish off of the bill. However, I will not be coming back here. Much better Italian places in the area than this one.
