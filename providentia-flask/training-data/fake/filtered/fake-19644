Wow! I tried four of their pizzas (with some hungry friends) at Mutt Strutt today: margarita, salame, radicchio, and eggplant. All fabulous, really perfect pies. I don't think there is better pizza in Philly, seriously. Good size, amazing blistered crust, luscious toppings (I love the dollop of fresh ricotta on the eggplant!). The radicchio was the most unique - they do a balsamic reduction that is bitter, sweet, and tart all at the same time - great foil for the crust. Â I wish I had tried the garlic and the breakfast, but we couldn't eat 6 pizzas...I'll definitely be hunting them down at Drexel on Tues/Thurs.
