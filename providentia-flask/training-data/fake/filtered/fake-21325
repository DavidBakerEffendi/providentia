Ok. The first time I can't to bogota was a yr ago and I have been hooked ever since. I love this place. Great food, great service and most of all great environment. I've been to many places and this place definitely has amazing customer service. When it comes to the drinks they are the best. Miguel, Fred, Tyler and Nicole are the best behind the bar. They rock :-D
