Great Brunch! One of my favorite Sunday spots. Every basic breakfast comes with fruit too, which is my favorite part. However, they are very often times out of Absolut Peppar, which really puts a damper on a good bloody mary. I would definitely recommend this spot but don't expect hasty or attentive service seeing as they're always packed.
