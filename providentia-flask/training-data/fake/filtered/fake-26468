My favorite food cart in New Haven. The vermicelli is super delicious and healthy. Hands down one of the best things I've ever ate. The owner of the cart is so nice. I remember the first time I ordered from the cart, there was this lady in front of me whose daughter had peanut allergies, so she came back with her order which contained peanuts, and asked the owner if he could just give her some rice and salad. The owner instead said he'll make her another one, free of charge, even though the lady was already a dollar short on her original order. Five stars for good food and good heart.
