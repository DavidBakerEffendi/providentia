While the service and staff were very friendly and the atmosphere was nice and pleasing. the food however well not so good. The home fries had a horrible butter crisco taste that was just not pleasant on the palate. The omelet was just three fried broken yolk eggs with a few ingredients thrown in and was over cooked. My husbands Monte Crisco was almost on the verge of being burnt and was really dry.
