We were a party of 8 searching for a restaurant in the theatre district that would take a rersevation on a Saturday night on 2 weeks notice for 6pm.   Based upon some reviews that we read on Yelp we decided to give this restaurant a shot.   Not only did they seat us upstairs in a nice room with hardwood floors, the service was very attentive and we were made to feel very comfortable throughout the meal.   We strongly recommend their chicken with portobello mushrooms serviced in a brown sauce, their grilled salmon, and the veal trattoria (there signature dish), was also very good  .For starters, you got to try their salad that comes with the walnuts,  cheese, red lettuce and a delicious vinegaurette dressing.   For the money, great ambiance and a terrific value.
