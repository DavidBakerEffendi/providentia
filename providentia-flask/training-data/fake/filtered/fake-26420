Decided to try this place on a cold Sunday afternoon and were very pleased! Since moving to Philly from Australia we've even trying to find great asian food and our experiences with certain cuisines/dishes have been patchy at best. Dumplings were one of of those... This place changed that in one meal! The soup dumplings here have the most delicious filling. Took away a star for the pastry...a little on the dense side. The scallion pancake however is top notch, we loved the salt and pepper squid and their version of dan-dan noodles were awesome. Order the Thai bubble tea too... Cash only but there is an ATM in the restaurant.
