Going by the reviews on Yelp I went there for lunch buffet with my co-workers. The ambiance and the interior is good and deserves praise. All of us found the food to be just about average. The Tandoor dishes were really dry as some other user had pointed out. The desert options were also a big let down. The service was ordinary and nothing exceptional, but no complains since it was a buffet. Overall quality of the food was just average and all of us were taken aback a little because we went with higher expectations based on yelp reviews. The kicker was the mandatory 18% Gratuity charged to us. ( Group of 5) While I acknowledge that several restaurants charge mandatory gratuity for bigger parties, charging 18% for a buffet with just average service and food did not go down well with any of us. This left a bad taste in our mouth and would not recommend this place for obvious reasons. For folks interested in a lunch buffet, there are a few other places down the road which offer better food and a bigger spread.
