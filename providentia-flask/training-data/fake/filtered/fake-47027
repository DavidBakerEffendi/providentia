We decided to go after we had heard good things. We live in the area and have been big fans of L'asso since it opened. We wanted to try this new pizza place to see how it compared. We got there while it was a little after regular dinner hours on a sunday night. We sat at a table at the back of the first dinning room. We carried on our conversation for about literally 15 minutes before anyone helped us. I don't know if they all assumed we were being taken care of by someone else or what, but not even waters came for 15 minutes. Then we got one waitresses attention who said she would send our server over. A girl came by and asked for drink orders. We decided to do the whole thing, frustrated by how long we had already waited. We asked her for a recommendation, to which she gave some unenthusiastic reply, like she didn't really care. The drinks we ordered were very simple and again we waited another 10 minutes for these. This was service when it was not crowded, I would hate to see this on a fri or sat night. It took so long that our apetizer came out 1 minute after the drinks. The pizza came. We had vodka and classic. It was OK, but not great. The meal went on with both the waitresses attending to us. We weren't sure who was our person and it was confusing the entire meal. We had a side of the Broccoli Rabe. TERRIBLE. It was so salty and watery. We each ate two bites. Overall def not going back. For our money in this neighborhood L'asso all the way. Better staff, better service, and BETTER PIZZA.
