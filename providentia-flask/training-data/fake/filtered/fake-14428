Our favorite Thai restaurant.  The food is always great and the service is great.  Always get our food out fast and hot.  The BEST pad thai and drunken noodles and great curry dishes.  Fish is always fresh.  The outside of the place looks a little sketchy but once you get inside it is so cute and cozy.  Bring friends here...everyone always loves it!
