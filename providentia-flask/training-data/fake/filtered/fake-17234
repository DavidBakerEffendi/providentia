haven't had as much of a warm welcoming in any diner as I had ad Andros.  The service there had given us appropriate attention not to neglect our consistent requests.  Coming from the hospitality industry myself I know how demanding it is especially in the back of the house.  So I have to give it up to the cook who managed to keep my burger medium rare and the fries crispy after ordering more than a handful of items at our table. I recommend the blackened chicken quesadilla. all and all it was a great experience hats off to Andros
