Yeah yeah expensive. Get over it. It's places like this that make Philly a player in the restaurant scene (and it's surely tough to deny it's a player these days). It's out of the way and most likely packed, a feat that doesn't happen if a place sucks. It's a memorable experience and worth checking out.
