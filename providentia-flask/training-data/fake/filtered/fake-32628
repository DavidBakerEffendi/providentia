4 Stars because: + Friendly and prompt service + GREAT coffee/espresso - By JRene - a CT micro roaster + Large portions (I'm a big eater on the weekend after a long night out.) + Great location, ample Parking (in back), lots of seating, and easy to access I cant give it a 5 because they are not open 24 hours and only server Breakfast and Lunch so at 1:30am when I'm leaving the bar I have to go to either Goldrock, Dennie's, or Olympia... and frankly given those choices Id rather go home thank drink burnt water which they claim to be coffee.
