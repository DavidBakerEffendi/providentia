Read good reviews on Yelp before picking spot for nice dinner in New Haven with friends. I'd give this place more stars if it weren't for how pricey it was. Good food (key word Good, not great), great variety of Latin American food, great service. But overpriced. Dinner for 4 with a few drinks over $220, when probably should have been about $160 -$170 out the door. I ordered the Yellowfin tuna special, the martini of the day (cucumber lime), and we had chicken, a few mohitos, no desert. Tuna was 3 stars, martini too small. Mohito's good, and good variety but at nearly $10/drink, not a good value. With so many options in New Haven, I'll try others before I go back...
