Yerba Buena is a small restuarant just a couple blocks north of Houston on Avenue A. The best feature is the 3 Mexican bartenders who are very good with tasty, creative cocktails. I especially recommend the spicy one made with gin and jalapeno puree. I can't recall the name. Stick with appetizers here. The entrees are very over priced and not all that good. Service is solid, if a little too familiar.
