This little spot serves superb food at very reasonable prices. The $35 tasting menu (that's appetizer, entre and dessert) is Â a steal. The French trained chef changes the menu seasonally and always provides choices in each category. The presentation is worthy of any French joint in Manhattan and then some. Service was quick and respectable. I was able to bring my own wine as they don't have a license yet and that only adds to the bargain. We are thakful that French food, beautifully prepared and so tasty, is available locally. Give it a try!!!
