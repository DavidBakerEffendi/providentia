Can you say overrated?  Is the breakfast choice in this part of CT so dismal that this is what passes for excellence. Skip it and hold out hope that Somerville's Sound Bites will see an excellent opportunity to make a lot of cash and open an outlet here.  Sound Bites - now they know how to do breakfast!
