This place is as good as it gets.  The food is amazing.  The employees are outstanding and the management is incredible.  I never used to go to the old bar that was here (bogarts) but I decided to try Park Avenue Tavern last year and fell in love.  These guys know how to do it right.  The bartenders are amazing people who take the time to get to know the customers especially the girl that works upstairs. LOVE LOVE LOVE PAT!
