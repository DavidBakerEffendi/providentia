Visited Feng  on Saturday night because let's be honest, It might be my favorite place in the world!  We had our car complimentary valeted Love that!  And sat in the bar.  I had a pineapple gimlet, which had no booze in it! none i'm sure of it. and when I told the server he just made a grunt sound and walked away. Hmmm. thinking that was really bad customer service. Ok so now I was annoyed. We ordered the lettuce wraps for an appetizer which were yummy BUT salty!  We both ordered a CT Roll, which is not on the menu but it was a special once and we were told they were going to put it on the menu but haven't yet.  Anyway they made ours special for us.  it's a roll with no rice. All fish and some cucumber,and avacado. Can you say the best thing in the world!  So good, it made up for my servers bad customer service. When the Valet brought my Acura. we got in it and both gagged and opened all of the windows!  It smelled so bad. The Valet stunk like Body Odor and he stunk up my Car!!!  Will I return, of course!  But I wont' order a drink:( and I won't Valet.
