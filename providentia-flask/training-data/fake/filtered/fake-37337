This place was my boyfriend and I's go to breakfast spot when we living in Fishtown. We have moved about an hour away to delaware, but we still will make weekend trips to La Maude specifically. DELICIOUS. Never had a bite here that i did not like. The owners know us by name and are always pleased to see us. which we do appreciate since we are young and well, its just nice to go somewhere months later and they still recognize you. We always try to get something different on the menu. the salads are huge, sandwiches full, and breakfast succulent. makes my mouth water thinking about it. We love the homemade juices(when they are available) and never leave without some of the baklava, it is to die for! never soggy. one of my favorite places to eat in philly!!!!! IT IS A MUST VISIT!
