Pricey but worth every penny.  I got the taste of Maine and it was really delicious.  Seems like a much better deal than just buying a lobster roll.  The root beer is quite good and the staff are very friendly.  It is a bit hard to find ... on the lower level just south of 17th and Sansom.  Definitely will go again.
