Grimaldi's is over rated. You want good pizza? Go to Bensonhurst where the heart of the American Italian culture is. If you want grandeur and NYC imagery, go to Grimaldis. It's NOT the best pizza in the city. It's the TYPICAL pizza in NYC. The dough is somewhat raw because they want you to NOT be able to tell the difference between the sauce and the dough. Blekh. Go an extra 10 stations on the D line and you'll get something real there in South Brooklyn.
