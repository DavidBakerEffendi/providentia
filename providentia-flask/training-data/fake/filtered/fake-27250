I live down the street and have come for brunch a few times, always hoping it will be better than the last experience, but it is never the case. I am never going there again and I just want to warn you that the service is very spotty, unreliable, and unfriendly. Today I ordered the pancakes, kitchen made me an omelet. When the pancakes finally came out 25 minutes later (and after my husband finished his rotten soggy salad, oily french fries meal), they were like 2 enormous cakes that weighed 10 pounds each (how can you eat that??), and the batter was UNCOOKED on the inside. Of course, it's impossible to cook something that is 4 inches thick all the way through. If it's going to take 30 minutes for PANCAKES you should tell your customer before they order it. It was a very disappointing experience and I left without a sincere apology or any recognition of the fact that they messed up my meal. It was $25 for my husband's eggs and two cups of coffee--I felt like that was a huge waste of our money and time since I did not eat anything. You are a restaurant! Your job is to feed your customer. YOU FAIL!
