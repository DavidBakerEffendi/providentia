Went to Oyster House with a bunch of girlfriends on a visit to Philly.  First we ordered an assortment of oysters and clams which were very fresh and tasty.  We tried the Roasted Oyster Sampler which was good, and the smoked bluefish - I did not particularly like the bluefish and the table was split, 1/2 in favor, 1/2 not.  If you are a big fan of smoked fish you will probably like it because the smoky flavor was very developed.  I was looking for the sauteed mussels from the online menu but they did not have them (very sad) however, there was a scallop dish in its place which I imagine was a similar broth.  The scallops came in the shell and for those sensitive to fishy tastes - be aware - they come with the muscle attached so there is a very oceany taste.  I happen to like scallops in the shell but no one else at the table would eat them.  The broth was very good, quite possibly the best thing on the table, despite the fishy scallops the girls were dipping oyster crackers and whatever else they could find into the broth.  The crab cake was good, and the lobster roll was full of chunky lobster meat - impressed with the amount of frest lobster meat in there.  Overall it was good, nothing great that had me jumping out of my seat.  Would not return as an out of towner but if I lived in the area I would go for the $1 Happy Hour Oyster Special.   Also need to make a special mention for the service - it was excellent.  Very attentive, friendly, helpful staff... but not overbearing or intrusive.
