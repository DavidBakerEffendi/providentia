We had heard the restaurant has a great food. So we went there few months ago. The waiter was rude from the beginning. While the restaurant was half empty, he didn't allow us to sit where we requested. Then he was getting annoyed by our questions and at one point mocked the fact that we only eat fish and chicken and not other meat. He was very obnoxious and made us very uncomfortable. So we decided to leave, and will never go back.
