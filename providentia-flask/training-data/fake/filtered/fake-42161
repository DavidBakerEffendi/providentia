A friend had booked 10 tables banquet style.  But Royal Seafood still had to open the other part of the restaurant for business (there are no private rooms).  They placed the ten tables so closely crowded to each other.  The restaurant was so noisy that the tables at the back could not hear any announcement from the microphone in front. There are at least two managers and what was discussed with the first manager was not communicated to the other manager.  There were several details omitted but one big detail was that they were not informed that the tip had to be in cash.  But who brings $800-900 cash with him?  Hence, Royal Seafood added another tax to the tip since payment was by credit card.  They also did not specify that the huge tip did not extend to the kitchen staff so they requested that an optional tip be also given to the kitchen staff. All twelve courses were great although the shark fin soup may not be genuine - it tasted floury.
