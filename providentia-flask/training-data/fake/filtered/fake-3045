This restaurant has one of the nicest ambiances in all of Montclair!  Everything looks and tastes very authentic.  The marinated chicken with mango salsa is amazing!  The plantains taste great as well.  The service was a little slow (granted, it was a Friday night and they were extremely busy), but still....  Other than that, I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to eat in the area.
