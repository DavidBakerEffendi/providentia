Had a great meal and great service - I had the chilli appetizer -and the Boston Jake Steak and cheese both were exceptional. For me the chilli was just the right amount of hot, My wife asked if she could have one of the chicken sandwichs as a wrap - and they were very accommodating. The waitress checked back to see if out meals were okay - of if we needed anything. Overall it was a good experience
