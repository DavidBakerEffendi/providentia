Yeah, this is probably the best ramen in the City, but if I were to patronise only one ramen restaurant for the rest of my life, this would not be it. I like my ramen to be more assertive, bold, and crass--the ramen here, on the other hand, is a bit too precious, self-conscious and soulless. I really can't complain about it, but this ain't exactly my "bag" as far as ramen is concerned.
