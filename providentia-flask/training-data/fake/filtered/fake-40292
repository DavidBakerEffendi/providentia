We arrived to a large crowd outside.  I asked Cheryl how long of a wait.  She says "30 mins."  I asked if that was true and she said yes, so we put our names on the list.  As it approached a one hour wait, I spoke with Cheryl again and she said that we were 6th on the list and several tables were going to leave shortly.  Twenty minutes later we left. I can't rate the food since we never ate there...and we'll probably never go back. Cheryl, tell us that it will be one hour and we can decide if we want to wait or not.  Don't keep just saying "30 mins" and keep a hungry group waiting and waiting.
