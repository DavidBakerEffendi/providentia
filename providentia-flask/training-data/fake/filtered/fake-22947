I usually don't write reviews but after this distasteful experience I'm compelled to do so. After many great recommendations to this little tapas bar my friends and I were convinced to check it out. We did not make reservations because no one was going to be there on time and in order to have one they needed a credit card on file. This would make sense if it actually was a well organized restaurant but it isn't. Nevertheless, we took our chances to enjoy our Wednesday night out. For starters the place is too small for the 15-20 tables that take up half the place not to mention a small corner that has one sofa and a couple of chairs a complete mismatch. The drinks and food are great but a little overpriced for the portion served. The drinks were good with too much ice and the food size is capable for a child. For the 15-20 tables the place only had one waitress and one buss boy that NEVER came around to check up on us strike one. Our plates were never taken off our table until I called the bus boy over and we only received drinks after hounding down the waitress that again was nowhere to be found. When the bill came instead of paying for my portion which should have been on a separate bill she assumed it was altogether with another group that was not with us. This then caused me to pay for extra of what I ordered including a 20% gratuity that she did not earn whatsoever. Final thoughts are simply this the service was absolutely HORRIBLE and I will never go back!
