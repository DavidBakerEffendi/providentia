I was recently on vacation to New York with some friends and was told by a New Yorker that Juniors was the place to go for cheesecake. We stopped in after our show, great that they're open late and not too crowded, even on a Friday night. We shared some buffalo chicken fingers and fries, and they did not disappoint. Huge chunks of chicken, lightly breaded with a very different, but great buffalo sauce. After dinner, we decided on the original cheesecake, which was outstanding! Such a perfect density and flavor. We also had superb service, the best we had in New York, from Mary! She was so friendly and sweet. We loved it south we came back the next day for a couple of slices to go, this time a raspberry swirl and chocolate swirl. Again, amazing! I lived it so much I plan on mail ordering one so my family can try it. Very satisfied!
