I had dinner at Almonds about 2 weeks ago. I brought a friend in because I live in the neighborhood and the food is great. I hyped up the place a lot. We sat down and put in our order, the server was very nice, attractive Latin guy, can't remember his name but he was great. After we received our food and began to eat, I stopped because I saw a mouse run across the dining room. I was mortified, but not 100% sure. So I told my friend. After about a minute we both saw it run across the room. I was absolutely disgusted. Earlier in the summer I had a similar experience at Almonds, only this time it was cockroaches. I disregarded it because I figured it was the heat. But after seeing a mouse...I just can't . It sucks because I'm a very picky eater and Almonds has a great selection of food and wine. But it's obviously not a clean restaurant.
