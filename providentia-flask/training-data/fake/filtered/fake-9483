So this is my first time I ever tried Greek food. And it was AMAZING! My aunt and I go to all different culture restaurants and this one was one of the best! For appetizers we had Keftedes , which are like meatballs, also we had Kolokithokeftedes ,that's fried zucchini. It was fantastic! For dinner my aunt and I had two dishes and split them. It was Pastichio (it is like lasagna) and a gyro platter. The manger was so pleased that I was so young and eating traditional Greek food he gave us Baklava on the house. The portions here are gigantic  and much worth  the money. COME TO THIS RESTAURANT ASAP!
