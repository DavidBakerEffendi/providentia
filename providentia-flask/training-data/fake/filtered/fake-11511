Something has changed for the better at baby blues! I stopped in for dinner and it was the best overall experience I've had there and I've been frequenting baby blues for over a year now. They were extremely busy when I entered the bar, there wasn't even an empty chair at the bar but the bartender quickly grabbed a chair from the dining room and planted it at the bar so I had a place to sit, hard to find this type of customer service in the city so I was pleasantly surprised. The ribs I had were possibly the best I've ever tasted in my entire life!!  Got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese for sides and I highly recommended both, great combo and hefty portions which I can't say I've always had at baby blues.. I couldn't help but notice the place just had a whole different feel to it than it had the last few times I was there so I asked the bartender if they'd changed anything recently and he said yes, the newest addition to the kitchen is actually one of the original founders of the baby blues brand in California. I was then introduced to him, I can't remember his name but he was extremely friendly and was happy to hear I enjoyed my meal and then brought out some brisket for me to taste which was excellent.  Like I said it was just an overall awesome experience at baby blues from start to finish. I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys authentic BBQ cooking. Something has definitely changed at baby blues and it is absolutely for the better! I was surprised to read a good number of negative reviews here and all I can say is that when it comes to new restaurants opening its necessary to give them some time to work out the kinks and learn from their mistakes and I can confidently say that baby blues BBQ has done just that!!
