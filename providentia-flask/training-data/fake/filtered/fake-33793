Really is as good as it get's. My favorite restaraunt in the world. When I could afford it I was there 3 times a week sometimes even though it was a 60 min drive from my house. The best bang for your buck, the food is just crazy good and amazingly cheap. Worth the drive, the wait, the loud music, the crowd. It is a must try in your life time if you love tex-mex. You won't be disappointed. I highly recommend the empanadas.
