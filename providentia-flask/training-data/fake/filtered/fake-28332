Best grilled octopus in town ! There is always a crowd there waiting to be seated, so that kind of sucks that you cannot get a table right away but the food is delicious. The atmosphere is ok and the service is good. Also try the stuffed shrimp which is also very delicious and the fried feta cheese. Bonn appetite!
