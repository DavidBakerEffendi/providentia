Sometimes you just crave a burger, but go to a local burger joint and are served up a dry tasteless piece of meat. Dissatisfied! But the burgers at Grazers are so juicy, so flavorful and available with a variety of topping choices (and they're local). If you don't want a burger there are other choices such as turkey, chicken, lamb, pork and fish. The extra couple of dollars you pay here is well worth the price for an outstanding burger. I'll be coming back here again for sure.
