I've noticed that the cooks don't where any gloves, which is gross. when I was there with my friend on 8/6/13 I've noticed a few things. A waitress there, I'm just going to be completely blunt. Her name is Sherelle, she makes me NEVER want  to go back. Her apron was so gross and dirty, she tried to hand me a straw.. I didn't want to take it! The manager that night was so rude, and yelled at the workers.. she seems to get upset easily.  I'm Never GOING BACK TO ACP.
