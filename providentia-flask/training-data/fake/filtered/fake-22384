Excellent place to dine! First off, one of the cleanest restaurants I ever dined in! Great decor and atmoshere! The food was wonderful and the portions are huge! The staff was very friendly and attentive, really no quams about anything. My husband and I had a very nice dining experience! Weekends do require reservations as it is packed but not necessary for weeknight dining. They have a spacious patio for the summer and although we dined inside, the patio was very inviting! Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone craving good Italian food!
