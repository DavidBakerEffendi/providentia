This was my first dinner at the Farm, and it blew me away. The servers and bus boys were attentive and informative, and very upbeat. Music was a little loud, but they lowered the volume for us with no fuss. It was a busy night, yet our service was great. Everyone at our table was happy with their meals, and our server explained the best wine paring with our dinners. French fries, crisp, fresh and abundant. The rib eye was good-not the best-but very good. The broccoli rabe was sauteed in garlic perfectly. My bluefish was cooked as requested-medium rare and vegies were tasty and well seasoned. I loved the shredded brussels sprouts with  grated parmesan. As for a good date locale: I would recommend the Farm for a date, groups, children, and anyone who wants to show off Cortelyou's up and coming night life. There's a beautiful bar, with locales hanging out-and a really good vibe. This is a good place for children who can sit and enjoy a grown up style meal. The atmosphere was friendly, warm, romantically lit.(low lighting and candles-very urban-country style interior)   The prices are on the high end-so be prepared to pay for this very special restaurant-from my own experience and my peeps who are regulars-you will not be dispappointed.
