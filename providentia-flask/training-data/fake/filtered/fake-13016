mmm, mmm, mmm. I recently had the pleasure of dining at Vesta with a couple of friends. The margerita pizza is fabulous. Very thin crust that actually tastes exactly like a big table water cracker. That may not sound good but it was. I think what makes it good is that it the crust didn't take over the flavor of the pizza. Good service too. And there's a hook on the table for your purse. hooray!
