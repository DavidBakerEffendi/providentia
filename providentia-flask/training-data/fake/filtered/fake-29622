Cozy little southern comfort spot with good food. I had the hippie banjo minus the sprouts and it was fresh and warm. My wife had and enjoyed the chicken with waffles dish. The chicken was good and non greasy. The waffles were just "okay". Either way we enjoyed it and the prices were very affordable.
