I live near by so I went here one morning for coffee and a butter roll While waiting my turn had an older lady, that kept going behind the counter and using her hands to get food..Now I don't know who she is but she was there the next day doing the same thing so I am guessing an owner...if the owner does not use the employees behind the counter or worse use gloves, how clean can this place be. Haven't been back since
