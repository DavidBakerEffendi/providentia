One of the best and most consistent restaurants in the city. I go to market table at least 2 -3 times a month and the food is always consistent. I used to love the fresh falafel and am sad they removed it from the menu. the eggplant parm is amazing! biscuits are to die for. And pancakes? I dont even like pancakes, but i love theirs. light, crispy edges with fluffy center. and an added bonus for never having to wait for a table. Waitstaff is great too!
