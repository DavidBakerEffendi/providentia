There was a line, but it went by quickly. Everyone behind the counter was super helpful and friendly. Food was delicious. I would highly recommend it to any and all meat lovers! They lose a star because there wasn't a tip jar. When I asked how to tip my excellent service, they said they have to keep the tips below the counter. Why?! You should let customers easily reward excellent service. It's good for everyone's karma.
