I just ordered from Blu Orchid, and I could not believe how fasty m food arrived!! I have to admit that I was a bit skeptical when my food arrived, because it only been 10 minutes earlier.. I had the chicken Pad Thai, papaya salad and the naan and hummus. They were all amazing. The entree was hot and the vegetables were cooked to perfection.
