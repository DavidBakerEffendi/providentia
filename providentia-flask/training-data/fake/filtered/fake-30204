Called ahead at 5:30 for a 7:00 seating. When we arrived at 7:00 we were told it would only be a few minutes. At 7:40 I asked to speak to the owner or manager. At 8 still not seated I asked where the manager was and the hostess said he was too busy to come talk to me and that he would only say the same thing. She also said they had to seat other people ahead of us because 2 tables didn't open at the same time. At 8pm still not seated a waitress, Susan, came over and apologized, no the manager/owner. Susan was very sweet and tried to accommodate us. We finally sat at 8:10. I'm shocked that the owner cares so little about his patrons. He did spend time behind the bar taking and shaking hands wih those sitting there but couldn't speak to me. Overall we had a very bad experience and couldn't support a business with an manager/owner who cares so little.
