Eating at Feast is like the best family dinner you can imagine, if you happen to come from a family full of great cooks. Comfortable seating, relaxed atmosphere, friendly service and excellent food. The room's lively and vibrant, but quiet enough for talking at a normal level. Seven of us shared the game feast, plus a couple of a la carte veggie dishes, and enjoyed everything. To single out just a few things: The wild boar ribs with root beer foam was absolutely delightful -- meaty, succulent, falling-off-the bone tender. Acorn squash with blue cheese and pumpkin seeds was a lovely balance of sweet, salty, savory, creamy, crunchy. The mushroom agnolotti, light and savory. Who knew I like venison so much?! I wish I had asked for a copy of the wine list -- there are quite a few excellent choices offered by the glass. I started with the albarino (especially great with the smoked trout and farro salad) and moved on to the pinot noir (light enough for the sea bass and quail, complex enough for the duck). I'll be back.
