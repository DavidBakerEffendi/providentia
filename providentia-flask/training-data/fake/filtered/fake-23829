How can you beat $5.50 a bowl!!!???!!!  And you get to see the guy pulling the noodles through the kitchen doors.   We had the roasted duck, and also the Special which had every cut of meat available including, tripe, tendon, brisket...etc.  Pretty damn tasty and filling.  I'm ready to go back. Its next door to a unique speak easy.  Great lil street.
