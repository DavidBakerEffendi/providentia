My partner and I visited Modo Mio on 12/8/2012.  We were promptly and courteously seated for our 5:15PM reservation. Our selections from the turista menu included the crespelle stuffed with beets, tongue,  lasagne with fried egg, potato dumplings with lambs neck ragu, black pepper braised lamb and the trout stuffed with wine soaked grapes.  Each item was well prepared, fresh and hot. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate torte and the pumpkin ricotta cheesecake. Yum! The menu at ModoMio is extensive, nothing is excluded from the tasting menu, and although our server kept saying that the portions were meant to be "small plates", not one portion was skimpy by any means. The pasta lasagne would have been enough for a meal!  Our server was attentive and helpful as were all the other servers who stopped by to see if all was well, if anything was needed.  The only negative is the noise level. It was nearly impossible to hear my companion over the music and the voices of other diners. In fact, we even had to ask our server to speak up when he told us of the menu specials.   Parking is on the street and can be difficult. We would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for food that is well prepared, service that is well paced and attentive and prices that are very reasonable.
