Fantastic service, cocktails and food. We've visited Rye twice now - once for brunch and once for supper. The food is fantastic and I would rate Rye highly among one of the best in the area. The menu is cleverly put together and I love how they experiment with the dishes (my British husband went for a scotch egg starter and a kebab for mains - the dishes were definitely not what you'd expect in the UK which isn't a bad thing!). The brunch menu is extensive and everything we ordered was fantastic. Whether it's eggs, granola or the fruit platter, everything came out freshly prepared with virtually no wait at all. The service is fantastic - the waiters are totally attentive and I really love the interior. Lots of reclamation wood, antique furniture and reminiscent of a speakeasy-style tavern from yesteryear. If only you could eat outside!
