$15 for a burger? must be worth it. not this time though! too buttered, too oily too fatty too meh. There's good fatty foods worth it. this place is not one of those. Â  Fries were unimpressive as well. the logic here is some fat is good so a lot of fatty crap is oh so better. Nnot so! Draft prices could be worse but are defintely not impressive. for kicks... The owner tries to pickup patrons - classy.
