I used to go here all the time before Lincoln Center concerts.  Last time they were really snooty.  The place was almost empty at 6 pm when we arrived and wanted to sit at our usual table.  They had pushed it together with the adjoining table (btw table is too strong a word, these are shelves and stools really as they crowd them in) and said that it had to be for a party of 4 only.  If the place had any customers in it I might understand the attitude, but this was just silly.  We went to Luce nearby, and had a much better experience.  No more Riposo for me, even though I did like their food.  Oh, and the prices went up too.
