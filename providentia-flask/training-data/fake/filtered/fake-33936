A great dining experience!  Excellent food.  Casual atmosphere.   Attentive and knowledge staff. Too many good dishes to list them all but really enjoyed the  clam chowder custard and the lamb.  Deserts were the big surprise.   Was so focused on the rest of the menu that I didn't expect the wonderful deserts. Make sure you have one.
