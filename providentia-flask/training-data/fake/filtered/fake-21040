the food- very delicious the service- absolutely horrible! My family and I had our repast lunch here and they could of not been more rude to us. We previously told them that we would have 20 to 25 people and the had told us their would be plenty of food and the meal would be family style. Well, they gave us only enough food to serve about 10. When asked if we could have more the waiter accused us of "pick pocketing food"?? The waiters spoke to us rudely and the owner was despicable. The completely overcharged us for the whole meal. They took advantage of our family during a difficult time and i will never return to this restaurant again.
