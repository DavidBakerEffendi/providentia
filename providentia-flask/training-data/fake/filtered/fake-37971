I was there on Wednesday night for my 3rd time and yet again it was great!  Great atmosphere, great service, great food... and of course awesome beer.   They have the best beer selection.  I've been to plenty of places and by far they have been the best.  I've actually been looking for a place to have my sisters 30th birthday.  The manager came over and was awesome.  We are definitely going to have the party at the Cask and future parties as well.  He gave us his card, his name is Mike.  He was very informative.  This is the place!  I can't wait.  It's going to be a great time.   I highly recommend The Cask Republic .
