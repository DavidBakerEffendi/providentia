This is one of my favorite places in Hartford! They have a really good mixed drink selection. The food is amazing! They change the menu around from time to time, which I like. But they do keep some things constantly on the menu which is really good too. The atmosphere is very good here also, it's not too loud and not too quiet. There is a nice bar area. They have an upstairs where you can have a larger group for a party. I alway recommend this place when friends are looking to try somewhere new.
