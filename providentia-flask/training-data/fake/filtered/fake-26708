I went in to try this place out. I wasn't sure what to expect. First the decor and atmosphere was really cool, I felt very comfortable. I sat at the Bar to eat, only to be greeted by this Beautful redhead, it was very hard to keep my eyes off of her!!! She turned out to not only be my server... but she was also the Bartender. The service was great, as was the conversation. She seemed to really know alot about all of the different wines and creative drinks, All I tried were fantastic. Then came the food, It was very good. I tried some of the different Bruschettas.....WOW!!! Â Also some of the meats and cheeses, again...WOW!!!! All of the staff was very friendly, alert and well knowledged about the food and drinks. I highly recomend this place, if not for the food, You should at least go have a drink and check out that Bartender (wink,wink).
