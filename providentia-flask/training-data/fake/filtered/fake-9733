Mill on the River is our favorite restaurant. Ambiance says New England at its finest. The wait staff is always attentive-special shout out to Maggie and Eric. The day after Thanksgiving I had Prime Rib which was cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes are hopefully served in Heaven. Our family again dined the day after Christmas and the Rib Eye and Lobster Tail (of course w the mashed potato again) were fabulous. Remember to start w the shrimp cocktail-huge size and perfectly chilled. Do not miss "The Mill" when in the area.
