Pepe Giallo's features a lovely and old style romantic back room, helpful and relaxed service (in a good way), and pretty darn good food. The prices are certainly reasonable. We went with a big group, and felt really comfortable taking our time and hanging out for awhile. Everyone seemed happy with their food, and we all got to taste various dishes. It is a bit out of the way on the one hand, but a romantic and comfortable place in the big city with good food and service, is not easy to find these days. I will return.
