Decided to take a late dinner with my daughter. We called to make sure they were opened and showed up 45 mins to closing. We never felt rushed or awkward. The service was perfect, Elise brought everything in perfect order and timing. We started with miso soup and green salad. They were both perfect in flavor and delicious. Next up we had Shrimp Tempura that was to die for. The rolls were super fresh and the recommended Temple roll was unique and flavorful. The owner introduced himself and shared his business philosophy of offering a great product at an excellent value. We couldn't agree more with his vision and wish them much success. We will be back!
