My wife and I recently ate at Graffiti, and we simply loved it.  The flavors are spectacular:  we shared the watermelon/feta/mint sorbet salad, green mango paneer, pork buns, zucchini/hummus pizza, and Graffiti burger, and we enjoyed every dish immensely.  I also had the lychee martini and loved it.  Plus, the service was great (I liked that the waiter described each dish in detail), and it was a treat to meet Chef Mehta.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
