So my original review was 5 stars but I've decided 4 after thinking it through. Overall, I am very excited to try RX again. For dinner, I'll stick to wine but I'll give the infusions another go during Brunch time. I was very impressed with the staffs ability to produce such high quality food during this busy opening week. Positives: - I really like the new decor, it feels much more comforting than Rimedios. - All the food was excellent, seasoned well and quick to come out. - The menu was simple and with just enough variety to satisfy different palates - The food seemed very fresh - The portions were either perfect or very generous. I felt I got enough of any one dish. Downsides: - The infusions were a good idea but much too heavy for drinks with dinner, I'd recommend bringing wine instead. I'm sure the current offering of infusions are better for brunch. - I thought the Mac and Cheese pasta, though very well seasoned seasoned and delicious, seemed to be made with a low quality "Barilla"-esque non-macaroni penne? noodle. I'd still recommend the pasta. - The plating for some of the dishes seemed off. Huge plates for the fried pickles and bread appetizers. Relatedly, I though the huge wooden planks for the salads make them messy to eat
