Terrible Food and Even More Terrible Service: Not sure what has changed from a year ago when I went but this place is HORRIBLE NOW !  The service  was among the worse I have ever experienced: pompous, slow, dim witted actually, and then (despite my wife being EXTREMELY polite even angelic given the deficiencies in the meal and their service) they had the GALL, the NERVE, the unbelievable BAD TASTE to complain about a 15% tip loudly to the entire table - I think they forgot they are in the hospitality business and think a 20% tip or more is just automatic. Well, as a former busboy and waiter, I can tell you it is not.  Manager didn't seem to mind that waiter brought the  "low 15% tip" up to the whole table; mentioned they bring it up regularly because "they work so hard."  THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU.  DO NOT BRING ANYONE YOU CARE ABOUT TO THIS RESTAURANT OR ANYONE YOU WANT TO MAKE A GOOD IMPRESSION WITH.  THEY ARE UNBELIEVABLY RUDE FOR MEDIOCRE FOOD AND TERRIBLE SERVICE.  GETS MY VOTE FOR WORSE RESTAURANT IN NEW YORK CITY.
