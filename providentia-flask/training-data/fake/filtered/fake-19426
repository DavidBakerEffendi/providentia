Service isn't always their strong point....  But we love this place!  Usually I get the steak in sauce with onions, salad and tostones ...as well as rice.  My family gets an array of food...from a peril sandwich, potato ball, chicken....etc..all delicious.... I switched it up and got the steak sandwich....  Chunks of deliciously seasoned steak with onions....mayo lettuce and tomato.....   DELICIOUS!!!!!!
