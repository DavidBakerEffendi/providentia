Hello all Went there for the first time to have a nice diner with my girlfriend.  I must say was blown away.  From the moment we got there till we left everyone was so nice and funny.  Chef came out to greet us and bring our chocolate soufflé. We had the escargot and mussels.  Both were great.  I had the duck and she had the beef Bourgogne both were amazing and soufflé was great. Can't wait to go back.
