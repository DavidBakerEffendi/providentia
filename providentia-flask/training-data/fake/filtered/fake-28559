This is sad to see that this is the only place people can go to give their taste buds a twist of indian food. This place does not do justice to the real taste of the desired food. THe hygiene is an issue too , dont believe me look at the water before your take a sip or jus run a finger on the dishes before eat off them or from them. Â The food at times seems reheated or refried. When we come to talk about the management , there is no other word to better describe it than " RUDE". As you enter you will be seated, and in a harsh tone asked to decide what you want soon, because they need to close soon. The time for your food to come is a little longer than you accept so its better if you have something to do. If you know what the food is suppose to taste like you might be surprised what your favourite dishes actually taste like traditionally. To anyone going there dont accept to be treated with all respect and a smiling face.. And if you are lucky, you might be the only one there so you will get all the attention or less attitude..
