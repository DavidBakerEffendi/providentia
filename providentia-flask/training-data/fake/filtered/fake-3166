Love the service.  My company is based in Parsippany and I use them for meetings, training and employee luncheons.  I have to say their food is excellent and they don't cut on poritions.  I have worked in the restaurant business and have held lots of events.  I give them 5 Stars. Thanks again Mary Anne
