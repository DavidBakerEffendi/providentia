Everything I tried was pretty good . The mussels were great the first time I ordered them. Not so good the second time! Somebody ought to tell the chef that you can't put opened shell raw mussels in the pot. They are dead& can't be eaten! About 7 or 8 were bad on my second order, also how about being a little more generous with the pizza toppings!!!!
