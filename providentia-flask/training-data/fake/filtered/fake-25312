I love everything about Union Jack's. Â The employees are super friendly and upbeat every time I'm in there. The "cor blimey" with fried pickles and chipotle sauce (a staff recommendation when I didn't know what I wanted) may be the best sandwich I've ever eaten. As far as I'm concerned, the best sandwich shop in burlington if you factor in the friendly service, delicious food, reasonable pricing and ease of parking.
