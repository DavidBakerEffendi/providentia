I was so disappointed on St Patrick's Day as my food came out cold so i asked the bus boy to take it back to the kitchen and get heated up. The Manager shows up at table wih my plater and asked what the problem was. When I told her she says " WELL MY HANDS ON THE PLATE AND IT'S WARM". This was at around 12:45PM, she was wearing big black glasses and a black dress that obviously didn't come in her size. I told her the food was cold and she gave me such a look of disgust and marched off. No apology, just her attitude. .
