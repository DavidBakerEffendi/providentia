Great food.  Very small place with maybe 12 tables, but was cozy. The French onion soup and the creme brulle were the best ever for me. My dining companions had the steak and frites as well as the escargots and were well- pleased.  Prices were quite reasonable for Manhattan.  Only negative for me was that they had only beer and wine.  So, I had to forego my pre-dinner martini.  But, the food and service were so good that I hardly noticed.t
