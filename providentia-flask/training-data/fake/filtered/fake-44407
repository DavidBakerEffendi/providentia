Habana outpost Ok, so I was first introduced to this place bc it was featured on a episode of bizarre foods or extreme bathrooms ...something like that. As far as the real FOOD is concerned its all comes from two dudes inane red truck that is attached to the main building. The food is more MexIcan than Cuban (which is what one would expect given the name) Best food is the CORN ON THE COB covered in parmesan cheese ... so good. Outside of that everything else food wise is just average. The environment is very Hip and cool and GREEN meaning friendly to the environment. It is very conscious of its foot print on THE environment which is cool... but I care Â about the food!!! They have sitting inside and outside.... solar panels and even a movie night. This place is more of a social handout for the "kids" lol .. young hippsters and Brooklyn natives who love to be in the cool spot. Overall I like it and may return... if I am in the mood for some awesome CORN. ON THE COB.
