My wife, a friend from out of town and I had dinner there on a Friday night, six pack of Rolling Rock and a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc in tow.  We had a 9:00 reservation on Friday night and were seated promptly after arriving a few minutes late.  Service was nice and attentive but in no way overbearing.   Food was delicious.  We asked for our dishes to be spicy, which more often than not doesn't end up actually being spicy.  Seems like most ethnic restaurants downgrade the heat to suit our unaccustomed Western palates.   No such dumbing down here though - the heat was legit!  We had the Ingudia Tibs (marinated potobellos) to start and they were very tasty and HOT!  My wife still dreams about them.  May have been a bit too spicy for my taste though, and I'm usually game for some heat.  I was sweatin'!  I'm honestly blanking on what we had for our entrees, but they were all delicious.  I know there was a lamb dish and several veggies.   We love the the family style meal around the one giant plate with the injera.  We don't typically default to Ethiopian for dinner, but we may start.  Great experience overall.
