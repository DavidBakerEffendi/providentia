I have been customer of Hollywood Pizzeria since they were on Hollywood ave. in Fairfield. Their pizza was great then and still is in their new establishment. They have been great to the residents of Fairfield offering free pizza during the latest flood that ravaged Fairfield in 2011. It is these small family businesses that keep the American dream alive. Great Job guys! Your food is delicious, your service is great, and adding the TV in the dining room makes my lunch hour that much more pleasing.
