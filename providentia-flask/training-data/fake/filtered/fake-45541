Worst Italian food I ever ate!  Baked clams were the size of a nickel in a water sauce  (we had ordered two dozen, a real rip off)...linguini and clam sauce had tons of chunks of garlic but no clams that were noticeable...shrimp luciano was boiled shrimp in pink water....and veal parmigiano was tough and tasteless.. tables were one on top of another and we kept getting bumped, restaurant was very noisy to boot! Would never recommend, would never go back...think they are just busy living off the past  or else diners don't get out much..
