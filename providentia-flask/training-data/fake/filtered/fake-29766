Love this place - almost so much that I don't want the secret to get out!! I live in the neighborhood so I've been lucky to try many of the menu options and I've yet to be disappointed!! The juices are fresh and delish, the customer service is exceptional and the food is thoughtful and full of flavor (which is not always the case for a place with such extensive veggie and vegan options). So happy this place opened nearby!
