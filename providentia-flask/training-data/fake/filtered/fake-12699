Empanadas and a variety of other dishes. The empanadas aren't the most authentic, but I liked the empanada fusion idea.... I mean, pepperoni and cheese empanada? Run for your money hot pockets! Anywho, I really enjoyed Â the baked mushroom empanada in combination with that green sauce they provide. The baked empanadas also travel quite well... I took them on the plane and was the envy of my flight. The plantain chips and guacamole were also incredibly good. The sangria was nice and strong. My only gripe was that crust of corn empanadas was a little tough, and the ground meat inside the empanadas tended to be a little crumbly. This place is tiny and gets pretty busy so go on off-peak times. Delivery available
