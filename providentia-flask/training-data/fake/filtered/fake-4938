So so falafel.  Not the best.  It is not crispy enough on the outside.  The greens that come on the sandwhich are very good.   The prices are a little steep as well.   The sides are all good but again pricey.   It is still one of the better places around to grab something on the go.   I would not go out of my way for this.
