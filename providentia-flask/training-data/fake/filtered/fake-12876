I call to place an order for delivery. Unlike most Mexican restaraunts you cant get any combinations here, either FOUR enchiladas or nothing. Ok, so I ask if I can have 1 chicken and the rest cheese, the guy says no, turns out these are frozen dinners that get thawed when ordered so no mixing and matching. I said ok, what kind of dessert do you have? answer: jello. ok, so I said I would take the cheese enchiladas and a soda. I waited and waited and no one ever delivered. I called and called and no one ever answered the phone. Finally it arrived and it was TERRIBLE food. I threw 90% of it away and I know that is wasteful but what else do you do with waste? I have since discovered Lolita's Mexican food, BEST in Manhattan that is for sure. Skip this place and head over the Lolita's..the enchiladas were grand and so was the guacamole.
