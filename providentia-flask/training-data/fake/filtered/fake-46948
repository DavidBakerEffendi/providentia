Good place w good environment but the fish was so bad that i couldn't even believe they served it. Also i asked for pasta to go and waiter said the chef does not take pasta to go. Whyy i asked? He said thats just the chefs preference. Seemed illogical to me. Anyways i ended u paying 170 bucks for what seemed like nothing. 2 wines 2 salads 2 super bad raw fish
