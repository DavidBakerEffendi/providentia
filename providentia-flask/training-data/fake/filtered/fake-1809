The atmosphere and food were wonderful! We ordered an avocado stuffed with Shrimp and an amazing sauce for our appetizer.  For dinner we ordered a whole chicken, the Saffron Rice and beans and plantains. We had 1 full pitcher of Sangria which was delicious.  For dessert we had the tres leches also delicious with two cappuccinos. The entire meal including drinks, appetizer, and dessert was delicious and as an added bonus very reasonable; $90 for two.
