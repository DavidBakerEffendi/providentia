This is a great spot to try an Italian dish and cheap wine. It looked small at first, but as you keep going further there were so many tables in the back and on the enclosed porch. I ordered the Farfalle Integrali and it was amazing! This is the best Italian dish I have had in a long time. I was hearty, yet fresh with Tomato and Pesto. We also ordered the Sun dried Tomato Puree, Pesto and Pine nuts as an appetizer which did not disappoint! It was really delicious! There were plenty of people there for a Sunday night - it seemed like a really happening place to be. If there weren't so many other places to try in NY I would definitely be back!
