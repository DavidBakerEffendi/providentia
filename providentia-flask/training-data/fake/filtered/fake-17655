I wish I could give a review on the food at Vermont Tap House, but unfortunately we didn't even get that far.  I can, however, give a review on the service.  We got to the restaurant at 3:30 on a Sunday.  We were seated fairly quickly, but after 15 minutes and no server we started to become concerned.  Looking around, the place was fairly empty, so the lack of attention seemed unwarranted.  Finally, the waitress came over, put down our dishes, and said, "Sorry folks, I'll be right back."  Another 10 minutes pass, and we were starting to get a bad feeling.  There were only 2 of us, and we had a very simple order.  We see the waitress start to head our way and just when we think we're making progress, she walks over and says, "I have 2 other things to take care of and I'll be back."  We were floored.  We wanted one small pizza and 2 glasses of wine.  That was it.  It would have taken her 30 seconds to take the order and get that started for 2 people that had already waited 25 minutes.  We couldn't take it anymore, so we left.  I was very disappointed.  I don't know what their food is like, but if their service is a reflection of their business model, I would say to stay FAR away from Vermont Tap House.
