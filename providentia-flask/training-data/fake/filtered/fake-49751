I love this little restaurant. The food is autentic and full of flavours. If you drink wine I suggest the Nero D'Avola . Try the Branzino is a ++++. I also suggest to try the Polenta con Funghi you will not be disappointed. I'm looking forward to go back and experience one more time a delicious meal.
