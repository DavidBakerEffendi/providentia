Ate here twice in my short time so far in Philly. Just moved here from Houston. Must say awesome awesome awesome Mexican food. Also great drinks and such an awesome selection of tequila and margarita's. The guacamole sampler is a must have as a app or even a full course. Then the flank steak with black dire beans and mango sauce was really good and filling. Have been to some great Mexican places living in Texas my whole live but feel that they hit a home run with this one. So happy moving to Philly and finding a place like home.
