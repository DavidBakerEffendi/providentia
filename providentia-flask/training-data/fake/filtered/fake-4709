I was visiting family in Staten Island and on the suggestion of my mother decided to try Blue.  I was a little nervous because I had heard that though the food was delicious, the wait staff was rude and obnoxious.  Still I decided to give it a shot... Our waitress was amazing.  She was warm and welcoming.  While she was taking our order, my stepfather managed to knock over his beer and my martini.  The waitress was so kind to him.  She tried to reassure him and lessen his embarrassment and she made certain that the mess was cleaned.  The manager (I believe she was the manager) came over and apologized (even though it wasn't their fault) and replaced the drinks, no charge.  Also, once informed that someone in our party suffered from a severe shellfish allergy, our waitress took extra care in ensuring that the dish was cooked away from shellfish items and notified us when such accommodations were impossible. On to the food...  For appetizers we had the avocado mushroom carpaccio.  The mushroom were a little saltier than I like my food, but they were still delicious.  For the main course I had a fillet with a lobster tail and my mother and her husband had the rib eye.  My mother enjoyed her food tremendously.  I thought the presentation was nice but my steak was a little too charred for my taste and the demi-glace didn't offer enough flavor.  Overall I gave this place four stars, because while the food may not have been to my liking, others did enjoy their meal and I truly to appreciate the professionalism and kindness of their waitress.
