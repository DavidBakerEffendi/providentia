I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. The tapas was incredible. We got 3 different tapas for the two of us and split the paella (a single portion) and left stuffed. The staff was the friendliest I've ever seen and other customers respond by also being friendly. On Friday they had a Spanish guitar player who did a pleasant mix of traditional and rock tunes with a Spanish bent. Good selection of beers also. Overall a extremely pleasant dining experience.
