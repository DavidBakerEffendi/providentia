I've been spending a good amount of time at Good Dog over the past couple of weeks.  A few friends movved into the neighborhood and the bar is literally right next door to their place. Incredibly chill atmosphere on all three levels,  everyone knows about the dog pictures lining the place but that is where the great experience ends.  I decided to try the much talked about Good Dog Burger, but what I got was a thoroughly undercooked, sloppy mess of meat, onions and cheese.  It was a bit more like eating a sloppy joe than it was a burger.  I think I'll pass on the food next time around.   Our service was great on the first floor, but as you get up to the game room, not an employee in site.  I understand on a busy night that maybe the second floor bartenders cant make it up a flight of stairs, but its a pain in the ass to walk down for your drinks, especially when they ask for everybodys ID everytime.  Hire a server for upstairs, I'll even do it for you.
