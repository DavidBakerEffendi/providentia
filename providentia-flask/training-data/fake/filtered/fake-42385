Saxon + Parole is now at the top of my list for a chic and delicious night out in NYC. I went with my best friend and we felt like we were transported to another realm - we sat in the downstairs area - the setting was like being in a in an episode of Boardwalk Empire. The food was delish from beginning to end. I had an asparagus appetizer with yuzu and truffle that was literally the best thing I have eaten in a long time. Oh, and the chocolate souffle - thank you! I look for it everywhere I go. Can't wait to go back!
