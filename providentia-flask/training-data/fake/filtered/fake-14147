Awesome tapas! I went this weekend and shared 4 plates among 4 people. The vegetarian tapas platter is AWESOME. there are so many flavors and textures, all of them done beautifully. The fried artichoke was my favorite. the braised beef dish was also amazing, plenty of flavor. the waitress told us that it was Spanish "comfort food" Reservations are REQUIRED; I saw them turn away people for not having reservations. I made a reservation for 7 and was seated by 7:10.
