We've been to this bakery several times for their deli. We used to rate the food quality as excellent but more recently it is just average. The service on the other hand has moved from above average to severally below average. Let me set the stage. There are a total of 7 workers behind the counters (it's a big and long bakery), not including those "in the back" who prep, bake, etc. 3-4 out of those 7 employees are near or at the deli area. However, only one person will actually make sandwiches, provide cold cuts, or salads. And this one individual is VERY MEAN. He doesn't acknowledge you or have any eye contact. There is a good chance this might be why other employee's won't get near or assist. He is also very slow so the line just backs up. Even though people were lined up before the 5pm cut off for the deli, he yelled at them to go away and just left. It's just unbelievable; we've seen this happen the last two times we went. We will never return or recommend this place again.
