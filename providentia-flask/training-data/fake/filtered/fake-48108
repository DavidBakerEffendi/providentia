Me and my family wanted to try this osteria for long time and we always decided on something else. we should have stuck to that this time. All the order was like frozen food, heated and put Â on plates. Was better just going to the supermarket and get pre-cooked foods. All I got from the appetizer to the main dish was too salty. Next time ........there will be NO next time at this restaurant
