The restaurant must really care about patrons waistline because you really need a microscope to see your $36 portion of halibut and a high resolution microscope to see your equally overpriced desert. It's ok to charge more for really good food, but would it kill them to make a portion a reasonable size so you don't have to look for a hot dog vendor at the exit? You should stick with their pastas because the portions are small enough as not to break your Atkins diet. The food is not that great to Â justify really small potions. The bartender was nice and the cocktail my wife ordered was really good.
