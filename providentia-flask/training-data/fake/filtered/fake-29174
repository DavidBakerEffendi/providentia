I have been coming to Maison Mathis since its opening...I am a first year grad student at Yale University coming from NYC, this place is a little Haven in New Haven. My classmates and I frequently stop by for meetings, dinners, breakfasts, and between rehearsal pick-me-ups. The food is unique, convenient yet delectable and sophisticated, With is healthy portions and respectful prices Maison offers an open invitation to all people from all walks of like to enjoy some Belgium love and hospitality. I personally make my way to Maison at least five times in the work week at random times, with this hectic schedule good food is a must and the employees and management team that I see on the regular meet me with anything from a firm handshake to a wink to a personal greeting depending on the temperature traffic or the urgency in which I bombastically enter into the line. I cannot say enough about Maison the employees have become familiar faces and the coveted back seating round table in a grad students dream. Keep on keeping on you guys are doing absolutely great work.
