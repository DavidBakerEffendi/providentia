I had the worst dining experience ever at the Orange, CT location. First we ordered the fresh made guacamole as an appetizer and had to wait for the warm flour tortillas to come along with it. Then our waitress brought someone else's orders to our table. I had ordered a vegetarian burrito with no cheese. And while my vegetarian burrito arrived with no cheese on top or within, it had pieces of pork in it so I had to send it back. (How can meat end up in a vegetarian burrito?) The waitress brought back another burrito within only a few minutes and I could see why--the whole thing was stuffed with nothing more than cold lettuce and rice which had cheese in it (which I expressly requested not to be put either on top or inside the burrito). It seemed as through the plate had just been put together in a hurry since the first time came out wrong--only the rush made it come out wrong again. What ticked me off the most is that the menu says any plate could be adjusted according to request, only none of my requests were ever honored. And not only that, we were still charged full price for everything. No manager came to see us. We should have at least had one plate deducted or one drink to compensate for the inconveniences and for what was honestly a very unsatisfying meal. Needless to say we will never be coming back here and I advise all to not waste their time or money there either.
