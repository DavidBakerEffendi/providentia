VERY RUDE FRONT GIRL. used to LOVE this place, have been twice in last month. There is a very rude girl working the front "seating" arrangement. I wish I could describe her more than that Dark Hair, had more of a personality fitting for maybe Best Buy- When you encounter her, you will know. Too bad, great fries, mussels and beers. Had a repeat issue and with different groups of friends with the same girl. We just will not go back, I will literally walk out if I see that girl working there anymore- hate to be that way, Lobster Night used to be special, maybe the sweetheart of a manager will see her for who she is.. Ahh Petite Abeille we go way back....Please get rid of her so we can enjoy you!!!
