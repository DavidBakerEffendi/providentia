We frequent Panevino about once a month and have been doing so for years. Whether you go for lunch, dinner or with a large group, it is always a pleasant atmosphere regardless of how busy they may be. I'm all about outdoor seating and Panevino not only has an outdoor patio, but a sun room for when the weather is not so nice, in addition to their main dining room areas. The hostess is always accommodating regardless of if there might be a wait. Service here is always on point. I have never experienced poor service or lengthy waits for our food regardless of what we order. Panevino is a refreshing Italian eatery that offers fresh, consistent and delicious food, complimented by terrific service. Check it out!
