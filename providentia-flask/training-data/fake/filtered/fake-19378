Everything about Crispy Pizza is great. The pizza is delicious. I love the sauce and the crust on the pizza (thin or thick). I had the eggplant parmesan which was also amazing. There are so many different varieties of pizza I can't wait to try. The restaurant is brand new, clean and they have a huge flat screen on the wall playing sports. It's great for families. Crispy Pizza isn't too close to my home but the trip is totally worth it for some amazing New York pizza and Italian dishes. Love it and I will be coming back!
