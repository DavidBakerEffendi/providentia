Recommend by my father's friend, we decided to give it a try. Apparently there is also a buffet counter. Tasty buffet, includes mango lassi and even whole wheat roti batter chicken Â awesome awesom ! Tandoori chicken_leg /thigh, one of the best I have ever had! Lamb chops I never saw anybody to keep in buffet but I really surprised the are serving lamb chops in buffet that was awesome awesome! Price are extremely reasonable. Service is good, the waters are helpful and accommodating. There is free parking lot with regal cinema. You can watch movies after you finesh ur food .
