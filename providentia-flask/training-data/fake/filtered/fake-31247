Since I live about 30 seconds away ive had the pleasure of sampling Adriennes fine cuisine numerous times and im happy to say its never been disappointing. Located in the heart of the financial district on stone st, Adriennes brings a eclectic and trendy feel to the dinning experiences in the area. Arrive during lunch or dinner hours and the place is always PACKED (might want to make a reservation). On to the food. My favs include the mussels linguine - fantastically seasoned muscles thrown over a bed of fresh linguini, little lemon, little garlic butter - delish. As far as the pizza goes, the old fashioned (grandmas) pie is a MUST. With numerous toppings to choose from you cant go wrong. Nice and thin/crispy crust with LOADS of toppings and cheese, grandma would be proud. By no means is FiDi considered a mecca for food but if your in the area give Adriennes a try, its worth the wait. (like I said, make a reservation or you could easily be waiting 30 mins on a table - at any time.)
