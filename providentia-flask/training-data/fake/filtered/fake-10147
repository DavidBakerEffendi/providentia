I recently had their Eel Set for lunch (11.50 + tax). It was as good as eel rolls can get, and the chef even included a free salmon and shrimp piece into my order. What really caught my attention was how fresh the salmon sashimi tasted; points for freshness. Came with some pretty bad miso soup. The place is pretty small so if u got a large group this probably won't be the best place. Nice HDTV in the middle of the restaurant. This place even comes with free Wifi (which gives you something to do while you wait for your order). Very warm hospitality by the waitress and chef. I think i just found my favorite sushi joint.
