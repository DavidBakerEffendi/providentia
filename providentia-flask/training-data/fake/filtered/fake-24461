Okk...I know,this is probably the most popular Chinese restaurant in Chinatown,NYC Â (though I coudn't figure it out,why???)....and I had high expectations set,which were definitely not fulfilled!!!!...I will explain you,why!!!!... Firstly,the place is so dirty,smelly,small for so many people,very poorly maintained...a perfect ghetto.... Secondly,the service!!!...It cannot be worse than this...you have to wait in a long line and also act as a gatekeeper and after that,when you sit,they will not give you enough time to think what to take...even if you try to take it,you will see their annoyed faces...and my friend ordered one dish,which was served to me,and I asked the waiter to serve it to my friend,instead...the waiter uttered something in Chinese with lots of annoyance (I know for sure,they are cusswords)!!!....so RUDE!!!! Thirdly,after waiting for a long time,and it was a hot day (Memorial Day,2014)we were not even served with water...we had to drink from our own bottle,... Fourthly,the waiter did not know,what type of wine was served as the House Wine on that day...he had to go inside and he took out the whole bottle to show us...it was so much ridiculous!!! and Finally,the FOOD!!!!!....oh my god!...it was horrible!...the soup dumplings were better of the lot...but was OK type,not great,that you would die for it!...I have tasted many dumplings which are far better than this!...and the other dishes in the main course was not upto the mark!...one even tasted so bad,we thought it was rotten!!!...We didn't like the food,at all,though we were hungry like sharks!!!!....that's the main thing.... and for that horrendous service,you have to pay the 15% tips on the total bill amount....which we really thought,we would never give...but it was added to the bill!!...guess what,they know,they don't deserve it,so people are not gonna give it!...so they just forcefully take it from you! I would never ever go back to this terrible place....it sucks....please don't ever go....don't recommend others!....I would not even give them one star,if I could!
