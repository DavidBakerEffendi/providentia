Absolutely charming! Bouley offers a beautiful setting and world-class service for that special meal...the tasting menu was perfect for a graduation lunch with the family. The wine (was a red from Languedoc) was supremely good. The service was great - they even accommodated my request to order a dish from the Prix Fixe menu as an a la carte dish - the Rouget with Iranian Saffron Risotto. Then came the Halibut which was almost overwhelming rich, but oh-so tender and perfectly cooked. Until again, when I am in the mood... I hope to dine at Bouley again... I will try the pre-fix lunch as suggested by previous reviews.
