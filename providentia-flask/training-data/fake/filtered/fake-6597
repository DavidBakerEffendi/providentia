We have just returned from Griamldi's, so the impressions are relatively fresh. Pizza was ok, but truthfully I would pick Ernie's or Modern over them any day. Service was horrendous, we had to wait for our waitress more than 20 minutes to get refills of water or get additional items. We are not a super demanding croud, but even for us it was unacceptable. I will probably not return, as being pretty knowledgeable of the pizza scene in nh, there are superior options. If they want to compete the service needs to be improved and truthfully the pizza as well.
