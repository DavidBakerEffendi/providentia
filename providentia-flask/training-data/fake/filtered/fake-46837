A fabulous addition to UES!  This is not your typical Indian restaurant.  It's a wonderful restaurant with good wine & drinks that happens to serve delicious Indian food.  Friendly service, inviting atmosphere, pleasant noise level, moderate prices all add to the charm. It's a small restaurant - reservation is recommended.  A delightful place for a date or small groups.  Will be visiting again soon.
