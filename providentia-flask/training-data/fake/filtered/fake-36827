Was here last week as part of a large group, the person who took care of us was the most surly individual I have encountered in the service industry.  His inability to handle the 7 people that were a part of the gathering left him appearing to seem like a loss child in a supermarket.  When trying to get a drink from the bar, bartender asked if I could order from the table man.  What the fuck really.  So I couldn't get a drink from the table or from the bar.  So should I go to Duane Reade and buy a six pack.  Yes.
