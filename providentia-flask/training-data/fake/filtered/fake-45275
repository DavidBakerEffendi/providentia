Hmm, here's something different:  A "Sample" Charge??! Beware! Wife and I were seated on upper deck early on a beautiful evening August 1st. Young male server was prompt and courteous. I inquired about a good beer and he suggested something from the local area. Since I was unfamiliar with it, he volunteered to bring a sample.....good idea. The sample was small in volume and served in a small glass. But it was tasty so I ordered a glass. Our meals were decent, nice atmosphere, etc. When the check was presented, I quickly scanned it and noticed a unusual entry along with the glass of beer, wife's wine, and two entrees: "Sample .25" WHAT??! A 25 cent charge for a very small sample of beer? I've had a number of primarily wine samples and a few beer samples offered over the years, but I've NEVER been charged for a sample, nor was I ever advised by the server there was a charge for the sample. Wife said, please......don't make a scene....it's only 25 cents and we've had a long day. Oh, but I was sorely tempted to have some fun with the Ice House folks. Good thing the manager didn't wander by.  Instead, I'm back home in Florida and left with posting my, "BEWARE - SAMPLE CHARGES LURKING!" on restaurant review sites. (But the Shelburne Museum is fantastic....if you like early Americana.......a great place with wonderful collections in unique settings.)
