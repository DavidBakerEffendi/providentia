Holy crap. This place is really good. So good that I may start making pilgrimages to Bed-Stuy just to eat here. So good that I cursed my misfortune that I wouldn't have time to eat here the following day. Yummy, simple drinks on the cheap. Eccentric and sweet service. Awesome music. Number one, though, is that freaking hot chicken. I don't especially love fried chicken. Nor do I especially love extremely spicy things. Yet, I especially love that dish. That with the watermelon salad on the side to take off the heat? A-right.
