I was looking for authentic Brazilian food and found it here. The food was delightful! The staff is very friendly and efficient. The decoration is beautiful. Very cozy place with natural materials and a Brazilian touch. The rope panels are just the best idea I've seen. Very nice! I ate the "bacalhau" or cod fish and it was just as I wanted, amazing. Highly recommend it!
