Aniello's has the BEST cheese pizza.....we've had Pepe's, Modern, etc, and Aniello's pizza tops everything everywhere so far!  The cheese tastes rich and buttery, and it is at its peak on a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday night.  For some reason on Thursdays through Sundays, their busiest nights, it gets a little neglected, but is still good.  With extra cheese, it's out of this world delicious!  The service when we dine in is always great, and they are all very friendly and care about our dining experience.  We don't even order cheese pizza from anywhere else any longer because they don't compare to Aniello's.  Haven't tried any other dishes, except the stuffed breads, which are great, because we're so enamored with the cheese pizza!
