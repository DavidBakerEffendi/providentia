Ok, so for years now whenever in New Haven, which pretty much revolves around Yale, I've been barstool resident at Delaney's.  Well, it burned to the ground last week and I've been forced to venture out in search of new watering hole that can satisfy my Jones for good brew.  A great deal of thought was clearly put into the Cask Republic's design, both an open floor plan and ambient lighting are welcoming as you walk through the doors, the selection impressive. If I were to rate them on the beer and food alone it'd be 6 stars! Where they lack is warm, personalized service. The bartentenders are dismissive, acting largely like you're a pest when you make inquiries/ask questions,  mine went as far as to roll his eyes and disapproved of my choice...Beer elitism!  The service at the table was swift and courteous, but cold and mechanical,  at the tables next to ours we hear the same "script" over and over, and our servers knowledge of beer was cursory at best. Great looking bar, fantastic food, vast selection, but just missing that x factor that makes a bar a neighborhood bar...needs to build a culture.
