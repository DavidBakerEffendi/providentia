I haven't had too many lobster, shrimp, or crab roll. Trying theirs, it made me wonder why I didn't tried it sooner. They represented for the rolls beautifully. The place should be called Luke's Seafood, but Â Luke's Lobster is got to be up there with the best of them cause they are not bad at all, and on top of that the chips and the soda is a good pairing with the roll. If you haven't ate any of the three, make sure you order the TASTE OF MAINE. You won't be disappointed at all!!!!!!!. Matter of fact, you might be a fan like me. Eat and enjoy cause you will like or love, and don't forget the chips.
