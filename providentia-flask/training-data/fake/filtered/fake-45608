This place was already a winner after 2 visits of great food, atmosphere and service. On the 3rd visit, I found myself staring up at their chalkboard trying to choose a beer on tap while waiting to get a table for me and the family. A tall dude wearing an earpiece, possibly manager/owner, suddenly comes over and asks what type of beer I'm in mood for. I tell him a wheat IPA and he has me follow him to the bar, he orders a beer, hands it to me and says that it's delicious and on the house. That, right there, is going above and beyond for customer service. Thank you tall dude, that made my day in an already great restaurant.
