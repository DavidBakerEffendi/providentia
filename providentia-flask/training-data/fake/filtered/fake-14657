Just go and enjoy... the burgers and the service are great- better than Zinburger IMHO. There were a few glitches but they just opened...they will work that all out. Great staff and management. We all enjoyed our food and they now have happy hour drink Â specials too. The menu can be a little confusing especially with the build your own burger part.
