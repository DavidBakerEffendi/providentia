Just ate there today the food was very fresh and great quality , service could not have been any better and the place had a lot of people eating there. Had the A menu was 9.99 all you can eat I'm on a budget and could not eat all the food they bring you. Will be going back for sure to move my game up to the 15.99 menu for some more choices on the meat but you cook your own meat so if it's not cooked the way you like it lol it's on you...
