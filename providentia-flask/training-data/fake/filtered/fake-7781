Geronimo Tequila Bar is just that...it is a bar.  The food is "upscale" bar food, mediocre, thoroughly uninspired and over-priced.  The mini bison burgers were not as good as white castle burgers and at ten times the price.  They have a large tequila bar but who could afford them at these astronomical prices...ten to forty dollars a shot!!!
