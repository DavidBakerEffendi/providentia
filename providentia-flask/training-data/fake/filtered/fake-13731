I always return to to Juliana's because of two points...the food and the wonderful service my waiter David provides every time we have him. Last night I brought my wife and a close friend for a meal with hopes of impressing him. So we decided to let David take over for us. Low and behold everything came out on time LIKE CLOCK WORK. With every bite delicious, full of flavor. That number 2 followed by the # 4 hit the spot. Did I forget the soup and salad? ....super! Afterwards we were so stuffed how could we have dessert? David, we appreciated everything you did to make our dinner a fantastic success. Even with the small table we were sat at you made the best of it. Also I told your boss about you but he didn't seemed to impressed by what I said...tooo bad. When you come in to Julianna you'll find wonderful food always fresh and delicious. While your there ask for David and let him be your chauffeur for the evening.
