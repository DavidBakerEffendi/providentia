Think the waiters & waitresses are RUDE. The bar manger as well. I always get a racist vibe. Love the pizza!!! But the people?? Don't know how they stay in business with that service. Other recommendations Rock It Pizza in West Orange! Def it's competition just not thin crust. The Service makes me not want to go back to Star they don't care about their customers!
