I walked by this lovely place the other day about an hour before I had to board my plane to Miami. It wasn't that busy so I walked in, took a seat at the15-seat bar, looked around to drink in the atmosphere and proceeded to sit there for FIFTEEN MINUTES while the three young men (count 'em, three) behind the bar patently ingored me. Now - I'm old enough to know how to get a bartender's attention, however, it simply wasn't going to happen. As a chef and restaurant owner, there was simply NO excuse for not at least acknowledging a person who was sitting there for that long.  One of  them should have at least said to me "Hi, I'll be with you in a few minutes," but sadly, no. Had they been employees at my restaurant, I'd have fired all three of them. Regardless, after 15 minutes (this is no exaggeration, I timed it) I got up and left. All I can say is that they were lucky it was me, not my cousin who is one of the top food and restaurant critics in the country. Chances of me ever going back: zero.
