Went there a few nights ago with my best friend who is from Boston. I had my usual Chicken Picatta, super yummy with a side of roasted potates and extra steamed vegetables that the waitress recommended to me. My friend also enjoyed her spinach and ricotta ravioli fell in love with the place. Friendly and helpfull staff, we will come back !!!! ps : try their homemade tiramisu
