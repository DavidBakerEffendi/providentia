My husband and I were feeling quite ravenous due to the gloom of a dreary Saturday, Ofrenda was the cure. Three youthful, fresh-faced workers greeted us at the door with beaming slightly imperfect smiles, which only added to the charm. As we had walked three blocks in the muggy inclement weather, I was thirsty for a beer. The selection was wide and varied, they even had Presidente. The only man in my life enjoyed the Huevos Pochados, and trust me they were almost tastier than his huevos. Ay perdon. The skinny girl in me opted for the Chilaquiles Verdes. I was delighted because they tasted like the chilaquiles of my abuelita. Must try dinner soon.
