I was looking forward to trying this place as I walk by all the time, and after going last weekend, it was as good as I hoped. My friends and I tried a couple of cocktails - the Buenos Noches, Luna, and the James and the Giant Peach. The BN,L was awesome - spicy chipotle flavor, but not overwhelming. The JatGP was tasty - hard to go wrong with bourbon, maple syrup, and peach. I dug the decor and vibe - dark wood and lots of beautiful metalwork. The wine rack over the horseshoe bar was pretty cool. I can't wait to go back and try some of the food. I'm excited to have this place in the neighborhood.
