Grew up in jersey, moved to ny for school and then nyc to live for a few years.....had taken pizza for granted before i moved west for a couple of years......moved back to the city a couple years ago and have been checking out all the local neighborhood pizzeria's.....if i passed by a place i would grab a slice even if I had food already or was headed to dinner somewhere......all about pizza. Finally made my way to Grimaldi's in bklyn late one rainy night when there was no crazy line........figured the place was overrated....had to be...especially since it is basically a chain nowadays with spots in texas in new mex?........can't speak for other places but as far as this one goes it DESERVES THE HYPE........pizza was perfect....so good I had to go back the next day and get another pie (live UES -thx zipcar).....wow.  I say it is tied with my favorite spot in Pennington NJ - Vitos which makes a square Brooklyn Style pizza in honor of I'm guessing grimalidi's.  Try this pizza. Also very cool atmosphere.....not hipster or anything....just real.  when i went there were no tourists so i don't know about prime time.....
