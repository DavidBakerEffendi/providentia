After seeing favorable reviews on Yelp, my husband and I tried TRB last week.  I'm not sure we will go back any time soon, although I'm always willing to give anyone a second try, especially to support a local business.  Our waitress was extremely inattentive, and couldn't even be bothered to pour our wine for us (it's a BYOB, but really?).  Once she brought our check, it was almost 15 minutes before she returned -- I can understand that happening when a place is swamped, but there were never more than 4 tables of patrons in there at once, and she wasn't the only wait staff.  I was really looking forward to a wonderful Italian meal, but the food was nothing special. I had heard great things about the fried risotto balls, so we tried them, and they were just OK.  The little neck clams may need to be re-named miniscule neck clams.  The only thing that was great was the price -- we got a lot of food and the bill was quite reasonable.  I hope this was just beginner's bad luck on our part! I really want to see it survive!
