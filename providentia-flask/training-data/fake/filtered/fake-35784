Staff was incredibly friendly, but service was slow. Our orders were wrong, then the waitress forgot my fries so we waited 5... 10... 15 minutes before I could even get ahold of her to ask about the fries. When the fries finally came out, we were already done with our meals AND the fries were not even cooked through! They were soggy and cold in the middle. We won't be going back there again.
