Came to this place after driving 32 miles for it as Yelp reviews made it pretty attractive. A great brunch place to be at, Excellent service and food, of course. Potions are huge, none of us six could eat even half of our orders. I would recommend the owners to add some pics to the menu, we had to order using the pics on Yelp. Will be back again whenever in Philly area.
