While I thoroughly love Lucy's food which is absolutely delicious, the service is awful and the staff has no common courtesy.  I had asked a wrap to made into a sandwich to be made into a wrap, which seems easy enough.  However after being told it was possible, a second staff member rudely remarked that they couldn't do that.  I had been there every day for lunch for 4 days straight and now I will not be going back for a while.
