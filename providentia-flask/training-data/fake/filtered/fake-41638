Surprised by the positive reviews. This was the worst food I have ever had. Masala sauce was sickeningly sweet and not much else... totally bland of the flavors I was expecting. It was also luke warm like it had been poorly microwaved. Chicken was under cooked and not edible. Ordered garlic naan it was soggy and needed more garlic. The samosa was the only saving grace and was actually quite good unfortunately the sauces provided were awful. Â Sick to my stomach for only $35 plus a tip, heck of a deal....
