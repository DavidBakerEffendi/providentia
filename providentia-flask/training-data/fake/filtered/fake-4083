An incredible selection of beers and whiskeys, bourbons, ryes - everything liquid! I was not convinced by the food though!  Burgers were a bit too dry, shrimp sliders extremely dry (the shrimp was so deep fried there was hardly anything left that resembled a shrimp) and both batches of the IPA fries we got were a bit cold-greasy. Old Rasputin Imperial Stout stood out with it's predictable good quality.   I will not order food again, but will definitely grab some drinks the next time in the neighborhood. (For the sweet-tooths, there's a Hungarian pastry shop on the corner!)
