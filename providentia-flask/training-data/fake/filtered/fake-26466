I am completely done with this place. Never again. I tried to order a Sicilian pie twice and I was told "we don't have the dough prepared". I had ordered personal pies when  they 1st opened, when I ordered them a 2nd time i got a horrible less than paper thin crust pie that my kids couldn't even pick up to fold & eat. Don't  order the "Buffalo chicken pizza' if you really want the blue cheese dressing on it-because even though it states that it comes on the pizza on the menu, unless you ask for it, they don't put it on the pizza. I had ordered 3 small specialty Pies several times, until 5/30/2014 I was told I could no longer order small pies, I had to order large pies because "it was too much work " to put it through the computer system. Every time you get a pie, 2 or 3 of the slices are folded over and stuck together because the pie is oval shaped instead of round and so nobody wants to eat the "screwed up mushed " slices. The  6 or 7  times I had ordered from this place, I had never spent less than $35 and I spent over $65 when I had company at one time. On Friday, 5/30/2014   I was so disgusted with the customer service--and the dis respectfulness I experienced, that  I cancelled my order, walked out and went back to ordering from Fontana's Pizzeria. The sad thing is, I live right across the street and if that is how a neighborhood customer is treated then I feel sorry for how any other customer is treated. I am so disappointed.
