I love the American Retro - this is the perfect neighborhood bar!  The staff is fabulous, and the easygoing atmosphere makes it a great place to catch up with old friends or make new ones.  This is also the best spot for  fueling up before (or after) shows at Terminal 5.  Plus, they throw a great party - Halloween was amazing.  I'm looking forward to many more good times at this new favorite!
