I am a huge fan of the food and atmosphere here but will never go back. Â I have been a loyal customer with my family here for a year, ironically. The owner for an unknown reason has refused service to me the last two times I have been here with my 3 year old son (who has always been well behaved there) to have brunch. He told me there is a "wait" and completely booked without offering to put us on the waiting list either time. Mind you, there were also obvious open tables each time. I called the restaurant 2 minutes later to ask if there was a wait and they said there was not a wait and to come right on in. What a disappointment. No matter how amazing the food is I will never go back, nor will I recommend this restaurant to my many friends in the neighborhood (which I used to send everyone here by the way).
