We are old timers. But! Since recent changes in management, tonight, we sadly report that we have had our last meal at Rat's.  What a mess. The bartender is gone. The new bartenders are clueless. They have no savoir-faire whatsoever. They don't want to banter at all..they are all business and not much of it...no smiles, no eye contact, lousy drinks!  The food was worse. Much worse. The  Viscysoisse was tasteless.  The Foie gras was insipid and almost ghastly, the famous fries were no longer the same exquisite fries of once-upon-a-time at Rat's!  The service was frightening. One server was not enough. It took 40 minutes for one single order of fries to come, and that only with the threat that we would walk out if it didn't come in five minutes (not worth the wait!). A second server couldn't make it happen. A conversation with the manager led to the following response to me, the customer:  "If you're not happy I don't care if you leave, fine!"  In my astonishment, I asked to see David Horowitz, the boss, and the manager said he send him right over. He never came!   The place is beautiful. It was always it's draw. But the food, while never scintillating, still supported the setting and the service was always impeccable. WHAT HAPPENED HERE?  What a sham, what a shame.
