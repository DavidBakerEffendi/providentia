Had a great experience at LaVa on new year's eve. The food was exceptional, the decor is really cool and everyone there was helpful. I suggest giving them a try for their Â "after dark" dinner menue on Thur., Fri. and Sat. nights. I've been a couple of times for coffee. It is usually crowded, but that is just a testament to their popularity. The regular coffee by LaColumbe is delicious and their pasteries are great. Service is quick, and I personally love the funky couches and decor. I live in the 'burbs', hanging here gives me the real urban feeling.
