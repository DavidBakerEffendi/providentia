I ordered pizza and a salad at 7:30 this evening. I called at 8:40 to see if it was on its way. They assured me it was. At 10:00 pm I called back and cancelled my order. How do you operate a pizza delivery service and are not capable of delivering in a 2 and a half our time period? There food is good but not worth a wait like that! WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THE AGAIN!
