I only have one small complaint and that is it took awhile to get silverware but that didn't stop me from those delicious fried chicken wings.  Look, I inhaled this food, it is that delicious.  The food is like my mom used to make.  The fried chicken juicy and golden brown.  The potato salad had eggs and mustard in it. The collard green were not cooked to death.  The sweet tea is super sweet but it was a nice contrast to all the savory flavors.  I have a piece of the red velvet cake in the fridge for breakfast.  Hungry yet?  Well then check out Amy Ruth's the hours are good so they're probably open.
