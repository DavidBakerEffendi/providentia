Stopped in last Saturday night after seeing a movie at a local cinema.  No reservation but we were graciously greeted by the hostess, Alice, and made to feel very welcome.  Started with the Brussels sprouts followed by the hangar steak frites and the Caddy burger.  Both cooked to order and very good.   Service was attentive.  Definitely a place to hit.  We will back.
