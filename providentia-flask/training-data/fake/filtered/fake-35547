I'm kind of a pizza junkie.  I have my own brick oven.  I've eaten pizza from Alaska to Naples.  A couple of weeks ago I had the luck to be in New Haven in on a Wednesday evening.  I knew I wanted to try Modern Apizza and was able to track it down.  The staff was friendly and fast and within 15 minutes, I had what is probably the best pizza I have ever eaten.  The crust was a perfect blend of crusty and chewy and the sauce was perfect.  I hope I get back through New Haven soon.
