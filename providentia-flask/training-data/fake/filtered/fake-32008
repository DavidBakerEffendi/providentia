Cheng Du is the best Chinese restaurant in West Hartford and one of the best in Connecticut. I entered this restaurant a stranger years ago and have become a very appreciative friend. Albert and Irene and their hard-working staff go to great lengths to make sure every patron is served thoroughly and respectfully from a full bar and a diverse menu of offerings, some more typical "American" Chinese fare such as General Tso's Chicken and Lo Mein and many more authentic Cantonese and pan-asian dishes and house specialties such as X.O. Shrimp or Chicken, Shrimp Pavilion and the Sea Bass special. As noted by other reviewers, service is quick and polite, with complimentary tea and water served upon request. It is also common for the customer to be offered other treats, compliments of the house, such as exotic fruits or other foods in season, an extra drink, what have you. I have over the years sampled about 80% of the over 60 entrees offered on the menu Â - Cheng Du Reunion and Three Delicacies with Basil and Leek are my favorites - and have found the food and its preparation to be excellent without fail. Add to this that the owner/proprietors will cater to whatever wishes and needs the diner puts to them - take the sugar out of the sauce, exclude or add this or that vegetable, substitute beef for pork in a dish, add more broccoli (my standby) - and the whole crew's bend-over-backward-to-make-sure-the-customer is happy attitude, and Cheng Du is a winner.
