We rolled into the Gramercy Tavern one night. Â A few tasty drinks, then a table up front in 45 mins ... My cravings for their great tenderloin satisfied. Learned that the bottled beer menu is outrageously good; my foodie guest says he's never seen better selection. Dining room serves fabulous food but is a bit stuffy with that type of attitude. Having said that, it is truly one of the best (and one of my personal favorites) restaurants in New York. Outstanding, innovative cuisine. Consistently superb. Tasteful, elegant decor with gorgeous seasonal flowers in profusion. Probably the best and most knowledgeable service in NYC. Extensive wine list with wide price variations. Magnificent selection of imported gourmet cheeses which is out of this world. The food is spectacular, the lighting is perfect, and the service can't be beat. it's "sophisticated country" feeling puts diners at ease, and i can't think of another restaurant I'd rather spend 3 hours at having a very special evening. They do a magnificent job for groups or special occasions. there is a great private room that seats at least 20 people which is perfect for birthday parties or deal closing dinners. You can eat in the bar area for a lot less money, a lot less pomp and circumstance and enjoy yourself.
