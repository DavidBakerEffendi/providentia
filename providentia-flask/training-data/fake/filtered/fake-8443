I like this place because it feels like your at a relatives having dinner with family.  The food is pretty good and the portions are big.  You will get filled and the menu is full of comfort food.  It is always hopping in here and it's right on the corner with a good view of the busy street.  Jones draws you back because there is something very familiar about them.
