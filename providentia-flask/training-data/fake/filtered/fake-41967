On a peaceful evening, I walked down the block on Clinton street, the restaurant, is well versed in a low discrete light. I sit at the corner, of the bar, the view is perfect, and the music is delightful. I ordered a classic Rib eye Steak, and a glass of red Bordeaux . The food menu is excellent , the wine list very ambitious ! The staff is awesome. I was having good time, until an insatiable , sarcastic young lady, a mind full of negative remarks disturb the jovial atmosphere. She vociferate over the bill, we all can tell, her intention was free meal ! Hello lady, there is no need to fight the staff, no money you should stay home !
