Recently returned to see whether D&C had the same problem that made me leave before. They do. Prices can vary 100% from day to day, depending on which clerk you get. Pizza dough was one buck yesterday. Two bucks today. Same pizza dough, twice the green dough. Â Had the same problem before. When you ask about the elastic prices, they (politely, to be fair) tell you that you can put it back if you don't want it. Fugetaboutit.
