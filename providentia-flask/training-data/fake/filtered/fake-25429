After reading the other reviews, you may be wondering what is so great about the corn on the cob. At $3.00 for 2 cobbs, it is a great deal. The Mexican style corn comes roasted, spread with a geneous amount of crema (which is not quite creme frache, not quite sour cream, but somewhere between the two). Chile powder and lime finish this off- the best food in the world. Pack some floss, this is worth it!
