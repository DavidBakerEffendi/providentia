Yes. It was great ! We visited "The Dosai Place" at East Windsor a couple of times recently and were very satisfied with the vegetarian food. So we ordered five items for our Christmas Party and they were 1. Yogurt Vada. 2. Gulab Jamun. 3. Vegetable Pilau. 4. Mattar Paneer. 5. Korma. Guess what? All items were excellent and especially the yogurt vadas... never tasted this soft and fresh from any other place ... Guests were thrilled and I am sure The Dosai Place will be getting more orders soon. We were all extremely satisfied with their food. Thanks Dosai Place! Â You made our party a success!!!!
