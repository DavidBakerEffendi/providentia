If you're looking for quality Italian food in the Orange/West Haven area, it will be hard to find anything better than Lorenzo's. The food is always fresh and piping hot. The staff is (usually) friendly and right on the ball. I've have 2 bad experiences with the staff, but it was with the same waiter and I try not to have him anymore. Stuffed mushrooms are always delicious. Their shrimp dinners are great, as well as their chicken parm. I can almost never finish an entree because they give you so much food. The restaurant itself is always clean and inviting. Not "up-scale" but certainly not a "fast food" type restaurant (Olive Garden or Bertucci's." It's a great place to go with your family, or to bring a date. Whenever I need a fix of Italian food, and my family hasn't cooked in a while, Lorenzo's is my go-to place.
