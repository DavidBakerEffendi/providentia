I love Brunch at Le Barricou! Free croissants, nice music, pleasant airy and bright atmosphere - its a perfect brunch! The pancakes are super fluffy and light, served with fruit filled butter and topped with blackberries, pears, and melon. I also love the heirloom tomato soup! Don't miss the chocolate bread-pudding with cranberries and fresh blueberries. An all around wonderful experience!
