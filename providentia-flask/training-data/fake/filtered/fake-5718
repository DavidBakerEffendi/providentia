This place is on a corner and somewhat a dive but they have the BEST cheesesteaks ever.  Tried the steak and chicken.  There is limited indoor seating with bar stools and a couple of small tables.  Most folks were dashing in to get their to go orders and being called by name as they walked in the place.  Beer selection is great and tons of add ons for your sandwiches like 5 different kinds of peppers, etc.  You won't be disappointed.
