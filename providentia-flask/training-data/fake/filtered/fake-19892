This place definitely is a MUST GO when in the Northside.  Couldn't decide what to have for dinner one night as I walked around a bit I ended up in front of Oasis.  Not having had a falafel in a long time and after remembering reading the great reviews here I decided to give it a try.  I'm so glad I did.  Like everyone else mentions for the price -- $3.00 for falafel sandwich and .50 extra for hummus, which I gladly added, it was worth every dime and then some.  At first I thought that perhaps I would have liked a few more toppings but after I ate my sandwich I quickly changed my mind and thought it was perfect just as it was.  A Snapple on the side completed my meal for a total of $5 CAN'T BEAT THAT WITH A BAT :)
