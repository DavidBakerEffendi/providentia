One of the best pizza's I've had in New York City When we got there the guy at the front was pleasant but told us the wait was like 2 hours. We asked for take out instead and he said no can do. After awhile, and a bit of pressure and persistence we allowed us to put in our order. I came all the way from Manhattan for this pizza so I wasn't leaving without it. Glad he lightened up and took our order. Cool atmosphere and good people watching
