I guess the idea behind returning to a restaurant is partially to recreate the enjoyment that you experienced the first time you ate there. That can be a dangerous game, however... My girlfriend and I ate there about a year ago and loved the ambiance, food and service. It was pretty much a homerun. So when we returned yesterday we were really excited. I ordered the lamb cavatelli app and Duck entree while my girlfriend chose the Chili lobster (app) and Veal entree. I'll say this: the food is just as delicious as our first visit. What has changed however is the portion size. My girlfriend had ordered the chili lobster last time and it had been swimming in its delicious sauce; this time just a thin covering on the bottom of the dish. Her veal was fairly portioned and she enjoyed it but was not blown away. Both of my dishes were very good (the lamb pasta was excellent), but the portion sizes were just on the line of being insulting given the prices (which have gone up since our last visit). So it's 3.5 stars for me for delicious food but surprisingly small portion sizes.
