Lisiano's is by far the best Italian around! I love that it is not a "chain" and Chris and Luba will always come to the table and ask how everything was. They have the best bread around, delicious homemade house dressing and the awesome meatballs. Try the squash flower appetizer! Every time we go to Lisiano's we have a great meal and great service, every time!! Yum!
