By far the rudest group of people Ive Dealt with..I work in the office upstairs order a bagel to be delivered and they tell me 45 minutes due to the fact that they are to lazy and don't want to walk up the stairs. Nevermind the fact that the bagels are extremely over priced, had the service and employees been a little more cooperative they would be receiving a lot more business from me and my company. Â Id rather drive 20 minutes then deal with this unprofessional classes group.
