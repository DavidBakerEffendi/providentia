I recently went on a Sunday night.  As this was my first time at this restaurant, I figured I couln't go wrong with the Pad Thai with shrimp.  My dining partner ordered Pad Kee Mao.  The Pad Thai came out within two minutes of ordering it.  At first I thought the waitress brought it to the wrong table, but I saw the few other diners in the restaurant were already eating.  The shrimp was fresh but had no flavor.  I think the Pad Thai, at least on this night, was made ahead of time and the shrimp was added before reheating.  The meal tasted okay, but it's disappointing to be served food that is not prepared fresh in a restaurant.  The Pad Kee Mao came out about ten minutes later.  That was good.  The Thai ice teas were good too.
