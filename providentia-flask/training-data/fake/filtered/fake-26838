This place is kind of like Chipotle, but somehow it portrays a more "homemade" feel to both its ingredients and the way it is prepped.  The place is always clean, the food always tastes fresh, and the service is great.   It is sometimes tough to get a seat during crowded hours because the space is very small. Overall, fantastic.
