Visiting from out town to celebrate our mom's 65th birthday, my mom, sister and I went to Colicchio & Sons seeking a fine dining New York experience. We sat at the bar and reviewed the interesting drink menu. The bar-tender was condescending and rude. My sister asked if he could make something "festive" for the holiday season. He replied "like what? Would you like me to crush up some ornaments into a glass for you?" So we ordered a glass of champagne. We were served a complimentary bread rolls that tasted like paper. They were very unappetizing. So after our drinks we decided to leave. We went two doors down to Del Posto and had the dining experience of our life. A huge fan of Tom Colicchio, I'm so disappointed in the experience his restaurant offered. I'll never try another Colicchio restaurant again.
