I'm struggling a bit after seeing all of the positive feedback this place gets.  All of the glowing-ness of 4 or 5 stars makes me think that folks need to normalize their excitement.  At this point, I know that I'm doing more to review the reviewers  but I'm having trouble understanding.   My thoughts:  Decent bun.  No one should charge for raw onions on a burger.  You get three automatic sides:  lettuce, tomato, onions.  At minimum, those three are provided.  The burger itself would've been average, and by that I mean, backyard-burger-on-the-4th-of-July average, had it not been overcooked.  I like my burgers rare and I got medium.  Its something burger joints should get right.  We had the Belgium fries which were tasty, if not a little over-seasoned.  The fries could also benefit from being cut a little thinner.  A few were cool in the middle. The brightest point here were the empanadas.  The bean and cheese pockets were cooked perfectly.  Golden-brown and flaky.  The interior of the bean and cheese was tasty and had a great spicy bite to it. All of this said, my biggest issue was the dog.  Yes, a dog came in with one of the waitresses and roamed the room freely.  It was a very nice and seemingly obedient dog, but unless I'm in my buddies back yard on the 4th, I don't want a dog wandering around my table.  There was no attempt by the staff to corral the dog or send him away.  He made several customers visibly and obviously uncomfortable, especially after spelunking underneath their table.  The dog smelled like he is kept outside.  Next time you eat a burger, you should try to pair the taste of well cooked beef with the smell of a musty dog.  Its gross.  Its probably not the reason the health department forbids it, but it should be one of the many others. Apart from the dog, this place is heavily over-rated.  If you must, get the empanadas to go.  Hopefully the dog hasn't nosed through the line.
