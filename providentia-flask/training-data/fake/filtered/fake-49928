Great service by Dominiqu, great food, tasty beer (Naughty Nurse probably my favorite) and a nice visit with Conner, the manager. Only regret, headed home after a week and a half of business. Ate here six times over the week and a half and still don't have a favorite dish, but the Salmon is very good. Thanks Dominiqu, Virginia and Conner.
