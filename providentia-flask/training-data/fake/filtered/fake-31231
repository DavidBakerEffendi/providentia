I visited Adrienne's Pizza Bar this past Sunday before the Diwali Festival at South Street Seaport. The place has great pizza and very clean. Unfortunately, the service staff appeared to be blatantly racist towards anyone who isn't white. The service was inexcusably slow not only serving the food but also to the instance that no one wanted to give me the bill once I requested it. I hope other Indians, Hispanics, and Blacks take heed warning and boycott this establishment. I have already filed grievances with other media outlets foreign and abroad to the undeserved lack of service that I was subjugated to.
