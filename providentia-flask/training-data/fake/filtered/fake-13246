Tiny little, unpretentious joint serving up drinks in Mason jars and some awesome fried chicken! The menu is small, but Peaches does its food good. We went on a Friday evening and saw everyone from families to the post-work crowd. Being a spice-lover, I ordered their extra hot cajun chicken sandwich and it did NOT disappoint. The chicken was crispy hot and spicy on the outside with an incredibly juicy inside. Paired with the mayo and brioche bun, it was basically a party in my mouth. And for once in my life, it was definitely as spicy as advertised! If you're feeling really adventurous you can order the Booker T.- a burger topped off with a piece of extra spicy chicken! I had to wash away the heat with some mashed potatoes and a slice of their sweet bourbon cake with ice cream and fresh fruit but it was well worth it. Pro-tip: I didn't see a readily available dessert menu so you'll have to ask your server if you're fiending for some sweet stuff. The staff is great- super friendly and attentive and the service is quick but not rushed. Definitely a neighborhood gem worth checking out!
