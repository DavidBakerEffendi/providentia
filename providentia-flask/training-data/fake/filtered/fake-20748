Overall great experience. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, but the hostess/waitress was very friendly and welcoming. The decor is interesting, not amazing. Every dish we ordered was excellent. We had the goat cheese tart and a salad to start, shared the filet mignon with foie gras entree, and had the dark chocolate lava cake for dessert. And the BYOB with no corkage fee helps keep the bill reasonable. Location is a little out of the mainstream, but we had a great dinner, and would definitely go back.
