I miss New York and a lot of it has to do with this place. When I worked in the Greenwich area I used to eat here every day.  And I mean every. single. day.  No joke. They have the BEST hummus, tahini sauce, hot sauce, and falafels.  To stay fairly healthy I'd mostly get the hummus sandwich and load it up with hot sauce.  When I was particularly hungry I'd opt for the falafel and hummus sandwich.  It's soooo good.  I moved to LA and there is absolutely nothing here that compares.  I went to New York for a weekend last month and I specially made time to stop by Mamoun's.  I got about a dozen hummus and falafel sandwiches and packed them in my suitcase!  Did I care that my clothes smelled like tahini?  Or that my suitcase perpetually has a potpourri scent of chili sauce, tahini, & falafels  No.  Because I'm too busy eating...
