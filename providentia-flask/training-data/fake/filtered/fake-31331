Worst service and food! My friend and I came by for an early Friday dinner.   Strike 1:  It was hot and we decided to have ice cream floats.  One was coke, one was root beer.  Service messed up the order and then told us to swap drinks - not even offering to make new drinks Strike 2:  We were very hungry and got some biscuits to start off.  The biscuits were rock hard - sort of like when you overheat something in the microwave. Strike 3:  Main course.  We had burgers.  Once again warm and rock hard.  My friend couldn't even cut hers with a fork. Strike 4:  Serve proceeds to sit a family of 6 next to us and basically on top of us at a table that seats 4.  They come with luggage, etc and we are effectively trapped in a table next to the section divider. Strike 5:  My friend gives the waitress our her credit card to just get out of here.  And the waiter proceeds to ring us up on a bill that is $40 more than our bill and refuses to provide an itemized bill. Strike 6:  After having to get the manager over to sort of the bill issue the restaurant does not provide a voided copy of the originally wrong bill. Net:  for the first time ever left a $0 tip at a restaurant and had to call the credit company to report the vendor and the transaction.  Keep away!! Manager's excuse:  we have a new chef and wait staff.
