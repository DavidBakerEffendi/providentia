Saturday 1/14/12 six couples went to see Jersey Boys and after the show we went to Knock for dinner. This upscale bar and restaurant was voted by our 12 person group as a "top of the chart" restaurant to eat and drink in Philadelphia. Our waiter Rick was very professional and funny. He anticipated our needs before having to ask for anything. The variety of food, quality of food, portion size and presentation was outstanding; 12 meals, no complaints and high praise. Cleanliness was also noted at this establishment. The drinks were generous at the bar as well as while dining. We can't say enough about this "Gem" in Philly. My wife and I will return as well as the other couples. You will be just as pleased if you decide to go. Enjoy.
