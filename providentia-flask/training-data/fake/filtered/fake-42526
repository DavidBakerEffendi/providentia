Extremely disappointed in the experience we had New Years Eve.  While the food quality was very good we had issues including dirty glasses when seated, running out of several items - including champagne (and on New Years!!) confusion with our dessert, and two mistakes with our bill/payment.  It is understood that high end restaurants will create special menus and raise prices for holidays, especially New Years, but for the money paid we expected MUCH MUCH better.  The only response to the numerous issues from the waiter was "well....we are really busy tonight".  This was not our first time dining at Moshulu but it will be our last.
