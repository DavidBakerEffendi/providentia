Delicious personal pies and a really great selection of add-ons. Would definitely recommend the Rosso pie w/ Pineapple or the Margarita pie...prices are a little steep judging by the outwards appearance of the place, but it's 100% worth it. You can taste the difference in the high quality ingredients that they use - best pizza in Bushwick!
