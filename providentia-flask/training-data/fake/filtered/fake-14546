This family-owned restaurant is wonderful. We have gone in a few times and the owner always remembers us. All of the serves are so genuine and nice and very excited to talk to you about their food. The food itself is delicious, very interesting tastes all perfectly balanced. I recommend the spinach and paneer momos as an appetizer. The soup is also very good and all of the curries and main dishes are wonderful. Highly recommended for food and good, friendly service. What a great addition to the Hanover restaurant scene.
