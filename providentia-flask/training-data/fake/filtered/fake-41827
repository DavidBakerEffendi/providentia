I am still sitting here in the Bodhi Tree and couldn't wait to express how much I love it. My boyfriend and I came here by accident because the other noodle places were closing.  Little did we know, weve found our a new favorite! We got the 7$ lunch special which by no means was the quality compromised because of price.  He got the green curry, crab cake and soup and I got the see ew, curry puff and soup.  We loved everything and will definitely come back soon.
