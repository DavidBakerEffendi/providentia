We recently had dinner at Max Downtown during the "Taste of Hartford" promotion week.   One of their three TOH entree choices was a pork chop, which I ordered to be cooked medium rare.  (I am usually leery of ordering pork because most restaurants tend to overcook the life out of it, but I assumed that since it was a special and Max Downtown promotes itself as one of the top restaurants in Hartford, they would cook it as ordered.) Sadly, when it arrived, it was cooked medium-well to well and was dry and less flavorful than it should have been.  Given the fact that my fellow diners were happy with their meals, I really didn't want to wait for another pork chop to be cooked correctly, so I declined that option. It's just disappointing when a supposedly first class restaurant like Max Downtown can't cook one of their own specials as ordered.
