I feel like I need to give this place another try. I was so excited to come here because of all of the hype surrounding it, but was completely disappointed by my experience. My table ordered several pizzas - two of them were burnt and the white pizza was the driest white pizza I have ever had. If possible, the service here was even worse and made us feel completely unwelcome.
