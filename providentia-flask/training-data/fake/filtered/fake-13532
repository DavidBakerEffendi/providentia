I like this place, but there's a bit of room for improvement. The first visit, it was really unclear whether Â you seat yourself, wait or what the deal is. After we figured it out, it took a while to get a server's attention. But they were busy, so it's understandable. The biggest complaint is that while the food is good, the cornbread portions are teeny tiny. For $4 extra for cornbread, i want a big fat piece of it, not a few bite-sized morsels.
