Came for family dinner on Thanksgiving (grandparents are too old to cook and location not my preference). Server grabbed my baked potato on my plate with bare hands and squeezed it, in some bizarre attempt to show me how to butter it. I asked her to please not touch my food, and had a new one brought out. There was no apology offered. I told her that I had to be honest and that it was completely inappropriate to touch the food on someone's plate. That aside, I had filet mignon, cooked unevenly and topped with a ridiculous garnish but no seasoning of any sort. Family members had mashed potatoes which were clearly instant. Place is stuffed so full of tables that servers can't get through to customers and            are constantly reaching over you. Not sure what other options are in the area, but they probably can beat this.
