Boycott Alert: Sushi Palace, Route 27 South Brunswick. Tonight, even with a reservation, they refused to seat us b/c we had a wheelchair. There were plenty of tables. Instead, they wanted to squeeze us into a much smaller space. This is a place we frequent regularly, have recommended to countless people & know the owner! He was the one who simply refused to serve us. Please pass this on & DO NOT EAT THERE!!!
