A friend and I stumbled into this restaurant completely by chance but decided to try it because we'd heard many great reviews. It has a small dining area in front with a table for six and a couple of seats at the counter. The owner is friendly and welcoming and eating there was such a positive and fun experience. It felt great that the owner took such great care of us, the food definitely tasted more homemade and fresh than other Thai places in the area. A lot of their business is from delivery and usually delicious, reasonably priced, healthy and fresh Thai dishes are delivered quickly without issue, the owner did mention that there had been an issue with her printer that led to a few late deliveries in the past few weeks. Rest assured that the issue has been fixed-and don't hesitate to visit Jeera or call for delivery!
