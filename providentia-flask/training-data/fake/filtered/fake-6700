We had to book gramercy Tavern a month in advance to get a reservation and apparently it is always fully booked. Everything that needs to be said has already been said by previous reviewers and there is no doubt that this is a great place to eat. I do think that it is far too expensive and whilst we had a great meal, it isn't 'special'. If you want really good food in a lovely setting then it's worth a try, but I wouldn't return. I also ate at their sister restaurant (Union Sq Cafe), which I actually thought was much better value.
