Don't get me wrong the food, it was above average 4/5 , the area was 3/5, the service was 2/5, but what got me to give this place a 1/5 was this guy who seemed to be a manager was ripping people off. I had just gotten out of a party and it was obvious that i had a little more to drink and he saw that, so when I went to pay with my card he was acting get sketchy and have me the receipt to sign and I noticed he had charged me 6$ dollars more, and when I noticed it he was like oh no it's 19.70$ and I got louder saying no it was 13.70$ where he pulled out the check and said "okay yes I give you 6$ out of cash register" (yes couldn't barely spoke English) Â where I responded "you give me my money first then I will sign" at this point he was getting angry with me as if I was trying to screw up his night. Then just as I was signing the bill and he was opening the cash register to give me my money, a kid maybe 16 years old runs in frantic yelling to call the cops be cause someone is getting jumped outside, rather than simply calling the cops, he decides to throw the kid out. I really hope this guy gets fired in the future, and if anyone who works there is reading this it was a short older male, no hair.
