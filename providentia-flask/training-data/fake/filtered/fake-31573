I have been looking forward to going to Blend on the water since my family gave it rave reviews. I was there on Monday and absolutely loved it. The hostess was very nice and inviting, our waitress Alexis was awesome. She made our night very enjoyable. The drinks were great and the food was phenomenal. The ambiance was great. Definitely returning sooner than later.
