Why does everything taste better here? Is it the great service from the second you walk in? Maybe the homemade sauces for the sliders? Even the beer on draft tastes better here... Great ambience. And a great deal. Oh, and I don't usually eat bacon- but can't resist with the sliders. Not gonna start with the shakes. Could become a habit.
