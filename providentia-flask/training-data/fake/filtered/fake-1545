Located in between a 24 hour bodega and a fried chicken joint, Gandhi Fine Indian might escape your eye when passing by, but they really deliver some great Indian food. My girlfriend and I started off with the Kachoori (which seemed pretty close to Samosa Chaat to me) and some vegetable samosas, which were excellent both in flavor, texture, and spice.  The thing that really makes this place stand out though, is their attention to detail.  Many Indian restaurants are happy to throw out any old Mint Chutney and Tamarind sauce, but this tiny detail can also tell so much about how  a restaurant cares about its process.  When I first sampled the mint chutney, I knew that I was in for a really great meal.  From the spices to the outer dough of the samosas, all of the extra details that make a restaurant truly stand out, were there.  I'm not sure if they make their samosa crust from scratch, but it certainly tastes like it. For dinner I had the Chicken Bhuna and my girlfriend had the Navrattan Korma.  The Chicken was a clear winner for me, a nice blend of curried spices, onions and just enough hotness to make it enjoyable.  The Korma was a little too sweet for my tastes, but might be a great eat for someone looking for that coconut/pineapple vegetable flavor. In addition, the raita and pickled Mango were delicious - the latter being a little more subdued than most places, therefore probably more approachable for a larger audience.  Although, I will warn, it is a strange (yet awesome) taste. I was most excited at the end of the meal when the owner gave me the take out menu, and pointed me to the chef's specials, many of which made me want to keep coming back.
