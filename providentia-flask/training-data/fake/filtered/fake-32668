Pub 46 is a great place to go-- they have awesome bartenders & the staff makes you feel like your a regular even if its your first time there. Tuesday you can bring your own mug in for $2 - you can't beat that! They do awesome happy hour specials from 3-8 and 10-12 you get $5 appetizers. The pub fries & wings are the best in NJ!!!!!
