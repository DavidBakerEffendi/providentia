D: How I have never heard of Woorijip before I met C is beyond me.  A small place near the end of KTown but it always has people in it, even in the early morning hours.  Great combination of price and food.  There's a per-pound buffet section, as well as prepared hot and cold foods.  I've had so many random dishes there, from the spicy rice cakes with octopus, to the chicken lo mein, to the tofu pancakes.  Have had nothing to complain about and it's a great place to go when you can't decide what you want so you just grab everything.  Most of the dishes come in under $4, so getting two or more won't dent your wallet all too bad. C: Was introduced to Woorijip in my Freshmen year in college for their yummy rice cake stew. My friends are I are frequent customers for late night soju runs here too. Often would grab seats in the back and stay til closing.  Everything I've tried taste great! Especially love the Kimbap and kimchi fried rice. Everything is super cheap and filling. Definitely satisfy my Korean food craving! Will try the per pound buffet section next time!
