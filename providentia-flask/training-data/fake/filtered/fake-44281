"WOOHOO! AS GOOD AS IT GETS!" I never was a breakfast-person, until I tried Lee's. Now, I am addicted to all of Mr. Lee's breakfast platters. The Hungry Man. The Big Man Pancakes. The Western Omelet. Bacon/sausage/You name it! The best part is...breakfast is all day. I only wish Lee's would deliver; it would make my cravings more easily appeasable. Lee's Deli's breakfast redefines breakfast foods and revives the "soul" of soul food. While the breakfast items are phenomenal, as many of the reviewers have already noted, Lee's cheese steaks and chicken cheese steaks are THE BEST in all of Philadelphia. Trust me For 6 generations, my family has lived in Philadelphia and I have tasted them all (Pat's, Jim's Geno's, South Street joints, corner-stores, delis, restaurants, you name it...). Try the chicken cheese steak (with some homemade BBQ sauce or Buffalo sauce) at Lee's and you will not be disappointed. A well-deserved 5! Lee's Deli is more than just foods; it's an experience!
