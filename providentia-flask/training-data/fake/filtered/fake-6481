Hubby is Vietnamese and we eat A LOT of Pho. This is by far our absolute favorite, and we travel an extra 30 minutes to come eat it. The meat in the Pho Tai is tender and fantastic and the broth is wonderful. Light and not greasy. They only have a few pho's they offer, along with spring rolls, so it makes ordering very easy if you're new to Vietnamese cuisine. Love it.
