No, no no no no! Overpriced, and not worth it. The karaoke is ridiculous, I won't even go into that. All I can say is I went this evening for the $2.50 sushi specials, thinking, "how bad can it be for so little?" Let me tell you, even at that price it wasn't worth it. first of all, the rolls were so tiny I could have fit four of them into a single, normal sized roll at any decent place. On top of that, they all tasted exactly the same. Tell me, how does yellowtail and tuna taste the same? I have no idea, but Yakitori Boy made it happen. Aside from the bad food, the service was so rushed it seemed that we were done with our meal before we'd even started.Our sushi came out literally less than five minutes after our appetizers. Â I think we weren't in the restaurant more than twenty minutes tops! To top off the evening, on the way out a friend was looking for matches, and I saw a half empty booklet at the front entrance, that seemed to be for customers, but when I picked it up the extremely rude girl behind the counter shouted at me "Are you STEALING my matches?!" When I explained that I thought they were for people to use, she told me "They are for customers ONLY. Don't steal my matches." Considering that we obviously were customers, I was absolutely amazed at how rude she was being. Not to mention that there were only three matches left in the book, did she really need to yell at me not to "steal" them? Just an example of what a rip-off this place is.. overpriced, mediocre, and I got accused of stealing three matches! Ridiculous. Never going back.
