I don't get what all the fuss is about. It's Indian fusion food in a noisy and cramped place. We had the dahi avocado chaat to begin with-it was yum even though the puris were not crunchy and tasted old. My husband had the chef's table with 4 courses. It was filling but all the food was bland and not very enjoyable. I had the lasooni naan (which was soft and not too strong) and the Chana. The Chana vegetable was awful-tasted like boiled Chana. Service was good. On telling the server how average our experience was, he brought us 2 coupons for a free drink/appetizer for the next day. You'd be better off eating at an Indian restaurant without burning a hole in your pocket.
