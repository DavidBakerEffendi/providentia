I just had dinner at The Guild for the first time tonight and it was wonderful. I booked our reservation threw open table online. I had never used this service before but I was glad I did. When we arrived there was a wait. However, our table was ready. The atmosphere was creative and interesting. The prohibition style cocktails were fabulous! Plus, my aged New York strip steak was spot on perfect. I'll be a returning customer.
