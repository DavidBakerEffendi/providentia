overall food/taste horrible; service ok at best very very loud - so if you prefer sports bar level of noise maybe ok, but at this price?? first course - oysters tasted prechewed and regurgitated.  kind that they replaced it with the tartare which was excellent duck not so good for the price ($260 for 4ppl), you are getting your pocket picked.   go somewhere else rather than support this garbage
