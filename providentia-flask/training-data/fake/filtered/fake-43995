Let's put it this way: I would rather spend my time in Mac's Tavern  drinking my way through their extensive beers and discovering my inner fat girl with their menu then wearing a kleenex-dress at Red Sky or bumping nasties with the trust-fund babies at Lucy's. In  world of uncertainty it's nice to go "where everyone knows your name."
