First of all, the bar is not in Kensington but along the border between Fishtown and Port Richmond. It is NOT Kensington. Okay? THIS BAR IS NOT IN KENSINGTON. Great food, but too much beer. This bar needs some wine, and not store bought box wine. What dark age are they crawling out of? They need a Happy Hour, and they need to include their awful box wine in their drink specials. Center City bars do this. The bar is a little too straight. It needs more gay and bisexual people. Too conventional--all these male and female couples, looks like Little House on the Praire. Has potential though some say this bar is a drug front. Not many hipsters, thank God. Or they are hybrid Richmond hipsters/Flyers fans, weird.
