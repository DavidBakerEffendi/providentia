We found Sarelli's last week completely by mistake, and were a little afraid to go in as it was nearly 10:00pm on a week night. But we walked in and were very warmly received and seated.  The dining room is large, well appointed and comfortable. The staff was quite friendly and very eager to please. The menu is full spectrum northern Italian, and there were several specials that night as well.   We started with the calamari - fresh, tender, lightly floured and delicious. We had the fish special, and the vegetable lasagna - both very good. The price is more than fair, and the service superb. Tonight we went back for a second time, purposefully.  Started with the goat cheese and walnut salad, followed by a steak, although I was really tempted by the ravioli special. Another delightful meal at a local restaurant that will quickly become a favorite of ours!
