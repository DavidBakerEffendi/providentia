Do you like to be cursed at by the staff?  The one star in the rating would be for the food.  I thought it was good.  The service however left much, much, much, to be desired.  Everything seemed fine at first.  But after our meal, we had to flag a server down for another round of drinks, because no one came back to check on us.  We figured they must of had a rush, so we did not make much of it.  After flagging down a server at an adjacent table, we ordered a final round, and we were thinking about dessert, but the server just sat down the drinks and quickly walked away.  This annoyed us a little more, but we figured we should probably skip dessert anyway. Finally, after finishing our drinks, we wanted our check and could not believe that nobody had still at this point come by to check on us or ask us for anything.  We waited and waited for server and did not get one.  We finally flagged down the server at the table next to us and asked him to bring us our bill.  Still, we have to wait and wait.  My wife (one of the most calm people in the world), finally has had enough and had to wait outside while I paid.   So when I go inside to the bar area to settle the bill, I complained about the poor service.  I was then told by the staff to "calm down."  Nothing can inflame a customer satisfaction issue like telling the upset customer to "calm down."  There is a reason the rule in customer service is the "customer is always right."  Even if the customer is not right by your point of view, they are upset at the experience.  Eventually, I was told I was lying about our wait for service, and the "owner" used profanity at me.  I never used an swear word at all.  I am honestly shocked.   Rule of thumb, when a customer is unhappy, apologize and move on.  If he is still unhappy, apologize again.  But never, ever, tell him to calm down or swear at him.
