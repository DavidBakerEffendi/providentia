Falafal sandwich made me go - Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh - it had a lot of falafal bites, tahini sauce, and lots of veggies! The best part was that the pita bread did not rip! Paid about $6 for my sandwich ...not bad at all! One sandwich filled me up. Def. a must go if you're in center city (Philadelphia).
