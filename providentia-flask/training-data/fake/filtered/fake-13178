This was the worst experience I had. Always came here for good food and this time sat around for over 10 minutes waiting for someone to take our order and nobody came around. All the waiters and waitresses were just standing around and chatting and clearly saw our stack of menus still on the table. People who sat next to us well after us had their orders taken right away. Terrible service and I give them one star for their performance today.
