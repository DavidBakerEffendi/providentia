I'm a pretty big fry fan, and these are some of the best I've ever had. They're the perfect texture, size, and go well with all the sauces that I've tried. On my last visit with friends we ordered a double (enough for 3-4 people) and the Parmesan peppercorn, Â Vietnamese pineapple, peanut satay and frite sauces. I liked the Parmesan best (probably because I love cheese fries). In addition to the great product, the prices are reasonable. For $7.50 we got a huge serving of fries and paid about $2 for the extra sauces, which weren't too small either. The service moves quickly enough, especially considering the food is made to order right in front of you. The only drawback in my mind is the lack of seating in the restaurant - not an issue on a bright sunny day given the nearby parks, but something that could cause problems on a rainy day. Next time I come I think I'll have to try the poutine. Definitely worth a trip if you're in the area!
