I have to say places like this don't exist anymore. I read some of the bad Â reviews, and I have to say that Jimmy definitely turned this place around. Monday was the first time I ate at this place. I had the N.J Burger with Waffle fries. It cost me a little under $10. I thought that it was great according to the quality that I was served. This will be a repeat location for me ....I will be back . I want to thank the manager & staff for making it so worth it. This place is a gem by far. SPORTS BURGER !!!! BEST BURGER EVER!!!!!!
