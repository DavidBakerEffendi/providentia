BEST ITALIAN FOOD I HAVE EVER HAD!!! I would reccomend this place to anyone and everyone. Sadly I live in Florida and can not dine here more often. I dream about their wild game meatballs (which is something I normally would NEVER order) lol. Along with their amazing food the service was nothing short of amazing. I will be going back to this place without a doubt when ever I visit NY again!!
