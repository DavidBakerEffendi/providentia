Nasty attitude !! Horrible drinks made with a  cheap alcohol that will give u headache after first drink!!! Most of Hipster looking bartenders are  sarcastic and nasty!!!      If you are female will be definitely discriminated by mostly gay male staff , like I never experienced in any other gay bar or any bar ever!!! Cocktails are poorly made with cheapest container alcohol and served with great doze of sarcasm!! If by any chance you don't agree with a cheap / never herd of beer that was given to you after asking for Heineken !!!!..they will stop serving you, and  The owner also hipster looking, probably bartenders boyfriend will kick you out!!!!!       Just one disgusting experience!!!!!      Save yourself money, time and aggravation unless you are gay man that will be hopefully and probably  served better and with more respect! Not a girls hang out pl.      This place only USE TO BE cool !
