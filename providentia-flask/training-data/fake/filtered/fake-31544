I came here on Saturday with my girlfriend and we both had a really good time. The food was delicious- I really liked the pernil. The drinks we had ( margaritas and Henny mojitos) were really good as well. Overall, the service was seamless. Felicia was our waitress and she always made sure everything was to our liking. I'd definitely come back again. Also, make sure you make reservations: there was a long queue of people waiting to be seated- not fun...
