Place was awesome, the wait was a little long by soooo worth it.  The service is quick the price is amazing!!!!  Especially for the amount they give you!  And the food tastes great!!!!  Great atmosphere too, really modern look, and even a DJ setting that laid back mood. Def worth it, just remember CASH ONLY.  But you only need a $20!
