My All-Time Worst Restaurant Encounter I was excited to try this place but had a dreadful experience. It was like visiting a chaotic, disorganized house where  a bunch of teenagers have been left in charge. Despite placing my order clearly, twice, the wrong food was brought to me, so it had to be remade. Then the miso soup and salad appetizers that the menu promised were replaced by some unpleasant side dishes -- innappropriate for sushi. When I pointed this out the waiter said, "The menu you read was not our menu," as if explaining everything perfectly. I asked why they hand out menus that don't advertise what the kitchen serves, and he shrugged, seeming totally unconcerned. Sometimes rude treatment is an anomaly, but I noticed people at other tables gumbling, getting fed up, and leaving, which I finally did, after wasting an hour. Apparently the staff at Seoul BBQ & Sushi is not charming its clientele. This would be okay if there was some degree of competence, but they seem unaware that what's on a menu is what should be served to diners and feel quite comfortable improvising.  Overall, this is a terrible restaurant run by rude amateurs.
