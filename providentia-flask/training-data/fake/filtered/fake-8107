Recently we used Papa Franks to cater a party that had some unique circumstances. Through it all Moe, who I do not know personally, treated us like friends and neighbors rather than someone on the other end of a business transaction. For that I will forever be grateful. I have been going to Papa Franks for 20 years and the food and the atmosphere have always been stellar. If you have not been to Papa Franks, give it a try. If you haven't been lately, what's stopping you? Thank you to Moe and your staff, the party was a success!
