This was my first taste of authentic New York pizza. I have to say it was awesome. They don't make pizza like that at home. My friends and I ordered a simple cheese pizza and it was so good. There was no wait to get seated and the waitress was very nice. I will defiantly be coming back to Lombardi's the next time I'm in NYC.
