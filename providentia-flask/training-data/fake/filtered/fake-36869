Best Fried Chicken in the 5 boroughs. The burger was cooked to perfection, and the bun (best part of a burger) was fantastic. mashed potatoes were better than my ma's on thanksgiving. really...everything was perfect. And I'm Asian so you know it must have been better than perfect b/c were crazy when it comes to our yelp reviews. In all seriousness, friendly staff, cozy room, and just the right blend of normal and hipster that make you feel right at home, and not some snooty falooty soho trend diner or some bushwick loft pot luck. yes...you should go
