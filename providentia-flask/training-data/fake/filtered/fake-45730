Some months ago I had a negative service experience at Garces Trading Company.  I spoke to the Regional Manager about the experience and that I am a frequent customer.  I brought a close friend visiter from DC.  We were both disappointed.   The Regional Manager graciously apologized and offered to make up for it next time my friend comes in.  Tonight we dined at GTC and everything was spectacular.  We had a great salad and great house-made Mozzarella.  Then we had short ribs and scallops...and duck fries for "dessert". Thank you to the Regional Manager for her generosity and to our waiter Nathaniel who wisely recommended our food. Once again I love this place, and so does my visiting friend. Thank you again.
