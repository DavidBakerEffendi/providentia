Great lunch - burgers and sandwiches are terrific, good size portions and good quality food.  Everything on the breakfast menu is good, a really solid selection, though not necessarily a standout.  You can get breakfast as good or better at other places. The atmosphere is casual, service is relaxed.  There's only street parking, so that can be a problem, depending on when you go.  Also, there's not a lot of seating, so if you've got a party bigger than four, better to go at an off-peak time.
