My absolute fav spot in the city. I have been there six times now and had an amazing time everytime. Spectacular food and ambiance, especially if you get to sit on the top dining floor. The staff is spot on and very accomodating, especially considering how busy the establishment is. Had some very nice dates up there. And speaking of dates, the ones wrapped in bacon are da bomb. Always order two portions :) Also their wine list has some very nice gems on it if you know what to look for. Just make sure you reserve a table as it gets preety crowded.
