I've eaten at Bin 228 twice and eat time my experience was different my 1st visit was in August 2010.  The service was great and apps were amazing!  Their panini's are a bit bland.  They need add some seasoning to their sandwiches.   My second visit was November 2010 and the service was so-so.  The waitress could have been more attentive especially with a group of 8 people.  The food was ok.  I ordered the meatball special which was a good size but lacking in flavor.  Overall, cozy place, so-so service (depending on which day you go) and ok food.  Don't expect a full meal as the menu is mainly apps.  I won't be eating there again.
