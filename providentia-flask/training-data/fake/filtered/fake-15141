My girlfriend and I stopped in for a drink for a half hour while waiting for a table at Gramercy Tavern down the street. Cocktails were great and worth the steep price. However, the service was rude and childlike. We made it clear that we were only stopping by for a drink at the bar. We had waiters pushing menus in our face 4 times in 30 minutes, absolutely disrespectful and short-sighted. I immediately decided to review them the next morning. Your business or service should sell itself, don't push customers around, especially in the digital age when they can easily write a review.
