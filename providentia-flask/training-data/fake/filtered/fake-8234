First, on site parking is limited, so go right for street parking. Second.  The food was fantastic. Stuff Eggplant special -  eggplant was well roasted.  stuffing of gnocci, chicken, sausages and fresh mozzarella were well balanced.   Seafood Combo on Pasta, with lobster.  Lobster was on the well done side, but the pasta and rest of the seafood was well seasoned. Local sea scallop on Pasta with Fra Diavolo.  good heat, scallop very tender, pasta just the right amount of al dente. We did get lucky on a Friday night with no wait.
