Five professional woman one evening after work went to Cuban Pete's to relax, have some sangria, and eat. When the waiter came over I asked if we could have two checks. He said no they didn't do that. I Requested he ask the manager to make an exception. He returned to our table and said the answer was still no. I asked to speak with the manager. This so called manager came over to the table and I explained to him that I needed a separate check for business purposes. He replied with, "No. I don't want any trouble from you". With that I thought he was joking. He then told us to leave. I then realized this man was serious. He then escalated and told us to "get out now".  I asked him for his name and he wouldn't give it.  I asked if he were the owner and he said no he wasn't. We left. He then followed us to the parking lot where I stopped a young man to ask if he could recommend a good restaurant in the area. This "manager" started yelling telling this person to not tell us anything.  This man was insane. In my life I have never been to a restaurant that didn't split checks. I have never been to a restaurant where the manager flew off the handle and behaved like a lunatic. I have never been to a restaurant where the manager was so rude and obnoxious. Now for the icing on the cake - this "manager" was the OWNER! Can you imagine the owner of any business behaving this way? His name is Dominic and apparently Dominic has issues as he was arrested back in 2006! In today's world people who exhibit this type of inappropriate behavior and who fly off the handle so easily cannot be trusted. How far would his temper take him? So, restaurant goers, beware of the crazy owner of Cuban Pete's. Do yourself a favor and stay away. Too many wonderful restaurants out there who will actually treat you with respect and appreciate your business!
