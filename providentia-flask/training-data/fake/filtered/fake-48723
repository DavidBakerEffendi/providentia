Stopped in here based in the great reviews, and I was not disappointed! Â 5 of us had burgers, chicken sandwiches, and grilled cheese. All were excellent and served with great fries and dipping sauce:). Can't wait to be back in Philadephia and check out more of their beers. That have an awesome selection, but I was driving last time.
