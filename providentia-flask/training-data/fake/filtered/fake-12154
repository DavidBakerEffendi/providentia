I'm a big fan of sushi, and consider myself to have some real expertise about the quality and ambience of sushi bars. Toro is outstanding, both in terms of the menu, presentation, and most of all, the wonderful sushi and unusual other menu items. For example, the spicy mussels were incredible, fresh, delicious, and uniquely flavored; the gyoza were excellent, and the special roles were wonderful as well. The staff was extremely attentive, and during our meal, the owner came over to say hello and see how we were enjoying our meal. I would highly recommend this restaurant, and can't wait to go back.
