I'm giving this pizzeria 3 stars .... It Could have easily been 5. the pizza is great .... an awesome quality pie for Bayonne .... or even Jersey City. However the staff is completely rude and have an unearned "cockiness" as if they know their the best .... as true as it may be the lack of humility is probably the reason why this establishment is so easily forgotten .... Â i would visit a " Mikes Pizzeria" or a "Wild Wood Fired Pizza" (only because of how nice the staff is every time i visit .... like im long missed family or something lol) long before i return in person to this establishment only to be talked about out loud and rudely (because i asked if they served Hawaiian pizza) while i try to enjoy a meal with my wife and kid. however i might order anonymously, and send a friend in to grab my pie lol .... it is that damn good!
