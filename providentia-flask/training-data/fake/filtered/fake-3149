The place is a great addition to the Ewing food scene.  The shredded pork burrito is really good.  The monthly specials are generally a good addition to the menu.  As pointed out in a earlier review, the tacos seem to be the worst deal, but most other items are inexpensive.  If you eat there, the meal includes chips and homemade salsa. The parking lot is too small and it does not appear to have air conditioning.
