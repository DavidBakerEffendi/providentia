From what I read in Time Out and heard on yelp you would think this place landed from another planet. They hype and ratings about this place are ridiculous. The fried pickles were good and beers were standard rate for what they had on tap. I tried the margarita from what a read from other reviewers "exotic" is a stretch on the cocktail list . Â Something at Mayahuel would earn a description like that. My food came quick and our waitress was very nice considering how busy she was. Good drinks and food I will be back but exploring in the mean time.
