Amazingly delish chow, and as good a quality/price ratio as you will ever find. Terrific soups and salads, the best guacamole (served with home made plantain chips), juicy ropa viega, sandwiches. Did not love the oxtail empanada...a bit rich and overly fancy for my taste. This is a sure bet...go for it!
