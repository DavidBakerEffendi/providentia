Well, we have loved this place for years until just in the last year. Had Dim Sum recently-- spent $140 and recieved only the really expensive dishes to chose from, which were remarkably small. We all left hungry! I told them, 'cuz we love the crew. VERY little sympathy and no attenpt to right the situation on their part. Went again yesterday, had 5 dishes--about $100 and only the mock eel was "great". Tangerine chicken-no tangerine rind as suggested we would find. The scallop dish was soooo bitter--only I could eat it, and just barely. Seriously--that chicken dish was no better that evryday Chinese restaurant General Tsao--swear to God! My wife said upon leaving,after a year of dissappointment with this place,-"Michael, we need to try different places". We LOVED you--you were exotic and something has gone wrong. LOVED our waitress though!
