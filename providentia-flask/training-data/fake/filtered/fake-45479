I'm not sure I have ever spoken to someone as snotty as Rebecca when she answered the phone tonite. We waited over 1 hour for our sandwiches to be delivered to our workplace 0.5 miles away - including waiting at the front door for 10 minutes because the driver said he was sitting at the front door (was a lie). When I called Rebecca to tell her that the pita bread for the sandwiches had completed disintegrated/fallen apart as it apparently was soaked through with liquid, she said that was my problem, and they were a very busy restaurant, and hung up on me!!! wow - i have never heard a person who is supposed to be in customer service behave this way. never ordering from this place again!
