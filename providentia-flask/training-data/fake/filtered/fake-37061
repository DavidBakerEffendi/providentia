The food & tomato pies are always wonderful. Unfortunately, the service is "IFFY". I wanted to speak with the owner that very night, a few months ago on our LAST visit, but my husband suggested that I let it go, and write up a review instead. A few times, we had "Jamie" as our server. Every time we've had her, it seems that she walks with a "chip on her shoulder". She is rude and has terrible manners. My husband and I haven't been there for a few months, and the other night, we figured we'd give it a try, in hopes that things would've been different. The food was WONDERFUL, thank you, however, as you may have guessed it, the service SUCKED!! There was a "private party" inside the restaurant, so we had to sit outside. That wasn't too bad, but "Jamie" was our server, again. She didn't pay any attention to details, thus causing numerous mistakes. Well, Mr. Gennaro, you have lost our patronage because of "Jamie's" rudeness and terrible service. We have recommended your restaurant to many of our friends, and unfortunately, the ones who have had "Jamie" serving them, many of them have the same or similar comments: "great service, but 'Jamie'....." Â We feel that we need to bring this to her attention, and especially to your attention, Mr. Gennaro, so that this may hopefully be taken care of. After this last awful experience, my husband suggested that I write this review, hopefully our concerns will be taken SERIOUSLY. Until something can be done about this, from now on, if we decide that we want your food, we'll order it for DELIVERY!!! This way, we wont have to deal with "Jamie's" horrendous service.
