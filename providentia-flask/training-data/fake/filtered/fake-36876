Walter's in Fort Greene is a must visit and visit again and again and again. Since they just opened, we were a little nervous about what to expect but took a chance and popped in around 7PM on Saturday.  There was a bit of a wait, which is to be expected around prime time, so we left our name and number with the host and went a block up to grab a drink.  She called exactly as promised and we were promptly seated upon arrival. Everything about the meal, the service, the decor and ambiance was wonderful from start to finish.  Our starters included shrimp cocktail (love the cocktail sauce) and the ceviche with pico de gallo, lime, lemon and homemade corn crisps... we shared the bibb salad with bacon (nice addition!), chives, radishes and a lemon buttermilk dressing... and wrapped up with the bar steak with chimichurri and fried chicken, both cooked to perfection. The nicest touch was when the owner, Danny Minch, came by to introduce himself and see if we were enjoying our meal.  He thanked us sincerely for waiting to be seated, for which really there was no need (though appreciated). Danny, we will definitely be back. Welcome to the neighborhood!
