threekitcheneers.com The Three Kitcheneers went to Tia Pol!!! This is a teeny tiny tapas restaurant in Chelsea. Very cozy and warm - a quintessential downtown feel. I ate so much food here it's just ridiculous. To be honest, I can't even remember everything I ate. But what I do remember, I can't stop thinking about. The Patatas Bravas, a classic tapa of potatoes with a slightly spicy aioli, was the absolute best I've ever had. The potatoes were so crispy on the outside and creamy in the center, like gigantic french fries. F*ck. I want them right now. I'm embarrassed to say that this was my first experience with Pimientos Estilo Gernika - holy crap - these should be on every menu, I don't care if it's an Amish Bakery, these should be mandatory. They're finger sized crispy green peppers sprinkled generously with sea salt. So simple. So amazing. threekitcheneers.com threekitcheneers.com/bloâ€¦
