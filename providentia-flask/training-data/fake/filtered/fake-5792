6 of us met at the Brooklyn Brewery this past Saturday afternoon 2/23. After checking out several beers there and taking the tour, we left to head somewhere that we could easily talk, eat and continue to drink some good beer. Before going to Brooklyn ( 4 of us from NJ) I came across The Counting Room here on Yelp. I mentioned this place to our friends that live only a few blocks from there and they had walked by The Counting Room several times but had never gone in. So we did... And it's GREAT! We got a nice corner spot  at the bar and looked over the beer and wine menu. Plenty of quality choices. Our bartender Russell was instantly like an old friend. Knowledgable, personable and attentive.  We ordered some light fare and were very happy with it as we'll.  Decor is inviting, wood wall feature, mason jar light fixtures, Jenga! Ventured downstairs just to take a look and it appeared to but a fun hang out as well.  Definitely recommend this spot if your looking for quality yet not expensive at all. You will enjoy this place for sure.
