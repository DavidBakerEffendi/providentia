Three words: Sriracha Brussel Sprouts. Granted, Sriracha makes anything amazing, but this side may be the best side dish in the city. JL crushes it with their sides, and if ever the pork hock is up on the board, one must immediately order it. Aside from the food, the place very laid back, albeit a bit of a snug fit. The only downside I can think of is the wait, but if you sneak in at the right time, you're golden. Check out Jeffrey's too (sister sandwich bar/grocery across the street), it's fantastic.
