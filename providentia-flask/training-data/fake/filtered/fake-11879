I eat here every time I come to NY, especially when I bring a group.  The friendly wait staff is always accommodating, and the food is always good.  Served family style, each food order easily feeds 2-3 people as advertised.  Menu items are reasonably priced as well.  This is a cozy, comfortable place with great ambience.  I definitely recommend Tony's di Napoli
