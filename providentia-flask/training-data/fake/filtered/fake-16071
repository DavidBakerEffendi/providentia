THE "BOUNCER" AT THE PLACE WOULD NOT LET ME IN BECAUSE I WAS IN A TANK TOP, THEN CONTINUED TO CALL ME A FAGGOT AND A GAY ASSHOLE? Disgusting. This is Chelsea in NYC and you are going to discriminate not only someone who has been a patron to your restaurant, but discriminate those who would normally feel safe in the neighborhood? Enjoy serving gross wedge salads and stale fries. Â This place is a DINER, not a restaurant. All these other reviews are fake but i assure you this is real.
