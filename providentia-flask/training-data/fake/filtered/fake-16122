we went there after a night out. We waited outside because it was really busy.  I didnt mind the wait because I work in the restaurant business and i know how it gets.  What bothered me was the waiter attitude and manners.  We ordered coffee he served us cold coffee!!!!  (We waited in the cold for almost an hour what makes you think we want cold coffee).  He then gave us an attitude saying it will be15 min more for hot coffee like we were suppose to specify what we wanted in our order.  Their lack of customer service mad the experience of enjoying the food taste bad.  I usually give more than 15% tip but y should the busser and runners be punished for his stupidity
