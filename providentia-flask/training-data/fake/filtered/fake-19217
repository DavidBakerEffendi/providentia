Tuk Tuk has sub-par thai food that just happen to be located in a neighborhood that doesn't have too many other options.  Their pad thai is SO DRY.  I had to add tons of lime and my own green chilies to get some flavor from it.  they claim to also be child-friendly but this SO is NOT the case.  the girl that took my order was totally rude, never made eye contact and didn't even thank me during the credit card transation.  is this economy that is the WRONG way to go.  i wont ever return.  tuk tuk RIP
