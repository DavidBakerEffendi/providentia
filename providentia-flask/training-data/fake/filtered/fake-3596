Long wait but we were able to score a seat at the bar which was fine. Aside from that the food was fantastic. Favorite dishes were: chicken & waffles and the mussels were amazing. The mood and setting was very nice. The staff was attentive and the barmaid was very helpful with suggestions. She was fun to chat with as well.
