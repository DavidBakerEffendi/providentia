OK I must clarify I am a certified pizza nut and have eaten over one thousand pizza in my life. That's pizzas not slices and it is a sad fact. Clearly Francos is not the best. It's no new style old style pie it's no Delorenzos on Hudson or for that mater Hamilton not even close.I wont get into the tomato pie pizza thing here So you may ask why 4 BIG DREW'S then? As they are so coveted the only thing I can say my Friends is its all because of one pie and one pie alone that I order at Franco's - THE LARGE DBL EXTRA CHEESE WELL DONE PIZZA II have been ordering this for sometime now. Its a round pockmarked cheesy pizza heaven in a box and It is local. Although the perfect pizza quest goes on I find my self more at ease with the thought of never finding that perfect pizza.This pizza has done that. RATING - 4 BIG DREW'S - FRANCO'S DBL EXTRA CHEESE WELL DONE.
