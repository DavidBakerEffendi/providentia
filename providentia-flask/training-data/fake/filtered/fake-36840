I was here back in March and was really happy with my dining experience. The restaurant has a vintage seahorse theme to it. The music in the background was soothing, and relaxing. (I think it was indies music) Anyways, the service was great, our waiter was very attentive and courteous (also very hipster). The restaurant wasn't crowded at all the night we went; maybe 2 or 3 tables filled and others were sitting by the bar. My friends and I ordered the Oyster Po' Boy, Buffalo Wings, Sweet Potato Fries and A Cheeseburger. The Po'Boy was kinda dry but pretty good, the bread was delicious though. I must admit the portion was kinda small for about $10. But i enjoyed every bite. The Buffalo wings were pretty good, but not the best. But it went great with the sauce they provided. The Sweet Potato Fries were THE BEST! supersupersuper delicious! a must try! The Cheeseburger is Cheeseburger, your average cheeseburger. Overall Pretty good place, I think our bill came out to be around $60! Prices are a little high but definitely worth it A must try if your in the area.
