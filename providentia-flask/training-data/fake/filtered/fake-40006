You truly are missing out if you havent been here for the weekend brunch. The several bloody marys I ordered were fresh, consistent and strong. The fried egg sandwich is hands down the best egg sandwich I've ever had, you need to try it yourself to understand. I also ordered the french toast which was amazing as well. The only down fall is that this place is very pricey. I winded up spending about 80 dollars for this brunch but I dont mind occasionally spending that money when the food, location and ambiance is the best of the best.
