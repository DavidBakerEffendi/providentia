I went here on an anniversary date with my boyfriend, and really liked it. The restaurant was really packed since it was Friday, but we didn't wait long for our food, and our waiter was pretty attentive. The food is on the pricier side though, and I was a little dubious of how small my food portions was when my salmon came out- but it was DELICIOUS and I was really full by the end. Definitely going again.
