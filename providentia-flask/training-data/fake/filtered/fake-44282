As a student at the Walnut College Restaurant School, I dine in on Lee's Deli on a regular basis (for a very good reason). All of these reviews capture just parts of Lee's Deli because this place has so much to offer. I especially love Lee's Deli's veggie sub and the grilled cheese special. I've never tasted anything like Mr. Lee's creations. I'm a Lee's Deli aficionado, and I'm proud of it. Long live Lee's Deli!
