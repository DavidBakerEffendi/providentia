I would give Red Star a 5 if it weren't for the awful, dismissive service ive recieved each and every time ive gone there.   The pizza is my favorite in the area and really very good.  Delicious.   Unfortunately,  ive always been made to feel that im interrupting the (way to many) people behind the counter and none of them have ever been in a hurry to acknowledge me.  The young girl with straight, brown hair at the register is downright rude.  I went in a week ago and she and another woman were having a conversation that seemed inappropriate for work, let alone in front of the customers.  Even when the woman stopped speaking, the young girl continued the conversation and totally ignored me.  FINALLY, the older gentleman acknowledged me.  When i presented a coupon for my pizza, the girl looked so judgemental and pissed off a me.   Hate to say it but i get this treatment every time i go there.  The pizza is more expensive than any other shop in town (and ive tried them all) but its also the most delicious.   If Red Star could show a little gratitide to their customers, they'd be a 5 star in my book.  If there was a half rating, id actually give them a 2.5.    Expensive, awful attitudes and service but the most delicious pizza.
