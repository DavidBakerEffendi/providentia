I tried to get a reservation via email, and Nicole replied back to tell me that there were no tables available that weekend, without even offering me a spot for the following weekend. I emailed back to ask when the next availability was, and she never replied. Good luck making it in the hospitality industry...too bad since I was really looking forward to having some good Filipino food in Manhattan that isn't served in a joint that has TFC blaring in the background.
