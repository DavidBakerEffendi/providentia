I have ordered take-out on several occasions here. Once I ordered just chicken wings (4) for app. $6 and some change. I return a few weeks later and I'm charged over $8 for the same exact order. I tell the cashier and she insistent that the price has ALWAYS been $8 and I just received a "blessing" that day. (REALLY?!?!) There needs to be consistency in the prices;This is what happens when you try to support black owned establishments. Needless to say, I will NOT be returning to eat here!!The chicken wasn't seasoned well either!!
