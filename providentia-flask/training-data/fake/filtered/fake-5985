I created this Yelp account so I could write this. I came here on a first date and started out at the roofbar. It was perfect. We were enjoying the view and cocktails (they actually make more than margaritas and a rum & coke up there) that we had a few appetizers there. My date is a vegetarian and was happily able to order enough for a meal, not just side items. We had the cucumber and crispy chickpeas, bacon wrapped matzo balls (well I had them, and they were one of the best things I've eaten this summer), and the broccoli--it made a broccoli believer out of me for sure. The rest of dinner downstairs continued to impress--there is a more extensive cocktail menu in the main dining room and bar. We decided to eat at one of the bar tables. Â I had their Negroni. The bartender explained that is was a "summer variation" and was a welcomed change to my usual Negroni, light and very refreshing. My date drank the cider on tap, which was described as crisp and light. She had the corn, shishito peppers with roasted eggplant, and carrot with almond cake. I ordered the poutine and then the sweetbreads with Cool Ranch hummus. Wow, definitely best sweetbreads I've ever had and describe anything as "Cool Ranch" and I'm in! I would go back just for a few cocktails and the sweetbreads. All in all a great night. Definitely worth the venture into Brooklyn!
