One word.... EXQUISITE! I got the smash sandwich with chicken meatballs, mozzarella, & a fried egg and a side of mashed potatoes. I must say they have the BEST mashed potatoes that I've had anywhere THE BEST. For desert I've gotten the ice cream cookie sandwiches.. They're always amazing. Now be prepared to arrive early if you want to be sat at a decent time. If not be prepared to wait 2-3 hours. The service is okay nothing out of this world.
