Definately a great bang for your buck when it comes to sushi....They have a lot of interesting rolls and all at great prices....For two people...a full dinner will probably not go beyond 30 dollars.  The looks of this place from the outside definately misleads its quality.  Right on Snyder, pretty much across from Myomensing.   Definatley a secret gem for sushi in south philly!
