This is my favorite restaurant in Philly. They make GREAT drinks. I've had quite a few things off the menu and all are fabulous. My favorite was the Char Grilled Aged Beef. SO yummy. And you must get the banana tower and Chocolate Pagoda for dessert. Great atmosphere and waitstaff. Our waiter made a mistake on our order last time (forgot to put our app in) and gave us free dessert. Most other places wouldn't make up for it. Pricy, but worth it for the quality and atmosphere.
