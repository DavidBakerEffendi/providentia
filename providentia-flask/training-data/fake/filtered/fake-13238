I love reading these reviews also to see what others experience in my favorite places.  We have been going to Raymond's for a couple of years now and love the ambience.  But, my wife and I almost walked out a couple of weeks ago when our burgers took-literally 40 minutes.  So, I appreciate what people are saying about the value of a good wait staff-if I had any other waitress we would have left.  But this gal was so  accommodating that we overlooked the ridiculous food prep time.  She was definitely older than the other staff and she told us that Raymond hired her when she told him she needed another job due to the economy.  Her last waitressing job was over 10 years ago at the Tick Tock Diner-but he gave her a chance.  Good call...her service made up for the 40 minute burger and we actually had a conversation about the best berries to go with creme brulee.  It sounds like they do a lot of progressive things in the community as well as hiring "older staff".  She told us they make huge contributions to arts community in Montclair. I'll keep going even if they mess up every now and then.  It's good food, a great environment and very cool staff.
