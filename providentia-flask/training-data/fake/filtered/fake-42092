An ex boyfriend turned me on to Luzzo's. I have only had it delivered so I can't really review the in-house dining experience. What I can tell you is that it might be my favorite pizza in New York. I have had their calamari and a couple of their salads, which are fine. As far as I am concerned I would not waste the calories on anything but the pizza. My favorite is the Arugula pizza (tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, shaved parmigiano, arugula.) It is absolutely divine. My mouth is watering as I a typing this. I guess I know what I will be having for dinner!
