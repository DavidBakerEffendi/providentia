This is a place that I have long tried to get into, and every time was discouraged by the 2+ hour waits. When I found out they were accepting reservations for restaurant week, I called immediately and somehow secured a table for that very night. After dying to check this place out for so long, I had a feeling that there was no way my dining experience could surpass all the hype and built-up expectations. Somehow, I was completely wrong. Despite it being Restaurant Week, my meal was one of the best I've ever had in Philadelphia. The Bruschetta Trio was amazing, with each combination being better than the previous. The Market Salad was likewise delectable, and the combination of nuts with warm sweet-potato cubes, mixed into a tossed salad was unexpected, and yet delightful. For entrees my dining partner and I split the Pumpkin Fettucine and the Scallops, both were delicious-- but the Pumpkin Fettucine won between the two. For dessert we had the chocolate mousse and the panna cotta, and again, both were delicious. (Hard to eat anything else at this point though.) Because Mercato is a BYO, each of our AMAZING meals literally came to $35 a piece, and I almost felt guilty spending such a small amount of such an outrageously enjoyable meal. I am so happy to have finally experienced the legend that Mercato is, and I'm already plotting how to get back there asap. (Still need to try the inky seafood pasta dish!)
