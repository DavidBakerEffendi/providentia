I'm going to make a bold statement for a city that prides itself on Sunday brunches: Jane is by far THE BEST BRUNCH SPOT IN NYC. Hands down. A place with 6 different kinds of eggs benedict dishes is my idea of heaven. The Lobster Benny with rosemary fries is my go-to dish. It's been my best friend through good times and bad (there's nothing wrong with calling an inanimate object your best friend). The french toast is a close second, which is almost more like a heap of yummy cake with the syrup and the powdered sugar. Mmmm. If you're looking for a brunch place, whether it's a place for your usual Sunday Brunch or for when you have friends in town, Jane is the place to take them. But do know that it's best to make a reservation at least a week in advance to get the ideal "brunch time" because the lines are a bit ridiculous - if you go there without a reservation, you're guaranteed to wait over an hour for a table.
