Please stay away, you'll thank me! 1.  We waited 11 minutes for a waiter. 2.  We waited 39 minutes for our food and it was not crowded. 3.  Hamburger was a doubled "McDonald"patty which was overcooked and dry!  There was a hair under the bun! 4.  Chicken dish was dry and overcooked, also! 5.  Noodles with chicken was bland and too mushy. 6.  Asparagus,4, was overcooked, reheated, and mushy. 7.  There was a foreign object floating in my water. 8.  My mashed potatoes were cold. 9.  Menu description read salmon with crab meat topping.  I received salmon with a crab meat paste on top, EWWW! The manager did not charge me for the salmon,but that did not solve the awful food, service, etc. STAY AWAY! GO TO APPLE'BEE'S!
