I just wanted to tell you that We love the place.. We've been here numerous times, you cannot get a bad meal... From the delicious appetizers, to the authentic wood burning pizza, to Â the specials, absolutely amazing!! The servers are young , energetic, very friendly and attentive!! I am a restaurant owner with places in Manhattan & Long Island.. When in NJ , I always come to Vesta! After reading a few negative reviews, I felt compelled to put my own in... It seems as if these people are either restaurant owners in the area or connected to one... Or why would they tell you to go to another brick oven a few blocks away?? Anyway, good luck to Vesta!! You don't need it , Keep up with the good quality and taste of your food ! Dont change a thing.. I highly recommend Vesta to all !! You'll be happy you went.!!
