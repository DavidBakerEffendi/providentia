I wanted to like this place...they have the right idea, offering a lot of choices of healthy foods, juices, smoothies, but unfortunately the execution is way off. I went there once before and it took a while to get our food but it arrived within a reasonable amount of time. Today I went back for lunch for the 2nd time and it took 40 minutes for our lunch - a portobello sandwich and a kale salad - to arrive. The restaurant was half full and the tables on either side of us both got their order ahead of us. When we asked the waiter why it was taking so long and why other patrons were getting their orders ahead of time, he said that it depends on how complicated your order is. I'm not sure what was so complicated about a portobello sandwich and a kale salad that look pretty similar in terms of complexity to every other menu item. I also watched the smoothies being made - took forever, saw someone send theirs back. Most importantly, after all that time, when the food finally arrived it was - eh. It was fine. Not bad, but not something I would go to a restaurant for. Bottom line - it has the ambiance of a lunch place but it wasn't able to handle the capacity of the restaurant being half full at lunch time and the food is just okay. Certainly not worth the wait. There are way too many good places to go in the village to waste time at this place. Too bad, it would've been nice to have a place like this to go to in the neighborhood but it's not worth the frustration.
