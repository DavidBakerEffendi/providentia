Food is AWSOME! My family and I have been coming here for many years. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. Tea is always on the table ready for you and your order comes so fast! Food is so delicious and fresh. The roti cannai is obviously everyone's favorite but the pad tai OMG out of this world!!! Also they always let you know how spicy (or not) you want the food. Love love love this place !
