Had the tasting menu and it was fantsastic! The porcini flan was served with crab and had a nice truffle flavor, my husband had the chilled oysters with caviar, which was better than mine! We both ordered the wild salmon that had a nice amaranth seed crust, I cant even begin to describe how delicisou this was! Â  We also love the organic egg tasting can't describe how orgasmic our meal was we will definitely be back!
