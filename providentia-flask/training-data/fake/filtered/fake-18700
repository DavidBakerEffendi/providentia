Well it's a lovely place. Nice atmosphere... it sure is clean and the servers are neat as well so that's one star for their hygiene. Food is definitely great! Love the dishes and drinks here plus they have a really good menu to offer,we tried out most of the dishes because we come here often and everything tasted delicious, so that's 2 more stars. And you're paying for something that's absolutely delicious and comes with a great service so an additional star. And since every factor is just so great here, then that's 5 stars all in all.! And mark this, I'll surely keep on coming back. This restaurant is a right choice if you want to be blown away by the food!
