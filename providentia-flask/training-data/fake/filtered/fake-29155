I called to place an order and the lady that answered had a major attitude. This was the first time I ever have called this place and the first time I have posted a review on a site like this...ever. I asked if they had vegetable dumplings--she replied with an abrasive "NO!" I asked if she had pork dumplings and she pretty much yelled "NO" as if I was supposed to know--some of the worst, rudest, customer service I have ever experienced! Â As a business owner myself, I can tell you that these people suck and have no business running a restaurant. Needless to say, I cancelled my order. Poor customer service equals no customers!
