My friend and I were so excited to see an empty outdoor table @ Kanella last Friday evening. She had eaten there before and loved it and I had been wanting to give it a go before I booked the restaurant for a graduation party.  We had parked up the street, and unfortunately the spot was in an area that still required change for meters. As we only had enough change for about 30 minutes and the meters stay active until 10:00PM, we thought we would get some change from the restaurant as there weren't any stores nearby. We walked into the restaurant and the hostess barely glanced at us. She finally looked up, and when we told her that we would need some change for the meter she said, "We don't give change. If we did, that's all we would be doing."  We were a little taken aback at her attitude, to say the least. We said, "But we are going to be eating here!" She shrugged her shoulders, stared us down  and said nothing. No apology. No suggestion where we could get some change. Nothing. It was pretty amazing. We couldn't bring ourselves to stay after that treatment. We left dejectedly. After going down the block to The Foodery, where they were having a beer tasting and gave us lots of change happily, we ended up eating outside at Mixto, which was quite pleasant.  Is any business that successful that they can afford to treat a returning and a potential customer that way? I don't think so. We just wanted the owner of this establishment to know what happened.
