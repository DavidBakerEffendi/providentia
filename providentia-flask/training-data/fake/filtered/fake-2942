I've gone to Cuban Pete's a few times. I stopped going for a while because the cleaning chemical they use is so strong that it was giving me a headache; our table couldn't take the smell and we had to leave. I went back this week and the smell wasn't so strong but still noticeable; Their decor is nice and the place is clean. They have been slacking off though because the table setting plates are mostly chipped. The food is OK, the rice isn't that great. I had the Chuletas Asadas but the onions weren't caramelized; the chuletas did have good flavor and were not dried. My other two guests had Piscado Al Ajillo and both stated that it was good. My other guest had an Ensalada Tropical and was satisfied with it. My last guest had the grill cheese sandwich with fries; but was told there no fries; instead they brought it with plantain chips which he wasn't to thrilled about. The place is BYOB. We ordered two regular iced teas and the server said; I'll bring you a pitcher for convenience; I didn't realize it was for his convenience because they charged us $14.99 for it; that wasn't nice! Another issue I saw was that the plates in which they serve their food is also chipped. This is a big no-no for health inspectors as porcelain\ceramic dust is very unhealthy for customers. All-in-all the place is OK. Their service isn't that great even for a slow night with plenty of servers. The big turn off was the chipped dishes, lack of service and the pricing on the iced tea. I won't be going back; there are better alternatives to Cuban Pete's; in service, quality of food and pricing. It started out good but I guess management is getting lazy.
