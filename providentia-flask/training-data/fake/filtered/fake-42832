I recently hosted a Chinese New Year's party at Nyonya.  Everyone who came loved it.  They felt the food was new and innovative and the service was excellent.  Diane, the Manager, spent a lot of time helping me plan the event and every detail was handled precisely in the manner I requested.  For a unique and fun dining experience, I highly recommend Nyonya!
