You always need to consider the prices when rating. People give high marks to Per Se, but if you are spending $300 per, then duh!  It had better be a little better than  the local diner.  Anyway, Yerba Buena is very good, until you calculate the pricing into it. I love their cocktails;  they are very creative and the bartenders put on a show. The food is somewhat less creative, albeit reasonably tasty. Service is a bit too much in-your-face, however attentive. Maybe thats what I liked least. No, I liked the prices least. This place is too expensive!
