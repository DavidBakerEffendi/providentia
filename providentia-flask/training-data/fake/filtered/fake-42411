Had heard about this place from friends so I had to try it... First time I had the chicken mole burrito and found it fresh, tasty and HUGE. My friend and I shared this and her steak burrito, which was tasty but a little dry. But we finished it all!. The next time I came with 3 friends who rave about De Mole and I tried the shrimp burrito which was amazing. This time I ate half and had the other half for breakfast the next day. Everything else they had looked very good. Cozy place, fresh ingredients and terrific prices, will definitely be back.
