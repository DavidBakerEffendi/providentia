My sister got married here about 10 months ago. It was a relatively large wedding from what I'm used to... maybe about 125 people. The Bethwood was very accommodating to our party. We had several specific requests to be made about the set up of the hall, and they were able to provide exactly what we wanted. Having been my 2nd wedding at the Bethwood, and maybe my 10th wedding in north Jersey over the past 5-6 years, I have to say that I prefer Bethwood.
