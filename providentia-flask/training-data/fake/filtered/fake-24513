Staple canton restaurant in Chinatown. Does get ridiculously busy but traffic moves quickly. Floors are greasy, decors nothing to instagram about but damn the food is good here. One of, if not the best place to get Cha Siew (roast pork) from. I'll stake my life on it. Top 3 for Roast Pork in Chinatown (in no particular order) - Big Wong - Kim Tuong Restaurant (chrystie st) - Noodle Town (bowery) Service sucks a lot. But let me explain why. Chinatown food is so cheap (~5$ per rice dish) that for Restaurants to make money, they need a quick turn-over rate. They NEED you to be in and out as quick as possible. Its a trade off , cheap food for "bad" service. And in "bad" I mean, they'll get you tea, your order and your check. If you want someone to smile and whisper sweet nothings into your ears, find a classier joint. If you want good wholesome canton food, and can care less about the theatrics, come to Big Wong. Let me add how disappointed anyone who knows Chinatown food was when Anthony Bordaine featured Hop Kee in his show was. Hilariously ludicrous that he would choose Hop Kee over Big Wong for Cantonese Food. Hop Kee has altered their cooking for the tourist taste palette. No self-respecting cantonese person would eat there and consider it authentic caton food. Â Bordaine lost all credibility when he chose that over Big Wong.
