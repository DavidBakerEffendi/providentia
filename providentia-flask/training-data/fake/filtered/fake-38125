Like many folks, I saw Good Dog featured on the Food Network's "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives", so my wife and I decided to try it after spending a day in the city. Being dog-lovers we thoroughly enjoyed the decorum and although it was a little dark inside, that was definitely off-set by the warm staff. We were greeted by a very upbeat and friendly hostess who sat us almost immediately (she told us that a table was being cleared and wiped down). She sat us and told us that our server would be right with us, so we got a head start looking through the menu, Soon after our server greeted us and got us started with a few drinks. I'm sure that I'm spelling his name wrong, but Nemania was extremely knowledgeable about all the beers that Good Dog has (12 on tap and many many more in bottles and cans). He recommended that we try the Lagunitas IPA and it was just what we were looking for. He was also very patient, since it was our first time and walked us through the menu, answering all of our questions regarding the food there. We finally settled on sharing a few items and started with the chicken tenders cordon bleu, which came with a delicious home made whole-grain honey mustard sauce. They were perfect, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside! After that my wife and I shared both the mac n' cheese and the famous Good Dog burger (which Nemania recommended to us). The mac n' cheese was absolutely amazing - with bechamel sauce and topped with a very unique corn flake crust! The burger was also fantastic with caramelized onions and stuffed with blue cheese, the perfectly cooked burger really made us consider ordering a second one, but realized we were too full from the already delicious meal. All in all Good Dog was amazing and we will definitely be returning as long as we can have Nemania serve us again!
