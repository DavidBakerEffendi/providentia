As we were planning to visit Puerto Vallarta on a busy Saturday evening, we were concerned that the quality of the service and our meals would be compromised.  Nonetheless, we made plans to meet another couple for dinner.  Call ahead seating worked perfectly and we were in a booth within 3 minutes of entering the restaurant.  Our server was pleasant and patiently returned to the table three times before we were ready to place our order.  The chips and salsa were fantastic and went very well with the sangria we ordered.  Our meals were all excellent and prepared exactly the way we had requested.  The portions were very generous and we passed on dessert (all of which sounded great and were very reasonably priced).  Prices for the food were reasonable, given the quality and fresh ingredients.  Other than the sangria, we did not have any other beverages and, as such, our meal was very reasonably priced.  I honestly cannot say enough good things about this visit and will definitely return for another meal.
