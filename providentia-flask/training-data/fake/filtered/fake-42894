Such a great find!!! Who cares about waiting or lines - you live in the city it is expected of great places.  Came here on sunday for brunch and man am I in love.  I got the huevos rancheros....and let me tell you the second best I have had in my life.  I come from Cali and I have had over 15 types of this meal in my life and This was the second best.  The MANmosa great!! Fruit salad so good - and they put in fruit people actually like!  I am going to be getting fro from here at least once a week.   Go and do your self a favor!
