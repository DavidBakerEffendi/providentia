Went there For an early Friday diner with business friends. Wow! Music great, atmosphere great, service great, Jason's creative way with food, an experience that everyone should have as often as you would like to be good to yourself! Nothing like it in the city. Casual cool and world class meal and this is just the beginning. Thanks Jason.
