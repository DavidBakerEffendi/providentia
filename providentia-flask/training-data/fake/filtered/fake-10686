I ate here for dinner with my wife and a friend.  I am a vegan, while the other two in the party were not, but we all agreed that the food was outstanding.  I think that the "limitation" of being a vegetarian sushi place has really helped Beyond Sushi to think outside of the box and to come up with creative flavor combinations that are lacking from most sushi restaurants.  None of us had ever had sushi like this in our lives, and I don't see how any other place could emulate their unique style.  The owners and chefs are also extremely nice and accommodating.  We'll be back!
