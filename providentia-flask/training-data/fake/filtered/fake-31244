Yummy. I live in the neighborhood and enjoy Adrienne's. It is a little on the loud side but the salads are generously portioned and delicious, and the pizza menu accommodates vegans. This restaurant isn't what I'd call destination dining, but if you live in the area or happen to be in the Financail District it's worth a try.
