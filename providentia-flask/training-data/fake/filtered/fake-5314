I'm a big fan of this place.  Recommend going straight after work to avoid the wait.  The menu is seasonal, inventive and delicious.  My favorite of all the Momofuku joints (not a big fan of their ramen, but their pork buns are legit) The only negative is the prices - what was once a pretty affordable dinner is now a pretty expensive night out, not to mention his drinks are way overpriced.
