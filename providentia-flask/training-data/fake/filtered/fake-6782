I stop in Slainte often on my way home (because it's right across the street from 30th street station). I almost reconsidered writing a review because I don't want everyone finding out about one of the best kept secrets in Philly, but this place deserves some recognition. The staff is always friendly and helpful. The beer list is extensive & updated often... AND they pour a hell of a Guinness. The menu consists mostly of pub food-but it's GOOD pub food. If you're waiting for the train, stop in and check it out. You won't be sorry.
