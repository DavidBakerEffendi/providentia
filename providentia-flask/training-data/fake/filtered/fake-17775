Pizzas are hands-down fantastic, and the House, Arugula, and Baby Spinach salads complement the pizzas well. The Spicy Pecorino is one of my favorites, but the Cipolla is a bit too rich and sweet for me to order again.  The artichoke dip offered on the summer menu is a dense, small-portioned, and cold-served appetizer that could easily fall off the menu for good. The seating outdoors is lovely in good weather, and indoors is charming.  The televisions are big, yes, but the volume remains down.  It's not distracting in the least if you are not there to watch. Staff can be testy at times, and they are not fond of serving water, even if you've already ordered a beer or glass of wine.  On different occasions, I've had to ask repeatedly for water before receiving any. At the end of the day, though, when friends and family are visiting, Toby's is one of my favorite places in Brooklyn to take them.
