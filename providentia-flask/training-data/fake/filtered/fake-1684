We ordered a bottle of RED which was Pinot Noir, It was GREAT !! One of their segnature dish "Fried Chicken." Fantastic! It was very good Fried Chichen! Fresh Oyster / Clam were also good! Â  Steak was OK. Only I did not like was Onion ring. It was very oily & not crispy. Overall, it was great dinner, I will going back.
