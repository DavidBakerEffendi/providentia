This place is amazing! We've been to Ludlow a few times, and always loved Wicked Good Pizza. When we found it was no longer there, I turned to the internet to look for some delicious pizza for the kids and I. A few minutes away in Chester, VT was The Pizza Stone. Made-to-order, with fresh ingredients. This is our new favorite pizza place in Vermont, and possibly ANYWHERE!!! We were in town for July 4th weekend and this was a wonderful surprise. When we're back up north, we'll be back!!
