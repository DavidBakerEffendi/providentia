Best hot dogs around. Always get the chili and cheese and bacon and cheese. Brings back memories of the hot dog carts on Central Ave in Jersey City! They have great specialty hot dogs and so many hot sauces to choose from!! Always a hit with the kids. Plus they have a cart you can rent for parties.
