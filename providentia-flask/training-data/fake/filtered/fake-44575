Nice bar but very rude door hostess on Saturday night (2/5). So many more friendly places nearby!  We were so turned off by the hostess rudeness (packed restaurant but she said bar was "closed" - at 11:40 on Saturday night???), that my friends and I went to Teroir nearby and spent over $400 there!  My friends were visiting from overseas and I thought this would be a nice place to go for drinks (DeNiro, etc.).  Bravo Locanda Verde! Never again.
