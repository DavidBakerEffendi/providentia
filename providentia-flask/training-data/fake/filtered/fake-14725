Just Fish is an awesome eatery... its cozy, friendly and very inviting.  The Owner is an outgoing personality.  He is warm and interested in his customers.  I heard of Just Fish all the way from Brooklyn NY.  I ocassionally travel to Newark, NJ to enjoy the food.  If you want Good eating, an Awesome Atmoshpere, Friendly Staff and an Outgoing Owner I recommend JUST FISH!!! Serious Soul Food - Fabulous FISH!!!!
