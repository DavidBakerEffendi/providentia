First time I visited this place for a birthday dinner..We were a party of 10 and when we were seated, the ambiance and views are very nice. However, service is bet to differ. It took at least 45min to get our drinks ordered and our meals came cold and 2hrs later... The food was okay, I've had better. But when we get the bill and say that they placed a 22% gratuity on the bill, we were fathomed on why they would do that. We asked the manager and he gave us an answer saying that we reserved through someone...so 2% to that person...nope i don't think you dictate on the amount of gratuity you take when your service is horrible. I would be going back there...
