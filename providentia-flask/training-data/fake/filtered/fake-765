Love the pizza, love the happy hour specials, and love the service - with one exception. The hostess (tall, skinny, blondish woman) always comes off as standoffish and rude. I'm not sure what her job is other than to act pretentious. She is so rude, that if the pizza weren't so good, I would never ever come here again.
