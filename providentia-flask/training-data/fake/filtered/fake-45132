Dropped in today at 35 weeks pregnant; my unborn child and I were rewarded with a very delicious Denver (chicken salad, grapes, walnuts, lettuce) and a decent chocolate-peanut-butter cupcake (frosting was great; cake part less of a knockout). Glad to see on the website that they deliver for lunch; I might take advantage of this in a few weeks when leaving the house is too overwhelming. Looking forward to trying more of the sandwich options and introducing husband and the baby to Rybread soon!
