I am not one to lie and I'll admit I love this place. Whenever I am in New York I make an effort to stop by. The last time I was there I met up with a college friend and luckily we got the last remaining table near the door (a bit of a draft but bearable since it was sunny out) only to watch a dozen people trail in only half an hour later. The place is understaffed as one waitress was attending to all the tables in the restaurant but the food more than makes up for the lack of service. I ordered the Cuban style roast pork dish and shared the famous corn (both spectacular!). I also ordered the Mexican hot chocolate which was divine and the perfect touch to my meal. The portions are very generous (you will not go home hungry) and the prices are very decent. I have tried various Cuban restaurants (ranging in price range) and this one hits the spot. This is a very popular local hangout and IF you get lucky you may even spot some celebrities dine here including Rachel Bilson!
