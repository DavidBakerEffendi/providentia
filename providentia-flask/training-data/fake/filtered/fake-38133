i saw on eater.com this was in the top 15 spots to visit(Famous for their grilled cheese) so i strolled over there on a saturday afternoon.  it was pretty full but i found a seat at the bar.  the guys making coffee and serving at the bar seemed nice and were welcoming.  As i sat, i noticed that all the food comes from 1 cook who is stationed next to the bar, fully exposed 'kitchen'.  he was a complete dick to all the servers/food runners, he had a real ego.  i sat for about an hour, i had the grilled cheese with gruyere and the mac and cheese.  the sandwich had good flavor, the wholegrain mustard sauce was good..but this was not a grilled cheese it was so soggy there was no crispyness or crunch what so ever on the bread.  the mac and cheese was bland id take the instant stuff over this every time.  so as i sat for about an hour just having a beer, i watched the cook continue to disrespect the front of the house staff as well as his dishwasher who was a older woman who hardly spoke english.  the worst part was he kept his spoons and tools in a 6 pan(small metal container) in still water,  which a lot of cooks do..but he didn't once change the water, only wiped them with the same towel over and over before he used them. he didn't wash his hands although there was a sink with soap right next to him.  and on top of all this he mixed and plated all the side salads bare handed.  he bare hand plated pickled vegetables onto a sandwich.  maybe this isn't a review on the actual Queens Kickshaw, its about the overly cocky yet completely unprofessional cook that was working.
