This restaurant is stands out. Just in the basis of the exceptional wine list, Baoburg( which stands for chef bao bao in williamsburgs) deserves a michelin stars. Each offering is so well considered for its ability to match the food or offer something special, and there a few real gems at reasonable prices. The food is, of couse, supurb, and each dish is a true work of art. But perhaps the thing that more sets Baoburg apart is the service, which perfectly strikes that balance between professionalism and sincere friendliness. Truly an experience to be missed.
