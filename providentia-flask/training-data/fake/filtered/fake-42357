I'll say that the food is pretty reasonable. Flavor is there sometimes fresh. I must say it's a bit crazy that you can buy a "whole" chicken at reasonable price but only to get a small container of BBQ sauce with a small garlic Sauce.. I think it's insane that you have to buy BBQ sauce and garlic sauce for a whole chicken purchase. Come on people!!!
