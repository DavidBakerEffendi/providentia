I order food and snacks for office committee meetings. Â I've found Cravings' management and staff to be kind, courteous, and professional. Clients only have good things to say about the food and presentation; Cravings has provided all of the necessary accessories: table cloth, tongs, silverware, ice, cups, etc. As one who often has to plan meetings, I've been saved numerous times by Marisa's willingness to cater luncheons on extremely short notice. I strongly recommend Cravings.
