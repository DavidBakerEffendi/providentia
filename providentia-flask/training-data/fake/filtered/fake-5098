Hell's Kitchen Lounge is awesome! I was there this past Saturday before I attended the Devils game. I must say their food was absolutely delicious! We ordered the Asian wings along with the hard hat burger, periogies which was saut√©ed to perfection & a few other delicious entrees. Our drinks were perfect and most of all our service was outstanding, even with it being so busy. Everything is reasonably priced. (definitely make a reservation when there is a game, it does tend to get crazy) Everyone should check out this spot, if you haven't done so already. I will definitely be coming back!!
