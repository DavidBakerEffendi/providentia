I grew up eating Ernie's and I have only grown to enjoy their pies more and more. Pat and his family add to the character of the place. So being born and raised in New Haven I am a proud pizza snob. Ernie's makes the best pies, hands down. They have a crispier crust, and their cheese has more of a savory, oily bite than the other great apizza palaces in the Elm City. I tend to order a red pie with mozz and when they have their native tomato, garlic and basil pie, I am all over it. Eating in is best, taking it home is second, tied with having it prepared and frozen for intercontinental travel, and then heated for a few minutes. This gives the same religious experience as eating it fresh, in a faraway place. I cannot write more since my stomach is grumbling too much. This is the best Pizza.
