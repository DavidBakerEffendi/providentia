Dear Owner of Soco Restaurant, Please consider expanding to DC. I promise we'll welcome you with open arms! The food was great, vibe is cool, and I swear the Â hibiscus tea must have crack in it because I ordered 6 of them. I went for Sunday Brunch while visiting NY and fell in love. I had the red velvet chicken and waffle plate, the sweet wings, and hibiscus tea..make reservations because it gets busy!!
