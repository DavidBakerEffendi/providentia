I've been going here for yearsss and I tell EVERYONE I know about this place. It's perfect. Amazing (an understatement) food with great variety, great atmosphere, sweet staff (especially given how busy it always is), and always worth the wait. I think the prices are very reasonable (and I rarely think that of most NYC restaurants like this). I really loved their curry dishes (that soupppp), and all their beef and chicken is great. The coconut ice cream is incredible... I can talk about this place forever haha. Come, and bring friends! Remember: it's cash only! :)
