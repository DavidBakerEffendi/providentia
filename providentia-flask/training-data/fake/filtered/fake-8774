Typical Thai restaurant, cheap and quick.  It's scarey walking into the bar area because you never know if it's empty or packed until you get to the dining room.  Even though you are rushed through dinner like cattle going to slaughter, the prices of the food is great.  The drinks add up, but the food is good, fast and cheap.  If it wasn't for the blaring techno music, it'd get more stars.
