PUB46 really is as good as it gets. Tuesday, Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays get crazy with 2$ bring your own mugs, and college nights on thursdays. Wednesdays is my FAVORITE night at Pub with karaoke, beer pong, and flip cup games. Pubs like a big family you can't wait to be apart of. The drinks are cheap, and the bartenders always have something new up their sleeve. There's shot specials called out all night too. The food is the best bar food I've had around the area. I strongly suggest the wings, and the pub fries. Pub 46 is a place where you can come in for a quick drink with some friends and end up spending the entire night there! I strongly suggest stopping by for a good time!
