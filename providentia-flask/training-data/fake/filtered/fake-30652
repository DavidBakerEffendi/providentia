I came here for a Mother's Day meal. The decor was simple, but refined. The staff was courteous and professional. We had the charcuterie plate to start. My favorite was the duck  prosciutto; the pâté and sausage were a little bit knuckly. The main dish my mother had, seared sea-scallops w/ lentils, was excellent. I ordered the grilled seitan with mushroom gravy, forbidden rice, and fiddlehead ferns as a departure from the usual. The fern was whimsical and delicious, while the rice had a nice, rounded flavor. The grilled seitan, unfortunately, was bland and lifeless. I informed the server of such and asked for another sauce to spruce up what the first sauce hadn't. I was given the au jus, which didn't do the service I hope it would. The server didn't ask again if the meal had improved, which was disappointing. The cheesecake and creme brulle were very good. I wouldn't feel right giving 4 stars to this restaurant.
