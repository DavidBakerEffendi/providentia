A friend of us gave us the tip to go to this restaurant. We (a couple of 3) will never forget this experience! We had no reservation and in cause of that a waiting of round 40 min. After wards the service was perfect. A short delay in the kitchen after ordering our wishes was equalized with free french fries. And no discussion about the huge perfect made steaks. Oh my god. Believe me you will never get something like this in hole Europe! The dessert was also like a culinary orgasm... ;-) And all that for a Â price which is more than OK! When I'm back in NY Ill be also back in Houston's!
