This was a disappointing experience. The service, long story short, greatly diminished the meal. The restaurant is set up in a bar configuration, with one table for 5 in the corner. The cooking happens behind the bar, as does most service. With this sort of configuration, a conviviality between guest and host is expected. The service was dry, impersonal, and slightly rushed. Meals at other restaurants of this caliber have, in my experience, been filled with informational, jovial and exciting exchanges with servers and other staff, a necessary and enhancing element to the evening. Servers seemed reluctant to engage in conversation about the (often) cerebral offerings, and that, coupled with the fact that, frankly speaking, it's extremely awkward to comment on food with companions (part of the fun of the meal!) when the kitchen staff is yards away, created a silent, joyless, and mildly arrogant experience. Some dishes were revelatory. Wine pairings, fantastic. Overall experience, an avoidable miss.
