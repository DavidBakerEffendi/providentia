This is one of my favorite NY restaurants.  It has it all!  Both the restaurant and the menu are stylish yet simple - something you would like to do at home but just don't know how to.  The wait staff is attentive, and I love the music and the whole general vibe there.  Not to mention those gorgeous NY celebs that are always breezing in and out... So whenever I am in NY I head over to Chelsea and sit back in those gorgeous white leather banquettes and order a cafeteria cosmo and my favorite fried green tomato salad, meatloaf with tomato relish, mashed and green beans and if I can manage it, a waffle banana split!  OK, so I only do this once in awhile...I do live in a beach town, after all!   Thanks Cafeteria, for my latest Comfort Food Fix!
