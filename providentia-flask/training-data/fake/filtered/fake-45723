I recently ate dinner for the second time at GTC and enjoyed it more than my first visit. Both occasions have been dinner for two without reservations. Our first visit we sat inside at a small table, we took one look at the wine list and opted for the wine store instead where we purchased a bottle for under $20 (no cork fee for first bottle). Our second visit was spur of the moment because the weather was so nice and we wanted to eat outdoors. The hostess did seem slightly annoyed that we did not have reservations but after a 15 minute wait (not bad at all for a Saturday evening) we were seated at a large outdoor table with a sun umbrella. We ordered the Chef's selection of cheeses. They are a great size for 2-3 people to share and come with accompaniments. For a main course we selected the Saturday Plate Du Jour of Steak Frites ($34 and serves 2). Our waiter warned us that it was a sizable meal and boy was he correct, it filled a large skillet brought to our table. The steak was cooked correctly and the duck fat french fries were wonderful. The sauce on the bottom of the skillet made the meal even better. As our main course arrived the weather took a turn for the worst and it began to rain, luckily the umbrella caught most of it and we were able to continue to enjoy our meal. As a bonus, every other outdoor table quickly paid their bills and left, so it was very quiet outside! Tips: Make a reservation if you don't want to get an attitude from the hostess station. Skip the wine list and BYO or go to the wine store inside. Get the duck fat fries!
