We are blessed with a number of world class restaurants in Park Slope and Juventino is one of them. We've had brunch and dinner there frequently for a few years now and decided it was a great place to have a wedding dinner after our home ceremony a few blocks away. Being a party of sixteen, booking the place for the evening wasn't practical, but Juventino suggested that the space in the back of the restaurant, just before exiting to the garden, would be practical, reasonably private and that we and our guests could just order from the evening's menu. It turned out to be ideal. We arrived and a team of servers were lined up in expectation. We two grooms sat at one end of the table next to the displayed wedding cakes from du jour across the street, and we were able to enjoy the fabulous food (I had the beet salad and pork 3 ways) and make our way around to chat with each of our guests. It was great being in a public place because other diners would periodically come by and congratulate us, and both staff and diners were visibly supportive of our decision to celebrate our marriage in public, something that a few short years earlier we wouldn't have been able to do.
