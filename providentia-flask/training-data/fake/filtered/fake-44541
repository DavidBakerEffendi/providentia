I previously had a good experience at this Rhong-Tiam, which is conveniently located at a strip mall in Plainsboro which has several other restaurants and a large asian food market. Unfortunately, today I had such a bad experience at this place that I decided to write this review about it. First of all, the waitress got my order wrong and brought the wrong dish. This is something that can happen, so I wouldn't have a problem at all with that. What I take offense at though, is the way it was handled by the Rhong-Tiam staff: First of all, the manager told me that it was me who ordered the wrong dish and really made a point of insisting on it. If this is not incredible enough, after I stood my ground and mentioned that I indeed ordered a different item, they then brought me this other item, but it was completely and utterly undercooked (think a piece of beef that is half-cold inside and so tough that you cannot bite it). Now, the manager's response to the second food quality issue was that "usually this food is eaten by using a knife". Incredible. I give lowest marks for poorly prepared meals and an unaccommodating staff. Try to avoid this place if you can.
