The dining experience for me and three friends was not good at all. Â Portion sizes skimpy, refried beans were tasteless, chips were unsalted, and the salsa was loaded with cilantro (yuk). My "Deluxe" burrito as about as big around as my thumb, and was way too spicy. So-so service. I won't be going back.
