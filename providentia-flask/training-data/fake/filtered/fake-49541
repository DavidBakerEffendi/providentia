First, before I continue I want to say I DO really like their pizza a lot and overall, I enjoy the place particularly when I eat in or pick up the food myself. However, when we order for delivery, they mess up the orders quite a bit if it is anything but pizza.   For instance tonight, I ordered Eggplant Parmigiana, no sauce on the pasta and garlic bread.  I received pretty much no sauce at all on the eggplant (who, can eat eggplant with no sauce?) and they sent their special garlic bread for $4.50 and charged me for it, instead of the plain one for $1.75.   This happens a lot.  The people taking the orders just do not pay attention.  Now, in their defense, the Owner did not charge me for the order when I called to complain - so kudos to them for this.  But, the fact that this occurs so frequently is still annoying.   Stick to ordering a pie and you probably will be fine.  They have never screwed up any of my pizza orders.
