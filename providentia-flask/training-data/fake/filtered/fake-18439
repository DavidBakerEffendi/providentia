I went during restaurant week and was not disappointed.  Our server was very friendly and attentive.  He also gave us some great recommendations.  The "salad sampler" that starts the meal was great.  I didn't like all of the eight selections, but it's not the chef's fault that I don't like beets.  The hummus and flat bread are great - I could have eaten 3 times as much.  Good thing we still had many dishes coming our way.  For appetizers, the fried cauliflower was perfectly cooked and delicious.  I'd also recommend the fried goat cheese and the leek/mint fritters.  For the "entree" we got the young chicken and the lamb sausage.  Both were perfectly cooked and seasoned enough to be interesting, but not so much to overpower the meat.  I would definitely go back again, not just the food, but also for the atmosphere.  My father said it reminded him of some of the market restaurants in israel (higher-end ones, obviously), if you could ignore the snow storm happening on the other side of the huge windows!  There was definitely a hip vibe, but not one that makes you question whether or not you're cool enough or dressed well enough to be there.
