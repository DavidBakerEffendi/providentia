The food is absolutely fabulous. This is a tapas style restaurant so you get little plates of food and order several items off the menu. I can not say one bad thing about the food here. I was a little hesitant to order the Pulpo ( it is Spanish Octopus) and this was delicious as well as the seabass.. I recommend everything we ordered. Short Rib, Melt in your mouth. Duck - Canapes and Crab- Canapes they are served on top like bruschettas on top of a crostini. The Brochetas - Prawns are served on a skewers. Most dishes comes with two pieces per plate. On top of the food being awesome our server was excellent. He explained everything perfectly and knew exactly what he was talking about!! I love Jose Garces restaurants you can't go wrong!
