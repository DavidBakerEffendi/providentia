Perhaps the best know restaurant on 31st Avenue, Astoria and top rated restaurant in Astoria Queens, this gem of a restaurant attracts the young, hip and local food connoisseurs of Queens. Off the beaten paths of Broadway Long Island City or 30th (Grand) Avenue, Astoria, Il Bambino is one of a growing number of trendy restaurants sprouting up on 31st Avenue in Astoria. I have been coming here since 2008, and have lived on 31st Avenue nearly half my life, so I have seen many restaurants come and go. Il Bambino has survived the ups and down of our great recession and bucked the average closure rate for most eateries in NYC. Over the years, the co-owner, Darren Lawless, has worked tirelessly to maintain and run this restaurant at very high level, and this is also reflected in the fact that there has not been much staff turnover recently. You can usually find the same crew ready to serve food or coffee to those who come and go on a regular basis. My favorite is the Prosciutto panini, on the menu. Oh, and did I forget -most items on the menu go for the less than $15 and in many cases less than $10/item. Il Bambino provides outdoor seating, but no scenic view I am afraid, just a view of other apartment blocks and buildings facing 31st Avenue. However, in the summer it is nice to have a beer here with a sandwich. Restaurant is Rated A, but I will give them an A+ for excellence. They are also Zagat rated. Kudos Il Bambino -. KEEP ON COOKIN'
