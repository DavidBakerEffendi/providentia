Gargabe! Once in a blue moon case To my shock, i found a big metal screw in my aloo masala roll. I immediately reported to the manager, he assured to take care of me and refund me, but did not do anything. Would never go there to have their roll. The manager Scott Â at 49w 39 street Manhattan did not even have the courtesy to get back to me.horrible
