urban spice is sooooooooooooooooo good. I do like Indian food at all, but this place gives me a whole new perspective on Indian food. My favorite to get are the biryani coz in that week urban spice did biryani festival & They are delish! I love spicy food so Â I order anything I get extra spicy. The chef works wonders with all the different Indian spices, and they all come out. Indian food isn't just different kind of currys in my mind anymore.chicken 65 is a great appetizer. I can not rave about this place enough. Do yourself a favor and check it out, you will not be disappointed.
