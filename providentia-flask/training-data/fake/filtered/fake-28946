What can be said about prime 16. Is the food good yes is the beer good of course...how can it not be? They are a beer bar. But when it comes to service...my god do they need help!!!! I have been four times. Twice for happy hour and twice for lunch, both times the "managment" was a joke! I had the opportunity to meet the "general manger"  not once but twice (the man with a pony tail) who to say the least has no personality when we approached him about our food...served wrong and cold, and our horrible bartender  he basically surged it off. Well thanks for hearing us. On two other visits during Saturday lunches we had the wonderful encounter of meeting the other manager a young man who just seems plan clueless and scared.We sat at the bar for both these visits and let me tell the bartender will let it be known he is doing you a favor by waiting on you. I mean for us handing you money you would think he would be a little more personable...but I guess when you are "New Haven Chic" you are doing everyone a favor. Prime 16 food/beer great but service is what keeps people coming back. (fyi there are restaurants in your area with good beer, good food, and great service)
