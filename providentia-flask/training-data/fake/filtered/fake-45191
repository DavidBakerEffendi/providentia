My friend and I went here a couple weeks ago and the food was amazing. I want to go back and try their different udons and ramens. If you go make sure to try their pork buns it is so so so good! The only thing I didn't like about this place is that the workers kept staring at me and my friend. Although attentive service is more than welcome I felt really scrutinized while eating so despite the yummy food I was slightly uncomfortable. My friend also agreed with me
