I went to cielo restaurant & got really sick on the fish dinner i ate. when i called the woman who answered the phone said oh ok ill have the owner call you, i still wait his call, the bathrooms were filthy & when my wife ordered wine it had stains on it from lipstick, i went there due to a friend of mine worked there & we wanted to surprise him, when we asked about him they said he was at the shore so very unprofessional. i will never go back there i gave one star because i had to.
