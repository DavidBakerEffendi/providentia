I was there a few weeks ago and this place went downhill. I used to go all the time when I was in college about 5 years back. As soon as I sat down, the waiter decided to charge us a $10 cover. A COVER! This isn't a night club! I was there with 2 other people and decided to get a "peppermint patty" flavored hookah. The hookah tasted like sour milk and a hint of peppermint. We tried to switch it out for another flavor and the waiter told us there was a "replacement fee" of $20. THE HOOKAH COST $18! Where does the other $2 come in???? We decided to get the check and leave. We only got 1 hookah for $18 and the bill came out to $50! We looked at the bill and the waiter decided to charge us a $10 cover for EACH of us! We decided to pay it and just leave. Right when my friend was filling out the total amount for his credit card, he noticed that the bill was now up to $60! The waiter decided to leave himself a 20% tip! This guy is out of his (bleeping) mind!! The manager obviously took the waiter's side (the customer isn't always right in this place) so we paid and left. The next day my friend disputed the claim and only had to pay $18 since the cover charge and the tip weren't posted anywhere in the restaurant or menu. Serves them right! If you want a good hookah and Moroccan restaurant, try Al Jannah in Clifton. Great price and great service!
