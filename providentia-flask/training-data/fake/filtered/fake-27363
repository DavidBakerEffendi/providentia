The most overrated pizzeria in Brooklyn. I don't even think they know how to cook a pizza. Every time I eat a square slice, it is under cooked beyond belief. Its like they serve raw dough with 5 pounds of sauce. Ever since they changed ownership this place has gone down hill. At least they have good ice cream, but other then that they suck.
