El Vez quite possibly has the best guacamole I've ever eaten.  Period.  We got the sampler, which allowed us to try three different kinds, all of which were absolutely phenomenal.  The fish tacos also were very tasty - perfectly portioned with great flavor.  Atmosphere was fun as was the drink menu - many great options! All in all, a great experience.  Would definitely recommend making a reservation, however, because this place gets crowded!
