There are certainly many tempting places to eat in the reading terminal market. The Original Turkey is one that should not be missed.  I had the "special" on rye, and it was the best turkey sandwich I've ever had.  the turkey is moist and tender, and the cole slaw and russian dressing were applied in just the right amounts.  the bread was as fresh as could be.  they make em large, but not obscenely so, keping it quite manageble to eat.  5 stars!, I'll be back.
