Glastonbury pizza house is one of the best pizza shops around there prices are resonable and they always have good deals. they have a very friendly and nice staff with great customer service that always greets us when we walk in. The resteraunt is very clean and has really good food. There is a full menue with lots of different choices which I like and they deliver which is awesome I have never had a problem with there food there so i would recommend this place to anyone
