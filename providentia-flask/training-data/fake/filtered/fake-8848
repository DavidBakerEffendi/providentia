We were expecting something better but there aren't many great Falafel places in NJ. The Falafel was so-so but not bad. Still not sure how I feel about the pickles on the sandwich.. The hummus was average. We made a special trip to Falafel Hut since there isn't anything good near us. We'll sticking to what what we know in Jersey City and Highland Park for now.
