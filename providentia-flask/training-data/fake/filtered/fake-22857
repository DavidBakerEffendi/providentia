Phrases we uttered throughout the evening: "off the chain," "mad good," "out of control." It was my first time at Amada and it was great. The food was incredible (we had the seafood paella, AMAZING) and the restaurant is really nice inside. We experienced great service from everyone, the hostess, the waitress, the bussers, the food runners. Everyone was extremely professional and courteous. My only complaint would be that for a fine dining experience, this place is pretty big and the open-air design makes it a little loud. It was not ideal for the level of intimacy we wanted on our one-year anniversary date but it would be a great place to go with friends.
