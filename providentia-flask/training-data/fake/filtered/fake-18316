This place used to be great under the old ownership, but since changing owners it's gone downhill. Ordered a turkey sandwich with avocado, was overcharged, and after sitting down to enjoy my lunch, I was upset to discover that all my $7 had gotten me was a meek 3 slices of turkey and some heavily browned avocado. So sad, this place used to be great!
