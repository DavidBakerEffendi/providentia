My lady and I stopped in for late lunch at Kati the other day and we were not disappointed.  This was a go-to when I worked in midtown, and nearly two years later, they are still delivering consistently delicious smack-your-lips-around-this-kati-roll-goodness.   The two of us shared a combo of four rolls, which we thought was plenty (even on hungry bellies, the portion size is right!).  All were good.   It wasn't too busy, so the manager Scott took some time to welcome and talk to us, which was nice.   Bottom line - go here if you like quick delicious Indian food.
