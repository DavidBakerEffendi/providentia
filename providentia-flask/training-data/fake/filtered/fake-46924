I made reservations for the 4 Season's Fountain Restaurant for a Birthday Luncheon on Open Table.  Several days later I increased our party number and requested a specialty birthday cake.  Everything was wonderful from the service, food, reservation, accommodations, valet parking, and updated emails.  I even took advantage of giving my credit card information ahead of time so that no bill came to the table that another party goer would try to take domain over and credit for a wonderful time.  This was my second time dinning at the Fountain Restaurant for a special occasion.  I wanted the Party Girl to remember her special day.  And she definitely will.  I can highly recommend the Irish Coffee as an ending to a perfect day.
