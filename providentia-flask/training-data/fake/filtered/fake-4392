Very good experience, I would definitely go back. The waiter was a little handsy, and the dessert came before the appetizer, but overall I was very impressed. They also required us to order in Swahili, and our chairs were all different heights, but nothing out of the ordinary. I could have done without the strobe light, but the Justin Bieber song-a-thon was a huge plus. If you are in Burlington, go to Bluebird!!
