Love this place, I love that I can have habachi delivered to my house and not have to deal with the crazy crowds at the restaurant. The ny steak habachi dinner is great, the FBI dessert is awesome too! The only downside to this place is if it's busy and you order delivery, it can at times take about an hour, hour and a half to receive your food, but definitely worth the wait I feel.
