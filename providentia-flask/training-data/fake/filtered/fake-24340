When I first discovered Mex-Grill, I was in love. you could get a huge platter of nachos for 6.99 with perfect fajita chicken, refried beans, and cheese. (And oh my gosh, don't even get me started on the churros!) However, after the past 6 months or so and 3 orders later, I am less than impressed. After bungling an order, I called the store to see if they could send over new nachos as I am allergic to onions. The woman on the phone was quite rude. The prices have jumped by 2.50 or more per plate. They cut back on quality and quantity. The chicken now tastes like the icky chicken you might get from a bad Chinese food place, you no longer get hot beans drizzled over your nachos, nor cilantro. It is now standard "Taco Bell" food for many times the price. If nothing else though, the fried churros are always a go!
