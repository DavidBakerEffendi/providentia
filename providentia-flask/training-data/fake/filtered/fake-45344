Made a reservation for 7 people a week in advance, was excited because it was a special occasion.  My excitement soon turned into utter annoyance.  Arrived at Soco at  5pm only to be seated 45 minutes after! Can you say pissed? Not a great first impression.  The server wasn't attentive.  The wait for food was long.  The food was alright nothing amazing. I had the chicken and red velvet waffles, left a lot to be desired. I was not as impressed as other reviewers.   The violinist, decor, and crowd was good.  I would be willing to give this restaurant another chance (maybe a different meal) but it probably won't be soon.
