Having a husband from Austria, we decided to try Steinhof for our anniversary. The consommé soup was pretty tasteless (needed salt and chives, but only had floating parsley bits instead) and the schnitzels, just so-so...Veal would have been better..Everything needed salt. They put the weiner schnitzel on top of a pile of pickles (cucumber salad?) so it got a bit soggy on the bottom.  Bigger plates would have helped in that case. They have those little oval diner plates. The potatoes were dried out. The rice bland. The farmer's cheese appetizer was good, but not very authentic. Tasted more like veg cream cheese and the salad had ranch dressing:( I think the cook was Mexican? The waitress was nice, and the space cozy. But yea, there is bad rock/pop music a bit too loud as someone else mentioned. I can see it being appealing on a winter evening, esp on the $6 goulash nights. I'll stick to Blaue Ganz for more authentic Austrian fare.
