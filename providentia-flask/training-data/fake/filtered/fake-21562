I enjoy it here sometimes, its rather mixed but usually more on the positive vibe. I recently moved to new haven, and was pleasantly surprised to find this little vegetarian restaurant in such a small city that has vegan options :) I go there almost every day for a variety of items and usually like everything, what I am most confused at though is some of the other patrons... No they do not have table service, they are a small restaurant..it works for them...but this does not mean they are mcdonalds...I absolutely understand some of the comments below about a burrito being undercooked, or a a salad having too much feta...but if in ten minutes the burrito isn't out on the table, I've witnessed patrons already at the counter appalled that they do not have their food? Â  I do believe they use an oven to make food not a microwave which to me seems like the better choice... I say cut them some slack! :) Also, someone made a comment below that if you live in New Haven you do not eat there...I am a regular...and several of my colleagues are regulars... All the girls I have come in contact with are nice! I do find it funny they have no males working there... Lastly, the cake issue, if you to Claires in the evenings, sometimes they have a lot of cake left, sometimes they do not, I asked the girls one evening what they do with it...sadly most of it goes to waste...BUT they then went on to explain that they had been donating cakes to a food pantry or homeless shelter...but that abruptly the places refused to come get the donations? Weird.
