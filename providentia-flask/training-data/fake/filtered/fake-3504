I tried Osteria for the first time this evening, and while the food was good, I wouldn't say it was anything to write home about.  I tried the polpo pizza [wood grilled octopus], and it was pretty good, but the crust was quite burnt.  The octopus was also burnt, but I liked that about it - it gave it an extra-crispy texture that I really enjoyed, so I don't know if that was deliberate or not.  My fiance had the marinara and had cheese added to it - that was pretty good.  A friend had described the pizza as "life changing," but I think that was a significant overstatement.  Good, but not great. The service, however, was superb, and the atmosphere was wonderful.  The seating is a bit crowded, but that's ok unless you're really large.  The crowd was a little older, but maybe that's because it was a Monday night.
