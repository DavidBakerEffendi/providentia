A little  gem with creative food and wonderful friendly service.  Heard about the place and had to try it.  The idea of supporting local suppliers and having a market driven menu  keeps things interesting. There were five f us and we tried, the pizza, meatballs, lasagna, two salads and bolito misto., and teh Holy Jesus cake....  All were delicious. Meatballs nad lasagna ( if you can believe it) were actually light.  Bolito mist - an Italian version of braised short ribs was delicious. Uber thin crust pizza delighted all of us. One bite of Jesus and we were converted....Yum! great food and our bartender and our waiter were great.  The waiter especially had a great sense of humor and gave the place a "local" homey feeling....Go - it is great ---if a bit out of the way but worth it.
