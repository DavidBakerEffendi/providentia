I ordered Lamb Shawerma and was super disappointed not only by the flavor but the quality of the meat used! It was all chunky pieces of fat and no meat whatsoever which made the "claimed to be Shawerma" horrible. The whole sandwich was lame with no real Mediterranean flavor AND I am Mediterranean and I know what am talking about! I would say it is also not over the top on hygiene, the floor in front the counter was all sticky..My flip flops were stuck to the floor because all the greasiness there! Never going back!
