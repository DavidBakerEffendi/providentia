Very, very cool atmosphere (maybe a bit loud). High ceilings, dark wood, wrought iron...was great to just look around. Then the food. My husband had a steak sandwich with gruyere that was very good, but the burger I got with bacon and aged cheddar on a pretzel bun was outstanding. Fries were also very good. Lots of variety in the menu. Really happy we went!
