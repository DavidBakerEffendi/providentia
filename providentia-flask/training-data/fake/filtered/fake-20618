Travelled from afar to try minneta' great stakes. My wife ordered the tavern steak and I had the lamb saddle. Both were cooked to our liking and the taste was exceptional. Our waiter Dan also tempted us with the choc souffl√© and I must say it was decadent. A generous serving for two. Dan was very knowledgeable, extremely helpful and we had a very good dining experience. The ambience of the restaurant was dark, misty and it took us back of what New York may have been in the 30s and 40s.
