We went into Dig Inn yesterday to ask for directions, saw the food and knew we had to come back. When we went back today the girls and guys working there made us feel so welcome and excited to eat. We chose brown rice, chargrilled chicken, spiced sweet potatoes with cranberries, I had roasted beet root with pumpkin seeds and my boyfriend had roasted brussel sprouts....ALL AMAZING! Whoever comes up with the recipes is a genius...you need to release a Dig Inn recipe book! Our total bill came to $23 including drinks which we thought was great value considering portion sizes - we even took leftovers home! Loved the downstairs eating area and the fact that you can see into the kitchen too. Unfortunately we are only in NYC for a few more days but will definitely squeeze in another visit!
