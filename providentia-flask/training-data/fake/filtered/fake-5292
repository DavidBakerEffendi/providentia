I want to like Roberta's, I do, I do. So many of my friends love this place and I have been there four times, once for brunch and the other times for dinner. The combination of the concept of using fresh grown vegetables, ethical produce and melting cheese onto dough really should mean that I love the food here.... but I don't. I've tried the pizza with kale (which kind of tasted like chinese restaurant seaweed on pizza... really bizarre) and sausage, I've tried the one with talleggio and sausage, the one with speck and garlic, the margherita, the eggs.... heck, I tried the wings. The food is fine. A bit bland. The toppings are very undergenerous. The servers need to get their shit together! I have been working in the service industry for 6 years and there is absolutely no excuse for how rude these guys are! There is one guy who is really nice, but the girls are offhand, unattentive and it always feels like you are putting them out or wasting their time. It's very strange. Anyway. Roberta's. It's fine. The price point is reasonable for what you are getting. I'll probably go again.
