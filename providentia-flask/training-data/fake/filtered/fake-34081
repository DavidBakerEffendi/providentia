If you think Tiffany's is a good place to eat, you need to get out more.  We got a gift certificate from someone who didn't know we would never go back so we tried it again and had the same disappointing experience.  Service is always bad, even though the servers have time to stand around in a group doing nothing.  They don't even come to your table to offer a drink until they think you're ready to order your dinner.  The steak was not cooked correctly and didn't taste very good, the baked potato tasted old and the vegetables on my plate looked like they were left over from last week.  My husband had a hamburger which he said was edible but the cole slaw tasted rancid and the fries were not very good.  The french onion soup tasted like nothing and my caesar salad tasted like they didn't wash the lettuce.  Our table was dirty so we went to another and it was too.  The drink menu was really skanky - when I touched it to look at it I was repulsed.  The managers stand around doing nothing, nobody asks you how everything was when you're leaving.  Either they already know or they really don't care.   Next time someone gives me a gift card for Tiffany's, I'll definitely give it back.
