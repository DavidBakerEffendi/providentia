This is my second visit here and I think I could cheerfully spend a whole day here, aside from the crowds! What an amazing selection of wonderful food! We started with breakfast at Pearl's which even has real maple syrup. We stocked up on sausages, cheeses and baked goods and drooled over coffees, crepes and beautiful mountains of fresh produce. I love this place!
