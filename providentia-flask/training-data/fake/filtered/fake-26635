Today was like the 3rd or 4th time I have been to this spot and I can stay with complete certainty that the food is consistently GOOD!!! I have had the short rib hash and one of the omlettes (don't remember which one).  I recommended the spot as a place for my brunch club homies...everyone raved about their meal.  The raspberry and passionfruit champagne cocktails are also a fave. We had the pleasure of meeting Chef Josh who was so excited that we enjoyed the food and welcomed us back for a "treat" next time.  Stone Park Cafe is a great brunch spot, with fantastic service and a great crowd.  I meet interesting people each time I go. They don't take reservations for brunch so I recommend (on Sunday) getting there before 11am or after 2:30pm (they close at 3:30p to get ready for dinner).
