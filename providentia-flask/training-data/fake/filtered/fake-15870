We had the good fortune of parking in an ICON garage next-door to JUNIORS on West 45th yesterday  There was a half hour wait . . . we saw 4 seats magically appear at the counter . . . we grabbed them . . . we were immediately and cheerfully greeted by bartender/server Carey who did not care that we were only having coffee & dessert!  Coffee was delicious, desserts were outstanding. Service was excellent! We will go back for sure!
