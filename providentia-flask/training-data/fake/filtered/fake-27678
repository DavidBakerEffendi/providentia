I live literally a 10 min walk from this place. This place has their own pizza take out, spumoni/ice stand, and restaurant. Delicious pizza and pasta. Whether you eat at the outdoor seating provided or dine in at the restaurant, the place is just good. 70 year old run business, and their sauce is just awesome.
