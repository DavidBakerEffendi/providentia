The best street meat cart in NYC, hands down.  The meat and the vegetables are always fresh and they are generous with the portions.  I've had every dish and pita sandwich from this cart and have never been disappointed.  Sure, the falafel and chicken over rice is good, but my favorite is a kefta & shawarma platter over yellow rice, pita on the side, lots of white and hot sauce.  Very good sized portion, especially for the price.  The free falafel samples are always a good treat when waiting on line.  Can't beat this place and great prices.
