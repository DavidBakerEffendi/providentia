We went on a Monday evening, and just ordered dessert.  Our server was super friendly, explaining menu items to us and recommending her favorites.  The hot chocolate was amazing!  I really enjoyed the Mexican hot cocoa; it was unusual and spicy but quite good.  I don't know if it was just the dessert items we ordered, but they (dessert pizza and waffle) were big and super filling.  We weren't able to finish everything, despite skipping dinner.  It was rather pricey, but no more than I would have expected.  Will hopefully get to go back, next time a major dessert craving hits!
