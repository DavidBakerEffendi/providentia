I dont trust food carts lol but there are few i would buy from. These dudes are one of them. And the one on lincoln center. Something about how clean and proper they make you the food. It makes me feel safe lol I had this multiple times while walking by 14 st on a rush from work to meeting and its late. I pass diner time. I am hungry. I just dont wanna eat anything. I want something good and contained. Hummm these guys gave me a good fix multiple times. Delicious!!! The line for the cart is ridiculous but worth every bite...Its just under $7? Woooow!! What the fudge! Crazy! Â Thats what i am talking about :)
