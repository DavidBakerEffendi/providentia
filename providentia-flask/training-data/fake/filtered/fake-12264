Stopped by for happy hour and dinner the other night.  This place is now one of the nicest looking bars in the area. They changed the whole layout.  They also hired a new chef and changed the menu.  We had several app's and I had a steak.  Everything was tasty (especially the steak).   Looking forward to going back soon.  Think the official grand opening is this week.
