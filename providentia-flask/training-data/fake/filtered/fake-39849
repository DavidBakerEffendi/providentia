Best thai in the neighborhood! There's typically a wait and they don't take reservations, but it's worth the wait! Â Everything I've had there had been great! The food is not too heavy. The fried rice with lump crab meat and wok cashew nuts with shrimp were both tasty. It's definitely small, but totally worth sitting close to a few strangers for good food!
