I don't understand what any of the fuss is about. I've had Marco's pizza precisely once, because once was enough. The slice was stiff enough to hold flat in the air while I gripped it by the crust, and was crunchy and crackery. The sauce was also very bland, and the only positive thing I can say about the cheese is that I don't remember anything standing out about it enough to comment on. I bought two slices. I ate most of the second one, but had to trick a family member into finishing it for me. He did not like it either, but that piece had touched my mouth so who can blame him.
