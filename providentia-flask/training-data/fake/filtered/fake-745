So this past weekend my family from Chicago came in for a visit, some first-timers others have been here a few times before. as a native Chicagoan i and my family enjoy a 'good pizza", 16yrs and counting since I've come to NY and I've only found 1 place that I can say "I ADORE THE PIZZA"!!!! It's a little place in Fort Greene, Brooklyn named "Not Ray's Pizza" mmmmmm:-) So at Lombardi's the service was nice, dining room was clean and the pizza was ok... If your looking for an authentic brick oven pizza, Lombardi's is the place for you.
