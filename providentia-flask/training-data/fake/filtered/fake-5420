Crazy Cuban here. This is the real McCoy or real Arnaz if you prefer. Â Great food and one of the few places I have ever been to that actually has some Cuban Class. For some reason, most Americans, and sadly some fellow Cubans seem to believe that dirty kitchens, neon signs and plastic plants and travel posters mean good Cuban Food. Not so my friends. Learn your history, Cuban culture is filled with fashion, ambiance, great music, stylish settings and great food. This place has it all.
