started off well enough, got sat right away, lovely table...and that's where the good review ends. sorry balaboosta. their green-horn waiter forgot half our tables wine...had to ask another waiter because ours had his blinders on. the apps and small plates came out waaaay too fast, and were luke warm...and bland. the skirt steaks were over spiced and over cooked as was my filet mignon. which was of course ordered medium rare, and came out medium......embarrasing... the desserts were also a let down, the mousse was obviously in the freezer and needed a pick axe to get through, and the pudding was less than appealing. the espresso was great, best part of the meal. we will not be back. now, if balaboosta is an honorable restaurant, they wont have this honest review taken down...again.
