New to the area, passed by this place coming from the local Target store. Got home, hopped online to check it out and I was there within a week.  It was great.  Neighborhood gem.  Great atmosphere, friendly staff and most important, GREAT FOOD!  I had raw oysters and a wonderful mahi mahi with a mango, pineapple and watermelon salsa served with coconut rice.  It was one of the specials of the evening.  Good wine list.  Would have liked to see more options by the glass but my sauv blanc was crisp and refreshing.  I'll definitely go back and often!  Thanks to Gary, co owner of Meal!
