I have only eaten there once, and it was excellent - both service and food.  My husband and I went with friends who eat there quite often.  We were very pleasantly surprised at the wonderful, friendly service, and the great food.  My husband and I quite often have Sunday breakfast at another diner in town after church; however, after reading on the New Haven Register website this evening about how Georgie's fed the homeless for Christmas, it will be our diner from now on.  May God bless the owners, and all who serve at this wonderful diner.
