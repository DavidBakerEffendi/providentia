This is a very rare experience. Paulie Gee's is a combination of sublime pizza, great atmosphere and super people. This is the kind of experience that gets into your dreams after you go. Paulie is a font of knowledge of all things pizza from the east to west coast and puts the best of it into his own special menu. When you order the pizza, don't look at the ingredients. It may throw you off. It's hard for your head to wrap itself around the combination of Gorgonzola, prosciutto, cherries and honey, but it works. It will blow you away. Experiment and trust in the master. Ask him what you should try and you are in great hands. You will love talking with him as much as he does talking to his customers. Cherry Jones, Hellboy, Arugula Shmoogula and Becca's Bacon Marmalade Picante are my faves. Don't forget about seeking out his "Secret Menu" as well.
