If you want an honest review from a patron who is not biased, doesn't have a restaurant down the road who is in competition with Sushi California, listen to this one.  Simply based on food and comparing all sushi restaurants in this area. If it's good enough for my 85 year old Japanese mother and her Japanese friends, it's good enough for me.  They go the extra mile, even at their ages to eat there.  The sushi chef is excellent, the prices are very reasonable.  If all you want is good sushi, no hibachi tables or asian-fusion - american cuisine, check it out. Definitely worth your while.  No alcohol, so bring your own.
