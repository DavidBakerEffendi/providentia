They ALWAYS get your order wrong. I've been double billed, had orders not put in and twice had an order with multiple different pizzas where they combined all the topping into one pie. Who does that? Finally I ordered buffalo tenders and they sent plain tenders with mustard. To make it right they redelivered a small container of buffalo sauce. How insulting. "Sorry we screwed up here make your own buffalo tenders". It's not just that they screwed up, they handled it very poorly. This is from someone who really wanted to see them do well. They just don't care and when you have a "meh" product you need to at least have great service.
