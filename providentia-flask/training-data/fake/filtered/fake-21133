Omega is probably the best diner in all of NJ. The food is great and the service is excellent. Always greeted by the friendly hosts in front who quickly seat us regardless of the time and date we visit, they hardly make you wait. My only prob with them is that the soda machine by the bar counter sometimes has it's moments where it tastes soapy, so they should probably invest in a new one... other than that, love this place!
