Having dined at many higher rated NY restaurants, I can say that without question Ai Fiori is seriously underrated. I've never had a better meal when evaluated from appetizer to dessert. Simply amazing. We dined there last night and cancelled another reservation to go back tomorrow night. You need to experience this one!!
