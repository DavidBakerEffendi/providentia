I'm ecstatic that there's a coffee place south of Tasker that isn't filled with jerk know-it-alls who started their barista careers working at Starbucks - and it's good, real good. Not perfect, but that's expected for a place that just opened up (last week? the week before?) I stumbled in here with some friends over the weekend for breakfast. I'm so attracted to comfortable (and level) outdoor seating, so we stopped in. Mind you, I noticed the place that was in the same spot before, something 'croissant,' but I never felt welcomed to come in and get something. Chhaya, using the same space, was able to get me in there. I'm not a Yelp aficionado who tries millions of spots, I generally only frequent the same spots that I adore, but this is definitely a spot to try. I love the 'let's put anything and everything on top of a waffle and it will be DELICIOUS!' Holy fucking yes! Chili? Eggs benedict? Check, Check... and now I hear of chicken curry? On a waffle?! I CAN'T WAIT TO TRY IT!
