The steamed crab and pork dumplings really were delicious!  I ate them for my meal.  Everyone needs to be prepared to pay in cash though.  The menu is pricey and you should have lots of cash on hand. I ate solo since I was just in town for a couple of days during Spring Break and stayed at a little hotel around the corner.  I went on a Tuesday and there was no wait.  So I suggest staying away from the typical Friday thru Sunday crowded nights.
