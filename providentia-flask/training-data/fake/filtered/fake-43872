We had dinner here last 4/19/2013.  The place is small and cannot accomodate a big group. However, the foods are good.  I ordered chicken with rice and salad and my friend ordered lamb with white rice and salad as well. They served it with freshly baked pita rolls. The waiter was so patient to explain the menus. Foods are delicious and its all worth it.
