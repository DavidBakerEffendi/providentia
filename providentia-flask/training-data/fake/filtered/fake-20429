Came with my family to a restaurant new to our neighborhood. It was loud. Hard to hear each other's conversation. Â We waited quite a while for our order (we were six so that is understandable), but they definitely rushed us out. We waited for the food substantially longer than they gave us to eat--started clearing away dishes while we were still trying to enjoy our food. If they want return customers, allow them to partake of the experience and don't make them feel as if they're being rushed out.
