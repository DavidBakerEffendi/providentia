We walked by earlier in the day and saw the thin crust pizza covered in tons of fresh arugula.....that night we were served a pizza with a handful of mixed greens on top. Â We informed our waiter this was not arugula and he had no idea what we were talking about. Fifteen minutes later he informed us they were out of arugula....wow trying to pass off bag salad as the topping....we also ordered meatballs that never came asked three times for napkins did not get olive oil that was supposed to come with the bread/crackers never got a water refill etc.etc. The scallop anti pasta was excessively rubbery....do not recommend
