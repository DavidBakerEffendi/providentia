IF you don't experience this place... you are out of your mind!!! I am appreciative of such a soulful, cool laid back family oriented atmosphere.... NOT TO MENTION the food and drinks are to die for! I had the stew chicken & rice and beans (can you say DELICIOUS) ... The chicken empanadas were hot and juicy... the music was suavey and relaxing... but that BERRY SANGRIA.... WEEEEPA! They don't know what they started but they DEFINITELY can't get rid of me now! This will be my cheers *que the music* "sometimes you wanna go..." I was pleasantly pleased and I highly recommend everyone to check it out!
