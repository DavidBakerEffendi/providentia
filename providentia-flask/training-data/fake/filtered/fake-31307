This place is very decent.  The buffet is actually a much higher quality than you would expect when lunch only costs 7 bucks.  Even beyond basic chinese food, they deliver:  excellent breaded zucchini, sweet potatoes with marshmallows, buttered brussel sprouts, slow cooked pork, fried plantains, and fresh salad.  The food is good, the Restaurant is clean and  I have always had good experiences with the staff.
