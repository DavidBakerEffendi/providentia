The atmosphere: I visited with my friend on a chilly fall evening in early November. The weather was perfect to eat...in the garden! Through the gates, flanked by towering walls and illuminated by fairy lights, my friend and I were seated at a tiny two-top near a tree; leaves occasionally falling into my drink! Although not on a date, we were surrounded by happy couples quietly chattering. The service: Impeccable. Polite, in no hurry to rush courses, knowledgeable about the food; able to make recommendations for wine pairings. The food: Oh, the food. We shared the tasting menu. Full of flavor and delicious combinations. The small portions and endless options left us feeling satisfied. Due to dietary restrictions, we did request a single change to the menu and were happily accommodated. We had scallops, smoked trout pastry, duck, a cheese plate, foie gras, a lovely salad and more! Everything was exquisitely prepared, well presented and so full of flavor. The valet: slow, slow, slow. I walked; my friend drove and used the valet. It was recommended that we provide our ticket to the waiter about 10 minutes prior to leaving; which we did...30 MINUTES LATER...no car. We waited for 40 minutes (it was 10 pm) until the car arrived. Had I known it was going to take so long; I would have sat at the bar!
