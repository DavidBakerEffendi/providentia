Really feeling this place.  Actually came for a happy hour where they serve really amazing cider's, wines, and beers.  Ended up staying here for dinner because the food looked so amazing.  I'm a healthy eater and this place is right up my alley.  Excellent meats, vegetables, all organic, no bs preservatives.  Really hard to find, I wish more restaurants were following this trend.
