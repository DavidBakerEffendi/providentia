The sushi is good at Zen but you first have to get past the nasty and unorganized hostess.  We had an eye opening experience when we ate at the sushi bar.  The area where the chefs were working was dirty.  Bowls were piled up, sushi was not wrapped in refrigerated area.  The knives were wiped with the same rag that wiped the counters.  We will not be returning!
