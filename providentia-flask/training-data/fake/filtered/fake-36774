A Single Pebble is one of my favorite restaurants in the whole world. And I have been to many great restaurants. It is very expensive, but worth every penny. You share a bunch of food between a bunch of people, so you get to have a little bit of everything. It is all delicious. Dry fried green beans, mock eel, and red curry soup are some of my favorites. You can't go wrong with A Single Pebble.
