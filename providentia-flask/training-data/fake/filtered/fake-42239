I went to traif for the first time this previous wednesday night with my girlfriend as we had heard alot of hype about it. We arrived around 8pm and were seated and put in our drink orders immediatly. The server was very in tune with the menu as it changes frequently. To cut to the good stuff we ordered: Strawberry-cinnamon glazed ribs Bigeye tuna tartar Shortrib sliders Salt and pepper shrimp Foie gras Scallops w/ corn and pistchio brown butter Before any of our dishes came we received a complimentary shot-sized cup of watermelon chili gazpacho which was deliscious. The ribs were probaly my favorite ribs i've ever had, crispy outside and falling off the bone and the glaze was perfectly balanced and very subtle. The tuna tartar was a winner. Served on tempura japanese eggplant was nice, sort of like an open faced spicy tuna sushi roll. The shortrib sliders were very tender and juicy and the sweetpotato fries were everything you could wish for when you think of sweet potato fries. The salt and pepper shrimp were ok. They were technically successful just not to my taste. The foie gras was served with a fried egg and fingerling potatoes which was fantastic sort of like foie gras for breakfast. And finally the scallops were perfectly cooked very sweet, and the pistachio brown butter with corn was an incredible combination. And to finish we had a conplimentary watermelon cube with a few drops of pomegranate molases in it, which was perfect. Overall the place stood up to all the hype and I will be returning very soon. Very fair prices as well especially for this neighborhood.
