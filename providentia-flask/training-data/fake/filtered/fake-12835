This place is always so open, airy with lots of people. This place totally gives a positive vibe and it's what i'm all about. Even the surrounding businesses are awesome to check out when coming here! I love making new friends and just having a good time and this place was awesome to do it at all while eating great food. The prices were definitely reasonable for the area and the employees seemed to love their jobs. That's exactly the vibe I like to have when visiting a place.
