Happened on this sports bar/casual dining restaurant through a coupon saver and decided to check it out for Super bowl Sunday. The small bar/restaurant was packed but the manager/owner Lynn was more than helpful finding us a table right away. The bar food/appetizers were good although the free buffet at half time was just okay (but it was free and plentiful). The waitress at our table was fantastic despite a crowd and full tables she smiled and really was on top of everything all night. I would definitely go back to this place for casual dinner/drinks anytime. And if you are a sports fan you will love the the amount of big screen tvs throughout the place.
