Really good Â place for seafood. Came here on Tuesday. The wait time was about ten minutes, not bad at all for a very popular spot in Manhattan. The servers was fast and attentive.They have excellent customer service skills, friendly, polite and knowledgeable. The food was definitely top notch stuff. We ordered Oysters, very fresh.The crab legs were meaty and delicious. The blacken catfish sandwich was so good that my boyfriend ordered a second one. If you crave for some delicious seafood, this would be the place for it.
