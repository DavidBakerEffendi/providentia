Great food, from start to finish!  The bread, as simple as it is, is amazing!  It's warm, soft in the middle with just the right amount of crispness, and has a great flavor.  The chorizo was delicious and the yuca was pretty good.  The roast pork is very tender and tasty.  The vaca frita was very tasty but I found it to be a little dry.  I preferred the ropa vieja, which was delicious.  The pollo rincon was amazing - great flavor!  The plantains are good and the rice/bean mix was very good.  The bread pudding was also very good.  One of the best parts of my meal was the Mamey Shake - I had never heard of it before and was more than pleasantly surprised.  As great as the food is, the service is even better.  Rudy is a hilarious guy who remember us after the first time we were there (even remembered what we had ordered.)  Definitely planning another visit there sometime soon.
