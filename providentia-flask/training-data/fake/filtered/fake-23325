Great vibe. But most if all GREAT Food. What I love most is that most of their items are pretty much spanish-american cuisine. I'm also in love with their grilled pizza choices! They have the classics like the magaerita and hilo (Hawaiian ) but they also have inventive choices like the new duck seared pizza which is out of this world! It seems like they update the menu with items, but to me thats pretty amazing considering everything I tried there is just delicious. Will eat here at least once a week.
