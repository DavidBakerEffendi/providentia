Overall impressions: fun, classy, quiet, delicious, and...bright. Food was fine, even memorable.  I had the lasagna, and my girlfriend had the eggplant rollatini appetizer (which, by the way, is big enough for a person with a small appetite).  We started with the buffalo calamari, which was great. But now, on to the main focus of this review: the television situation is out of control. Do you like staring into the sun?  Would you like it if I drove up to your house and flashed my brights through your dining room windows?  Think of that level of discomfort, and multiply it by 4. That's right.  There were four HUGE flat screens in a row, each one showing a different terrible channel. To whomever thought this was a good idea:  you were wrong, and I'm telling everyone how wrong you were.  Some bad decisions in our lives are swept under the rug, but your television decision will forever be remembered in Yelp history.  As other reviewers have commented, this was a completely ridiculous move. Would I go back?  Sure.  Food was great, wine/beers were great, service was great. But avoid the TV room at all costs.  You have been warned.
