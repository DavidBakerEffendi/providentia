I cannot say enough nice things about this place.  I have been here two times and both times have been terrific.  I had the crab cakes both times and they are the best.  My boyfriend has gotten daily specials and enjoyed them.  Every entree there is complemented by original sides and sauces making for great dishes.  The service and ambiance are excellent.  It is a little overpriced but overall worth it.
