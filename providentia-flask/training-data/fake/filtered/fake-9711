This is a great Vietnamese place. It's BYOB and there is a liquor store next door. It can get busy and be prepared to wait. We went on a Saturday night at 7pm and only waited for about 15 minutes. As we were eating I could see the line outside get longer at times. The foot was delicious and with your meal they bring bean sprout, basil, and lime for the table. The pho and broth in general are hot (temperature) and the sriracha makes it spicier. This isn't the best dining option in the middle of a warm summer. My meal came with shrimp and crab meat. There were only three shrimp in the bowl so don't get your hopes up. Others in our party had beef pho with probably 10 beef pieces. The service is slow, but friendly. We were okay with that since we weren't in a rush to leave. I will be returning to eat here again in the future, but not more than once a month.
