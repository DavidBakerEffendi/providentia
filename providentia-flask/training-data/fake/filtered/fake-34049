We visited this place again Saturday Dec 22, it was packed, but the service was smooth, people were raving about how exceptional everything was. My Â girl friend ate almost all her grilled seafood platter and that plate is huge, I have to help her a little bit. On the other hand, I will recommend some Christmas balls hanging from high ceiling. We enjoyed our visit and definitely will visit again. Good job done by the new management!
