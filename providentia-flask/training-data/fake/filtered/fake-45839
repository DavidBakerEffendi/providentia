Blue lights? Yes, please. Window seat?  Of course.  Sound track (the Strokes and Thievery Corp.) was perfect.  Australian wine--de Gulden Zeepaard--very tasty (apparently the Dutch explorers get around).  Je weet toch. But really it was the company that made for a memorable evening.  Funny, sweet and very, very hot. Also a bit of a talker. To the waitress we kept waiting past closing: sorry to keep you from the rest of your life! We lost track of time. We promise we'll arrive earlier next time. And the sushi was pretty good. #that'sjusthowIfeel
