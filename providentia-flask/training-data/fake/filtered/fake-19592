This place had a "soft opening" earlier this Fall (2010). At present, it's BYOB. I went with a big group to check it out; I had the fish tacos, but tried a variety of other dishes. Absolutely SMASHING food. The fish and tortillas were fresh and crispy, and the fillings were well seasoned and ripe. Â  Plantains were very well prepared. Good people and good service. They're still scrambling to have enough cups and plates, but that will pass. Highly recommended.
