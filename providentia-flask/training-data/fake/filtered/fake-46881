Paesano's has elevated the standard for sandwiches in Philadelphia. The cheesesteak/hoagie cliche has defined Philly sandwiches for WAY too long. I have eaten here dozens of times and my only complaint is that sometimes the bread for the awesome panelle sandwich has not been cooked enough. Even so, it is the most amazing sandwich on earth for under $5.
