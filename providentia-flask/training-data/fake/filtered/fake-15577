I have been twice and was happy to get something other than Portuguese food in the Ironbound district. The drinks were ok but nothing to write home about. The service was "eh". The first time I went the waitress was a little incompetent but nice. I ordered the salmon and shrimp rolls which were good, took a little long for just sushi though. The second time I waited ten minutes at the bar and there was only one other person besides myself so I ended up leaving and going to Iberia's. Too many spots in Iron bound for bad service.
