We met a guy on our flight  from Florida to Philly who told us that Zento made him fall in love with sushi.  Well, we fell in love with Zento.  We had a spicy king crab roll, a garden roll, a rainbow roll and a sashimi roll.  Arguably the best sushi I have ever had.  Everything was fresh and the service was great.  The place is small, but quiet.  I highly recommend this place.
