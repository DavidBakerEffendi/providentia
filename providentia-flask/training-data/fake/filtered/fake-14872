This place was all right.  Nice ambience and relatively good service for a Chinatown restaurant.  I went there because I thought it would have good wonton noodles, but the wontons were a tad on the salty side, and there's definitely better wonton noodles in the neighborhood.  But the noodles did have the special and move expensive chives that other places don't have.
