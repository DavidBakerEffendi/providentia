What an apt name! Did it taste good? YES! Was it Malaysian cuisine? YES! The fried tofu was excellent, some of the best I've had-- crispy on the outside, extremely moist and melty on the inside. Their rice was cooked in chicken broth and incredibly flavorful. And everything was so cheap. For my girlfriend and me, the check came out to about $20 and we were both stuffed. I had no idea that this area in Elmhurst had such a concentration of SE Asian cuisine. Definitely will remember to come back here (and you should too!)
