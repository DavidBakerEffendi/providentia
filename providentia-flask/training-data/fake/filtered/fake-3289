I have been here at least 10 times and never been disappointed. The watermelon goat cheese salad is delicious. So is the ah'pizz salad!  I usually get the ah'pizz pizza. It seems simple but the flavors are amazing.  I have spent plenty of time in Italy and I think this is on par with authentic italian pizzas.
