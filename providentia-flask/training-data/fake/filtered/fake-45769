Had a wonderful dinner for two. We mistakenly purchased a Groupon for the wrong night and the staff graciously accommodated our purchase. The meal was delicious with generous proportions. The dipping oil for the bread was a great combination of hot and sweet spices. The veal and chicken were cooked perfectly. The potatoes were were just crisp enough to be firm while remaining moist and soft in the center. The dessert cannoli was creamy, sweet, and not overly heavy.
