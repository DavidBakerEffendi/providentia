Hands down the current best in astoria's sea greek seafood eateries, a very saturated category in these streets. impreccably fresh, expertly cooked. a huge con that prevents it from a glaring red 5 star rating is the decor, tone and demeanor of the entire staff. Inside has Â zero ambiance and at times it seems as if the staff is making noise to come across as an odd competition to see who could be the most pissy and vocal about it. It is entirely unnecessary to THROW silverware into a bin full of silverware and speaking loudly over it in stressed tones. Not a pleasant environment to eat such fantastic food in. If the owner likes you, you get special treatment. If not, your kind of out of luck. It's almost as if those who don;t complain get free drinks. Focus on the food instead, broiled scallops being one of their best.
