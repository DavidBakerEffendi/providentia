Delicious stuffed artichoke! Both my sister and I really enjoyed them. I haven't had one like that in years and was happy to find a place that made them so well. I also had the chicken franchese which was good. It came with two pieces of chicken and I chose to get pasta with it instead of a salad. Kinda wished the pasta had the same sauce instead of the red sauce, but only because I'm picky like that. We then shared the tartufo, which was great as well. Came with 5 pieces, we ended up eating two each. I also ordered a cappuccino, the glass was a little messy so I had to wipe my hands off, but it was good. Overall, I definitely will be going back to try more.
