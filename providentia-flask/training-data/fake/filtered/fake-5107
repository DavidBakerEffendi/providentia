It's a legit, down to earth, no frills bar.  It's full of students from nearby Rutgers Newark and Seton Hall Law School, cops, and firemen which leads to a great, safe atmosphere.  Only problem is that its in a Shady part of town and its tough to find parking.  Great food for a dive bar if you're lookin for something along the lines of a burger or a sandwich.
