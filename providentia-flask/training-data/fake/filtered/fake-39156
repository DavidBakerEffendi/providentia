I'm into burgers and after being very unimpressed with Bobby's Burger Palace, I decided to check out 500 Degrees. The spot is small. Really small. Like if 20 people were in there, they'd be touching. That said, the burger was good. Got the classic with truffle fries. The fries were great. My only complaint is that the burger is for supermodels only. I'd call it a snack instead of a meal and I'm usually only able to eat 1/2 restaurant-type burger.
