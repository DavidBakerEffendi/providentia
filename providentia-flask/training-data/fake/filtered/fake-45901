We made a reservation for six people at 8 PM on Saturday, March 12.  We arrived on time only to find folks who had 7 PM reservations waiting to be seated.  We were seated by 8:30. No waitress came to our table for twenty minutes.  It took another twenty minutes for the salad and appetizers to be brought to the table.  It's now 9:10. Dinner itself wasn't brought to the table until 10PM... 90 minutes after we were seated.  The waitress apologetically had brought us a second salad free while we waited. My pastichio was dried-out and browned from sitting under a heat lamp too long.  In contrast, my friends said their dinner was barely warm.  Apparently, the kitchen staff cannot keep up with the volume of orders. The hard wicker chairs, formerly from their Pitahari Taverna restaurant in Highland Park, NJ, has found a new home in the Monroe location.  They are very, very uncomfortable to sit on, especially for two hours. Our friends told us that if they had come by themselves, they would have cut their losses and left after thirty minutes. The long, long wait is a deficiency with the staffing and kitchen that's been occurring in their original Highland Park location and has been brought over to this new one in Monroe.
