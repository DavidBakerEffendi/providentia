Good food, TERRIBLE service! I was at Percy St. BBQ Saturday night with 5 other people. We got our appetizers before our drinks, as we waited over 20 minutes for our cans of beer. When the meals arrived, mine was not served. Since our waitress did not check on us - even one time, we had to wait another 10 minutes before we could grab someone to tell them I did not get my sandwich. I finally got my meal as everyone I was with was finishing theirs. Although the food was good, the service was awful. I will not be returning.
