Well I have not yet tried the food, I just got off the phone ordering and I should have hung up on the lady who answered the phone or at least ask to speak to her boss! I called and asked her what are their specials' she answered and said "the same specials we have everyday!" I asked well what are those? she yelled " the same ones from everyday!!!  so rude?! how am I suppose to know there special's I don't work there!  #BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE
