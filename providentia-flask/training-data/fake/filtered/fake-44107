We went Â here on our first date and both got the all you can eat sushi. Per person is $22.99 which I think is a pretty good price considering you can basically order anything on the menu; they have a large variety to choose from. The food is made fresh and is very delicious! But overall I gave it a 4 on a scale of 1-5 because their service is a bit sow if you don't sit at the sushi bar.
