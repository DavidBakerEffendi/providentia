I've had breakfast at Cafe Cluny a couple of times, and it was good both times. The breakfast club sandwich is really good and the service is fairly good. The servers are definitely friendly, but the table next to me had some trouble with their order, they didn't warm up their order as they had asked, so I think that the service can Â be a bit spotty.
