Tasty, reasonably priced dim sum. Highly recommended if you're in the area. For quality of food and price, Noodle Chu is vastly better than the offerings in Fort Lee. It's also slightly better than Qin Dynasty across the street, which offers greater selection but is often packed and can be a little bit hit-or-miss with respect to flavors and textures. While it isn't quite the same as flushing, it's probably as good as it gets in NJ.
