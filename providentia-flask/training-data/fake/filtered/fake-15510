I went to the bar for an esports event. The host was promised a time frame and about 90 people showed up for the event. We all purchased food and drinks and were somewhat rowdy, but we weren't causing a disturbance. Techno music was blasting and there were a good 30-40 people who weren't there for the event that we were being far louder than us. A frat group heckled a few of us and called us 'fucking nerds' and then the manager kicked us out and accused us of being too loud and driving away st. patty's day business. Food was mediocre, service was shit. Will not be going back.
