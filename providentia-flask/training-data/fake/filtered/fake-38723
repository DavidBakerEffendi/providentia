I am a local artist,and garment worker,I had to go to Fork to meet up with a server who received one of my charm bracelets for Christmas.I walks through the awkward womb -like drapes only to find a tiny sourpuss of a woman...slight,with cropped dark hair.She was very dismissive of me at 1st glance...the other servers,and host crew were really nice,and the bartender Guy,was sweet,and makes a great cocktail...but the point of greeting patrons,is to make them feel welcome,and the sour-puss at the door did not...just because i don't LOOK like I can afford to eat there,I can!
