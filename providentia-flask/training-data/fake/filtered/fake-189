RUDE!  Big emphasis on that.  Being friendly and polite goes a long way with the majority of people, who could be potential repeat, loyal customers.  Cheesesteaks are tasteless and expensive, separate lines for drinks/fries and for steaks.  Huge sign about you have to speak English when ordering.  They have a sign telling you how to order (wit or witout onions), which makes you sound like a piece of garbage, which is what genos is, garbage.  Also there's a vibe that you might get beaten up if you look at someone the wrong way the whole time you're there.  Don't go there.  Once again, they're incredibly, offensively rude.  No logic to their operation here.
