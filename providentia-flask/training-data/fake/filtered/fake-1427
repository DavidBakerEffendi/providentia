I don't know if maybe they've gotten a new chef or hired new servers or something, because a lot of the reviews I've read are negative, but I can't think of anything bad to say about my experience. I stayed at the hotel for a weekend back in September and I loved everything about it, particularly the service at the Tap Room. I ate at the restaurant three times, twice for lunch and once for dinner. I had a delicious Summer Salad and absolutely LOVED the truffle fries (incredible). Had a few other things but can't remember what, these two definitely stood out. Nice place to go grab a drink in the early evening, and the staff was very friendly. Will definitely return again in the future.
