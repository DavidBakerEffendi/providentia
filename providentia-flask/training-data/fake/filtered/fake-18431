When this place opened up, I hated it! 93 cents for sambar? Then one day I ventured off into the fusion and I got the #14 with goat cheese and the sambar didn't go well. I kind of get why sambar is extra. But still. Reasons why I still coming back to this place: Good Dosas at a reasonable price BYOB!!!!! Staff is nice and friendly and surprisingly informative Reasons I don't like going: Can get packed during lunch! With chutney company in the name, I think there should be a chutney fountain in there. We need more Southern Indian restaurants in the city!
