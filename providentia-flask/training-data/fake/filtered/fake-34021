Best Kale Salad Ever! I've lost over 100 lbs over the past year primarily by eating a lot of salad, so when I say that Vital serves the BEST kale salad, I know what I'm talking about! The chef cuts the kale into thin strips and adds a touch of cumin to the dressing. Delicious! And, the chicken was just right! I even enjoyed the water, which is served with a slice of cucumber and lemon. Â The food was so good, I just had to tell the chef! The staff is friendly and the service was great. I'm looking forward to going there again.
