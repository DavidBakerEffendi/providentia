Emporio truly is one of the best places in N.Y to eat. I went there for my first time a few weeks ago with my uncle and brother, and my first impression? WOW! They do it right, here, from the decor to the food and service. Walking in at 8 o'clock, it's crowded but warm and cheery. Trendy couples at the very cool bar flirt over delicious-looking wines while some waiters and customers alike jabble happily in none other than Italian. We were seated quickly despite the crowd, and although seating was a bit of a squeeze, it felt cozy. The waitress came quickly and was very pleasant. She brought scrumptious bread along with equally wonderful olive oil for dipping. We ordered the watermelon salad to share, and not only did it come in a timely manner, but it was heavenly. I mean cool, sweet, juicy watermelon chunks drizzled in smooth balsamic vinaigrette and paired oh-so-gorgeously with creamy goat cheese and laid to rest on fresh basil leaves. 'Twas delicious in every way possible! After our divine watermelon salad had been finished (awww...), our dishes came out well before we had expected them to with the amount of other customers there! I had the Paccheri alla "Norma" which looked a little strange but what it lacked in appearance it made for in taste. The eggplant was savory and complemented the fabulous house-made pasta. My very picky twin brother ordered Le Capesante, and he was floored by the wonder that happens to be tender scallops, sweet corn and yummy tomatoes. Uncle P. ordered Agnolotti, and he was, needless to say, extremely pleased . Overall, this is a wonderful little place. The food was worth the price, and next time you're in the area, do consider eating here. Cheers!
