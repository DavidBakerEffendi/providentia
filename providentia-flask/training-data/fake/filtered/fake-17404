Absolutely amazing pizza.  Super thin crust, cooked to perfection.  It's the best pizza around.  Be prepared to wait if you go around dinner time, even late lunch time during the week.  The wait is never super long.  An excellent time to go on the weekends is right around 11-11:30 on Saturday just before the big lunch crowd hits.  Parking is tight, but it's definitely well worth it!!  Best pizza around.
