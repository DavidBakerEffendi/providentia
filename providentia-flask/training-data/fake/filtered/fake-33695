Food is phenomenal. I recommend ordering their fajitas. This place is always packed. The only reason I gave them 4 stars rather than 5 is because of their odd management system. They do not accept reservations, nor do they let you take food to go... Strange if you ask me. On Friday and Saturday nights expect to wait an hour to two hours before being seated. Food is delicious, fresh and reasonably priced. Service is on point as it should be to turn over the tables in a timely manner. This is my one and only go to tex mex restaurant.
