i recommend this highly! We (party of 6) went for dinner after a matinee on a Sunday. We arrived at 615 , and our reservation was honored promptly, We sat in the back which was very comfortable, The menu for dinner has a nice variety and our waitress Rachel was fantastic! Answered all our questions and helped s to decide on what and how much to order. The butternut squash raviolis are a must for an appetizer! They put soft pretzel sticks on the table with a great mustard and keep refilling upon request, Excellent chicken pot pie, and Salon also very fresh. We would definitely go back and try the brunch menu which also looked very good, When I arrived home i noticed a mistake on the bill that I hadn't seen while we were there, I called the next day and explained the situation, the manager took care of it with no hassle or problem! This is to be commended, So hope you give The Brickyard a try! Enjoy!
