Lunch can be easier to get reservations! A beautiful meal from beginning to end! Had the Tasting Menu and it was fabulous. One of the best meals ever. Presentations were beautiful and service was impecable! Yet, not hovering. You can run up your bill unintentionally by having more water and be sure and ask the price of the glass of champagne they recommend!! The loaf of bread given to us as we left was a welcome surprise!
