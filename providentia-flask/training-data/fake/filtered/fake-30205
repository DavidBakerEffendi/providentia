My wife and I decided to try this place for the first time. The food was very good. My wife really enjoyed the eggplant lasagna. Very thin slices of eggplant. The veal dish that I had was also very good. The dining area, while small, was separate from the bar area, which we appreciated. We Â also enjoyed the Gato Negro Merlot wine from Argentina. Would definitely go back.
