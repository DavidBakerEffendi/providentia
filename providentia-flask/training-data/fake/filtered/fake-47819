new to the area, and new to yelp!  girlfriends and i decided to go out around rittenhouse area and landed here for some drinks and fresh shucked oysters!  from the outside, the place looked crazy!  we went in and were seated right away at the bar.  we ordered a dozen oysters and let our waiter chose for us.   he made excellent choices!  the drinks were delish!  everyone seemed to be having a great time, including the people that worked there (my girlfriend pointed out the manager standing by the bar tasting almost every drink that hit the bar, which i thought was odd, but my friend told me he was making sure they were satisfactory, or wants to have a little fun at work :)    ).  the place was packed, but still got really good service, and it looked like everyone else there did too!  i learned they do a Sat Night Happy Hour, which is hard to find on a weekend, and we can not wait to get there for it!
