To give a quick summary of the restaurant  :  1. The food was good, and exotic in its own way  2. Food on menu are not that cheap, and the juice / dessert      are strongly not recommended.     The last, and the most important part...   They ADD A 28% TIPS DIRECTLY into the bill, it's INSANE  and the service is nothing different than any other restaurant.  Since we order something around 150, we have to pay almost 45      dollars more. I don't think I've EVER paid 28% tips anywhere in a      restaurant, I paid 25% when its a upscale restaurant or when the  service is extremely good, but this just left me speechless...   My friend who told me this place said that last time their bill didn't         include the  28% tips, so basically it comes out pretty randomly,   whenever they are in the mood of earning you extra money.  So, with this price and its related service and food, I end up rating this      restaurant one star.     Be REALLY CAREFUL  the next time you go, in the worst case, add  30% to whatever price appears on the menu, and believe me, its    DEFINITELY NOT WORTH IT.   I just hope nobody will be robbed like us again :'( ....it was a great  evening with friends but got pretty mess up in the end with the  unexpected bill.
