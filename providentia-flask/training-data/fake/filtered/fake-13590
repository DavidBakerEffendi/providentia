I have to say I don't know why this restaurant is so popular.  The food is ordinary, the tables are piled one on top of another and everytime we go there, there is a smell of some kind of insecticide.  Very off putting. the sauce is not special and watery. To me it is a restaurant that tries to hard to be clever.   Just my Honest Opinion.
