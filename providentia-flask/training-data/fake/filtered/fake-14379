A great night. I've been in the Upper Valley for over 12 years, and this is such a yummy and FUN addition. The menu is fresh and different and has something for everyone. The wine list is simple yet selective. And the guavapolitan is to die for. Jimmy and Natalia are excellent hosts. I thought the ambience/decor was simple and tasteful. They have made efforts to reduce the noise level, and that might need more effort.  However, I will happily return. ps -  I have to disagree with another reviewer - I thought the mushrooms were perfectly flavored with just enough bite.
