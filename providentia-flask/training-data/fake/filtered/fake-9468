Terrible service - waited over 30 minutes for brunch (we're talking eggs and bacon) - no explanation - no apology forthcoming until I complained - food not worth the wait.  Many other tables kept waiting and complaining.  Had to roam the place to find waitress to ask why the delay - looked through kitchen window - cook must have been in the weeds but guy in there chatting with sunglasses on top of his head.  Rubbish.  Can only assume favourable reviews are by staff or owner.
