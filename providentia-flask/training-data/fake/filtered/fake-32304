I love coming here. My boyfriend and I have been fans for awhile now. I think their food is very good. I only had one issue, my boyfriend did not care for the meatballs. He said they were comparable to frozen meatballs you can get in the grocery store. Prices are fair. Service is generally very good. This place is always busy, especially on the weekends, so I highly recommend making reservations if you plan to eat here. Parking can be tight on the weekends as well. The main dining area has the tendency to get rather loud when it's a full house. I would not recommend coming here for a quiet romantic dinner. However Cafe Antonio is very nice, quiet, and romantic if you come for a later dinner during the week. I have never ordered food from their "Pizza Shop" side although I hear it's very good. Cafe Antonio is a must if you are in the area and looking for some great food! Remember this restaurant is BYOB, so make sure you bring your own :)
