Very nice. Bring fancy shoes! (they didn't like our sneakers) also, we ate there by accident. Gorgeous view. Traditional French style and Italian influences with of course Asian and everything in between. I wouldn't call it "seafood" like some of the reviews. There's just as much meat as seafood if not more. Service was classy and impeccable. Food was good some was great all well prepared and beautifully assembled. Go there for the view but mostly, the entire package is worth it and not overpriced. Attentive, service but not over the top. Very interesting and nice.
