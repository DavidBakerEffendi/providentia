Went to Blue on Staten Island last night with my girl and it was great. From the same owners as Beso & Bayou, which we've frequented before; they have done a great job on this place. The windows to the north overlooks the Kill Van Kull tidal strait which is a frenzy of maritime activity with no less than half a dozen ships scurrying by during our dinner. I love the refurished railroad tracks between the patio and water which makes a unique juxtapostion to the gleaming oil tanks across the water in Bayonne; eerily romantic. The pork chop I had was fresh, juicy, plentiful and perfectly delicious. The potatos were crunchy and soft at the same time and the sauce was out of this world. I would highly recommend one make the treck up to the north shore of the island for this gem.
