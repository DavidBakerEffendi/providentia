Sumo is really good, don't believe the negative reviews from uppity/picky people in here.  Hard to give them 5 stars, but they are a really, really solid restaurant. Our family eats here all the time and we love it. The sushi is always fresh and fantastic.  They make a really good red curry too, and the veggie lo-mein is as good as you will find at any asian restaurant.  My kids love the pineapple rice too.   Ignore the few negative reviews and give them a try, I doubt you'll be dissapointed. BYOB.....
