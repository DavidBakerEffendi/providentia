My cousin just got back from Madrid and wanted to see if we could find some authentic tapas in NY. We chose Degustation simply because it was highly rated. After looking at the menu, he immediately concluded that it was completely different from any tapas experience he had in Spain (not to mention A LOT more expensive). These aren't your Mama's Tapas... So, we threw out any comparisons to authenticity and left the decision making to the chef. We both chose the 5 course menu with a wine pairing. Our bill came to about $200. Honestly though, it didn't matter. The service was amazing, the food was amazing, and we felt blessed that we were fortunate enough to be able to have this delicious experience. Everyone should go to Degustation. Next time, I'm going to try the 10 course menu!
