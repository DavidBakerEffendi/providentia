Very disappointed when they came to our small town and set up in front of the local stores at our holiday tree lighting.  We work hard to decorate and bring customers to our businesses and we don't need a truck blocking visitor's view during the entire annual tree lighting.  They were not considerate of the local businesses who pay taxes.  Yes, I know they have a permit but they could have parked on Park Street which would not block any businesses.  I won't support these kind of businesses who roll in and are inconsiderate of the small local commerce.
