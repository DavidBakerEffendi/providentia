A simply dreadful experience. Never again. Lunch special / sashimi box. The problems: -- shoddy decor, sloppy service by Japanese restaurant standards -- muddy, tasteless miso soup -- mushy texture to the sashimi after initial (dry-tasting)  bite, to the point of  inedibility -- rubbery dumplings, not enough taste to identify the filling -- goopy dressing on salad, which unfortunately is not served on the side -- off-texture California rolls, a bit wet, & mushy from theavocado -- mushy pickled ginger, which must have been frozen or canned -- a LONG HAIR in either the rice or an unfinished California roll near it -- a bad aftertaste to the half-eaten lunch
