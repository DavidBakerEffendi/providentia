I love Sanford...especially late nights after the clubs ; ) their food is great ... Seafood risotto I would recommend to all!! Chunks of seafood creamy and just delicious. Why 3 stars you say... Everything else is good but not great. Also the food takes wayyy too long , I mean 20 min for a grilled cheese? One thing I miss is the turkey dinner ... Let's get it back ppl thank you
