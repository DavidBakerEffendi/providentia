This was an amazing experience from the moment we walked through the door. Waitstaff was knowledgable and attentive. I saw one server spend almost 10 minutes taking photos for people at a table. Â Our server "T" was awesome. I dropped a piece of bread on the ground like a fool and without missing a beat she brought over a whole new plate. Everyone shares responsibility and it's a real team of people who care. This was a busy Friday night and I am a super fussy person. The food was original and very good. A salad with jalepino sauce, cheddar and apples was so good. And maple gelato with bacon. Interesting flavors having a party in my mouth. Really I eat out all the time and I like west Hartford but it can be a little pretentious. Not here. Not here at all.
