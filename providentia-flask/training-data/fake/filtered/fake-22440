Queens Comfort was a great and enjoyable experience for myself and everyone I was with. The food, service, and atmosphere was all excellent. We showed up on a Saturday night and sat right down with no wait. We ordered three appetizers that were all very good, my favorite being the cheesy tater tots. For my meal I had a Space Jam Burger which consisted of blueberry jam and bacon and was excellent, my only complaint was that there was too much jam on the burger. My favorite part about Queens Comfort was the service and atmosphere, our server took all of our orders without writing anything down and got everything correct and was very polite in the process. The atmosphere is really cool, as everything was very laid back and interesting, as they served water in mason jars. I would recommend to anybody visiting New York City to make their way over to Queens and try out Queens Comfort.
