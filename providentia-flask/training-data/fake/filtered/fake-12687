Our party of 4 dined at Lupa on 6/26/08.  We found the surroundings to be quite attractive, but service was lacking when it came to describing the dishes on the menu.  The waitress told us to refer to the glossary on the back of the menu instead of answering our questions about dish preparation.  While prices were quite reasonable for NYC, the food was forgettable.  It was okay, but nothing special and not what one would expect from a Mario Batali restaurant.   The olive oil served with the foccacia was bland and the saltimbacca was extremely salty.  The side served with the entree was skimpy as was the dessert.  In walking down the street, there were several other restaurants without a "famous" chef  looked more appealing than Lupa.  We were disappointed.
