If you want low-key, tasty french food in a no frills environment where you can bring your own wine, you cant do better than this place. A real find. I've heard people say the waitstaff is rude, but if you are polite and reasonably patient, there will be no problem. The mixed green salad-- usually a snore of a dish-- is vibrant with rustic flavor and is quite refreshing. Great desserts too.
