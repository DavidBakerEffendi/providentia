Teresa's is soooo good! The waiters and waitresses are really nice and the food is awesome! I usually have a caesar salad to begin with and then have some kind of pasta! And the pizza is great too! My family usually goes there when we have guests or when we want to have a nice dinner in town! GO TO TERESA'S!!!
