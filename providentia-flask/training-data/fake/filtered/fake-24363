I'm pleased to see all the positives here. I love this place too and have taken friends, family and colleagues there for years. The man who I assume to be the owner always greets me with a warm handshake and the waitresses are wonderful. The atmosphere is everything I like in a neighborhood place..kind of noisy but not too much so, and lots of amiable people on line waiting to pick up their to go orders. Very casual and comfortable. Nothing fancy, just good people enjoying good food. I always get the chicken with red beans and french fries and it is always delicious, great portion size and very reasonably priced.
