This is very beautiful bar, dark woods shimmering glassware under a golden chandelier glow. Great beer listing with some high alcohol IPAs. The food is limited but you should try the cheeses and especially the meat pies which are phenomenal. The supplier is Six Pence Pie Company that has recently opened a restaurant/bakery in Westville center.
