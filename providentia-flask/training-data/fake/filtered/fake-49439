Inconsistent. Unable to meet the expectations I have for this price level. I had high expectations given the reviews and reputation of Marc Vetri. And who would travel up to 640 N. Broad in an iffy neighborhood unless the destination was exceptional? It was not. Not even close. It was noisy and the chairs were uncomfortably sloping forward. The server was OK, not great. The prices were $$$$ range, which is what I expected. The four appetizers we chose for our party of four were only fair--overcooked octopus, decent grilled vegetables, a concoction of little pork bits and vegetables, and fried mozzarella. My (and my wife's) entree of grilled mackerel should have been an embarrassment for the staff to serve. Two tiny bits (think the size of your thumb) of crusty, overcooked, tasteless fish with some onions and a few other slivers of greenery sprinkled around. If we hadn't held on to the grilled vegetables from the appetizers, I wouldn't have had much to eat. The dessert was pretty good. I will never go again. And I'm not sure I'll go to the new restaurant Marc is building in Moorestown, my home town.
