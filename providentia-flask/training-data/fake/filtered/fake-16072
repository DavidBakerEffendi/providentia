On the good side: - It used to be nice once - The wolves that raised the wait staff did a great job On the bad side: - The food is absolutely vile. Avoid the chicken caeser salad, the tomato soup and the tuna burger - You may be condescended to, feel ill-served by and have an existential crisis as you wonder whether your purpose there is actually to please the waiters, and not the other way around - If the food makes you retch, be a man about it and don't complain. They will not apologize for it or take it off your bill. But, you may get a moderately amusing sarcastic comment about what you just tried to do
