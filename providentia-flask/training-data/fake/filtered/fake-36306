A GEM. Enjoyed a mellow anniversary brunch with the gf here on a Sunday.  Delicious Chicken n' Waffles, and very decent wings and Cobb Salad.  Staff were all great/attentive, an added benefit given our late-night carousing required dosing with frequent imbibing of Jalapeno bloody mary's and coffee in turns. Decor/music also great, hip without pretentiousness, and overall price is king- cheap (delicious) and cheerful.
