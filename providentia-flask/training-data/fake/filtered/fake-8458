Absolutely amazing!  My go-to restaurant whenever I am in Philadelphia and every time I eat there, the experience and food are 100 times better than I remembered (which I did not think was even possible).  The service is top-notch, as at every other Starr Restaurant.  The manager always goes over and beyond for the clients - he is constantly walking around, speaking with customers, and ensuring that everyone is satisfied during their entire dining experience.  I also noticed lately that the menu has some awesome additions that provide an even greater variety for brunch, lunch and dinner.  I wish Jones and its entire staff would expand nationally!
