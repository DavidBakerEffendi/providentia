Came to Lu Nello's the other day for dinner with a group of friends and all of the dishes that we had came out delicious. For appetizers we had stuffed artichokes, shrimp in speck and octopus.For my main meal I had braised short ribs. Everything was fresh and of high quality. This restaurant is good for group gatherings or fancy diner dates if you want to impress someone special. Would come here again.
