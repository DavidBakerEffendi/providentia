Yum! I'm so happy its finally cooled down enough for some Eastern European comfort food.  Portions are enormous and prices are extremely reasonable.  The cucumber salad is a must, simply delicious.  The stuffed cabbage are among the best I've ever had.  The cauliflower casserole was equally tasty.  It's homey and tasty and comforting.
