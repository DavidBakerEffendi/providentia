Talulas Garden is everything an exceptional restaurant should be and more! We managed to get a last minute reservation for 4 for Sunday brunch and inside the place was buzzing, but in no way felt crowded or rushed. The interior is a polished blend of designer "earthy" elegance. It's interesting, inviting and alluring all at once. The service was superb from the moment we arrived. The brunch menu was inventive, artistic - and WOW was it ever delicious. The flavors jump off the plate to surprise and delight - and without exaggeration - leave you begging for more. The outside courtyard garden is a rare jewel in a vast city, and we look forward to coming back in season to enjoy an al fresco experience Talula style. The valet parking service was an unexpected bonus, and after lunch, as our car was being retrieved we walked next door to 'Talulas Daily' for a peek, but that's a story for another day!!!
