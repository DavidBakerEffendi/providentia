The food at this restaurant is great. This place can put Golden Krust out of business, if they were to compete. The flavors of  the food are very similar to what I grew up eating  for Sunday dinner. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a good meal at a low price. The amount of food that you get in what is listed as a small on their menu is  really a large at any other restaurant.  I only have two  negative comments about Caribbean Connection: 1. They run out of food, I guess only a certain amount if food is prepared per day and when they run out that is it, you have to wait till the next day and 2. It is a take out only restaurant (I say this because the food is so good I want to eat it right away, not wait till I get home). If you decide to give this place try I recommend you try the following dishes: Jerk chicken and Curry Goat. Enjoy!
