TAKES CASH ONLY. Very affordable place with a plethora of different types of hot dogs and cheese steaks to choose from. They also are the one of the few restaurants that sells "jarritos" which are delicious Mexican sodas. I keep on telling myself that since it's all natural sugar it somehow makes it better for me. So far they sell them in Pineapple, lime, fruit punch, mango, and grape fruit. Now, before you go for the safe flavors I will tell you from personal experience that Pineapple and Grapefruit are easily the best flavors. The Pineapple is tart and refreshing and the Grapefruit...um it tastes nothing like grapefruit but has a very light citrusy flavor to it. Â As for hot dogs, D makes a really nice sauerkraut and mustard with chopped onions and peppers on top, I would also go with the Jersey cheesesteak, and the chili dog. I just uploaded their menu so you can see for yourself.
