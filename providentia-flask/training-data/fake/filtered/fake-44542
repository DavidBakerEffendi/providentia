I've been to Rhong-Tiam a few times now. The food is fine, but definitely overpriced, even for the area. What irks me about this restaurant is that the service is terrible, and the hostess seems confused and willing to lie to make a few extra dollars. I ran here the other day to get some roti canai ($4) (yes, I motivate myself to go running with the promise of food at the end), and I'd only brought my debit card, as I had never had trouble using it before. When I tried to order, the hostess said, "The minimum for a credit card is $15. $20?" I asked, "So... what's the minimum?" reaching for the menu to choose something else. She said, "Would you like two roti canai?" I said, "No, one is fine." She said, "Okay. The credit card minimum is $25." What? I don't even understand. I just left. And don't plan on coming back.
