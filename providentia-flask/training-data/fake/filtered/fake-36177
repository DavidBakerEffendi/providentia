To start with , it could be nicer if the service were friendlier . But the biggest reason I almost gave two stars was that the cocktails are mini cocktails . They come in unusually small glasses , with lots of ice , and are only filled about 2/3 of the way . They tasted good ,but had about two swallows , and I hate it when my meal starts out feeling like management wants to rip me off , and the mini cocktails are a ripoff . The bartender must be under orders to keep them ridiculously small because each one served to our table was tiny . I assume they want to force you to order more that way . Note to management : you don't make repeat customers by pissing them off to start the meal . SO , i suggest ordering beer , at least the bottles are standard sized . Â The food was quite good . We liked the rib n tail , the kale, the crab , quail , and peas , and a couple of others that I am forgetting . All were well prepared with interesting ingredients . EXCEPT , if you don't love jalapenos , you must tell them to hold them back . They included them in dishes that did not mention them on the menu , like the otherwise tasty grits . So eat the food and drink the beer --bottles $6--but AVOID the mini -cocktails .
