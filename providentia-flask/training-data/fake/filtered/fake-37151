My first time at The Blind Pig.The Gator sandwich is outstanding. It is topped with a spicy salsa. Very tasty. I enjoyed the extensive selection of hard to find beers. The staff is courteous and friendly. The establishment is clean and the ambiance is relaxing and warm. Say hi Â to Debra behind the bar.
