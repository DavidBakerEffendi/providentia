Aurora was very disappointing,  went there on Saturday night with my wife and my brother (who I was introducing to NYC).  Appetizers took just under an hour to reach the table.  Not thrilled with the start, but was told by staff that our bottle of wine would be comped so at that point agreed to just relax and enjoy the rest of the dinner.  Appetizers were very good, pasta was good, and then I had the spare ribs which were a bit tough and overcooked.  Then encouraged by the staff due to the time in which it took to get our food, to order dessert which would once again be comped.  We thanked them for the offer and agreed to split two desserts amongst the 3 of us - tiramisu was good, other chocolate dish much less so.  What ended up finally doing it though, was I then received the bill and not only did they NOT comp the bottle of wine, but they also charged us for one of the 2 desserts that they encouraged us to order.  All in all, not a good experience and certainly not the way I planned on introducing my brother to eating in NYC.
