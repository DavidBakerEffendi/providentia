Went for dinner and it was delicious. the Hunan Lamb is probably the best lamb I ever had. The Garlic Noodle Heaven Shrimp is also pretty tasty. The Crispy Duck is amazing. It's the type of duck that you can get in Chinatown, it's definitely worth to try. I had 6 people in my party and we ordered a bunch of appetizers and by the time our entrees came we were full. Definitely recommend the roti canai, popcorn rock shrimp, Spicy Thai Chicken Salas (if you like spiciness). They also have a happy hour from 5-7 that includes different appetizers and drinks, which includes their famous popcorn rock shrimp and the Jane G's sangria which is refreshing! They have a full liquor bar and plenty of wine to choose from.
