Went here for the first time and ordered the Tenderlicious Salad. Appropriately named, this salad was incredibly fresh and delicious.  I often purchase chicken salads from fast food venues at the same price.  TLGs salad was far superior.  You can tell the ingredients were fresh and have not been sitting around in a prepackaged container for days.  Highly recommend this restaurant.
