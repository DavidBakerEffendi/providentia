Great Catering!!!!!!  This is also my Favorite Sandwich place!   Plus the Soups are very fresh and clearly house made.  I travel to Princeton a couple of times a year and often send clients as well when they are visiting campus.  The service is friendly and very good.  They make the truly best Deli Sandwiches and Deli Salads around, at a great price.  Wonderful array of choices and those incredible sugar cookies are something I bring across the country when I travel.  I recommended Red Onion to a friend on campus and they mention the Red Onion Catering every time we talk.  I worry every time I visit that they might retire.
