Dear lord what an awful milkshake, and fries and a burger to match. The shake was like drinking chocolate milk, thin and watery. Fries were lukewarm and soggy.  And the burger is TINY.  This isn't any better than any fast food chain, and three or four times the price. Portions here are VERY meager for the price, and they are WAY overstaffed and STILL slow.  My friend and I were the only people in there and it still took forever for them to get around to talking to us.  And they had no idea what kind of oil the fries are cooked in.  Be careful if you have allergies! Only plus here is that it's open late, but we'll see if that lasts.  But during normal hours go to Five Guys if you want a sizeable, reliable burger and fries at a reasonable price.  It's further from my house, but worth the extra block of walking.
