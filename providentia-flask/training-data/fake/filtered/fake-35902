I went to robertas for brunch.  It was a disaster.  I waited over 90 minutes for a table, and when I finally sat down, it was another 45 minutes before any food hit the table.  I felt that it may have been because I went at a peak time, so the following tuesday, I ordered pizza for delivery.  Yet again, it was a 2 hour wait.  When the pizza finally arrived, it was cold, the cheese was hard, and the crust was tasteless.  I was thoroughly disappointed with the quality as well as the service.
