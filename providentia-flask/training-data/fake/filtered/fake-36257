This is an ideal place for a meal or snack before, after, or on a break from the Natural History Museum.  It is a very family-friendly place;  at lunch today there were three strollers parked inside he door.  The food is very good, and my chicken skewers came with more luscious French fries and greek salad that any one human could consume.  The outside seating on Columbus (closed today because of he morning rain) would be a pleasure on a nicer day.
