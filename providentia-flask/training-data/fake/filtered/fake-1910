This place stinks up my end of Red Hook with nasty fried seafood and boiled crabs smells. The owners should be fined for not putting in a better exhaust system. The smell is downright offensive sometimes. Additionally, it's totally overpriced. The food is completely mediocre, and the decor is so cheesy. I can't believe people still flock to this place.
