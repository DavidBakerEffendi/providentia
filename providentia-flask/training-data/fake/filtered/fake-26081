The food at Charlie Was a Sinner had some highlights, like the  potato croquettes with the smoked paprika aioli and the pappillotte of sunchokes which was delicious.  There were also some dishes that did not transcend the ordinary such as the marinated asparagus. Something I enjoyed about the experience were the very attentive serving staff, host and hostess. While the space is cozy and even a little tight at times, the busy staff manages to politely step out of the way of guests, allowing them to pass. It looked like a choreographed dance.   One of the things I liked the least about Charlie was a Sinner was the ambiance.  I would prefer to visually see the presentation of the food and to enjoying the conversation of my companions in lieu of the background audio noise which was concert level loud and the flickering visual projections which reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock hallucination.  The combination created a sensory overload which was not an enjoyable accompaniment for a delicious meal or good dinner conversation.  Before we had finished eating I was very ready to leave.
