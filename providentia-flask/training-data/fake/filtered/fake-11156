This review is for Bierra: If overpriced food and a pretentious atmosphere is something that you crave that Bierra is for you.  Seriously people, the beer is good but that is about where it stops.  If you like paying $$$ for italian meats and cheeses that are way overpriced then, again this place is for you.  One of my friends saw Scott, the husband of Khloe Kardashain there (enough for me never to come back). Yet again another "celebrity" chef has cashed in and opened a machine that is a pure tourist trap.  Batali you do have some good food within Eataly but you should be ashamed charging such ridiculous prices.
