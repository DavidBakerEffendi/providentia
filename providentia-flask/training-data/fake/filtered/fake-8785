My wife & I took my kids & a friend here Friday night around 8. The dining area was full. The waitress came over to us right away, moved a table or two to accommodate us & we were seated. We had a Table 87 salad which was excellent. Then Â some baked clams & fried calamari which by far was the best we ever had. So tender. We had a large Margherita & a breakfast pie. Out of this world! Then on the waitresses recommendation we had a Nutella pie. Thumbs up for her recommendation! Great food & service. This is definitely our new spot! We will be back very soon.
