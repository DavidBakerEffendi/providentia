Nothing special.  Food was only okay; not worth the price.  With so many good restaurants in New York, there is no to go to an okay restaurant - especially when it isn't particularly cheap.  Nothing wrong with the food, but nothing stood out as excellent either. The service was generally good other than occasionally bumping into one of our chairs that was along a busy passage.
