Stopped by for brunch today with my girlfriend and there was a wait...as I anticipated. The girl that put us on the waiting list was very pleasant. We waited outside along with a few others who were waiting for tables as well. She came outside to check on everyone and explained that there was a big party leaving and that she would sit us all as soon as possible.   After being seated, the other waitress working took our order and we received our meals promptly. I had the eggs Benedict as usual and my girlfriend had a crepe henri. Food was delicious.  The eggs Benedict are by far the best I think I've ever had in New York. For desert we ordered a Citron crepe, which was great as well. Service is fantastic. Food is fresh and delicious. Highly recommended.
