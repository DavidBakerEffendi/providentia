oh god, this place is good.  pricey, but good.  i take off a star because they have only one or two vegetarian entrees.  i usually get the chile relleno, which is great, but i'd love to have more options. quick story:  sometime ago we went here and a fly landed in one of our drinks.  the manager apologized, was very sorry, replaced our drinks and stated that the next time we come, margaritas were on the house.  how would they remember us, i thought? but they did remember.  we came again almost a year later.  they remembered, and we got a pitcher of magarita on the house.  that's some good service!
