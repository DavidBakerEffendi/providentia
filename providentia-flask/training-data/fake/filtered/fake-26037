I've been here a couple times and it's been pleasing, it's a different vibe with the atmosphere, live band on weekend nights which is fun and food is pretty good I love their cornbread and chicken corn chowder is great although it would be nicer if the portion of it was a bit larger. Staff is OK, last time I was there it was horrible our waiter forgot to bring us the cornbread and when he did he only brought 2 pieces, didn't ask how we were doing, didn't refill our drinks and overall service wasn't that great. But not bad for a southern comfort food joint.
