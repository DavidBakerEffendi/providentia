I work in the LES, so of course I make my way here and come with my co-workers. I soon found out this place gets packed and has a lot of buzz. But I don't understand why. The food is good, sometimes very good, but not great! Not sure, what people are raving about in their reviews. Maybe, its comfort food and the nostalgia and good feelings that come from it, but on pure quality of the food, its enjoyable, but nothing to rave about. And if a coworker says lets go to Clinton, I would be up for it, they do know how to cook an egg properly!
