I stopped here in a crunch as I prepared for an event. This place is so cool. I stopped in for a tray as they were closing. I got a fresh baguette with fig spread and 2 different cheeses it was so fresh and yummy! The staff were very nice and inviting as if I wasn't holding them up as they were already closed. Such a nice place I have to go back and eat in the outdoor area with some friends real soon.
