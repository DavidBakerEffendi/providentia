Been there twice now. First time was soon after opening. Service was shall we say "green" at that point - server couldn't even pronounce half the entrees. But the food was really good and I liked the space, so gave it another try last week with a few friends. This time the service seemed professional and the food even better (guessing a lot of their kitchen staff trained at their other restaurant so they were good to go). I'd heard their duck confit was great - and didn't disappoint - very rich. The lardon salad was huge and addictive. Mussels were insanely good (white wine, garlic broth). Veal mil, while not the traditional version was delicious. All the sides we tried were also great - fries (perfect), cauliflower gratin and mac/cheese. Was not too expensive (I think $60 per person with wine). Also, the host/manager was really friendly too - one of my friends mentioned to him that she liked the music and he volunteered to email her the play list!
