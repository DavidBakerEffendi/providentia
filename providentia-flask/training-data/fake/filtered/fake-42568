I'm from Jersey. My girlfriend (who is from Texas) came to visit me and we took advantage of the Groupon for this restaurant. Definitely a great way to save some money and get to know the place. From the staff to the service to the quality of the food....I must say this is among the best dining experiences I've ever had. I usually avoid fancy places, but this place was fancy yet not pretentious at all. When you pull up to the boat upon which this restaurant was built, you see how amazing and majestic it is. Once you enter, it has a very cozy feel. The hostess was incredibly polite and although we showed 30 minutes before they could seat us, the staff was incredibly polite and courteous to us. Once we sat down, my girlfriend and I ordered the Atlantic Salmon and Amish Farm Raised Chicken. While we waited, our incredibly kind and sweet waitress brought us complimentary Focaccia bread with butter that was made with sea salt and fresh honey. They then presented us with a complimentary pair of garlic toasted crackers with Chicken liver mousse. It was so delicious...it's hard to believe they were complimentary! Once we got our orders, my girlfriend and I were amazed at the aesthetic presentation of our food. Once we took our first bite, it was clear that this was going to be a great night. The food was fresh and delicious. Our waitress was very kind and willing to help us with anything we needed. The food was so good that I was upset that the meal was over! I highly recommend this place. Even without the Groupon, I feel it's worth every penny!
