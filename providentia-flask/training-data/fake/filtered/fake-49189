Horrible, unprofessional, completely incompetent service, so-so food...    Our waiter Robert was ridiculously slow... He served the sushi but no chopsticks &  no soy sauce, soups without spoons, steaks without knives. We had to ask several times.. Finally, I got impatient, I stood up and went to the waiter station to get them myself     We had 2 tables which they mixed up the food. Their bbq table did not work and they said they wanted to move us to another table.    One of the manager was over eager to help the waiter that she took the plate from the birthday celebrant without asking if he's finished or not (he was still eating!)       Soup and salad included in the bbq orders were sent to the wrong table. Too many rice bowls on other table, it was a mess!!!     It takes fooooorrrreeeever to get water refills.        Never ever order more than 2 bbq. They skimp and combine the meats and sides, and you can notice the difference in portions when you order just 1 bbq serving.    The bbq meats was mediocre. It crumbles when grilled & flipped. Lettuce was bad, we did not even touch them. Service was horid..we will never be back there again!!!
