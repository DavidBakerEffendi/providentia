As an eat-in place, I don't recommend it as most of its business is take-out and delivery. Now with that said, the quality of the food is average - nothing special. I think they try to be all things to all people and as such they end up not excelling in any one area. When you order take out , they also have a bad habit of packing the hot stuff with the cold stuff in the same bag, unlike some other places which separate the items. Â As for the food itself, it's okay if you want something quick and don't' have time to run out to get it. The delivery service is usually prompt -- I have foudn that I get my order within 30 minutes after placing it.
