I love pizza and have been to a lot of pizza spots and by far Nino's is the best. I used to order from Gina's in Harrison but once I ate at Nino's it was a wrap. These slices are wide and thick, there is a good chesse to sauce ratio and let me not forget its delicious. I have also had the italian sub, chessesteak sub, grilled chicken salad, antipasto and it was delicious. The food presentation is great the staff is always there when you need them. I dine there alot with my family the ambience is nice and they serve BEER!!! They are located in a good area parking is never a problem for me. The resteraunt is clean which one of the most important things when it comes to dinning out. The delivery service is great and they also deliver BEER. I hosted a kids party there and the staff were attentive and great.
