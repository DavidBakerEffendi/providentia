I really like this place. They have a big menu so there is something for everyone, they offer discounts for "children's portions" and they have everything I have ordered there has been great. This isn't a "white glove" five star type of place, but they get five stars from me because for what they are, a family Italian restaurant, I think they do it really well. The pasta dishes like the Gnocchi primavera are delicious, the salads (mandarin orange salad is my favorite) are fresh and the margarita thin crust pizza is the best I've had in the area outside of NYC. The have reasonable prices and they also do delivery well. By that I mean the food gets to you promptly and still hot, a concept lost on many other take out places.
