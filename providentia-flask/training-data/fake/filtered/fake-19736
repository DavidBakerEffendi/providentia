Growing up in a family of meat purveyors, I have acquired a skillful eye for quality meats and provisions.  My ancestry is Polish and German so when I entered Adolf's for the first time and smelled the aromas I had flash backs of my grandfather bringing me as a child to butcher shops New York. I have to proclaim that the quality at Adolf's is by far the best I have ever experienced.  I recommend anyone who wants quality variety and authentic European smoked meats, plus authentic groceries from Europe to visit this store.  I must warn you! Your will be spoiled and have difficulty purchasing meat products from anywhere else. They just won't compare!
