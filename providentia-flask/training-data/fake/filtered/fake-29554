It's chilly and windy out, so I decided to treat myself to dinner and cross a new place off my bucket list. I took a 30 minute ride to get to this quaint country cafe style restaurant "Pies n Thighs" after hearing such raves about the food. I arrived and had difficulties getting assistance with getting a menu, and then was given a street flyer and had to stop Â and ask a waitress for the house menu. I ordered a catfish dinner and sides, paid and stepped aside to wait when I was asked to wait outside, I asked "outside" and again the woman said outside someone will bring you your order. Confused and insulted I went outside and stared in. Three women came in placed their order and paid and stepped aside. Now I was highly insulted and confused so I went in I asked why I was told to wait outside and the women were not? I was told they routinely ask people to wait outside. I wonder if it is they only ask people of color to wait outside? I demanded my $30 back and left insulted and angered. No matter how good the food may be, I will not spend my money to be treated different or insulted.
