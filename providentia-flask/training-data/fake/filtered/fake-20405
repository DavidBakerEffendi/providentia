Disappointing and Rushed I thought I really liked this place- they have great, fresh, spicy food with many vegetarian options, and I've beent here a few times, but my experience at Tiny Thai last night made me reconsider my rating. I realize how busy this little restaurant is, and they do a great job getting people to tables within a reasonable waiting period, even when the place is jam-packed. However, this is also a draw-back for diners who would like to relax a little and enjoy their meal. I consider myself a fast eater, and after about 8 minutes of tackling my spicy Rose's Tofu (which happened to have a scarce amount of tofu in it), I took a breather and decided to concentrate on drinking my hard cider for a minute. My boyfriend and I were clearly still working on our courses, but were asked within 20 seconds if we needed our food boxed up. Sure, there were people waiting to be seated, but really? After a day of mountain biking, we wanted to relax and enjoy our food, but we were being rushed along as if we were on a conveyor belt. While we were still eating we were asked a total of 3 times if we were all done. It seemed like a very passive aggressive way to say "move along", even though we hadn't been there more than 30 minutes total (i guess a plus is that the service is fast), as if the goal was not to please the customers, but to achieve a high turnover rate. I was also really disappointed by their "Roses Tofu"-- I counted about 4.5 small pieces of tofu in it.
