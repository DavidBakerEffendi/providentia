I love oysters, and the red,white and blue deal (6 oysters and your choice of PBR, red or white wine for $8) they have here is the best in town. Their fries are also to die for. If you like beer but don't like PBR you can sub it with a blue moon or stella for an extra $2, which is still a great deal.
