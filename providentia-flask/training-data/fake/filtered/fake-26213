Only went here because Roberta's was packed to the gills. Awkward walking in as no one was there to readily direct you to a table. Lackluster (dumbed down sushi). Miserly portions. Overpriced. Â Server spilled our drink while pouring with no compensation. Inconvenient as no one told us or had any conspicuous signs that they only accepted cash.
