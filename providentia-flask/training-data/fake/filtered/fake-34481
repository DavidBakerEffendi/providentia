WARNING: The Manager is extremely unprofessional and rude! However, that seems to be "Just the way he acts". Imagine if you will, trying to pay the bill and a man slams your card on the counter for no apparent reason. Please keep in mind, that he just gave you the bill to pay. Then he asks what's going on here and you say, I just gave you the card to pay the bill and you slammed it on the counter. Then, he says this is me slamming your card on the counter! BANG!!!! The first slam was a "7" the second was a "10". Perplexing, isn't it? Well ladies and gentlemen hold on to your seats because that fine older man is the Manager! My family and I have been coming to Star-Tavern for years, but NEVER AGAIN!!!
