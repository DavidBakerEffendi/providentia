Went here a couple weeks ago after clubbing with 3 friends.  it was my friends birthday!! After waiting outside for 20 minutes we were seated...we ordered the macaroni spring rolls and I asked our waiter what  he recommended for my meal and he suggested the country fried steak which was AMAZING...my favorite part of the meal was dessert we ordered the red velvet cake and banana splittt!  i had hinted to our waiter that it was my friend's birthday so he actually got a couple of the other waiters to sing happy birthday and put candles in the desert!  it was super sweet! the only thing i didn't enjoy was the 10 min wait for the bathroom and it was loud...
