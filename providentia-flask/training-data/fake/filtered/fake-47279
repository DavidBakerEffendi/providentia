I'm such a fan of this wonderful little spot. The chicken is outrageous - juicy, full flavored, and with the most delicious crispy skin. They are also local and free roaming, which is important to me. The interior is bright and welcoming, and the owner is friendly. I recently tried the bahn mi and, like so many other reviewers, really enjoyed Rotisseur's take on one of my favorite sandwiches. Oh, and the salty kale chips are pretty good too!
