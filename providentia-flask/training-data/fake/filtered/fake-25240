Love this place. I've eaten there a bunch of times both dinner and brunch and it was nice and comforting each time. Cozy but does not strip you of personal space. The food is nice (nothing exceptional) but I especially love them for their service. Everyone is accommodating and proper, but not pretentious hipster (ahm, mesa coyocan). My bf and I use it as our place for cocktails and a quick bite.
