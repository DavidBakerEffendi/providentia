OMG.......My husband & I ate at the diner Aug 1st--We ordered soup & Veggie wraps. The yankee bean soup is nothing like the ewing diner...your soup maker is the pits. it was warm tomatoe like soup with a few beans floating in it. But really put me over the edge was the "HAIR" in my veggie wrap! The waitress seem not to care she took it to her manager he took it off the bill, no I am sorry or the manager's coming over to see if they could do anything for me. It was all I could do not to puke all over the table. As we paid the bill the hostess asked how the food was she could not even apologize she looked disgusting & wretched in need of a bar of soap and a hot bath.....This place looks pretty inside but it is a dirty hole. EATERS BEWARE!!!!!!
