I've been coming to Cafeteria pretty regularly for quite some time and I've never had anything but a good time. The atmosphere is clean and nice but not too fancy. I have felt comfortable coming here no matter if I was dressed up, or just relaxing on a Sunday. There is sometimes a bit of a wait if you come late on a weekend but its only really bad in the after bar hours of the weekend. I once came with my girlfriend and her family of 6 (8 total) on a busy evening and they were able to seat us in under 20 minutes. They even gave us our own walled off area and offered a prix fixe type of option that we didn't take. The service is always great and the food and drinks are worth the price. I am not a huge fan of mac and cheese in general but their's is some of the best I have had, especially the gouda+bacon. The Prince Edward Island mussels are typical white wine+garlic, but the bread they serve already soaked in the bowl makes it stand out. My favorite app by far is the cornmeal calamari. The texture is perfect every single time. As far as entrees go the hangar steak and smoked pork chops are my favorites. Everyone should try the chicken and waffles once, its delicious. My only real complaint is that they seem to make a horrible menu change every time I go back. My favorite dish used to be the country fried steak, then one day they decided they'll only serve it one day a week. The chicken and waffles used to come with country style sausage gravy, and now they serve it with some type of mango chutney (why?). As far as the bar goes the signature drinks are all delicious and interesting. They have a decent selection of beer and liquor too. I regularly get a signature cocktail followed by a few Lagunitas IPA's, but I've ended a nice night with some Macallan 18 on a few occasions. Overall I'd recommend Cafeteria to anyone looking for a nice relaxed place to sit down and eat.
