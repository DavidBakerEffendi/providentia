Flew into town and booked the Clearwater for an anniversary dinner. We were seated at a corner table with a view of "the scene" The management surprised us with complimentary champagne! Thank you. Food and wine were exemplary and unbelievable value for money. When we first arrived, it was relatively quiet but as the evening progressed, it became flamboyantly busy. Even so, the staff were attentive and efficient. Great job guys. I look forward to seeing you again.
