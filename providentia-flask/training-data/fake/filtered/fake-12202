Miya's is one of the few restaurants I go to regularly. The owner and the chefs at Miya's are testing the limits of our taste buds while remaining within the boundaries of sustainability, which is an accomplishment in itself. From pumpkin miso soup, Tokyo Fro, "Oh, Me So Hini" salad (one of the tastiest salads ever!) to Woompa (vegetable roll), Kraken (sushi roll) and Kiribati Sashimi, your palate will think it is heaven. If you feel it is too much to choose from a 20 page menu, try the Blue Plate Especial (10 piece sampler of Miya's classics for $22). Miya's has proclaimed "Sushi for the masses" and "Off with the heads" of the invasive species, so I am happy to help. The menu is going to incorporate gluten-free dishes soon. The more the merrier! Â  Miya's is a great place to go for a relaxed evening in a casual atmosphere, made possible by an ever friendly staff. Miya's is more than a restaurant, it is a way of living. See you soon.
