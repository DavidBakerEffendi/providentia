Oh dear God, thank you for answering my foodie dreams!! Marietta is the newest addition in the Peaches empire and they have not disappointed!! Although the original Peaches restaurant still holds on to an outdated menu, their newest addition has a menu that will cause excessive salivating foodie with a functioning palette. I popped in about 2 weeks ago after constantly hearing about it from everyone from my BK buddies, family friends and even saw a post on Chef Roble's instagram account.  It was amazing. The menu is a sort of "high-end" take on soul food.  Featuring items like frog legs, bbq quail, and a variety of crudités. The drink menu was also a great mixture of well curated cocktails and spirits. The first visit was amazing and every visit since has followed suit.  The wait staff is professional yet personable and so if the part owner whose name I can't remember.   I highly recommend this for anyone looking to get a soul-food fix without facing typical menus featuring chicken and waffles, mac and cheese and collards. This is something new and worthwhile!
