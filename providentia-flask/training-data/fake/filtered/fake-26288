We found Torals because it's close to our house and it's become one of our staples. They periodically do some weird decorating and furniture rearranging, but don't let it dissuade you! The Ecuadorean food is DELICIOUS and the chef/owner kindly accommodates special requests. He also makes an amazing home-made salsa if you like spicy food. Free starters include popcorn and chips with salsa. The portions are huge and hearty and you can't beat the prices. The perfect place to go when you want a big home-cooked meal but don't want to pay a fortune or make it yourself. We even used them to cater a party for less than it would have cost to buy the ingredients ourselves; everyone loved the food. Torals is a real diamond in the rough!
