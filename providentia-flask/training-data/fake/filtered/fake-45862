Went with family on Memorial Day. For appetizers, we ordered a dozen oysters, the tuna trio, and also the chicken trio. The oysters tasted fresh. We thought the tuna trio was good, specifically the spicy tuna, but the chicken trio was bland and dry. For entrees, we were hoping to try the sushi, but were told they were out of sushi..? So instead we ordered their Delmonico steak and the spicy chicken. I asked the steak to be medium and it came out well done, tasting like cardboard - this was strange considering the similarity between the steak and the name of the steakhouse. The spicy chicken was incredibly spicy and the rub or flavoring was just one of the dips/spreads given for the bread (one with jalape√±os). Our waiter was nice and patient, but the food came out painfully slow and during our dinner, we heard the wait staff drop dishes on two separate occasions. We had dinner around 6-7PM and the place was empty. We also overheard that the head chef was not in - this could possibly explain why there was no sushi and the food was subpar. Overall, the experience was not good. We might return again hopefully on a night the head chef is in.
