1) I have been eating at Piolin Jr for 5 years now and I absolutely love the food.   The staff is also friendly and courteous.   2) My favorite dishes include lomo saltado, arroz con mariscos (seafood rice), ceviche mixto, rotisserie chicken is flavorful and if you have a huge appetite the bistec a lo pobre is hearty.  To top of the meals, aji (green sauce) gives it a little zest. 3)  The staff at Piolin, including the manager and owner, are always smiling and entertain a family environment.  For the adults looking for an alcoholic beverage I would recommend the chicha sour.  I get it everytime.   4) Will continue to eat at Piolin Jr ;-)
