It gets worse. MIL, who is local (and a total sweetheart) went back to do a follow up with the woman who served us: Maryella. She intended just to speak to her, nothing to do with her supervisors, about what happened, with the intention of gently telling her that what happened when we came in for the cake tasting just wasn't a good way to treat return customers. Maryella accused her of making the whole thing up and yelled at her because she 'almost got fired' because I complained about the way we were treated. Too bad they didn't fire her! I know I'll never be back!
