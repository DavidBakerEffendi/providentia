One of my clients recommended this amazing restaurant to me.. I remember telling her  I want good food, good drinks and nothing to trendy and extravagant like the other restaurants in meat packing, and she was like ok I got a place for you go check it out, and I am so happy I went. I went on a Saturday night my reservation was for 8:30.  It was very busy in there ..Our table was not ready so they sat us by the bar and we started ordering drink. The drinks are delicious. The bartenders are professionals when it comes to mixing there drinks,! I mean its so cool to watch them make them They really look like pros! We ended up waiting almost 40 minutes to get seated that had upset me a bit but luckily the drinks were to good that I was not paying attention. But they were really nice about it once they sat as down they apologized and were so kind .. They gave us  complimentary glasses of champagne. I mean the  service was just top of the line. The food is amazing.. You def will enjoy it . My favorite drink was Poquito Picante it has a little spice to it. and there Guacamole is delicious. Im definitely coming back.
