Love this place!  We tried the bacon-wrapped dates and the brussels sprouts and these two are a must! Trust me, you won't be disappointed. Very tasty! In terms of drinks, we had Alta's Red Sangria and that is dangerous! Two glasses each and oh my! We were extremely happy!  It sneaks up on you so be careful. The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the braised octopus, carrot & rainbow radish salad.  It was a little spicy for us, but the waitress was so fabulous; she quickly removed it from the table and adjusted our bill without us even asking. Great service! I definitely recommend this place for a romantic date or for a special occasion with a group of people. Thank you Alta for a providing a great night with my sisters! XOXO
