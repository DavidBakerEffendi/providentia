BOTTOM LINE: the steak sandwiches are pretty good. I had a cheese steak with fried onions and a cheese steak with fried onions and pepperoni ( a little light on the pepperoni) served on a nice roll. This is a nice little find if you are from a real Philly cheese steak area and find yourself in central NJ.
