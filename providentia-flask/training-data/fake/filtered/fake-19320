I really do love this place.  The kale salad is really, really, really good.  So is the burtata appetizer.  So are the drinks.  However, as a vegetarian, there is only one entree on the main menu that I can eat.  I love pasta, but I am really not a fan of the spaghetti with nettle pesto.  It's not bad, but it is a bit dull.  One evening there was a vegetarian risotto on the specials menu, but the kitchen had already run out. I know vegetarians are annoying people, but is it possible to add another dish?
