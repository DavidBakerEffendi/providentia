Best burger in town. since the view is a a given and you get to choose among the beers (served by the lovely Elana), or wine (yes, rose! perfect for urban water views) and even diet snapple. Other food is surprisingly good. I had to have a lobster roll it being Memorial day. It was very good. Great for the under $20 price. Chef Liz Cleary puts a stake in the heart of the Rasputinlike horrors of most out door dining. Crowded on weekends, divine at all other times.
