Well this was our first time....and it was very promising....loved the chaat...and especially for some one who is expecting and is craving chaat or Indian street food like me. I would highly recommend. We had the sev puri....Indian chutney sandwich...Kala khatta...and Chinese fried rice and we were not disappointed..I was not sure how everything is going to taste as there were two different cuisine's but I was surprised with the food it was par excellent....if you wanted to have the best chaat and  Indian Chinese  and not worry about the ambiance....this is THE place to go. wont be disappointment for sure. Excellent service...waiters were very friendly and helpful.....when asked what is best on there menu they said everything was excellent on there menu with lots of confidence. Just by the long wait also you can say that it is going to be worth the wait.
