Absolutely delicious!  We went for brunch this morning, and got the breakfast tacos and the gallo pinto.  These were hands down the best breakfast tacos I've had in years.  The handmade corn tortillas were perfectly cooked, the eggs were delicious, the beans had great flavor, the pico de gallo was fresh, and the chorizo was really nicely done.  Though made of similar ingredients, the gallo pinto had a completely different flavor - highlighting the freshness of the ingredients and thoughtfulness of each dish.  Not to mention, it was really good too. I can't wait to go back.  The Upper Valley has never had Latin American food as good as this, and I can't wait to eat there again!
