Oh, Laduree. The raved about French Macaron shop located in the Upper East Side of the city. For being a tiny shop, it is a great business. Although the pricing is quite insane, i guess it's expected for a shop in that neighborhood. Now, let's get on to the 'product'. I asked bought a pistacho macaron. It definitely reached my expectations. It wasn't to sweet. Just right. It was pretty small, but in my opinion it was the perfect size. And terrific with a good cup of tea. Overall: PRO- delicious CON- extremely overpriced
