The New Wave Cafe staff creates a very friendly, welcoming environment each and every time you arrive.  I have seen the New Wave team consistently go above and beyond to deliver exceptional service to all customers...especially the local regulars who have come to know and love the fun atmosphere, great food and excellent bartenders.  Their famous "tots" with cheese dipping sauce is truly the best in the city and a must try appetizer if you are a newbie to New Wave.
