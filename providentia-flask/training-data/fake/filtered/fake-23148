Horrible! I have lived in the area for many years and I have seen the service go down hill. Most of the time I can bear it, but last night it took over and hour and a half to get our order. When the order finally came out, it was wrong. When I alerted the waitress to this, she argued with me and did not correct the order. The place was a bit dirty as well (spotty silverware, dried "something" on the wine glasses"). To top it off, they charged an additional $12 on my credit card. Inst unauthorized charging of credit card illegal? STAY AWAY!!! There are many other places in the area that care about their customers.
