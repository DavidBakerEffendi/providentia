The food here was great and also tasty. They could really challenge other transfusion restaurant around the town. the price here not too pricey and also not that cheap. just dont expect anything you get from the ghetto. the place has a wonderful atmosphere to setup a dinner, however i dont think it is good for day time. had 2 wonderful dinners with my friends here and will definitely come again on a different occasion.
