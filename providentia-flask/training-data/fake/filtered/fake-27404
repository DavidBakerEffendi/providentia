I am junkie for their roast beef sandwiches and potato and egg heroes. When ever I go in for lunch the decision between the two is quite honestly one of the hardest things to do. They make their mozzarella in house so you its always fresh. My grandfather grew up in Redhook so he turned me on to this place years ago and I've been a fan ever since. I love going in there and hearing all the staff banter with each other and the customers, makes you feel like your all friends. Defonte's lives up to the hype believe me.
