First real Italian pizza I have has since living in Italy for a year in college. The service was absolutely amazing. The only slightly bad thing is you have to pay cash, but there is an ATM at the restaurant if you are in a jam. That is what I had to do. Amazing place though. Everyone who goes to NYC should eat here.
