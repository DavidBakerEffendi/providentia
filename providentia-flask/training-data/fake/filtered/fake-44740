I have never written a yelp review before but after the wonderful treatment of the entire staff including the manager I just had to. Lets start off with the drinks. Fantastic. I've never had better tasting drinks in my entire life. I'm kind of a pansy when it comes to anything spicy but I could not keep my lips off of my friends poquito picante drink. It was amazing! The food was also just as good. The empanadas were so flaky and soft and the plantanos were just sweet enough. The service was fantastic. Everyone was attentive as soon as we walked in. The manager even personally walked us over to Beauty and Essex just to make sure our night was even better. I've never been treated better in NY. Thanks Yerba Buena for a memorable night.
