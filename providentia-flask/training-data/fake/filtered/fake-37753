Unbelievably tiny with tables crammed together and noisy as hell. Oh and we didn't get any food. You ask why? Well, first we were asked to wait for 15 minutes...we opted to wait outside rather than stand over people's heads. When we returned after less than 15 minutes, our table had just been "given away" but we were asked to wait since a couple tables had already paid their checks. So now we squeezed around the two tiny bar stools and waited with the kid in tow... 10 minutes, 20 minutes, no sign of the diners vacating and no effort from the staff to give them any hints... 10 more minutes and finally we just gave up as the noise along with the wait was getting unbearable. So yeah don't think we'll be back.
