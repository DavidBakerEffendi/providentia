Having been to the namesake in Turin I was wondering how it would translate to the nyc market - reading some of the reviews I see that the concept is def lost on some folks.  ..."basically the same as Whole Foods except you can walk around with a drink."  Basically the same if a store featuring regional culinary specialties of a single country/cuisine is the same as a multi-national grocery store. Sadly yet another concept that works well in Italy lost on Americans.  Definitely worth checking out  - I found lots of beautiful handmade breads, pastas and a tempting variety of gorgeous fruits and veg.
