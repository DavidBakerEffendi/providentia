After being a monthly customer of Devil's Alley for the past 3 years, I wish I could be leaving a more complimentary review for one of my go-to restaurants in center city. Unfortunately, after my last visit, that just can't be the case. It was a slow week day, when I met my girlfriend here for lunch on her hour break. We placed our order and waited. Waited longer than I was used to for this place. Finally, I saw our order being carried up the stairs to our table, when the runner was intercepted by the owner. After a moment of what seemed to be overreaction and confusion between her and a few other members of the staff, we got to watch our meals go back down the stairs to the kitchen. Our waiter came and apologized, but with now only 10 minutes left on a lunch break and no food, we had to get it boxed up to go from the kitchen. No sort of compensation or even explanation from the owner herself, which I honestly find unacceptable. To me that says, "I don't really care about what the customers themselves think of the food, it's what I think." Every other time, this restaurant has been great. However, apparently if the owner is around you can expect the staff to be walking on eggshells and delays from the kitchen. Owners without good customer relations get -2 stars in my book.
