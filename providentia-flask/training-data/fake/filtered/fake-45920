I really wanted to like Catas. It really is one of the nicest spots in Newark. However, I've been going there since they opened and it can be a hit or miss. Some things on the menu are pretty good, others just sound good in theory, but don't quite translate. The ribeye is really good. The service can be crappy, seems like waitstaff changes quite often. Service to me use to be good especially at bar seems to be falling apart lately. I went there recently with a couple of friends and my party kept making jokes about how authentic the expeirience was that we had empty glasses of beer sitting on the bar for half and hour. The Sangria was weak, had minimal fruit in it, and wasn't especially good. A good sangria is a chance to set the tone for a good Spanish meal, and they totally dropped the ball here too. The Service was slow and the waitress/barmaid  was argumentative. It all starts and ends with service.  The Ambiance is tacky,young mixed in with really older people and music can be really loud while dining. Overall, this place use to be good and seems to be falling apart and it hasn't even been open that long. Really hope management makes some modifications. They use to make me feel welcome, Its just not as friendly anymore and food seems to be lacking.
