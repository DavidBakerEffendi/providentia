A menu with great variety in its nod to its surfing theme.  The portobello mushroom stack is amazing, the crab cakes are 99% crab minus the typical bread crumb filler-tender, light & wonderfully crabby! The entrees clearly use fresh ingredients and have great flavor.  The fish tacos are ambitious and though the fish a little overcooked, they are worth tackling.  Fun Thursday surf movie night!  The staff are terrific, the prices just right and the food is really, really good.
