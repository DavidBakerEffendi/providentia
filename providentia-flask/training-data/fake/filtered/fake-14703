Went for brunch and came back for dinner! This is a very cute, truly French bistro with great rustic decor and friendly staff. I went for brunch one weekend morning to tap away at the computer while having a drink and some eggs. The Eggs Norwegian were wonderful and the bartender was extremely welcoming. The only complaint I have was that they were leaving the door open to let people know they were open and it was a tad chilly, but I was told they will be getting a door barrier next week. Just had the escargot, which were interestingly in a tomato base - not used to that, but still delicious. Also requested a Kir, my favorite eastern France drink, and it was very well balanced. I plan to come back and bring friends.
