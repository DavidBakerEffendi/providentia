I have ordered delivery from here a couple of times but never again.  By the time the food gets here (at LEAST an hour and I live 1 mile away!) it's not at all hot and usually soggy and greasy.  DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!!  I ordered tonight and the person answering the phone was rude, the time for it to get here was an hour and a half and it was inedible.
