The chicken sandwich is the best chicken sandwich I've ever had. My friend and I have had it multiple times and it's amazing. Dark meat so it's juicy, fontina cheese, caramelized onions, avocado and an amazing aioli sauce. It's full of flavor and each is complimentary and a perfect combo. My boyfriend got the pulled pork and said it was really good as well. Nice atmosphere, good beer list. Excited to try other entrees so I can comment on the restaurant as a whole but so far so good and I continue to go back.
