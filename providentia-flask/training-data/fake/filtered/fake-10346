I love this restaraunt, both locations on Staten Island are excellent.  Not only is the food outstanding and very fresh, but the owners are absolutely delightful.   Our family goes straight to Pasticceria Bruno for dinners, parties, birthday cakes, and more.  The Hylan Blvd location made my daughters first birthday cake, two tiers, covered in fondant, adorned with adorable butterflies and dragonflies.  My guests are still talking about the cake, and my daughter is almost  two. I have NO idea what the other reviewers are talking about, I have eaten in both restaurants dozens of times, and have never been dissatisfied.   Their cooking tastes as homemade as mine. And their prices are reasonable.  You would pay more to eat fried food at Applebees. Try this restaraunt, you won't be disappointed.
