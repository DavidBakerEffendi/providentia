This is by far one of the worst indian restaurants that i have been to. They make you wait atleast 15 minutes just for them to take your order. We ordered chicken tikka masala, the pan was sizzling but the chicken pieces were COLD. No flavor in the chicken biryani what so ever. Service is just horrible. Please do your self a huge favor and never go to this place. i suggest checking out some of the other indian restaurants in the area.
