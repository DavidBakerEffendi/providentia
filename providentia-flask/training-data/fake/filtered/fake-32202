This place may have great bagels; however, the service is horrific. There is a specific man or whatever you want to call him there who is immature. If a person hates there job they should quit and find another one. My first incident is with my eight year old. He went in to get sandwiches and handed him a bill and the cash register personnel gives him the wrong change and then decides he is going to argue with an eight year old. How stupid and immature can you possibly be. He is eight and you are what, fifty? Get a life. Then another incident is when I call to place an order and I am telling him specifics about my order; he catches an attitude and just tells me to tell him what I want and that is it. Sorry if your sorry self can not be patient for a two minute phone call to take an order. Your store is not that busy. Relax. So I cancelled and decided to go else where. I will NEVER recommend this place and will NEVER go there again. I would rather eat cheap fast food and recommend Krauszers before I ever step into that whole. At least they would treat people with respect.
