Weird. A coffee shop in Fishtown where they're extremely happy to see me. Even though they don't know me. And I'm not wearing a plaid shirt or ironic facial hair. What's the catch? Good coffee? Check. Solid wi fi? Check. Plug for your laptop? Check. Great music? Check. Â  On the negative side, I don't love the florescent light panels, but it's so sunny in here that you barely notice it.
