This place is in my neighborhood and I'm beyond delighted they finally opened. I've been there every other day and am crazy about the Tuscan Kale Salad! Also, I've been drinking their green juice, which is delish! I didn't care for a muffin I purchased- it was hard and didn't taste fresh. Everything else I've tried so far has been exceptional; the wine (organic), the brussel sprouts, the ratatouille, and so on. Service is great.The manager is very knowledgeable and gave me excellent recommendations.
