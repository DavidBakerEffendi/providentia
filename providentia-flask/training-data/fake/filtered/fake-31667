Went on a Tuesday night and it was packed! We sat at the bar and ordered food.  It was a bit tight to eat but it worked. The steak tartare toast was really worth ordering, but after that we wished that was all we had. We tried the pumpkin toast which was too much.  The mussels were a bit chewy for my taste. THe oysters were pretty good though. THe shrimp salad was ok, not enough shrimp. Dessert was really great...order the carrot cake! We only had wine, which was ok.. very short list. But I guess their specialty is the mixology drinks, very interesting watching the bartenders mix them up. I liked the ambiance though, and the decor. I would meet up for drinks here with friends.
