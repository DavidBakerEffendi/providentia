Loved our first time here.  Will certainly become a regular visitor. Stuffed eggplant app was great.  Ginger calamari was cooked perfect, and very tasty, but the sweet ginger sauce took away whatever crispyness would have been there.  I'll get the regular calamari next time. Gnocchi with bolognese, another hit at the table. Spring butterfly pasta was loaded with fresh veggies.   Chicken francaise was a great choice if you want a traditional meal. Veal valentino was a surprise combination of flavors that I didnt think would go as well as they did. Braised short rib ravioli was perfect. Stuffed grilled pork chop was heavenly. All the veggies were fresh and flavorful.  All the sauces were top notch. Four of us at the the table were passing tastes around, sharing everything.  Each time we tasted the next thing we were further and further blown away.  Lost count of how many times we said something to the effect of "Oh my.. wow". There was only one minor issue.  We didn't get bread on the table till after we were seated for ~20 minutes.  We were waiting for the other half of our party to arrive and I guess it just flubbed up the timing.  Not a big deal. Aside from that, the service was great.  Friendly and attentive staff.  Cheese grated over your plate, not pre-grated powder..  We never felt rushed.  We ordered some apps, then some pasta courses, then our main course.  All 20-25 minutes apart, spreading the meal out nicely.  We were seated a little over 3 hours in total. Thats the only way we like to do dinner.  Just like at a family dinner at home. I highly recommend this place.  Already looking forward to going again soon!
