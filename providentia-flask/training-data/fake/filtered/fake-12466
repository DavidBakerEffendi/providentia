We ordered a cod dinner and got this real cheap frozen fish. We told the waitress and she took it back into the kitchen and back in 2 minutes stating that is a thin piece of cod. Â We eat cod all the time and know our fish. Do not order cod there as they are giving you cheap fish. Never again would we go there. Very disappointing....and very dishonest advertising.....
