If you know how to play this, and you've got timing down, this place is on target and a favorite all the time. Pizza is uber-dank, the Ultimate is "ultimate", and the Caesar with roasted reds and artichoke hearts is tasty and cool. To keep it brief, this is a must-do experience...just don't walk in @ 5PM on a Friday or Saturday and expect to jump right into the flow. The place is regularly packed and even take out takes time and requires precision when it comes to timing. "do it"
