I hate to do holiday meals because it usually means the lowest common denominator of any restaurant. Well, not today at the Village Inn. Food was amazing. Service was warm and attentive without being intrusive, despite an absolutely packed house. I have worked in the business years ago and know how hard it is to execute under these conditions. ( Great wine list too). Very impressive: definitely a new favorite
