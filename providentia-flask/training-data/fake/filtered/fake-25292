I recently moved to Brooklyn from LA and my friends insisted that I try this place for brunch. After a lengthy wait we were seated outside, after some wait we got our drinks and food. It was average for the price, I would say. The menu is actually pretty limited and I had to settle on the Moroccan Scramble which while adventurous, didn't actually come out well as a breakfast dish- I found it overwhelming. I had some of my friend's truffle fries which were tasty but certainly not the best I've had. All in all I'd say this place relies heavily on the Heath Ledger hype and didn't wow me in the slightest.
