From my rating it's obvious I LOVE THIS PLACE. I met some friends here for dinner on a Thursday night, we didn't have a reservation so we were told we had to wait about 30 mins for a table. We perched ourselves at the bar and had some of their delicious cocktails. The bartender was nice and really cared about the preparation of the drinks. Our table was not ready until 40 mins later, but the time flew by it's easy to get lost in the decor, the bartender mixing drinks and a conversation or two with other people at the bar about how their drinks tasted. Our food was amazing, some of the best cuisine I've eaten in New York. My sometimes vegetarian friend had the seared filet mignon, I had the pork shnitzel and our guy friends both had the venison stew. I tried a bit of everyone's and it was so good. Whatever you order here is going to be good. Totally affordable, well by NY standards, and great ambiance. This is a great place to take out of town friends or a date.
