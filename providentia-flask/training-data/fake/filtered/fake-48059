Food was good but service was iffy. Loved the environment, even on a loud (and perhaps bit too dim?) Friday night. The bartender was awesome, no service points docked for him. Friendly yet not too much so, and provided great recommendations. After sitting for dinner, the waitress clearly had no clue what she was talking about in terms of drinks (my friend asked for a wine recommendation and her response was "they all go well with eating") and while service got slower throughout the meal (to an unbearable 15 minute wait after done with our entrees), overall she was incredibly friendly. But if the food hadn't been so good, it would have been a lower rating for sure. Bread that started the meal was delicious. Had the jumbo shrimp and friend calamari appetizers. Both good, the calamari was a huge portion. My friend had the ahi tuna salad which was large and delicious, although came with quite a few items that weren't listed on the menu (might want to be careful about that since people have allergies!). I got the filet which was great, although I got the Bearnaise sauce which I found quite spicy and was sad about. Had the pink pussy cat for dessert. Simple but good. I've also had a few of the mixed cocktails off the menu, always a delight if you don't mind throwing down the dough.
