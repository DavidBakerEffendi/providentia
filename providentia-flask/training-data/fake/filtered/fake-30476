I just came back from dinner at Cho Dang Gol with a big group of 12 people and they were super accomodating.  Several people in the party did't make it on time but the restaurant was still patient enough to allow us to have the extra table.  I strongly suggest big parties to get there on time as it is a popular restaurant and there are plenty of people waiting for a table.  Having said that, the food was excellent and the service was second to none.  We started off with several plates of tasty scallion seafood pancakes which really whetted our appetite for the main course of Korean barbecue, jap chae, and bibimbap.  We shared everything as it was easier that way in terms of ordering and figuring out the final bill. The quality of the food and the sevice are reasons enough to check out this wonderful restaurant.  I am a repeat customer and I have never been dissapointed!
