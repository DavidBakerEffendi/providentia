Ok so I have never reviewed any resteraunt, especially a delivery place. But I absolutely have to give credit where credit is due. I was sitting in my kitchen starving and tired of getting the same delivery all the time- I find this random menu in my menu drawer for Pazzo Pizza. Well- HOLY AMAZING. I order Chicken cheese steak expecting a soggy mess and I get the most amazing thing that might have fallen from heaven. Did I mention it was hot?? As in not sitting on a counter waiting for delivery. Oh yea, Two words: CALANDRA ROLL. I also got sausage & peppers (I don't even LIKE marinara sauce) and WOW delicious. Oh and the simple things... like the person who answered the phone was polite and GOT MY ORDER RIGHT. I don't know who owns this place- but they deserve a hug and a high five. If you live in Fairfield, or close by- TOTALLY try it. I can't wait to order a pizza- Its probably heavenly. Thank you for filling my belly with quality deliciousness.
