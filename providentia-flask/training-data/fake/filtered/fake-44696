Dined at Bellini's tonight based on the recommendation of a stranger, should have known better.  The restaurant is dirty, table was not clean when we were seated., the grated cheese and hot pepper shakers were so sticky I chose not to use them.  Bathroom was so dirty my 6 year old grandson noticed. Ordered baked ravioli, undercooked and clearly not even a high quality frozen product I could have purchased at a supermarket. Will not ever go back.
