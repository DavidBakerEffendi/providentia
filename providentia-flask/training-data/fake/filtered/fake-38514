This place is a waste of money.  The portions are very small but cost the same as a full meal at other restaurants.  My wife and I started with a $13 cheese plate that contained three tiny pieces of cheese, each one not much larger than a dime - no kidding!  It was the sorriest excuse for a cheese plate that I've ever seen.  The service was good and soon after we finished the cheese plate (which didn't take long), our dishes began to arrive.  My tiny $19 pork chop was delicious around the edge but near the bone it was overcooked and dry.  And forget about side dishes, what accompanied my pork chop was only about two bites and so small that I really couldn't even tell what it was.  My wife's meal was a $17 two bite portion of sea scallops.  I've never seen a scallop that thin in my life!  We were advised by our hostess to just buy more of the side items (at $10-$20 additional cost each!).  Wow!  The only bright spot about our visit was the craft beer, but once again, it was a small portion.  While it was a great tasting dark ale, the draft beer I recieved came in a tiny little glass that I generously estimate at 10oz, and it cost $9. Philadelphia has many restaurants that offer much more value and much better food than a.kitchen.  I won't waste my time and money there again!
