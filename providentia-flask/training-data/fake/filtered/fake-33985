People who go to Yale think that New Haven pizza is famous, but in fact New Haven, CT just isn't that famous. But I am not writing to make fun of folks who went to Yale, I am writing to tell you all that just a few short days ago, I tasted New Haven pizza.   It was quite a scene.  We waited outside in line for about an hour, and then waited after we ordered for another hour, but from the staff and the old pictures and newspaper clippings on the wall (from CT newspapers 20 years ago... not enough to dub anything "famous") I had the feeling it was going to be worth it. We had a pizza with mushrooms, and a white pizza with potatoes and rosemary.  "Well how was it?!" I'm sure you're wondering if you haven't had the pleasure.  Let me tell you, it was very very good.  It was good for lunch the next day too. And that's the Truth about New Haven pizza.
