My favorite place for lunch!! Have visited this hidden gem over 10 times in the past year. My colleagues call this place "By The Pound" because your food is weighed. So, you pay for what you eat. Salad bar has a nice array of traditional brazilian foods (fried plantain, feijoada, cheese balls, farofa, etc). Today, my bill for 3 people (with 3 Snapples) was $44, tip included. Good value for the dollar. Friendly service. Pleasant atmosphere for a mid-day break. I always take out of town guests there. To date, no one has ever complained.
