I was pleasantly surprised by how much my kids loved this place.  They had the traditional ramen with pork belly and liked the trainer chopsticks.  My husband and I had the vegetarian wasabi ramen which was outstanding.  We also ordered the eggplant bun.  The eggplant was crispy and bun was soft.  They have a lovely staff that welcome you when entering the restaurant.  Will be going back soon!
