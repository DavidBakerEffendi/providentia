This bar/restaurant is awesome. I've only ever been there at night,past 10 pm mainly because my boyfriend gets off so late,so at night it is typically loud and busy. However upon visiting yesterday afternoon with my boyfriend,we got a pleasant surprise. It was just opening and the bartender Rich was not only extremely engaging, he was also very knowledgeable about the drinks he served us. It is a tequila bar after all,and before this, my boyfriend or i never met a bartender who knew the differences between the types of tequilas there are and their typical uses. The food is just ok to me,but only because Im Afro-Cuban American and the food is more American than what Im used to,but my American boyfriend loves it! It's not that inexpensive, but it isnt over priced,especially for downtown New Haven. You can get pitchers of cocktails for pretty cheap if you like going out as groups. A pitcher usually serves 5 drinks, and the price for all pitchers is like paying for 4 drinks. And that's standard,it's not a special or anything. The prices range for each cocktail,but typically 9-11 for one drink, 36-44 for a pitcher. Overall for the bar alone i could find very little reason not to give it 5 stars!
