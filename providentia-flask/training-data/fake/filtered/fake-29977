Where can i begin? I'm not an oyster person (Heck, this was my first time eating them raw) so I didn't know what to expect coming here. Walked in and was immediately seated. The red haired waitress (I unfortunately can't remember her name) was quick and attentive, and was totally sweet when I told her it was my first time there and eating raw oysters. Had the happy hour deal and completely fell in love with the oysters and the beer (tasted deliciously like coffee and something else) And then....the fettuccine with clams came out. I died, went to Heaven, and floated back down. I even gushed that I wanted to take it home with me (sadly I couldn't) Shane is totally sweet and if I could live in here and drink the beer and just eat the pasta (and the scallops with risotto, Good gravy they were good) I would.
