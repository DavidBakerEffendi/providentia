Went there for a birthday dinner on a Sunday night. Food was amazing and service was friendly and knowledgeable. The famous Carne Asada really didn't disappoint! The fried chicken tacos were really good too. Cucumber Jalapeno margarita had the perfect kick - of jalapeno and tequila. Overall it was a very pleasant dining experience and I would definitely go back to try more!  Lolita now takes reservations on Open Table, so much easier to plan ahead.  Can't wait to try the rest of the menu.
