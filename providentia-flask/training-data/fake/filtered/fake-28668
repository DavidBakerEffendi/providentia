My friend lives in town and of all the places she took me to I found this restaurant to be the best. Of course one has to like Turkish cuisine. We usually share cold appetizer combination and grilled mix platter.  That covers a lot of what they offer on  menu and everything is delicious.They also bake their own flat bread which is offered along with olives while waiting for your order. Turkish coffee they make is another gem of theirs. Between very fair prices for their portion sizes and BYOB it's very affordable and keeps you going back. The waiters are very attentive and know their menu. Definitely recommended place to dine. For locals: they also deliver.
