Positives!  Best Chocolate Layer Cake!!  Just add more of the sweet stout anglaise pretty please.  Nice work Tessa and Sam! We had a corner seat near the servers stations which was awkward.  Please fix the tables, they were wobbly.  Fortunately our fantastic server helped out and adjusted them.   One suggestion made by 2 people at our table (and I think so too) is match the burger with the bun size. I have had some really great meals in the past here but was disappointed with my meal.  I got the Corn cakes dinner which were dry.  The kale and mushroom topping was really tasty, but the cakes were lacking.  In my mind I was thinking they would be more cake like not pancake like...so a bit of disappointment cause it was not what I expected.
