Let me start off by saying, wow! From all the different restaurants I've been to, I can easily say this is probably the WORST. I went there about a week before the Super Bowl and let me tell you, the service was absolute THIRD class. We get there and wait by the door to be seated, and there was a tall blonde woman who was behind the bar on her phone, who yells to us, "it's self seating" and then continues on with her conversation on the phone. After we finally "self seat" ourselves, the woman comes about 20 minutes later to ask what we wanted to drink. As we are waiting for our drinks, we see a coupe of toddlers running from the kitchen to the dining room with pool sticks in their hands without any supervision. From the looks of it, they were related to someone who worked there. Finally the blondy comes back with our flat drinks and some burnt "garlic bread", and asks for our order. When I place and order for lobster ravioli, she says to me, "I doubt we have anymore, this place doesn't have anything." At that point I looked at her and asked her if I can place an order for Clams. She says, "you're better off picking a dish with chicken, because this place REALLY doesn't have much." As soon as she said that, I said thank you and my wife and I just left, I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy, it was an absolute atrocious experience. Bottom line this place is an absolute mess and from the looks of everything, I think it was a blessing that I didn't order anything,
