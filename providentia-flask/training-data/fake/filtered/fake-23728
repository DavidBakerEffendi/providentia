I'm new to Yelp but decided to start posting after my recent trip to NYC. The Smith was a great go to spot for a few afternoon lunches. I liked that they stayed open between normal lunch and dinner hours so late lunches were no problem. Wine is served by the carafe which was a fun way to try a few different things I'd never had before. Service was attentive, not overly knowledgable but very nice. We found ourselves here more than a few times during our stay and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Try the hot potato chips with the blue cheese sauce (I ordered it on the side which makes the chips less soggy)
