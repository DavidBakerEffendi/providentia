We recently went to On20 for a special occasion.  This was our second time at the restaurant and we found it disappointing on several levels.  There is a mandatory service charge of 20%, regardless of the size of the party, that also applies to the bar area.  After we were seated in the dining area, we waited an inordinate amount of time for cocktails to be delivered, even though the bar area was hardly buzzing with activity.  When our server delivered our cheese plate, no effort was made to explain the various cheeses, so we asked him to do so.  His truculent response was that he did not know the selections, as he did not assemble the platter, but he would venture a guess.  I would expect more from the caliber of restaurant that On20 proclaims to be.  Lastly, although On20 was aware that we were celebrating a very special occasion, they made no effort whatsoever to make our outing extraordinary.  If you want to go to an extraordinary restaurant in the Hartford area for a special occasion, I would recommend dining elsewhere.
