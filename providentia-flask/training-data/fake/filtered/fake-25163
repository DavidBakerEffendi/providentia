I went last Saturday with a big group and we all loved this place! Great service, great (lively) atmosphere and terrific food. The ricotta and mortadella bruschettas, with the slightly charred bread, were wonderful. The salumi plate, the sweetbreads, the artichoke - great little dishes. However, the pastas (no surprise for a Vetri restaurant) were the biggest hit for us. I only had the steak after that, but I thought that was also melt-in-your-mouth good. I would agree with another reviewer that some of the cocktails were well done but overpriced (after 1, we stuck to wine and beer). But if you are looking for a relaxed, upbeat atmosphere and some great Italian food at reasonable prices, I think you'd be hard-pressed to beat this joint. For those that had issues, I would suggest giving them some time and going again later, as the simple fact it's brand new could explain some of the inconsistencies or flaws. We will definitely be back.
