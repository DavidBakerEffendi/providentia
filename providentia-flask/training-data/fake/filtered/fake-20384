Few days back I was in NJ with my family. One of my family friend suggested this restaurant. We ordered gobi manchurian which was perfect flavor and spice, tandoori mushrooms were delicious. We had spicy dal tadka & paneer bhurji. It was made to our taste. Service was friedndly. We ended our meal with having rice pudding & mango ice cream. I will surely come again.
