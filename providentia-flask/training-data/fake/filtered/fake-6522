There is NOTHING about this place that I don't reccommend. I live in the neighborhood and even if you don't, I advise you to make the trip. It comes across as family owned and not exclusive, the decor isn't exactly trendy. Anyone can walk in and be treated to a friendly, sincere greeting. It can be pretty busy in there, so patience is a plus. It is so worth the wait. If you're looking to impress a date, this isn't going to be the cozy, romantic atmosphere you might want, but trust me the food and drinks will be all you need to make the evening memorable. It is a nice place to dine and it is a good experience. If I wanted an apple martini, this is the first and only place in town I would go. It's one of those out of the way places where if you don't know about it, you don't know about it, but you should. I can't imagine anyone having a bad experience here. Parking is tough. Park at the paid garage if you can.
