I stumbled on this small falafel place while walking around in the West Village. The place literally is hole-in-the-wall, but the layout of it was cozy. The problem is that there are so many people trying to get food it feels less like cozy and more like gross. That being said, the food (falafel) and the smoothies were excellent; more expensive but higher quality than other falafel places. THE AWESOME... -Delicious food -The location of it is perfect -Good selection of different things THE MEH... -Tiny tiny tiny space -The workers weren't rude, but they weren't friendly. -Cash only (!?!?) I'll be back again..as soon as I ever have cash again.
