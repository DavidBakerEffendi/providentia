i have had a reservation for a party of 6 for this saturday night (a 40th Â anniversary party- told this to them) at fitzgeralds 1928 for OVER A MONTH... so far in advance that they told me the reservation book didnt go that far but they would write it down... i get a call today THURSDAY, two days before my reservation telling me they were canceling my reservation bc they booked a party...i said i was appalled at the lack of disrespect for their customers and I would be telling everyone I knew. The man told me not to threaten him. DO NOT make reservations here.
