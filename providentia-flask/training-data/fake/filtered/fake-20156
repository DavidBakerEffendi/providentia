Well they must do something right they have over five hundred stores. But..........great food, no! Cheap food yes for sure! There freezer is bigger then most  small houses. The only fresh veggies they have is the let&tom(and that is questionable).  The service is not grade A, I never have received all of my food hot. I truly believe that if it was not for out of town business they would have shut down years ago! But having a large family we still go on occasion, for an inexpensive meal. All that crap in the lobby is overwhelming and tacky. You need to have something to do while you wait sometimes an hour plus for a table!
