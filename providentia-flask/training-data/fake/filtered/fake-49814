Guy fieri struck out on this one! Quite possibly the worse service we ever experienced. My fiancé and I stopped on our way back from NYC. We had seen the place on tv.  We were one of 3 tables of customers in the place but it still took 15 min to give us a menu. Gave us the wrong soup. Salad plate was obviously dirty. Main dishes came out at different times. Vegetables were mushy. Food under salted and bland. Kitchen was filthy and bathrooms reeked like stale urine  Only saving grace were halfway decent fries!  We ran out as fast as we could.
