We came here because of the extensive draft list. It did not disappoint but I was less than impressed with the pours on the beers. I can understand that some beers should be 10 ounces but why serve them in a larger glass. I would have a premium not to be served a half a beer. I guess they have a glass half empty half full mentality. We'll hobback because the food was good but I hope they fix the glassware deal if they want to craft beer status.
