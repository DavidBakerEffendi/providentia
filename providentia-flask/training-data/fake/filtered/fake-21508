I went to Ward III the other night with a couple of friends and i must say, upon our entrance I was pleasantly intrigue by the dark but, unpretentiously classy "basement bar" type of environment. We were the first ones there, as it was kind of early (I think the bar staff  was still setting up). We were instantly greeted by a cool tattoo laden bartender and ordered a round of drinks. I was getting over a slight cough, so i asked if they could prepare me a hot cocktail with Laird apple brandy and peppermint tea for my still fragile throat. My order wasn't on the menu, but without hesitation was made to perfection.  I had two. I definitely would recommend to anyone who is looking for a great service and cocktails in mind for a low key type of night. We didn't eat during our stay, but I couldn't help but notice the delicious aroma streaming from our neighbor's plate. yum! next time.
