My wife and I were looking forward to trying a new restaurant in our home town,but it never happened.  I thought by making a reservation on Wednesday for Saturday that I  had all the bases covered, but I was wrong. When we arrived ten minutes before our seating I found that our names never made it on the list.  The hostess informed me that there would be no problem and we would be seated in ten minutes. Ten turned to twenty to thirty to forty to fifty then to us leaving and going else where for our meal. Needless to say not only was it a serious disappointment, but it is one number that I will never call again!!!!!!
