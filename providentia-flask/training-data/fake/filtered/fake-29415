Though the food is good at this Udipi cafe, the service is very bad. An old man who was taking care of billing may be over loaded with work but he just can't throw the bill book at the table of a customer. That too I went in with 2 small Â kids and the bill book was thrown at the table and it landed with a bang on the table and my younger kid 4 years old just got a shock of it. A VERY BAD MANNERS which I have never experience anywhere. I just hate the way that old man behaved not having enough maturity for his age I guess or may be his is too proud of his hotel ..hence the rude attitude....didn't even had a coutersy to apologies after that.
