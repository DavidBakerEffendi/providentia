You know, my wife and I really liked this place at first.  The food is pretty good.  The atmosphere was comfy and our kids really liked the fish tank. There were, however, too many pet peeves that really has put an end to our visits.  First of all, be prepared to bring your own jasmine rice.   For a large dish, you receive about the amount of one scoop of ice cream.  They are extremely stingy on the portions and charge you $1 if you ask for more.  It's rice people.  Especially annoying if you're paying $17 for an entree.  Next, the service.  We're done.  Sitting.  Waiting.  Last time we were there, the waiter incorrectly brought shrimp Pad Thai, which my wife can't eat.  When we informed the waiter, he looks at his pad.  No apology, no "I'll take care of it."  Just an annoyed look.  As he's about to take it, I ask him to leave it on the table and bring out the chicken one (to make sure the shrimp is not removed and replaced with chicken).  He says "no" and takes it away.  Wow.  Thanks for the service.  Needless to say, we will spend our money elsewhere...where the rice flows like water.
