Went here last night, recommended by our daughter who lives in the neighborhood. A fun, energetic vibe, restaurant was full. Had a great table near the window, terrific service. Food was very good, nice light chopped salad, Bison burger were very good. Others had the beef noodles, another burger, and the pork chop, which my wife loved. Good wine selection, not too expensive. Â Good neighborhood place, upscale casual, a little noisy but that's not a bad thing
