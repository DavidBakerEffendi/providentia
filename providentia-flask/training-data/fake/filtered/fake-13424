The Canoe Club is my new favorite restaurant. It's a great place for lunch and dinner, or to relax at the bar and take in the ambiance of a traditional canoe club. The menu is extensive, the service attentive, and the portions are generous. Great wine list and selection of beer and ale, including microbrews. Music in the evening is just right, not a distraction. I like to sit at a table by the front window and watch people headed to and from the Dartmouth campus or shopping. When headed to a movie or campus event, I let my server know and they're sure that I'm served and on my way in time. It's a good place for a business lunch or dinner, too. They make me feel welcome there - that's why I go whenever I'm in town.
