PYT has stellar food.  This is really the only important part of the equation.  Their staff is friendly, and their food is delicious. As a foodie, I'd be willing to wander into some fairly suspect neighborhoods to enjoy my favorite dish. This is not like that at all, I can look past the skinny jeans and raybans for a delicious creative burger, great drinks that appeal to my inner child, and a dance floor in the back to work it all off when you're done. What more could you ask for?
