I went to Positano's with my daughter on Mother's Day, and I received the worst service of my life.  When I explained to the manager how I felt, all she did was make excuses, and the guy standing next to her (I have no idea what his position was in the restaurant) showed me a text message from the "real" waitress stating she had a stomach ache and couldn't come in, and that is why this untrained lady was serving us.  It's not about the money, but it would have been nice if they had offered me a discount on my next visit, but they just let me walk out the door in tears.  I would give anything to go back in time 5 hours and find a restaurant who cared about making the mothers walking in the door feel special on Mother's Day.  I am appalled.
