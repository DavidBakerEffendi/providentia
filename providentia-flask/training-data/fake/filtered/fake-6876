I held a banquet here and could not have been more pleased with the service, the event planning, and of course, the food. I worked with their event manager, Elizabeth, who made the process of planning and executing the banquet seamless. She was willing to accommodate some random menu requests we had, checked in with me periodically in the days leading up to the event, and was very familiar with how to work with student organizations on campus. The night of the banquet I showed up early to check out the set-up in the private room and was thrilled with how courteous and helpful the servers were. One of them made sure I had a glass of wine and the other helped me arrange name cards before the guests arrived. Once the guests arrived, the restaurant did an excellent job accommodating people's drink orders, taking food orders efficiently, and making sure the courses came out with perfect timing. The food was amazing - I had the hangar steak, and fully intend to return to ZINC for a regular dinner at some point to have this dish again. The best part is that unlike other restaurants, ZINC will create banquet menus with 5 or so options per entree, so every guest will be able to select something they actually enjoy. I highly recommend ZINC for a banquet. This restaurant offers the perfect combination of impeccable service and delicious food. The private room is ideal for parties of up to 30, and the restaurant is willing to set up the room in a way that works best for your event. Again, I am extremely happy with the way our event went.
