Horrible! Overpriced and misleading. Not worth the money at all. Soup was cold and chicken parm was overcooked. We ordered our food and the waitress asked "Did you want soup or salad with that?" She said it in a way that made us think it came with the meal... And for the price of an entree it should come with it. But.. NO! We were charged an additional $7 for a small bowl of soup and $6 for a small plate of salad. We wouldn't have ordered either if they had told us it was an additional price. We called for the manager and she was rude and not understanding at all. She said "Nothing I can do. The menu says Al la carte." I'm from Jersey and I speak ENGLISH. I did not notice the fine print that says Al la carte and I dis not even know what that meant.. I think it's French for "This restaurant sucks."
