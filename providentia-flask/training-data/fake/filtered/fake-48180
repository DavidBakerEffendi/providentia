The fries are great and the sauces are on par as well.  Although I don't suggest the Peanut Satay to anyone, in my opinion that's one of their worse ones. However, in my opinion, the success of any restaurants should be customer service.  One of the Filipino worker there decided to PMS and throw a b*tch-fit today while I visited the shop with some friends who never tried it before.  My friend asked for samples and the worker yelled at her for doing so.  As I look at him in disgust, he turns his rage to me and says "What are you looking at?" like a tough guy.  He scoffs and act as if he's too good to be working there when clearly, he will never do anything more productive than making fries at $7.25 an hour like the laboring b*tch that he is.  When I paid for the food, he snatches the money I placed on the table and missed two one-dollar bills and turns around to open up the cash register.  When he finally realizes he was missing two dollars, he acts as if it was my fault he's a dumb-ass and won't stop giving my friends and me dirty looks and muttering things under his breath, being the little b*tch that he is won't say anything out loud.
