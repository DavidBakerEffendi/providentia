Boyfriend and I just moved to the area and our neighbor highly recommended this place for a special occasion. We chose to go for our anniversary last night. We had a reservation for 7:30PM. It seems to be a challenge to get parking, but that's ok, we found a spot. We went inside to get our table, confirming we had a reservation and we were told it would be a bit longer and we were handed a buzzer. Ok. TWENTY MINUTES go by and we are finally called for our table. "We have a table for you now, but we need it back by 9:20," states the hostess. My jaw dropped! "UMMMMM Ok, I don't think it will take us that long." How rude!?!? After waiting 20 minutes past our reservation time, we get that!?!? Ugh. We were seated in the bar area (how romantic) and we orders some beers and an appetizer. The little necks were good, but I felt over priced. The waiter took our dinner order and then that's pretty much last time we saw him. He didn't serve us anything, other people did. He checked on us once when I was half way through my beer and starting to eat my dinner, we ordered another round. I was done with dinner before another waitress asked us if we needed another round and retrieved the ones we previously ordered at the bar. Yes, the wrack of lamb was the best lamb I have ever had, however, it did not make up for the lousy treatment by the hostess and waiter. Oh yeah, then after we finished dinner it took the waiter 20 minutes to see if we wanted desert... No, it's 9:20 and you need your table back. I don't know where the waiter was all night, but if his neglect was due to waiting too many tables at once, they need to up the staffing. $50 a person for dinner... They can afford more wait staff. We thought about going back for the free BBQ one night, but by the time we got out of there we were done with that place. Never again, despite being five minutes away and the lamb being amazing.
