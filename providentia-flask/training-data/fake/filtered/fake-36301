Great food for what it is: southern fried cajun collective. Very friendly service, BYOB (no corking fee for wine), amazing fries (get them spicy. you won't regret it), very relaxed atmosphere and amazing price to food ratio. I got the fish n chips last time I went, spent like 15 bucks and was full for a day. Thank you for existing Juniper. In the words of the legendary acting talent Arnold Schwarzenegger: "I'll be back."
