This is a great after-night spot!  They have a decently stocked kitchen that's open late, and you can't beat that for munchies--especially their fries and perogies! YUM! Also an okay selection of beers; hey, you can't possibly go wrong with food and beer being a plus, right? Anyway, the atmosphere was pretty laid back, albeit, I was there late night with a friend and the place was almost empty, but not enough to be awkward.  The staff is extremely friendly and don't hover over you, even if there only 5 people at the bar!   I've always been intimidated to enter this establishment, but you know what, once inside, I'd definitely come back for seconds, thrids, and even fourths.  It's got a relaxed feel that's not so grungy AND it feels truly 'local.'  Not flooded with college kids or tourists, I guess you can say, it's kinda home-y, in an off-beat sense. So anyway, if you're lookin' for that local feel of South Street--and some good conversation pieces on the walls--then don't be afraid to step in here..I guarantee a chill time...regardless of the hour.
