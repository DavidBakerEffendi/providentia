I did my baby showers party in their hall. First of all the food sucks. Secondly, the food is not sufficient enough for my quests. Almost half of my quests left with empty stomach since I keep telling the waiter to fill up the buffet. The waiter liked he did not know what to do ( maybe never worked in the restaurant before). Their service is very unproffesional. Thanks Mirchi for ruining my party.
