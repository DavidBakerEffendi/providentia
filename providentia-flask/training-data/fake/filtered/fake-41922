My friends and I went here for restaurant week. They acccomodated our large party of 10 and we were thankful. Our server was friendly and got every order right. Right before we got dessert, our one friend who had work met up with us to go out after we were finished dinner. We asked the hostess for another chair just so she could sit down while we finished. Without even looking around or trying to find one, she replied with a snotty attitude "We don't have any extra chairs. You do know it's restaurant week, right?" When I then stated that of course I knew it was restaurant week and reminded her that our bill was almost $600 and asked if she could at least check to see if they had an extra chair, she responded "Your reservation was only for 10 people. We don't have any extra chairs." Meanwhile, a table across from us and a ton of bar chairs were open. Our friend shared a chair with one of us until we were finished dessert. My friends were disgusted by this hostess. She had a horrible attitude. We were spending a lot of money on food and drinks that night and this hostess absolutely left a sour taste in our mouth by the time we left. The food was ok, but not worth the condescending attitude from the hostess. Customer service is key at a restaurant. NONE OF US WILL BE BACK.
