Gotta love this place. Never crowded, always friendly. Go there Monday for a quiz show and go there Thursday for karaoke. Here's a secret: At 10 o'clock they have a 5 dollar menu. You have to ask for it or else you may get the full price one. The portions are pretty big too. One 5 dollar meal to go with your 5 dollar black and blue's or 9 dollar pitchers and you're in for a good night. If you're there on Monday or Thursday say HI to DJ Mike. He'll always show you a good time. Its a little pricey but its worth it. The atmosphere is great and it's the ideal Â spot if you just wanna chill.
