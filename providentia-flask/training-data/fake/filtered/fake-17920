Best Sushi in the Metropolitan area.. I have been to numerous sushi restaurants including Nobu and other famous NYC Sushi Restaurants. But Nori is the best. It is consistently delicious with a ton of rolls to choose from.  There cooked food is great too but i rarely ever get as I love the Sushi too much.  A definite must eat!
