i'm so mad at this place right now. i would give them a better review because my first experience was pretty good (spring roll vermicelli), but i just ordered delivery on this extremely stormy night and ordered the chicken bahn mi (my bf got it when we first went there and it was good), but they sent me the wrong sandwich...pork, layered with two kinds of ham! or something i couldn't recognize. don't get me wrong, normally i would suck it up and eat it, but i don't normally eat pork and there was just so much of it. so i called to complain and they said they would fix it (poor delivery guy). when he brought the chicken sandwich, he asked for the wrong one to take back...which i dug out of the garbage for him...then he lingered in the hallway as if he was waiting for a tip. i told him, i'm sorry...i would tip you, but i gave you all my cash the first time. he said he was sorry for the mistake and off he went. i opened up my sandwich and, yes, there was chicken...and HAM! and pate and some other meat. grrrrrr! i don't remember sliced meat when my bf got it and i checked the menu and the ingredients don't say anything about pate or ham or anything other than grilled chicken. look, i'm normally not picky, but this is just frustrating. this place is lucky they're the only ones that take CC and the only ones with spring roll vermicelli, otherwise i wouldn't come back. oh - and the first time i went, my friend got the beef pho and said it was super bland. she refuses to go back. best bahn me = bahn mi zon. next time, i'll pull out cash.
