The rumors are true!!! I have been wanting to have breakfast here for at least the past year. But I couldn't deal with the weekend lines. I had Monday morning off so I decided to finally visit. It was amazing and totally worth it. Just the aroma when you walk in in satisfying. I had the pancakes and there is nothing to say. They were excellent. Light, fluffy and beautiful to look at. The only quibble I have is that the tea was just so-so. Tazo or PG Tips would have been better, but it doesn't matter. Go on a weekday.
