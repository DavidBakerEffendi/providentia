My friend and I went to Senoritas this past weekend because we had heard good things about the restaurant and had found a Groupon.  We ordered the table side guacamole and a shrimp and vegetable dish.   The guacamole was prepared without anyone asking how spicy we would like it.  The woman who prepared it barely met our eyes, let alone talked to us.  The guacamole ended up being completely bland.  After several minutes, we were able to flag down a waiter to find us hot sauce.  We made the guacamole palatable by adding hot sauce, salsa and salt.   Our main dish of Senoritas sauce with shrimp was tasty, but not exceptional.  All in all the food was fine and I might have considered returning if the service weren't so awful.  It took over 10 minutes to flag down a waiter to refill my water and when he did, he left our table so quickly, he never even refilled my friend's water. If this restaurant were in a town with good or very good Mexican restaurants, I doubt it would last.
