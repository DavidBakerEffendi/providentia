We recently experienced an extraordinary epicurean evening at Le Cheri.  Every morsel and drop delightful!  From the special ravioli (filled with 2 fishes and garnished with flavorful oil and herbs) to the fresh fish for two served table side (perfectly cooked in a pastry shell) to the decadent desserts (chocolate bread pudding never tasted so good!) - the meal was amazing!  In addition, the wine pairings perfectly complimented our food and our tastes....Charlotte is a Wine Wizard! We are still glowing from our experience and will be sure to return soon!
