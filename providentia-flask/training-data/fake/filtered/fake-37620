although this restaurant serves great food, the service is horrible. i have been here three times with my boyfriend and all the times we have been here they rush us and bill us before we're even done with our food. the last we came here the waiter brought us the bill and took it before we could even finish putting money for his tip. he then stopped, looked inside and started this rant on how we didn't tip him and how we have to tip him and we told him that since he took it the way he did, we figured that he didn't want the rest of it. anyway, nice restaurant, delicious food and prices but bad service.
