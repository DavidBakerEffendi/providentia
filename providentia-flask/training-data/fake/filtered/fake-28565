The food here is really good. Garlic Naan, bhaigan barta, navratan curry, saag, and pakoras are all delicious. A friend from Boston prefers this to any of the many Indian choices in her neighborhood, and after going to hers, I see why she says that. The service can be good or bad depending on the day, the time, how busy it is, and the particular server. However, the food is so good that I don't care about the service. Lunch prices are so well-priced, and at dinner you'll leave stuffed and with a to-go container for a good price, too.
