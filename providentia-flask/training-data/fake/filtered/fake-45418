Soco is simply amazing! The atmosphere is warm and inviting. A beautiful ambiance with an indoor and outdoor space, great for hosting events. A spectacular bar filled with your liking and great music playing in the background so you're able to talk and enjoy the company you're with. The food is delicious as is the drink menu. I had a sampling of everything and I have to say, this menu is diverse enough for any meat lover or vegetarian to enjoy something savory. Great addition to Brooklyn; I will definitely be back!
