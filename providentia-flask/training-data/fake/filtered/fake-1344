Wow. Do NOT believe their web site. The backyard had 1 dinner option and 3-4 sides. The most substantial menu item was stale tortillas wrapped around warmish pork and a few radish slices. That was the pig face taco. And it was the best of what we were served. Two of the other items on the backyard menu included grilled corn - served cold. And a burrata and watermelon salad that was tiny bits of the cheese (chewing gum size) sprinkled over a bunch of watermelon sitting in its own pink water. Wish we had done a U turn and gone to Littleneck next door.
