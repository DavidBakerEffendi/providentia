We had a wonderful evening here! One moment we were in busy Times Square and the next we were down a few blocks and stepped into a wonderful Italian atmosphere very reminiscent of Italy. The wine selection is great and the food was outstanding. The lamb was the some of the best I've had. Highly recommended.
