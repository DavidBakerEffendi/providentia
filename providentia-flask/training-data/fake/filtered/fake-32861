Great Chinese food, as good as any comparable place in Frisco or Seattle, the ports I used to hang out in.  Han, the owner, is usually working the tables.  I've eaten there twice.  It does get busy for dinner.  Try it for a leisurely lunch.  Show some courage and intestinal fortitude and go with Han's  recommendations.
