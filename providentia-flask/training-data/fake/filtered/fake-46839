Wow a most pleasurable evening. Great food great ambiance. The vindaloo was perfect as was the butter chicken. The okra appetizer was great too. Just an unhurried feel to the place with great service Â  Puts you in a happy mood especially when you end up with a reasonable check to pay at the end of it. Welcome DM to the Upper East Side
