Nothing beats the whole experience! I have never been so well serviced in my whole life. Service was impeccable and is a perfect place to bring someone you want to impress. The food is good, not the best, but still good enough and combined with the service and ambiance, makes it really an amazing experience. Try the bar as well while you're at it, they have cheap drinks.
