This is one of the best restaurants to open in the neighborhood since Boca Lupo. The kale salad is amazing. A friend and I shared a pasta and the squid - both were perfectly done. We were perfectly full. Service was attentive, knew the menu well but not overbearing. Recommend this place to any foodies in Brooklyn.
