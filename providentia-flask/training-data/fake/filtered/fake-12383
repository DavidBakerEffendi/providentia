First time we came here, lunch time on a weekday. First impression was what a pretty, pretty restaurant, and the servers were very friendly from the moment we walked in so that was great. Their menu was pretty small, but everything looked appetizing, and inexpensive, ordered something with eel and rice, and OMG mouthgasm. It was such a perfect lunch! Also, I think I paid only $13 including tip, and I would've gladly paid double for that lunch! Came back on a Sunday around 8PM hoping for dinner, but they had turned into a music venue and weren't serving meals, just drinks and sides. Music was okay, I didn't want to tip but I was guilted into tipping like $15 how did that even happen. ;_; All forgiven though, because I managed to order a beer without getting carded â€¿
