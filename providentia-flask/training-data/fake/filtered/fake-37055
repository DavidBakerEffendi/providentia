Great ramen, in complex-flavored rich pork soups. Must order noodles with all the fixins (you'll want to), and the Buta no Kakuni, glazed pork belly (to die for). Noodles have the right amount of chew and bite to them, the broths just make for some good slurpin'! Less one star, because it's spendy for what it is (average $15 per bowl), when there are other fresh noodle offerings especially in the NYC area.
