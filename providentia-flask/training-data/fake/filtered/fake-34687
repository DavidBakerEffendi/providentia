I've been a long time customer of Sanford's during the pre-renovation years, and always liked their food - breakfast, pastas, burgers, etc. were always good and some of my favorites. I never got around to trying Sanford post-renovation, but was excited to go there last weekend when the chance came up. I was there for breakfast, and was so disappointed with my food, especially since I had high expectations. My pancakes were VERY dry, and my eggs over easy looks dirty with the yolk inside cold. I hope this was just a one-time fluke since Sanford is one of my favorite places to go in Astoria for a casual bite.
