Walking into Diner for the first time, there was little room to stand and wait for a table without being in the way. Back up two inches, bump into the people spilling out of the door. Move forward two inches and my cousin and I were bumped by servers running out plates of food bombarded by bussers grabbing old plates. It was a cluster fuck, needless to say. Once we sat down, our experience became a little more pleasant, as all the food options sounded amazing- in the snippet of time we were told what each dish was, that is. The menus simply list "pancakes" & "fritatta" so all dishes on the menu needed an explanation, along with the daily specials which were written on the paper tablecloth. The food came out in no time though, despite being incredibly packed for Saturday brunch. I ordered the poached eggs with hambone & arugula and was not disappointed- it was spectacular, and the portion size was just right. Copious amounts of coffee later, my cousin and I squeezed out of the Diner and back into the snow. All in all, it was a pleasant and delicious experience.
