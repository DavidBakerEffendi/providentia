We ate there with a large group of people.  The staff was rude, and unprepared for our party size despite having made reservations weeks in advance.  The food was mediocre and took forever.  In fact, two in our party left after the appetizer course because things took so long.  We were left waiting for drink refills and between courses.  The manager was so rude he should be considered an embarrassment to this establishment when we complained of this sub par experience.  Finally, to top off this disastrous evening, we were made to SHARE desserts despite having paid $70 per person for their large party menu. In a word, it was awful. -Avoid this place-
