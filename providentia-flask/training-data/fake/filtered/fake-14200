The Octopus was out of this world, hint of lemon. I prefer the French preparation of scallops, but the catch here couldn't be fresher. Peasant salad with Feta (incredible creamy crumbly Feta) was a perfect balancer for the grilled shellfish. Unassuming decor, slightly tacky murals give you the freedom to kick back. Attentive, family style staff.
