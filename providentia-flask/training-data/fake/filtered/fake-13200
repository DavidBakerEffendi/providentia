Cheng Du 23 is the best Asian Cuisine in North Jersey! They will prepare any dishes to your taste, whether you prefer hot, mild or no "hot stuff" at all. Their staff is friendly and helpful. And if you really want a special treat, forget the menu and ask the owner, Kevin, to make a recommendation. So far, everything I've had has been irresistible and addictive. And for dessert, make sure to get the Red Bean Ice Cream!
