From the reservations (Amy), Host (Justin) and server (Karen) - our Friday night foursome with good friends was fantastic. This is special food - not inexpensive but different with solid presentation and impeccable service. 2 specials (monkfish and a delicately layered dish of NYStrip steak with unusual paired sides) and 2 orders of delicatable lamb shank. Perfect lamb with the best sauce - not overpowing, but complex. Yum. The chef is creative and delivers a solid Â yet not overly done menu. One surprise that will keep us returning - try the Ceasar Salad - not even close to what you're used to, but the best salad we ever had...Don't miss this Glastonbury destination for dinner.
