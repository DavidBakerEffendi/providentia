Ok. I read a huge number of these reviews before I went to this shop and bought 24 macaroons to take home with me (they travelled very well by the way). I couldn't believe though, that everyone is raving about these little treats. The cookies are very nice, the centers have a perfect consistency. The taste is the problem. They taste much too sweet and actually taste unsavory. I found several of them tasted a bit Iike soap water. The caramel is the best, but I would prefer a standard salted caramel any day. My husband is a huge fan of fancy desserts, and he could barely eat them. Â My 13 year old said it best. "Oreos are way better". He has a point. Maybe people just want to feel like they could buy something expensive. I will save my money next time, buy some beautiful clothes on Madison, and get dessert elsewhere.
