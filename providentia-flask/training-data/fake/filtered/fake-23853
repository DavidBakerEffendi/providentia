Just ate at Sazon while visiting Philly from D.C.  It was enough to make me want to plan another trip, asap.  We had beef stew --- perfect for the cold blustery night -- and two kinds of arepas, chicken and the chicken, avocado and mayo.  I agree w/ another reviewer who says the arepas are a godsend to those who don't tolerate gluten (this was my first experience eating arepas but we had them at another quite good restaurant for breakfast on the same trip and those just didn't compare).  We finished with the classic cocoa, which let me tell you, will blow your socks off. It was like nothing I've ever tasted before.  Be warned that it's rich, so save room.  Roberto sells his special mix of south and central American chocolates so you can try to replicate the experience at home. On top of the great food and the cosy, laid back ambiance are the owners --- not only are they fine chefs but they're friendly and obviously very passionate about what they do and enthusiastic about sharing that passion with their customers.  I wish I lived closer so that I could make Sazon a regular event, but I'll be back for sure.
