I would give zero stars if I could. I was here in mid September with my daughter (recent Princeton graduate).  This was my third time eating at Witherspoon Grill as the food is absolutely delicious and the service usually top-notch. However, on this particular evening, my waiter was "Kennedy."  I was still in the process of eating my meal when he brings the check to my table and plops it there, stating: "I hope you enjoyed your meal."  My daughter and I were both horrified!!  No dessert menu....no asking if we needed anything else.... I'm positive it was because we were  African American because I didn't observe anyone else being rushed out of the restaurant that night.   Obviously, I left no tip.  I later called the manager who made excuses for "Kennedy."  This manager was not the least bit apologetic, by the way.   Obviously, I will NEVER eat at Witherspoon Grill again.
