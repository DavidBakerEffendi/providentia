A friend & I went back to Vida this past week, and I'm eagerly anticipating going back with hubby. The decor is inviting-- but the BEST is the combo of excellent food and excellent service. The waitress was friendly but not overbearing and remembered us--and our beverage of choice-- as we walked thru the door. By the time we were seated with menus, she had our sangria on the table & poured. The food has been consistent-- fresh, seasonal, and perfectly seasoned. The specials are clearly noted as you enter the restaurant and are the first thing the wait staff tells you-- and they know them by heart without having to look at the menu. Â My first dining experience was with their vegetarian bean dish, flautas, and a hearty white bean and kale soup. The second time, we had all appetizers and a caesar salad-- the best caesar salad I've had in a LONG time. The calamari was fresh, made on premises and came with a delicate minette sauce. The flautas were perfect, as always, and the mussels with Vida sauce were incredible. Overall-- the food is simple seasonal and some of the best SI has to offer. And observing how the other diners were treated, my friend and I received no special treatment. At Vida, you are made to feel like you're at home.
