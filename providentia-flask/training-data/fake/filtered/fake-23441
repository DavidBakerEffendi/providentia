Jezzi: Food: The jerk wings are great! Crisp on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside and topped with a nice amount of the sweet yet tangy sauce. Â The "jerk" sauce doesn't actually taste like the kind typically used in jerk chicken recipes, but it's definitely jerk inspired. You get the smokiness of a jerk sauce with that sweet and spicy combo that Caribbean food is known for. The churassco was also very good. The garlicky marinade gave great flavor to the meat which was cooked to perfection. There was nice char on the outside with a moist red center. The beans, rice, and plaintians were also quite good - certainly above average. Experience:Great atmosphere - I would characterize it as intimate yet fun. Also, they have GREAT frozen drinks. They taste awesome and pack a nice punch. Do try! Rating: 4 Bears: Food: The wings we ordered as appetizers were flavorful with a tangy sauce drizzled all over them. I prefer my food saucy so this was right up my alley. The meat itself could have used slightly more flavor, perhaps if they were marinated in the sauce at some point it would have made a difference. The steak was a great size and had no fat. Which is rare on a cut of meat that size. It too could have used slightly more flavor as well. Experience: The restaurant was dimly lit to create a romantic atmosphere. They played some great Caribbean jams to complete the atmosphere. The service was good as well. The decor could use some updating. Rating: 4
