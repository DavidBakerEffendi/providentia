Have been to the Moshulu many times over the past decade, and it WAS literally one of my favorite places, between the food, service, & atmosphere. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED HERE? We wanted to spend our one year anniversary at a special place, and the TERRIBLE service, food quality, etc. RUINED everything. It started with warm bread being delivered that was COLD, the wrong soup being delivered after waiting almost 40 minutes, the WRONG order arriving for my girl-friend (NOT TOO smart delivering a BURGER to a Vegetarian - that ordered TUNA), and Salmon that I received that I choked down. The Manager was for lack of a better words, an arrogant dick. He was nice enough to not charge use for food we did NOT ORDER, but did charge full price for EVERYTHING ELSE. My Girl-friend eat across the street at the Chart House. Staff at the Chart House was great and I left them almost 30% tip. Left the Moshulu server 20 cents - and that was TOO MUCH. Shame, because I will NEVER go back to the Moshulu - unless under NEW Management, with better food quality. Having worked in food service at a major respected hotel in college, I know that things could not be this BAD unless the Manager is just a ZERO. After speaking with him, I wouldn't let him run food service at 7-eleven. All imo, obviously.
