This place is to be avoided at all costs. The service is inept and they try to jack up the cost of your meal in their attitude and especially by refusing to let patrons share plates of food. We wanted to try the different pirogi and borsch and other dishes and were told we had to order separately. They brought out the wrong fish, took it back and had us wait 20-25 minutes for the right one to appear. Meanwhile all the other patrons had left. Other than one pirogi dish, each of the other dishes had something objectionable about it. The music was blaring and even after a request to turn it down, it crept up. During the meal a set of screens to hide some equipment crashed down loudly when staff bumped into it. To make up for the fish, the server offered one complimentary dessert (a piece of cake). There were three of us, he brought out two different pieces of cake and then charged us for one on the bill when we had not requested any dessert at all. The overall cheap attitude of the staff was to add as much as possible to increase the bill. There were few diners on a Friday evening,. The place deserves to go under. Supposedly it has been open about 6 or 8 months and is the first US branch of a Moscow chain. The decor is colorful peasant kitch.
