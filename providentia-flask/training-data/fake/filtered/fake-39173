SPEND MORE ON STAFF AND LESS ON THE DECOR: A beautiful environment for what turned out to be a bunch disaster. 15 minutes for water, another 15 for drink order and 15 more to be delivered, than we got to place our meal order. At about the 45-50 minute mark the waitess came and said {not kidding) "they were short on help as everybody decided to request today (Sunday at brunch) off". OK -let me get this straight. You are a new restaruant in NYC's Times Square -open only a month -and you give most of your staff time off on a Sunday brunch? Are you kidding me? If they spent as much on management training and servers as they did the the over the top (compliment here) decor, this place might actually be a winner. But with only 10 tables filled and terrible service, probably not.
