This place was extremely packed Friday night and I knew it was going to be a good place when they didn't take reservations but people are willing to wait an hour plus! Staff was really nice and fun environment with great food my biggest let-down was my raspberry mojito. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes for our table but in the meantime waited at the bar had drinks and some yummy fries with gorgonzola cheese dip (who would have thought that gorgonzola is good for dipping!). I had butternut squash ravioli which was done incredibly and the rest of the table ordered various fish dished and all enjoyed. I wouldn't recommend this place for big places due to its size and wait time but for 2-6 people it is great! Enjoy :-)
