Came to New York looking for the famous New York Pizza that's bragged about. Went to Little Italy figuring that I would get a good pizza. it is Italian food, right? Well the pizza at----in Little Italy was simply that-pizza, very subpar. I figured oh well, NY pizza is nothing to brag about. Decided to give it one more try and went to Lomabardis on a Sunday night. No wait! We ordered a large pizza with Proscuitto and Onions (tho we wish we would have got meatballs since all toppings are $2, why not get the meat vs veggies). This pizza was the BOMB. It was so good. Fresh, fast, and delicious. The waiters made a few mistakes and kept bringing us pizzas that belonged to other tables and every pie looked good. I ate there about 5 hours ago and Im already wanting another piece. Worth the visit to Nolita even though I was staying in Brooklyn.
