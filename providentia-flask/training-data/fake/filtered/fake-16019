Pros: Good food, Good Service, Free Shot of Tasty Vodka just before you leave Cons: It took an extremely long time to bring everything out. The restaurant wasn't that crowded. The appetizers 2 small salads took about 30 min to bring out. The Soup parts took another 15-20 minute, then there was another 30-45 minute wait for the main course. The food quality was good, i'm just at a loss why it took so long, i ended up sitting there like 2.5 hours each time waiting for the next thing to come out.
