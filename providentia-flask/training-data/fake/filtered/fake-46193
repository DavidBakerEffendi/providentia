Great Ribs and sides. Looove the sides. Especially their beans! I think it's made with pulled pork; super yums. My only complaint is that their ribs are not very consistent. Sometimes its fall off the bone tender, and sometimes its tough as hell! It gets pretty busy so try to call ahead. If you're going as a party of 2, the Full Rack with 3 sides is a great deal. If you're not a pig like me, there should be even some left over for lunch.
