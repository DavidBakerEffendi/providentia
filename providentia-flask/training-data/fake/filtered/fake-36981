Me and my wife booked the Pizza Bus tour because of all of the great reviews here. Scott is awesome he is so enthusiastic and the fun. Now granted iv'e only been on one other pizza tour and that wasn't as good because i didn't feel like i got my money worth. and most of the attention was paid to a smaller group. The pizza bus alone will make you feel like a kid, it reminder you back to a time where you used to be on that yellow school bus swapping great stories and and meeting new people. We went to like 3 or 4 places. and all tasted amazing. If your looking for a grey food tour look not further.
