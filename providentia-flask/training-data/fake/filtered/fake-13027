Love love love this place. My husband and I went on a whim - we were in crowded Times Square and longed for Italian food and quiet! So I looked Il Corallo up on Yelp and we headed to SOHO. We did not wait at all (Saturday night, around 8:30 pm). Let me just say we were not disappointed or mislead by the Yelp reviewers. He had the Black Taglierini and I had Rigatoni Padani (tomato cream sauce). I have never had homemade rigatoni and am now ruined for all other pasta. They had a wonderful Barollo at a good price, too. All in all I would say the only disappointment is that we had no room for dessert! :) Can't wait to go back again.
