Not only did I love the food (avocado tacos!) and drinks (best margaritas you can get!) here, but the staff was amazingly friendly and welcoming. I don't know what happened to these other random reviewers, but not only did I get my order accurately and quickly, but it was also with wonderful customer service.  Unlike the other odd people I've read on here, I took the time to ASK the names of the people helping, so I know it was Rob and Eileen that made helped make my day great. Sorry, but I don't think Rob's efforts to help customers pay for their meals is in the least bit sketchy.  I plan to spend a lot more time here and will definitely recommend Gueros to all my friends.
