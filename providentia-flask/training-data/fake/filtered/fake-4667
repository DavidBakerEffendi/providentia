I like Jose Garces and many of his places, but this place is as overrated as it comes..Unless you are there for the bourbons and whiskeys (great list)..Food is average and the burger is not even remotely close to a "best burger" possiblity like people hype it..I actually prefer tinto next store and for the wait time to get squeezed into this tiny place, its just not worth it..I think if this place was owned by a guy who was not famous it would never be packed..
