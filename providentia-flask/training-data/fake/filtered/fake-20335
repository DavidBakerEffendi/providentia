The worst food ever. Do not waste your money here looking for quality Indian food. Â I ordered naan and once the food comes out I got little pieces of bread. I called th waitress over (who by the way wasnt Indian and knows nothing about the food) and she informs me that sukhadias apparently only gives frozen pita bread and that's te naan that they have. If I wanted to eat 99cent pita bread and pay 3 bucks for it. I could've done that in the comfort of my own home. The pakoras came out cold as if they just defrosted them and could even make them fresh. The palak paneer was so watered down with. 5 pieces of paneer. The chaat was the worst chaat I have even eaten. Everything was horrible. Do not go there
