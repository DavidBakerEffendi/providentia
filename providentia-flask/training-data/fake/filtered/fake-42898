It's too bad that some of the previous reviews were based on what this establishment used to be. Everything has changed. Â With the new owners, new menu, new decorum and new philosophy, I rate this restaurant an A+. The staff is friendly, the menu is great, the food is fresh, and the atmosphere is airy and comfortable. I have nothing bad to say about 983 and will continue to go back.
