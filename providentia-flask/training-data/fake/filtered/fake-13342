First, Kimchi Grill has combined two of my favorite things in a most wonderful way--tacos and kimchi--this is simply the best idea ever. Â Unfortunately, despite my attempts at self-restraint, they are also located within my delivery area. After a long day of work it is easy to fall into the warmth of my inviting couch with the ease of Seamless Web and a bottle of wine. And because Kimchi Grill is so delectable I regret nothing. I am moving full speed on the path to a happy, pudgy and slightly poor mortality and the Kimichi Fries are most certainly worth it. Furthermore, Kimchi Grill's staff is nothing but delightful and accommodating. They are often busy (so many people fighting to eat yummy kimchi and guacamole filled burritos) but Kimchi Grill's staff works hard to get out delicious, spicy, mouthwateringly good food as quickly as possible. They also offer wonderful service to their clients. Case in point, I (after a long day teaching the youth) came home cranky and hungry. Kimchi Grill worked hard to make me an awesome burrito and have it hand delivered to my lazy bum's front door. It was very good, however, in a moment of understandable kitchen rush there was no guacamole! I felt wronged, but mostly just cranky, and I forced my boyfriend to call. I think more than anything I simply wanted my voice heard, I really didn't need anything in return, yet Kimichi Grill insisted on sending out complimentary drinks, chips and guac. I felt like such a douche--but also so appreciated. Kimchi Grill is amazing for its food and its service and I am ecstatic that they deliver to me.
