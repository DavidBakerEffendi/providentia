The food is EXCELLENT!!!!  Unfortunately a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. I've read the other reviews and they are right, it takes about an hour for delivery. But I've gotten delivery from almost ever pizzeria in Clifton and I don't know why but noone in this town can deliver faster than an hour!!!  So considering their food is great and they deliver just as fast as everyone else(really slow) they get high marks.   Go for pickup and you'll be in love.
