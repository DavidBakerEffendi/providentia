I consider myself to be a regular at the Russell.. This scene is as good as it gets. I've been here for every night and has never been dissatisfied.  The food is great the drinks are great.   Nice bouncers, friendly owner.  It doesn't get any better.  My favorite nights are Monday when they have poetry and Saturday's.  It's never overly crowded and the music always hits the spot.  I cannot wait to revisit the Russell,,,I've desperately been looking for this kind of lounge out here in dc and has been disappointed. I miss the Russell
