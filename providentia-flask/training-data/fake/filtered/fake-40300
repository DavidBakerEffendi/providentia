My wife and I came down to Brooklyn to visit Brooklyn Museum and had Brunch at Cheryl's Global Soul afterwords. I had the most delicious pancakes I ever had. The pancakes were fluffy and moist, berries were fresh, portion size was perfect, it was just perfect and unforgettable. It will definitely be added to my "to die for" list. They had a little line to get in for Brunch but the server was very nice and checked on us a couple of times, and as soon as we sat down, the server came to take drink orders. (By the way, I recommend their Bloody Mary, hands down). Atmosphere was really laid back and lovely. I think we'll go back there for dinner. I've got my eyes on their Sake Glazed Salmon. Can anyone tell me about that dish?
