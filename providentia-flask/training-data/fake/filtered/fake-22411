THis place is terrible.  If I could give it zero stars I would.  I ate here after a doctor's appointment Saturday morning and ordered buscuits and gravy.  It was much too sweet.  My waiter rushed me out while I was in the middle of my coffeee, and the manager constantly yelled at the staff within my earshot. These people envision themselves as hipsters, but they're not.  They're simply characters dressed in plaid who run a poor restaurant.  Avoid, Queens Comfort,
