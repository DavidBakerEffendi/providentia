My first time at Tango Pizza was truly an amazing culinary experience!  The first thing I noticed was how clean and neat the Argentinian restaurant is.  They have an open view of the kitchen which I like because there is nothing to hide.  The dinning room was classy and inviting, but certainly not a black tie type of place.  I sat at a side table where I ordered the Fugazza Pizza, fried and baked empanadas, salad, and a glass of authentic Argentinian wine.  The food is prepared fresh to order, the empanadas were like no other, crispy flaky crust, with a tasty meat filling, not greasy or messy.  The pizza is made with the freshest of ingredients, the cheese is high quality, not like other pizza places that use the cheap cheese and grease pools in the center.  The pizza crust is light but tasty, I think its because its a yeast based dough.  The salad was enough for a family, again fresh tasty and they didn't skimp on the Kalamata olives. The family owned restaurant is a new favorite of mine with mouth watering authentic Argentinian dishes.  Service is quick and professional, this is a great place for a quick lunch or a dinner out with friends and family.  Overall it was an excellent experience, cant wait to go back.
