A five star family brunch spot, Rose Petals served me the best breakfast I have had since at least my wedding in 1996. I ate the specialty Rose Petal peanut waffle, which was served with ample whipped cream, freshly sliced strawberries, confectioner's sugar, and yes, edible rose petals! I had a business meeting, and the staff was pleasant but not invasive. The decor is earth tone, with roseate splashes of color. Even the slate in the bathroom was a rich milk chocolate brown. Tastefully-placed mirrors and pleasant architectural angles enhanced the ambience. An extra touch is the playroom for children. Restaurant staff told me that they bring in an extra staffer to facilitate play during Sunday brunch, a naturally busy time. This restaurant promises to become a destination point in Germantown/East Falls and the entire Northwest.
