I gave it five stars because of the following three things they do exceptionally well: Handmade Pasta Nino is a master. He makes it by hand in the front of the shop and often shows you the creations before sending it back to the kitchen. The flavors and textures are amazing and the quantities are just right. Friendly Service The brothers and Nino are very friendly and they greet me any my family whenever we walk in. You might occasionally come across a young server that just learning the trade, but I've never had an issue. Soups Try the homemade chicken noodle! It's a must for anyone suffering from a cold. The sausage and lentil is a favorite of mine as well. I've never been disappointed by anything I've gotten from Antimos.
