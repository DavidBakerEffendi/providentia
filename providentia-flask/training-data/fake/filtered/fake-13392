I have been coming here once or twice a week since school started at UVM. I'm often short on time in between classes, but the service is always prompt and courteous. I have dietary restrictions and the server is always very accommodating to my needs. Earlier this week I went in to get my usual egg white omelette since I can't eat egg yolks. Every time I order my omelette I hear someone in the kitchen moan and grunt about making my order. This time the cook made fun of my order and I could hear him since they have an open kitchen there. And to top it off once my omelette came out it looked like pile of poop and was buried in oil. The server told me they have to use more oil on egg whites so it doesn't stick to the pan. It looked more like a scramble than an omelette. The server was nice enough to give me 20% off and he looked embarrassed about the situation. As I was eating my pile of poop I noticed dried up egg matter or whatever it was stuck to the plate under my omelette. I've never had this Â issue before with my omelette. In short if the kitchen staff is going to make fun of peoples special needs and piss and moan about making my order they should take this option off the menu. They should also seal off the kitchen if the staff can't control their outbursts. I will find another establishment to get my quick fix who won't make fun of me. I feel bad for the servers there for having to polish over the kitchens unprofessionalism and amateur presentation. I tried to contact a manager this week, but the phone number listed didn't work. Maybe they went out of business already if this is the kind of food they have been serving lately. bl
