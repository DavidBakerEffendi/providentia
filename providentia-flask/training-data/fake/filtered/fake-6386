I have dined at sakura gardens a few times to get a good feel for it as I usually do before reviewing anything and my initial thoughts that stuck with me through my 4 visits have become true...absolutley unequivicobally FORGETTABLE. The sushi is bland and tasteless usually lukewarm when it comes out and a few times was straight rotten. The service was terrible the bartenders ignore you and the waitstaff take FOREVER the "martinis" are sugary and also forgettable. Save your money go to chikurin on main street their sushi is much better and their spicy mayo is actually that...spicy...the service is great and the pricing is fantastic. I never say this about restaurants but I hope sakura fails miserably and close soon so something actually decent can go in
