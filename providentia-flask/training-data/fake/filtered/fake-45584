I don't know about the bar or regular restaurant menu but....just got out of the mother's day brunch. I only have two good things to say, the price was right and the servers were working hard. The place was chaos. The layout crazy-disorganized. Everyone was smashing into each other. The food was mediocre at best. And who's idea was it to cut the bagels in eighths? The chocolate fountain was an unspeakable mess it turned my stomach. Some of the desserts were up on the bar and inaccessible. OK so I could go on but you get the point, I think it sucked and I felt bad for the moms. We went there many times when it was O'Connor's and we were always satisfied. Oh yes and I had to argue with a server because our table was smack in the middle of the main corridor to the buffet table so we moved it back a bit just so we didn't have to get plates on our heads. Yeesh it was awful.
