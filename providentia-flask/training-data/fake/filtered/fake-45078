Great pizza and pasta dishes.  Crummy, at times rude, service.  They make a lot of order mistakes but never apologize and don't seem to think you should be upset that you had to wait for things to be made right - kind of a "you get what you get" attitude.  Be especially careful on "to go" orders and have the person repeat your order back - at least then you have a 50/50 chance of it being right.  Even with these problems I find myself going back after a while because I haven't found anyplace else that makes such good pizza and sausage and peppers - but I definitely go there a lot less than I would if they improved their service and attitude!
