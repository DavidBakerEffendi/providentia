I ate here with four of my coworkers the other night and we all agreed the food was some of the worst we have ever had. I'll start off by saying that we had wonderful service and that our waiter belongs at a real restaurant. The meal started off with undercooked rolls that were impossibly hard on the outside and were basically just dough on the inside. There was some hope when we got the appetizers and all that was wrong was that they were on average way under-seasoned, but those hopes were soon dashed by the main course. The dinner was all around bad. Our dinnners are described next in hopes of preventing anyone from making the mistake of eating here. Scallops and risotto: better described as porridge. This was the best of the meals. Next was a pork rib covered in a sauce that was described as tangy, but turned out to be just sour (and tasted rotten). Another friend had cold, soggy fried cod. My last friend had half cooked ravioli where she had to carefully eat the cooked parts out as the rest was too hard to bite through. Last is my dish. I had a burger.  Everyone at the table agreed it was the worst of the meals. This confused me as messing up a burger is pretty difficult. They managed it by putting a layer of charcoal on everything, somehow procuring bacon that had the texture of jerky and no taste, and putting a swiss cheese on it that was so bad it was hard to swallow. The beef itself was also the driest and most flavorless (outside of the charcoal taste) piece of meat I had ever had. This was all served with bland separated mustard and sweet potato fries they seemed to forget to fry.   Please do yourself a favor and avoid this place. I'm not entirely convinced the chef has even tried what he's serving.
