I first discovered this place when I was bartending at a 3-star restaurant and found that the head chef would meet other top chefs from around the city there for very late night dinners.  (It's open until 4am, a big plus.) Though its old tile and plain windows make it look like a hole in the Chinatown wall, the food is amazing.  Try the duck and noodle soup.  Or just ask the waiter to make something around your favorite food (fish, veg, etc.).  It's all very, very good.
