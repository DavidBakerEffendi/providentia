I think this is the best round slice in the city.  That being said, go during off-peak hours on a weekday because the wait is pretty awful.  $5 a slice is also a hard sell, but I can only rationalize it because watching Di Fara make each pie by hand is kind of amazing - I'd suggest getting a whole pie for the best deal.
