The previous reviewers were right on target.  This is a gem in the heart of New Haven, CT.  We had a fabulous experience and our food was amazing.  You can't go wrong with the duck nachos or lettuce wraps.  The pan seared scallops were just out of this world.  My husband was not that enthralled with the cod & mussels; it was just ok.  We were all duly impressed.
