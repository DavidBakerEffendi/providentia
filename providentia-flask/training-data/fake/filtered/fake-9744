I'm sorry to say my meal wasn't very good. I ordered the swordfish on a bed of angel hair pasta with pesto sauce but, the entire meal was drowning in pesto sauce. It looked like they just dumped 3 cups of pesto on top of my meal. The fish was also a little under-cooked. I didn't go there for sushi. The appetizers we ordered were very good! I like the atmosphere and the friendly staff and sitting on the rooftop! Sadly our waiter  is not included in the friendly staff category he didn't really seem to like his job very much. When he asked how our meals were I told him ( in a very nice way) there is too much pesto sauce on my meal, he kind of shrugged & just looked at me for a bit  then asked if I wanted to return it. Of course we all know you don't ever send any meal back to the kitchen! Well, at least I don't.  I would go there again but I would only order the appetizers which are a meal in it's self.
