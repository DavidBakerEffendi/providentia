I've been going to this little basement spot for the last two years and the food has constantly been good. Of particular note is the bread, cooked daily. The owner, however, is not as amicable as one would expect for someone in the hospitality business. She is downright gruff, and very often, especially in the evening, rude. I've learned to avoid the evenings and I now go there only for lunch. Take my advice...
