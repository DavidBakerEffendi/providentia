This place is phenomenal. This place is addictive and now I know that they open til 3am at the weekends. I definitely will be back after few drinks wtih my buddies late nite instead of waiting for a long line and get bad service and food in some where else. I love their steam dumbing for sure they are the best in Chinatown (best of Philly 2000 no BS). Hot and sour soup was awesome. The entrees that I recommend will be claim in black bean sauce, soft shell crab, saute watercress (Chinese vegetable), lycee duck and their house special fried chicken. The service of the Waiter is unbeatable. Â He help us refill the water in no time without asking and change plates.SLK can't go wrong for a reasonable Chinese dinner. Don't expect to be super fancy but they are very good for casual dinner. Worth your bucks to try!
