I've never posted a review of any restaurants but after just eating the Blue Cheese Burger, I knew I had to.. I ordered the burger medium, it came out slightly pink and it came with free fries! It is probably the best blue cheese burger I've ever had. I devoured it so quickly! The place is new so I don't think a lot of people who get lunch around the area know about Graso Grill yet.. At 1pm on a Thursday, there wasn't a line!
