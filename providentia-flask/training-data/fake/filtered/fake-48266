French fries are my life. They are my life force. If I'm ever on death row, they will be part of my last meal, along with a Five Guys burger. So imagine my delight upon finally locating Pommes Frites in the East Village about seven blocks away from me. Â I was there twice a week. The guys there practically knew my order. Let me explain. Twice-fried Belgian fries, perfectly crisp and hot out of a paper cone. (Tip: if you get the fries to go, they fit another cone over the top of the first and shovel in some extra fries. Happiness.) Numerous dipping accoutrements. My personal favorites were the Vietnamese pineapple mayo (just the right amount of sweet to contrast with the salty fries) and the pomegranate teriyaki mayo, which had a bit of a tang. They also let you sample whatever sauces you like with a couple fresh-out-of-the-fryer frites, and are open until 3AM on Fridays & Saturdays! Perfect for when you're stumbling out of the club, though the line tends to curl around the block when it gets later. Make it out, folks. You won't regret it.
