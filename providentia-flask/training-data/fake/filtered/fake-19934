I've been to Edi & the Wolf three times over the last three months - before and after Sandy - and all three times, were consistently a great experience, even if they were a little different. Â Before the hurricane, they were in full motion - lively, incredible food, equally incredible wine list and the service was fantastic - approachable / friendly but seasoned. After Sandy (the day after they reopened), they had lost their wines, and their inventory, as well as their walk-ins, but they made us feel at home - and the food was just as good - even with an extremely limited menu. Get the mushroom spaetzle or you may regret it for the rest of your life.
