I'm on Yelp just for this kale salad. holy shit. I don't even want to try to make this myself at home because I'll mess it up. Cheese and pine nuts and the way they cut the kale it's like these perfect ribbons of a food I usually just put into a juicer. Perfect. Service was great, our server was a down to earth, very Brooklyn lady who was smart, funny and invested in the menu and what we were having. Steak tartare-excellent, flavorful-, good cocktails and a an upscale vibe that doesn't quite match the down- homeness of service and music, but that's a really good thing.
