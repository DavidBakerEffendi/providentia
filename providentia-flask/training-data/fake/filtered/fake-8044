Just has a business lunch there and it was a great experience . The waiter ( will a, per the receipt) did not rush us and kept the food coming, we lingered after out meal and I did not feel like they were trying to get us out for another seating.  The croque madame was really good and very filling.  I have been coming to the odeon for years and it has always been a good experience for both a casual meal and more formal business meeting.
