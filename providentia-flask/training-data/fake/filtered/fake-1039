I really love this place. I've been back more than a few times now. They were definitely still figuring out some of their service routines, in terms of how things should flow, but nothing to hold against them as their prices for pizza and the like are very reasonable. Also, in a few of the times where things got a little confused, the staff was nothing but gracious and pleasant. It's family run! Stromboli with peppers and sausage are highly recommended or their Sicilian style pizza. Also for $5.95 you get a fresh, healthy, veggie filled salad. Not many places in Princeton can you find that. Panera just doesn't cut it anymore and non of the other pizza places serve a decent salad, a few leaves of ice berg lettuce and a cherry tomato is NOT a salad.
