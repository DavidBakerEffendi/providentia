3 words. Bang for buck. I don't think you can find another cheaper yet better tasting set of 4 dumplings elsewhere in pricy Manhattan. So far, the chive/leek dumplings are heavenly - charred perfectly from the outside and the meat has been cooked to perfection. It's taking a bite out of the Chinese countryside. I've also had the zha jiang mian, and for $3 it's quite good. a bit too salty, but still has all the fundamental components that makes it a good zha jiang mian dish. so if you dont mind a crowded seating area with a long ish waiting line for some awesome chinese food, this is the place to be.
