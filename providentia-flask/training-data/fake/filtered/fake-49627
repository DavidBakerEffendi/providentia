This place should really be called "Snack." I came here one evening, on an empty stomach. Which was my first mistake. Then I saw the name of the restaurant titled "Feast." I thought "Feast." Wow. How wonderful it is that of all the places I could stumble upon, I found a restaurant with a fulfilling name like that. Surely that would cure my hunger. But after eating the worlds smallest piece of below average tasting, $24 lasagna, my hunger would remain. So we complained about the portion size to the waitress (who was very kind). She reported it to the manager, who did nothing and said nothing. So overall I'd give this .5 stars if that were possible. And I'd also change the name of this restaurant to "Snack." Afterwards we went down the block for some pizza. Positives: The waitress was nice. The interior of "Feast" looks like it should be good. Negatives: Extremely small portions. Overpriced for the size and taste of food.
