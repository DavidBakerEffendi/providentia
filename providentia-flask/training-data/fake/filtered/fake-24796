This great restaurant is #1 for Princeton on tripadvisor. I can see why. Food is simply excellent. Best Italian I've had in the states - manhattan included. It's in a strip mall but inside your relatively transported into an Italian villa type setting. Service exceptional - smart waitstaff that genuinely wanted you to feel comfortable. We're vegetarian and they could modify to order. The Cannoli was better than in the city also. Ignore the neg review on yelp not sure if this guy knew the place as they serve no pizza. The owner makes rounding the tables a point an he's a great conversationalist.  If I had to pick a weak spot it would be the bread  - sort of simplistic for the phenomenal items after it. Seriously though I've been to Italian in NYC, Hoboken throughout jersey and this place is amazing.
