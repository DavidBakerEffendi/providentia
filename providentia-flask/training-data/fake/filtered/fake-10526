I got the penne vodka and it's very bland and flavorless. The peas in it tasted dry like the frozen kind The eggplant rollatini appetizer is quite disappointing as well. The eggplant is so thin it's almost nonexistant between the layers of eggwash, however the stuffing was good with the spinach and ricotta, just not great. I would not go back here ever for the hot entrees.
