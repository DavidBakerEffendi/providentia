I'm shocked to see so many good reviews - I though this place was truly awful. Very noisy, and the d√©cor is more institutional than industrial, although the zinc bar top is beautiful. I had the Carrot soup as an appetizer, and it was absolutely tasteless. I then had the mushroom flatbread - the egg on it was revoltingly undercooked and the mushrooms were tough as leather. Dessert? No thanks - get me out of here and I will never go back.
