When I entered the shop the inner was eye-catching. But the problem of this place is with the service. There are no clear lines for ordering and paying and customers are just randomly scattered in the shop waiting to get served. So when you think it's your turn to order, they ring up the person who is sitting at a table already eating their food. Oh, yeah--the food. It's decent, certainly not superb or inspiring in any way, but okay. Everything is pretty much pre-made. But the food that's just sitting there and served reheated upon request.
