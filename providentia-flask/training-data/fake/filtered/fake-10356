i have to say i was a little bit disappointed when i entered the cafe steinhof. although i felt pretty cosy next to the "stiegl bier" sign (i am from salzburg where stiegl bier comes from), the atmosphere in general was very "cold". the wiener schnitzel was very, very good though, that's why cafe steinhof gehts 2 stars from me. i didn't have time yet to check out the gulasch-night on monday, maybe it's worth a try?
