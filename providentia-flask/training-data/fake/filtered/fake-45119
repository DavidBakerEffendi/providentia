Trios is my go-to pizza place, and I feel really fortunate to have such a great option in the neighborhood. It's a definitely step up from your average pizza shop. My favorite is the Villa's, but I also really enjoy the Invernale, which is like white pizza with a fresh arugula salad on top. Both the round and square options are delicious, with great thin crusts. I've also had some panini and appetizers, all of which were solid. The fried mozzarella stood out, as it was discs of fresh cheese breaded in house and not prefab mozzarella sticks. Trios consistently beats their own delivery estimates, telling me 40 minutes and arriving in 20-25 (I live about 4 blocks away). When dining in, I've always found the service to be friendly and helpful.
