I've lived down the block from Angelo's Pizza my entire life and until fairly recently, I was quite a regular customer. Up until about 2005, Angelo's was owned and operated by an Italian man named Angelo (and his son who moved to back to Italy in the late 90s) and the establishment represented everything great about a Brooklyn style pizzeria. The slices were large, the sauce was great... he made a very good pizza albeit being the dirtiest man alive. If you didn't mind him coughing on your pizza from time to time, then you were in for a good slice any day of the week. Around 2005, Angelo went back to Italy and the place went to a new buyer. He has a large staff of about seven people and new faces come and go constantly. Because there is a new cook regularly, the pizza always changes and since 2005, it's only been getting worse tasting and more expensive. Not to mention that some of the staff is intolerable. There is one man of Spanish background who is very nice and makes a good pizza, then there is an Italian guy with a really thick accent and your inability to understanding him only comes second to his inability to understanding you... never bet on him getting your order correct. That said... why go here? I go here because I'm in walking distance and when I'm really lazy, I might stop in. However, if you have to get in a car, anyway... you're better off going to Villa Borghese, Villa Gennaro's, or Godfather's Pizza which are all pretty close to this place.
