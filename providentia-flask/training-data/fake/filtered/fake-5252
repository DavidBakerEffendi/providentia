As much as I was willing to pay for their over-priced juices, these are some of the rudest, most anti-social people around. Needless to say, the customer service is really lacking here. I've walked in there several times and always get rubbed the wrong way by one of the staff members. Either they don't acknowledge you right away when you walk in or they don't say thank you when you leave them a tip. No, thanks. Let me skip the rudeness, save my money, and use my VitaMix instead.
