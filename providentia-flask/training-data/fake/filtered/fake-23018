Visited at lunch to check it out - they are planning another like this in my town, Hillsborough.  Walking in I was surprised to see a "seat yourself" sign, then waited about 5 minutes for anyone to come over.  Only two other tables had people in the dining room - and one person looked like he just needed a place to sit while planning his bets.  The menu (I looked at both lunch and dinner versions) is a little limited and overpriced.  Ordered the somewhat expensive "Filly" cheese steak sandwich, which was good but not worth $13.  Honestly, this is a betting parlor that has a kitchen and some tables - maybe they needed that to get the location approved by the town? I can't think of why I would go back.  And if this is what the Hillsborough location ends up being, they are going to have a tough ride, and I know I won't become a regular.
