This was THE WORST restaurant I have ever been to... The girls at the front are BEYOND RUDE... After waiting an hour and a half, they say Oops I forgot about your party... and then when we say something to the manager it turns into .. Oh no we called your party and no one answered... Its going to be another hour... I almost feel as though its reverse discrimination when I walk into this place... STAY AWAY...
