Not only is the food here delectably fresh and flavorful, but the service is wonderful, too.  I celebrated my college graduation with a lunch of delicately roasted lemon accented asparagus with parmesan and cripsy, rich mac and cheese.  My brothers ate incredible veggie bibimbap and a wholesome, wholewheat vegetable pot pie.  The staff graciously congratulated me with some wonderful pairing of a rhubarb tart and aromatic ice cream.  One of the best meals I've had, and I appreciate its farm-to-table foundation.
