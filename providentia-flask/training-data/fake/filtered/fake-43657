This place needs some work. Quite generic in everything they offer, but then again, prices are low. I may have ordered the wrong things. Don't eat grilled chicken here... it will be very... very dry. You'd probably safe with hummus or other simple things. I was disappointed but it's clearly a very popular spot. I imagine nothing is truly made from scratch.
