Went here because my friend was craving shepherd's pie-- turns out they don't always have that on the menu-- and stayed despite no chance of satisfying the craving.  My friend had done very little research (probably just googled "shepherd's pie nyc") and the prices were higher than he expected, but we decided to just go for it... and oh my gosh I'm so glad we did! We split the scotch egg to start, which was good but nothing to write home about.  Other than that, everything was amazing!  I had the Beef Wellington (one of my favorites and something I don't get to have often) and, while I've had better, it was really delicious.  The beef was very tender, and the potatoes on the side were nice and crisp and actually came out hot, which so many restaurants seem to struggle with.  Yummy as this was, though, I have to admit I was a little bit  jealous of my friend's pork chop... literally the BEST pork chop I have ever eaten.  I don't know how they managed to make it so juicy and flavorful... there just are not enough good things to say about it.  I mean... I just can't even.  AMAZING. Oh, and I almost forgot about this because the pork chop just stole the show, but my friend and I tried 5 different cocktails and all of them were delicious.  I am not a scotch drinker, but my favorite was the scotch highlands... perfection in a glass.  Dessert was also yummy, service was great, and the decor was so cozy on a freezing night.  Go there.
