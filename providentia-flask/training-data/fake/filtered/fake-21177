What the heck happened to Cooperage recently? I live right around the corner from this place and have been coming since it opened. Food was always awesome and the service was top notch (Anthony is the man). I don't know if there has been a management change or what, but it has gone sharply downhill in the last 2-3 months. Menu has completely changed and is awful. Waitstaff has all turned over and is not good. In the past I would have recommended to anyone, but now you're probably better off staying away (I know I will be)
