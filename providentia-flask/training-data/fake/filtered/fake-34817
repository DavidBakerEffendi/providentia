Been here a few times and let me tell ya, The food is good. It is pricey in terms of bar food, although its a bit more higher quality. The service for eating wasn't too bad. Not sure what an average wait time for food is cause I'm usually conversing at the table, However the wait at the bar was quite long and out of control. I Don't know if it was because I'm small (5'5") or because I wasn't dressed in tight jeans such as the other patrons, Needless to say I was parched between lengthy waits for beverages. The one tender (bald dude with glasses) Kept giving us dirty looks as we ordered. Overall I'd go back. The food was good and the beers are good. They had some good selections. Â Tough to give it 4 stars, since there isn't a half i can snug in there. I wasn't a huge fan, but it was better than A-OK.
