This bar has been the perfect addition to the neighborhood and a nice contrast to the Murray Hill 3rd avenue bars. Great atmosphere, great food, and great staff. Nicole is one of the best bartenders out there and always makes me and friends feel very welcome. The menu is amazing too and is a major step up from typical bar/pub fare. Â I feel right at home here!
