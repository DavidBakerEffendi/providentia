It was a horrible experience. My brother has a nut allergy and they fry everything in almond oil which is very inconvenient. Even so, my brother told 3 different wait staff about the allergy and it was if they were deaf. Having ordered a burger even after telling them of his allergy they brought him fries along with it. They brought him a new burger and the manager came over to apologize but when my mom told him that our waiters neglect could possibly hurt someone with a severe allergy, the manager just brushed it off. So rude. Needless to say we will never be going there again. Food wasn't even anything special to have gone through all of that for.
