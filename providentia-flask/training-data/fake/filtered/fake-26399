My sister and grandmother happened to be in Philly and wanted to have dinner. I had read great reviews of Village Whiskey. We decided to go early around 530 because they had to drive back to Jersey. Upon we were greeted and told it would be a 30 minute wait. No worries we can have a drink and catch up. While the bar is fantastic, the space is crazy small. We did find a small section to stand in and kept having to move as food came out of the kitchen. I ordered the Old Fashioned and my sister got a glass of wine. Hands down the best Old Fashioned I have ever had. I tried to replicate it multiple times with no success. We got seated after about a 20 minute wait time, so props for exceeding expectations. Our server was a very nice young man. We ordered right away. I ordered the Village Burger, my sister got the Lobster Mac and grandma gor the Pork Sammy. We decided to share an order of the Duck Fat Fries. Average ticket time. Food is out and delivered. I cut into this amazing looking burger and it is cooked to a perfect Medium Well. I pick it up and bite in to an amazing burger. Its euphoric. The fireworks are exploding in my head. Moist, juicy and the beef speaks for itself. I had a bite of the other two entrees on the table. The Lobster Mac was creamy and delicious. The Pork Sammy was tender and smoked to perfection. The fries are a story all their own. So unbelievably good. I dream about them. At the end of the meal we were all completely full. A great meal with great company. All and all successful. I will be back to this fine establishment. If you want a great burger and a great experience, go to Village Whiskey. It doesn''t disappoint!!
