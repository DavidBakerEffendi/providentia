the salad bar is always fresh and a value for the price, slow cooked prime rib is the best i've had in a long time, microbrews on tap rotate frequently and vary often, their Guiness is a great pull and the bartenders are always ready with a joke and a smile. great family owned local business with a range of clientele, always find someone at the bar to chat with
