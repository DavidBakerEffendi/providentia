I wanted to try something a little different and to be honest the ambiance is what caught my attention.  It's a really hip place in center city Philly but Absolutely Nothing like China Town.  The drinks were Awesome and the Food was Off the Charts!!!  The Ahi tuna dumplings were Scrumptious. They also have a Whole fried Snapper that was IN - FRICKIN - CREDIBLE!!!! If you are ever in Center City you are short changing yourself if you don't go.  You will NOT be Disappointed.
