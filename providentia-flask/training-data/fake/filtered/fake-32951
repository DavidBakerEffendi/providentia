I went to G Lees with a friend and we both agreed that the BBQ is first rate. I  ordered  the dry rub BBQ which was moist and tender - quite enjoyabe to the palate. The greens and Mac and Cheese are also hits. Another exceptional quality is the customer service. This is definately an ideal place to dine. S.B.
