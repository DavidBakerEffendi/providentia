As a longtime troll on yelp I finally felt the need to share a perfect dining experience.  I love the food at Recette so I wanted to see what was going on at the Gander.  I was amazed by the friendly welcome at the front door, the delicious food and drinks and fell in love with my charming, quirky and informative server Kimberly.  Kimberly helped guide us through the menu and took the time to listen to my friend's allergies and put her at ease.  She found us cocktails for our preferences (a peach smash and some sort of egg gin drink) and perfectly paired wine for each of our courses too.  The tots are a must have, as is the chicken liver mousse and trout tartare.  I loved my spaghetti and clams, the duck and branzino.  The sorbets were really original, especially the curry chocolate, and she told us that the pastry chef Christina (also from Recette) makes them in house.  Kimberly charmed us as well as those around us, since I overheard a woman next to me talking to her grandmother about how much they loved her and stated that dining here was better food and service than Per Se!  The only negative I have would be that the restaurant felt a little warm and Kimberly was incredibly busy so it took her a few minutes for her to run our credit cards.  I will be coming back with my parents when they are in town in a few weeks.  They truly understand the importance of not just food, but hospitality here.
