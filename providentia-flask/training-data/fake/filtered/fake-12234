I just moved to town and stumbled across this place while I was out getting to know the area.  Turns out, the only good thing about this place is the strength of the drinks- and I think its needed to distract from the blan taste of the food.   I was there Thursday evening and the few waitresses on staff seemed to treat their shift as more of a social gathering which lead to slower service.  It took me 15 minutes to get my first drink and when I asked my waitress what was going on and if I needed to order something else, she seemed annoyed and said the bar was backed up and I would get it as soon as it hit the counter.  She then proceeded to go back to the conversation I so rudely interrupted her from, and when she finally brought my drink she just dropped it off and walked away without asking if there was anything else I needed.  With that being said I only had that one drink the whole hour and half I was there. I ordered a grilled chicken burrito and the meat was dry making it less then desirable to continue eating, and furthermore I am used to meals such as this coming with sides and when a lone burrito was placed infront of me, my disapointment continued.   All I can say is I'm glad I had this experience on my first run in- now I won't waste my there time anymore.
