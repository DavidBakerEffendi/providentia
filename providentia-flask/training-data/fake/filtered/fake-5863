Dirty Martini with blue cheese olives!! Just PURE heaven! A MUST TRY FOR MARTINI LOVERS!!! Love this place for many reasons.... First being of course the drinks, Drama free, great music, good food, nice loungy decor, mature age group (21-35). It's perfect for a date night or a night out with a group of friends. We have been there often enough to know that we have yet to go there often!!
