The service was terrible, even though we called ahead, we still had to wait an hour for our table upon arriving,  the food was bland at best, totally lacking any flavor. I ordered the combo number 1, one tamale, two enchiladas, and one taco, the tamale was just bread and chicken no sauce all dried up, I only got one enchilada but it was bearable, and the taco came with meat, lettuce, and cheese, no sauce.  I've never been to a "Mexican" restaurant where your plate did not come with salsa, sourcream etc.. The salsa in the salsa bar tasted like it came from a jar, none of them were any good, except maybe the spicy ranch, and the containers to hold it were so small you couldn't dip your chips in it.  The margaritas were terrible, when mine was served the waitress spilled half of it on the table, served with no lime, and she never came back and brought any napkins to clean it up. So if you would like a dissapointing place to eat, with bad service and bad food this it!
