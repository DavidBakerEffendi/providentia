Delicious food. Vada pav was spicy and good. Cheese dosa was nice and crispy. We also tried the chat samosa and chole batura. The chole batura was the best. It was made fresh and comes with two batura. The samosas was Â delicious but small and the chole and yogurt overwhelmed the dish. The place is very clean and the service extremely friendly.
