The pizza is good but it's really overrated in comparison to all of the hype.  The service is fine also but the most shocking thing of all is how dirty the restaurant is.  I'm amazed it has been able to pass a health inspection.  I am very tolerant when it comes to cleanliness but this is really a whole new level.
