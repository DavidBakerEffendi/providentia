I hesitate to write this review only to the extent that Friday night pizza is still a secret.  As recent transplant to the area, a friend had the good graces to recommend I take my wife and 3.5 year-old here last Friday night.  It was incredible.  The ultra-casual vibe in the converted garage with family-style long tables was dripping with unpretentious wholesomeness for which we moved from Chicago.  The pizza was fantastic.  I must have tried a dozen different kinds and loved every one, in no small part because, despite the fact that they get very creative with the toppings (pulled pork from Fatty's and caramelized onion!) the crust is both chewy and crusty--satisfying to even this New York pizza snob.  Having a decent beer on tap was also a great touch.  If you want a more sophisticated place, go someplace else, and don't ruin this place for those of us who appreciate it for what it is.
