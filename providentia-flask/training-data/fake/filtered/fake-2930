Nothing special, I definitely don't see what the big deal is about this place, it's WAY too crowded for such a small place you're basically on top of each other and that's not appealing to me. The service sucked and we had 4 different waiters come to the table, all with bad attitudes. The food was okay once again nothing special. Won't be going here again if it's up to me!
