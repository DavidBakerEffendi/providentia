Dan Box back on this Yizelp and I'm talking brrrrrunch! Just went back to El Rey this weekend for the ole breakfast/lunch combo! And I read another recent review that was railing on the pancakes...I could not disagree more!!! The pancake dish was awesome!  I split it with my galpal, Ann Box.  Loved the flavor and sweetness. We also got papas bravas, which make home fries look like homeless fries. Chalupas al pastor are my favorite thing on this side of the equator. They are not just flavorful and delish but they will blow your mind. If you aren't rocking out brunch at El Rey, you're a sucker and I feel bad for you and the people you make decisions for! Go now! Props to my server Malik who was real nice, fun and easy on the eyes ;-). And the manager, Marjorie stopped by the table to make sure we were loving life and she left a great impression.  Boo yah Dan box out!
