I came here this past weekend for a birthday party, and had a GREAT time. We came a little early so we could eat before the real party got started, and it was a-mazing. I was with a larger group, which I thought would have been a problem, but we got seated without much of a wait. We had a few plates to share before our meal (dry rub riblets, bbq sliders, wings) and the table fell silent as everyone devoured every bite. I had a burger (swiss and mushroom) cooked to a perfect medium rare, while the rest of the table enjoyed a smorgasbord board of bbq items (think ribs, chicken, fish tacos - what? yes, fish tacos, believe it). The party continued for quite a bit, and the birthday party go-ers all had an awesome time- but the review got bumped from a 4 to a 5 star for the service. We never felt rushed, always had exactly what we needed, and our server offered to call us a cab at the end of the night. Doesn't happen in Philly everyday... If you're in the area check it out for sure!
