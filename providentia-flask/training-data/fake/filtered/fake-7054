The words salads and pizza hardly do justice to the offerings at this newest addition to the Burlington food scene.  I have sampled both the Arugula rocket salad (the combination of peppery greens, pine nuts and fennel with a light dressing) is so stimulating and the beet salad, which takes beets to a whole new level.  The pizza crust is incredibly light, crunchy and the salt gives it a subtle sweetness which I love.  A great place to linger (fun, friendly bar with great signature cocktails) or if you are in a rush, for a quick, healthy nosh.
