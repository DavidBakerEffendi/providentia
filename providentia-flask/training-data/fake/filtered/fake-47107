Not knowing what to expect from Crisp, I definitely ended up getting what they promise: Ultra Fresh ingredients and lots of flavor! The store is modern and the music they play is great. In addition, the handbag sandwiches are so creative and easy to eat. Even with a line, the wait and service are swift and the employees are a delight!! Crisp is definitely a must have!!
