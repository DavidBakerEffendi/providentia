Went last night and the food was actually very good and the atmosphere was very nice. Why I give it only one star: If you have a good allergy/intolerance, be careful before ordering.  I need to eat gluten free and the waitress told me the tacos were NOT but the enchiladas WERE gluten free, and as I experienced symptoms of "glutening" this morning, I decided to call up the restaurant for a second opinion.  This time they told me the enchiladas were NOT gluten free. Burger and Barrel, you need to take these things seriously...make sure your staff and chefs know what allergies are out there and what's in your food!!!
