Yes, we decided a while back that even though the wait was ridiculously long and the service erratic and sometimes unfriendly, the fun atmosphere of Cuban Pete's was worth dining there once or twice a year.  NEVER AGAIN!!! Last night, we were treated quite rudely by the hostess who interrupted us, rolled her eyes at us and talked down to us as if we were children rather than grown adults who were just trying to coordinate a party of 14 for a birthday celebration.  When the owner came by the front desk, we explained how inappropriately we had been treated and do you know what he did?  He kicked us out!  He said we were not nice for complaining and he didn't want to serve us!!!! What??  You're not allowed to tell the owner you haven't been treated well?  And not only does he not make amends for the poor treatment, he says:  "I don't want you in here.  I don't want to serve you?! " I'm still in shock!!!!  DON'T GO HERE.  They're icky.   GO TO GREEK TAVERNA.  We did.  We had delicious food, wonderful service and get this ... they treated us courteously.  It turned out to be a great bday party after all.
