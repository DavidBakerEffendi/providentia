I have Never been treated so badly in a restaurant in my life. The hostess was a nasty little Japanese girl. She was unpleasant and did not have any other words in her vocabulary besides "NO!" Julie the owner seems to forget, she is no longer the only Rodeo in town in a practically deserted plaza. By no means is she turning over her tables 5 times a night like she used to! Â She needs to bring the Geisha Girls back instead of the Japanese hood she has working the front desk and tables. While she is at it, she should clean her filthy windows, and floors...the place has a foul odor....and the rolls are not what they used to be.....TASTELESS! They never offered us a glass of water or asked if we would like a dessert. Really? The board of health needs to inspect. The ladies room was filthy with papers on the floor. I give it a year and bye bye!
