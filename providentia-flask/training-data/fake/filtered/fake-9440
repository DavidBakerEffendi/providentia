Boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner, and I still am thinking about this meal days later. The filet mignon was perfect, and the rissoto blanco was quite simply one of the best things I've ever tasted. Rissoto with truffle oil and an egg on top, where you can pop the yolk and spread it all over the place? Count me in again, and again . . . A little pricey, but if you go on a special occasion, totally worth it!
