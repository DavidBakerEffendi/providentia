Nice place.  Took my parents there with my husband and everyone found something they liked.  My fav was the kimchi burger--as mentioned in other posts it's an tasty, innovative way to serve a burger.  The cheese board was awesome--nice selections.  And my IPA was fantastic, a great rec from the server. The scallops dish wasn't my fav--kind of standard and served with cheese grits that aren't really great.  But I have really high standards  on grits:)
