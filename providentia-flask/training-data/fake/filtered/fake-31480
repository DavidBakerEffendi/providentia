My girlfriend and I go here often and the food is always great. It's such a quick and healthy meal. The sauces are amazing and it's great because you can mix together all the vegetable that you want. The miso soup is a great addition. Also the employees are awesome, they're really polite and always fun to talk to. This is definitely in my top three places of where to grab a tasty healthy lunch or dinner. The prices are good too. I'll miss it when I go back to school!!!!
