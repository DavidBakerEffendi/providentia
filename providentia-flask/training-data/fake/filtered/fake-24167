I came here last Friday for valentines day with my wife and kids for some ice cream and had a excellent, sweet heart waitress. I believe her name was Christie? She was excellent in serving us and was very friendly in talking to us.She has a great memory and memorized four of our ice cream orders without writing it down.Okay Â food and service good job! Try the gram-cracker ice cream
