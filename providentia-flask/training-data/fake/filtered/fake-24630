Mannnnn you have to wait so long, the service isn't exactly friendly (but certainly efficient), and you will often sit with strangers to enjoy your meal. But damn, you will really enjoy your meal. The food here is AWESOME, and I don't use caps very often but I will for Joe's Shanghai because the soup dumplings and the Shanghai noodles are so good it's stupid. I'll be honest, the staff kind of treats you like crap but you will go back regardless because the food is delicious and you won't find soup dumplings like this anywhere else. There's a reason why the line spills out the door and onto the street. The food is AWESOME.
