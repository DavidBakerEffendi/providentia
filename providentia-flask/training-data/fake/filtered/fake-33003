I love Saint Mazie.  I am there all the time.  But I didn't realize how much I loved it until Wednesday night.  I usually like to dance at Saint Mazie, but Wednesday night I was just down for a cool, chill vibe night.  Ya know?  So the bar had these two guitarists, just being cool and chill, and they were chilly jammin.  I was really getting into my vibe there, just chillen, when this bag of retards walks in.  4 girls.  I'm like "whatever man, its fine, just do your thing over here, they wont bother you."  I say that to myself.  Well guess what? These girls start yappin it up, clapping, having a good time, and just generally ruining my chill night.  Well just as I start thinking to myself how NOT chill this place is now, the owner finally walks over and tells these chics to chill or leave.  Thank goodness.   Long story short, I was able to enjoy the rest of my night, without having any stupid clapping, singing, dancing, or "having fun" ruining my cool out, chill time evening. Thanks SM!  You can count on me being there every Thursday!  Chillen.  By myself.
