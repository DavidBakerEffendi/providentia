My first time here on Monday nite 12-28-09 I attended with my Fiancee and Parents... Heard about this place through friends, we got there at 11pm, there was a few people there. But we got seated right away. To Start the French Waitress was really nice with my Parents and myself, she gets 5 stars. She was very patient with us, Specially with mom and dad LOL. We ordered 2 Appetisers the Corn and and the Fajitas which were to die for. After that for dinner we ordered the Pork, which was excellent, my fiancee order the Shrimp she loved it, and mom and dad ordered the Pollo Campero, they loved it... the Flan for dessert was to die for. Â ( WE order 1 coconut and 1 caramel flan, they were both good. as for the Drinks the Mojitos were OK. I will see next time. The Only downfall, is that my fiancee wanted a Steak Sandwich, and they said they could not make it, I believe if they have bread and steak WHY NOT make it, but I guess those are the Rules, if they would had made her the Steak I would had given this place a 5, but for now a 4. OK my final review. 1. Parking is Perfect right outside for free... 2. Friendliness Perfect. 3. Will I come back , YES I WILL. in the next 3 weeks. Why I my coming back well, because I love the atmosphere and the food was really good. Johanner
