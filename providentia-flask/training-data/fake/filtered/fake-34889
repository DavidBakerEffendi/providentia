I was skeptical about this pizza restaurant having a good cheesesteak but after several recommendations from the locals, we gave it a try.  We weren't disappointed.  The cheesesteak was great . . . good quality meat and perfectly baked, yummy bread.  The fries were good too.  The staff (family owned and family run) were so nice too.  Great place to stop in for lunch.  Didn't try any pizza or pasta but saw SEVERAL customers getting these items and they looked delicious.
