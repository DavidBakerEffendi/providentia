My husband and I have eaten at the Nutley steak house, always a good time and good food.  Could not wait for the Fairfield location to open as it is closer to our house. We went in, waited 10 minutes for a table, hostess running around like they have nothing to do, there are open tables everywhere.  We were finally seated in the bar area at a table.  The waitress finally shows up after 10 minutes.  I order a Coors Light Draft, my husband orders a Michelob Ultra.  The menu says they have Michelob Ultra bottles, the waitress tells us they only have it on draft, so my husband says ok bring me the draft.  It takes 10 minutes to get the beer and remember the bar and restaurant are pretty empty.  The waitress finally delivers the beers but could not remember who got which, minor mistake but considering we are her only table uncalled for. We decided not to be to complicated and we just ordered 2 burgers, mine a bacon cheeseburger medium and my husband a Mozzeralla cheeseburger medium.  The food shows up and my burger is overcooked and over salty.  My husbands shows up with cheddar cheese instead of mozzerella.  He mentions it to the runner and the runner takes it right back saying he will fix it.  The waitress sees me with mine but not his and asks what happened, my husband explains and she says she will take care of it.  The burger comes back and my husband notices a little yellow cheese and thinks they just scraped it off and added the mozzerella, but to his surprise and shock all they did was add the mozzerella on top of the cheddar.  We have never seen this before and hope to never see it again.  At this point, he just eats it cause he know it is a useless cause.  The kitchen staff has no clue what they are doing. We have not been back since and don't plan to go back to the Fairfield location - what a shame, they should totally not have the same name.  We will be driving the longer distance to Nutley - RIP Franklin Steakhouse Fairfield!
