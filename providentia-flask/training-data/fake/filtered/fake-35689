Slow service, poor food. I guess when you walk into an empty restaurant, that should be your first sign to leave. I ordered the Oaxaca Enchiladas, which consisted of a few steamed vegetables and no flavor.  My friend ordered the black bean soup which she thought was "ok" and some cheese quesadillas...  nothing to write home about.  The rice and bean sides may as well have come out of a can.  Everything was overpriced. The bathroom appeared to be clean, but really in need of some updating.  There was no hot water in the sink. Needless to say, I will not be returning.
