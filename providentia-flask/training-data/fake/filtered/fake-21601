We had a terrific night here. Went with another couple--ordered some excellent salads and good cornbread to start. For main courses two of us got the Jambalaya (great); one burger (very good); and fried chicken (also very good). Beer was top notch; service was friendly and efficient; atmosphere was comfortable and laid back. We left before the music started, but we'll definitely go back. I say if you're wavering about trying it, go ahead and do. Easily beats any place we've been to (for comfort food) in Maplewood, South Orange, or Montclair. Update on 1/1/13: Went here two times more for dinner and was less impressed with each successive visit. Service seems increasingly disorganized. Food is less consistent and we recently ordered inedible salads. Entrees are still ok, but not sure we'll be going back for dinner. Bar and band scene remains fun, though -- and still a nice choice of beers.
