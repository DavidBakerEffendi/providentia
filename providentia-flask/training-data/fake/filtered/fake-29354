Man, I just love Mamoun's Falafel! Beats any other falafel restaurant in NYC, hands down! The prices are great, so I always stop by for lunch in between classes. I wish they were located in a larger store...but who Â really minds when Washington Sq Park is just a few minutes away? The falafel is fantastic, enough said!
