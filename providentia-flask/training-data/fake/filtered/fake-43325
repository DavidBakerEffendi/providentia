My husband and I were looking for a new place to try.  I read all the great reviews for this place that everyone else wrote so decided to try it.  The place did not look as nice as it does in the pictures.  we ordered the chicken samosas for appetizer.  My husband and I were very disappointed with what we were served.  The samosas were not fresh and the filling looked burned and did not have any flavor.  They were nice enough to replace our plates with new ones and the one they gave my husband was dirty.  The main course wasn't any better as well.  We ordered the special biryani which didn't taste anything like biryani and was over flavored and had a strange after taste.  The chicken was dry and didn't look fresh as well in the biryani.  The only thing that tasted fresh and good was the naan.  We got the garlic chicken which was half decent.  The food is not worth the price you pay.  I would never go back to this place and would never recommend it to any one else.
