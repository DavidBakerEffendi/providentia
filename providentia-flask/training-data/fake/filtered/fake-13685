Oh my god. My boyfriend and I went here just to try something different, and we were both blown away by the food! Their friend sweet plantains are particularly good - I had been badly missing them since I left the Caribbean. The ambiance was beautiful, and though the front room seemed a little loud the smaller back room we were seated in was absolutely fantastic. Dinner by candlelight under swoops of fabric with sweet music playing in the background... it felt like something out of a romance movie. The food shocked us both. We were expecting something good, but what we got was beyond good. I cannot for the life of me remember the names - he got a beef dish with onions and ride, and I got a chicken dish with a salad, rice and beans - but we couldn't stop telling each other how good the food was the whole time we were eating! Their dessert was great as well, and totally lived up to our now-high expectations for the place. We will definitely be coming back here again!
