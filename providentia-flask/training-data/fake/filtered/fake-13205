I just went to NTDTV's 2009 International Chinese Culinary Competition in NYC and the chef in Cheng Du 23 won the highest honor for the Sichuan category in the competition!   I got the chance to sample the food from the contestants and Chef Jiang's dishes are to die for!!!   They are sooooooooooo delicious and stay true to the original and traditional flavor!   I cannot wait to have a full meal prepared by the chef in Cheng Du 23.   Congrats, Chef!
