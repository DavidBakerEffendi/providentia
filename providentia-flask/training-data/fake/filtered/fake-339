Don't get me wrong, I love philly... But i've had way way better cheese steaks then Genos.  Ive had better at a Gas station in philly that had a little kitchen.  Im assuming the hype is because of the location, all the lighting on the building, oh and that it was on TV!  The food network i think it was?  Good business for them from all the tourists though.
