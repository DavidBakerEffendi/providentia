Not quite as good as I was expecting.  Service was subpar...I had a very difficult time phoning the restaurant to change my reservation.  The person who finally took my call was not the least bit friendly and rather rude.  While the server was a bit more polite, her knowledge and descriptions of menu items were amusingly nondescript.  The ceviche was excellent; other menu items were just ok and over priced.  Don't think I'll return...too many other options in the city.
