I brought my children here for lunch Saturday afternoon.  We got there early so we were seated right a way.  All three of us ordered burgers and they were amazing!! Both my kids finished there burgers.  The reason for the four stars was the service I say my waitress 4 times, when she took our order when she delivered our order, I asked her for the bill and ten minutes later she brought it. The place was getting pretty pack so I would have thought they would have wanted us out of there. When I finally received my bill I had to wait another ten minutes before she came and picked it up, I actually asked the hostess if she could run it.  I would recommend Prime 16 and will probably go back again but just hope that I don't get the same waitress.....
