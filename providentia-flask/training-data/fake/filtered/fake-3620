Had lunch at C4 and it was good. It's a cool spot and if you are in the mood for a fatty meal it's where you should head. Had dinner here too, and was quite disappointed with the smoked spare ribs. They were very tough yet fatty, not a good combination. The corn bread and baked beans that they came with were pretty good.
