Go somewhere else!!! We had the same experience as other reviewers. The service was very poor and the food was below average. The wait staff is inattentive and very slow to fulfill requests. And this was on a slow night. I had better food at diners. Our salad was wilted, our appetizer were soggy, and the pizza in which they claimed people loved tasted like Dominos. There's better places in New Haven. Don't go to this place unless you like bad food and bad service.
