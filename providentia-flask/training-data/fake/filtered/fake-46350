Went there last nite, waited about 30 minutes for a table which is expected, so many ppl still waiting. There's happy hour from 5pm-8pm you get 2 for 1 Kirrin or Sapporo for $6. Ordered Samurai Ribs - so so tasty. Chicken Bun was also good. Ramen with pork belly was so delicious. Def coming back even with the wait.
