Great view! great food. unbelievable service. Fred is the man. People complain about the prices, but anywhere you go fro good seafood, you're going to pay. the King Crab legs in the spicy cajun boil were amazing. Def go for the mini crabcakes as an app. Bloody mary was exceptional and the Old Bay rim and raw oyster on top was a great touch. Cant wait to go back all summer
