I must say, I really do not understand the negative comment about the Makris.  I try to get there every weekend, because my kids love the place, and so do I.  We have almost exclusively gone for breakfast, but I have had a few lunches there as well.  No matter what meal I go for, I never leave feeling anything less than fully satisfied. Breakfast is our favorite.  I have had everything from omelets to the Monte Cristo, and all have been fabulous.  My oldest always gets chocolate chip wheat pancakes, and is never disappointed.  My youngest has various food allergies, and the folks at the Makris have always either cooked her something special, or cooked the special waffles or oatmeal I bring myself.  No other diner or restaurant has done this for us, and it really shows what a special place the Makris is. In addition to the great food and wonderful, personal attention we are paid while dining at the Makris, I have to comment on the atmosphere.  Unlike certain other diners or restaurants in the area (the Olympia and the rebuilt McDonald's come immediately to mind), the Makris actually looks and feels genuine- probably because it is.  The Makris is clean and fittingly updated, but remains an old-school diner without the fake, over-the-top "nostalgia" of those other places.  From the shining diner car exterior to the single-table juke boxes, the Makris oozes small town diner charm.   Unlike the Olympia, which tries really hard but just can't pull off the genuine atmosphere and incredible food, the Makris does so with ease. Basically, your choice is to visit the Olympia once and leave wanting, or visit the Makris and feel as if you never want to leave.
