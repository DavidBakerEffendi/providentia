My first time ordering from here was not that great. It took them two hours to get it to me because the delivery guy got lost. (Uh, sure???) However, they actually called me up and said that they were making two fresh pies for me and were most likely going to fire the delivery guy. (Which when I think about it, makes me feel kinda bad.) So after two and a half hours of waiting, I got my pies and a free two liter of Coke. The pizza was fresh and tasty though! A perfect balance of cheese and sauce with a nice, edible crust. After that time, I have ordered two more times, and they have been prompt and fresh all the time. (The free two liter of Coke always helps sweeten the deal, too.) My biggest reason for recommending this place to anyone on the North Shore is because you can order from them online using Delivery.com. Easy as pie.
