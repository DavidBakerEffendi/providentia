I was really excited to go to Luzzo's for dinner with my boyfriend, I read the reviews and everything. It was packed when we got there, good sign, right?? Wrong!!! I guess no one understands what makes a good pizza or Italian place.. for many reasons... Firstly, We had to wait a few minutes to be seated, so we sat at the bar and ordered some wine. Waiting a few minutes wasn't the problem. The problem was that out of all the wine they had on their "wine list", only 10% of them did they actually have on hand. The wine wasn't anything special, and we were a little disappointed for an Italian place.. they are the ones that know wine after all. We were then seated in the back, looked nice and romantic, but was so loud we couldn't even hear ourselves think, let alone, hear one another. So we moved back to the bar and ate there. The salad we ordered was decent, but who can really mess up a green salad... The pizza we got was disgusting!!!! It said on the menu that it came with roasted garlic, basil and we added olives. If we didn't add the olives the pizza would have been uneatable. There was only 3 pieces of basil and 4 pieces of garlic on the whole 18" pizza. And to top it all off it tasted like they had cooked it with chlorine. I'm not the type to complain, but the whole experience was unpleasant. The only part I liked about it was the salad, which I could have easily put together at home. The $2.50 a slice pizza around the corner is 110% better than this expensive stuff. Don't go!! Save your money and your stomach!!
