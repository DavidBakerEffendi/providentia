hosted a surprise birthday for 11 people and the hostess was AMAZING!! other than being extremely accommodating throughout the entire process, esp when it came to last min additions, etc, she even led us to the back, pretending we were going to a table for 2! in addition to the great service from everyone in the restaurant before and after the meal, the food and drinks were spectacular.  the bar is legit, w drinks like old fashioned served w a big cube and all.  a lot of these drinks are alcohol forward, so let the server know if you prefer fruiter or more mixed drinks. the scotch egg is amazing, as is the mac and cheese, and of course the meatloaf sandwich.  accidentally ordered the beet ravioli thinking it was beef ravioli, was disappointed, but otherwise, food was fantastic, great value, perfect portions.  i look fwd to going back again soon.
