Pretty good food at very, very reasonable prices. I've been there a few times now and it's worth the slightly longer walk from work to grab lunch or a snack here. My favorite thing right now is probably their curry + fried chicken cutlet over rice--unlike a lot of places in the area the chicken actually has some meat to it and isn't paper thin. And the curry?--Well, nothing special, it's your typical mild Korean curry, but we are talking about a place that's a "taste of home," so no complaints here. Their kimbop is alright, one of (if not THE) cheapest places to get kimbop around here, though I've had better quality wise. Try not to get kimbop too far outside of the lunch and dinner rush times as it can get dry from sitting in that cold case. My absolute staple favorite here? Their $1 (or included with their lunch box sets) simple green salad. They have this super garlicy sweet vinegar (? correct me if I'm wrong on the vinegar) dressing that I absolutely looooove, though I will say I keep a roll of mints on hand for after that snack =D. So in summary-- good food that I would make at home, though coming during rush hours is best for food quality and freshness.
