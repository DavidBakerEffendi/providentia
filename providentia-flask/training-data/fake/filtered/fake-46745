Went here to entertain a few business associates before a Nets game and came away being very entertained myself!  We opted for the chef's tasting menu and oh boy what a treat it was.  Highly recommend this.  We had an oyster BLT that was creative and delicious.  A prawn and steak dish that was spot on and some high quality sushi that rivals Tokyo's finest (yes, having a Japanese wife has made me a certified sushi snob!) . On top of the exquisite food and excellently paired sake, Jeff the Chef truly made it an experience with his delightful personality and attentiveness to all our needs.  His staff was amazing as well.  If you go here do yourself a favor and put yourself in the capable hands of the chef.  He will simply amaze you.  Short walk to the Barclays Center which was great because it actually snowed that April night!
