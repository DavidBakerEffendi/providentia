I went here on 7/20/10.... Upon walking in I was kind of taken back by the decor, it looked like they took leftover school supplies and put it together to make seating arrangements. The staff was dessed very sloppy and it kind of made me NOT want to even order, but nonetheless I went ahead and waited to be seated...... At first I was impressed with the fast service but to my surprise the service was only fast because the food was luke warm and STALE... I had a chicken box which comes with 3 unidentifiable chicken peices, a biscuit, and a side ( I chose macaroni n cheese) all of this for 11 dollars!!!!!!!! the macaroni was stale and cold, and they must have used processed cheese, if you are looking for authentic macaroni and cheese please DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!! the chicken was stale and bland... I tasted my friends Collards green and the portion can't  satisy my 5yr old son. The only thing tasty there was the homemade lemonade, and for that I could have went to the local koreans and buy  6 lemons for a dollar and make my own......  I want my 30 minutes back and my 11 bucks!!!!!! I was better off at the local chicken spot or even Popeyes!! Hope this helps!!!
