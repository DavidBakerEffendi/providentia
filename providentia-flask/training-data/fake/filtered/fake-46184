I live close to the downtown Ippudo and decided to try it one Monday evening.  There always seems to be a line so I figured it is worth a try.  We arrived at 9:30 and had to wait about 1/2 hour for a table for 3.  While waiting we tried a pork bun which was very tasty.  The atmosphere is quite busy.  The service was quick since they need to turn around tables fast.  The ramen was fine.  Would I wait more than 1/2 hour to be seated.  Probably not, the bar area was quite small.  I would go back but try to time it when it wasn't quite so crowded.
