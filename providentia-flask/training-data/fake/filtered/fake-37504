Don't listen to the old bat who is probably a spam bot.  El Cholo is the only Peruvian spot on Staten Island.  The owner himself does a lot of the work, is very friendly and will explain anything on the menu to those new to the cuisine. If you want a authentic taste from a unique locale, eat here, it is the pride of the neighborhood compared to the genuine "hole in the wall" eateries nearby.
