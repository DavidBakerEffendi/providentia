we each had our own version of the slider (anna-slider with bacon, cheese, and onions; sarah-slider with bacon and onion; tristan-slider with cheese and onion). each slider was priced between $2.50 and $2.75. everything was made FRESH before our eyes and with attention to detail. the burgers were moist and savory, the buns sweet and soft, and the sauces were to die for. plus great atmosphere. minus not really any veggie options (cheese fries don't really count) one slider won't do you in for a legit meal, but one is a great way to have something without filling up before a night of bar hopping. all three of us agreed that the chipotle ketchup was the gem of the place (i need to find out if they sell bottles of this stuff for me to take back to st.louis), but we were very satisfied with the sliders as well. the bartender also won our hearts with a free sample of the guinness shake (normally $6), which was super sweet, think, and creamy without covering up the taste of the beer. we applaud you mark. p.s. this may seem like an odd comment, but the ventilation was well appreciated. the smell of burgers and fries is great, but no one wants to smell like that all night long.
