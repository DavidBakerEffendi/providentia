Great food, lousy service and even worse patrons. My wife and I have been promising to dine at the spotted pig for some time Â and finally made it last night. Per usual, a two hour wait during rush hour but we stuck it out and were seated upstairs in slightly less than the estimated 2.5 hour response from the hostess. The pretentious group of young women seated next next to us completely ruined what could have been a great meal. The hipster waitstaff was slow and unattentive throughout the entire meal. When the girls next to us became unbearable and even the wait staff noticed how obnoxious they were, all we got was a shoulder shrugg and a half hearted appololgy. Not worth the 2 hour wait, Not worth the 20$ burger, Not ever again!
