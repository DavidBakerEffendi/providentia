I've heard that this is one of the best Pizza spots in NYC...I'm not so sure about that!! Â There's nothing wrong with the pizza, it good. I would go there again, as there is nothing negative to say about it, but it wasn't anything special. Anything I could call "the best." More like "pretty, pretty good"
