$92.00 for 4 big bones,some pork and some grease .To us the taste of the meat was overwhelmingly like coffe and grease.The sides are even  worst .the potato salad uneatable we left it untouched. the beans  ok.the broccoli stale.I don't know where they get  the barbecue sauces but the ones from a super market taste a lot better.And selling pork by the pound ?....like fillet mignon,what a gimmick .At Morton's of Chicago we get  2  16  oz porterhouse steaks side of spinach baked potato 2 martinis and great service for about  that much, and you can not Finnish the whole meal.while here after you take the grease and the bone you are left with maybe 4 to 5 oz of the most expensive pork. Another minus is the guy cutting the  meats.....if you ask him something he will  answer you like  he is doing you a favor.He should take lessons  from the lady at the bar.so pleasant and helpfull 5 stars to  her.I had to give 1 star to the restaurant because they don't have a o rating.I guess the owners are following Mr Barnum moto "There is a sucker  born every day ". So if you feel like getting robbed without a gun. go to Fette Sau.
