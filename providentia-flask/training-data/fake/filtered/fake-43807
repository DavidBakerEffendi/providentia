I've heard that service at Landmarc is bad, but thought that ppl just love to complain and  honestly expected way better service of that kind of restaurant in TriBeCa. Went there on Thursday night with friends for special occasion. They gave us a table right the way-perfect. But than we were waiting for a wine list for a while and no one came to the table even to say hi and welcome. Finally we got the list (menus are on the table already). Our waitress were nice, friendly and helpful in the beginning. Everything went well. Food was OK. Again, not for that kind or restaurant. File mignon and rib eye were same quality as u can get from a diner but twice more cheaper. When we finished our main courses we were waiting for someone to clean the table for, no joke, about a half an hour.  Finally when someone cleaned it we asked for coffees and check together, cuz didn't want to wait again and ask for breakfast menus, cuz that would be perfect time for it. And guess what? We got coffees after 15 mins when check was signed.
