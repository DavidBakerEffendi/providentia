it pains me to write a sort of negative review b/c the folks there are really sweet.  however, the food is mediocre - there were a couple of bugs in our lettuce and it wasn't the cleanest joint, either. on the plus side, the food did seem fresh though our spring rolls had clearly been fried early and kept warm until service.   all in all, i'd skip it.
