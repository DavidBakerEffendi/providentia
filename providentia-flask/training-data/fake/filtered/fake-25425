Amazing authentic food.  The ambiance was great.  The place is a little small.  But the experience is something to take back.  I am from San Francisco, but visited this place in August of 2007 and would definitely go back when I am visiting NYC again.  The corn was excellent.  Also I heard a Lenny Kravitz video was filmed here.
