My first review and I am really excited is going to be about yuca. I've been here like 4 times, most of the time for drinks and some tapas. This last tuesday I came in with a group of 7 and decided to eat. It was a waaaaiiiittttt, it gets crowded, and the waiting went up to 45 min. the hostess looked confuse but eventually she asked the manager for a more accurate time since we wanna have half price tapas, after 40 min and 2 pitchers of sangria we were really happy and got seated. Even it was pass 8, we were honored with half price. OMG the food was off the hook. Everything was good. It was no rush. The service was nice. At the end one of my friends end up Â loving the hostess, she was so sweet. Thanks Yuca bar, well done.
