I really liked the pizza it was pretty amazing. But PLEASE DO NOT EAT THERE GET TAKE OUT. They have terrible service. It was awful. I sit down with a group of eight friends to eat. The waitress seemed like she was in a rush the whole time taking our drink orders. She goes around to everyone and asks them what they want to drink. She forgets me, so I thought it was just a mistake, but when I asked her to make sure that I got a water too I got a very quick sassy answer it almost seemed like she was on drugs. Then it got even more uncomfortable when the waitress and another waitress would not stop staring at our table, and me. It was just an awful dining experience in general and I recommend no one eat there. But the pizza is great so get take out or delivery.
