Quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever had. We made a reservation for 4 adults and 2 babies on a Saturday night at 5:30pm. The place was packed by 6pm. What happened to New Yorkers eating at 9pm? Oh, I know... everyone wants to eat at Walter's so they eat early to avoid the REAL chaos at 9pm. Very baby friendly restaurant. They had a nice highchair for our very social 17 month old. The wait staff entertained her each time they walked by. It's pretty loud inside. Definitely more of a "happenin" kinda place. If you're looking for intimate and quiet, then this place isn't for you. All in all, it was a great experience. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the food took a VERY long time to come out to us. Sitting almost an hour with a toddler in a restaurant is never ideal.... but that fried chicken was worth the wait.
