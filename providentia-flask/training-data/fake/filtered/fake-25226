I am so excited to finally get around to writing a review to this fabulous vegan joint! I have never, EVER, frequented any establishment as much as I do Champs. I've never had a disappointing meal here (which makes choosing from the monstrous menu so difficult!) and the service is perfectly adequate for the hipster community these servers are forced to deal with day-in and day-out. From the bro-wrap to the tuna melt to the cheesecake, it's all fantastic. And the prices are reasonable to boot. I do wish it were just a few tables larger, as a wait these days is pretty much guaranteed. But, c'est la vie!
