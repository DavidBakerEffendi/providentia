For NYE we catered in a ton of food from Percy Street for 12 of us.  I spend some time each month in Texas and this was the closest i have had to real deal bbq on the east coast.  Didnt have the full fledge smoke flavor but you tell it was there.  Brisket was the best, baby back ribs were very good, pulled pork was above average.  All in all great food and would highly recommend.
