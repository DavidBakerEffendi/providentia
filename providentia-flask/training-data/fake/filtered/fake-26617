I don't know where you get your food but mine doesn't come seasoned. Apparently this is the case at s.p.k. cuz none of our 3 dishes were graced with salt or pepper. Our drinks were average but overpriced and the "hostess" that took our names before the 20 minute wait at the bar was a pompous, rooster-chested fellow who acted like he owned the joint. Our server seemed like that guy who mumbles a request for spare change on the r train in the middle of the night- and he didnt seem to give a hint of a shit how our food was or if we needed more drinks at any point. Busser was cute and was on top of her shit the whole time. First time I tipped under 15% in a long while...
