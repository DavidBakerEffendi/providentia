I know this is out of my area, but we ate here when we recently visited Philadelphia and were very impressed.  I had the mussels and a tasty beer.  The waiter was really helpful since I had no idea of what many of the beers were like on the menu.  They have lots of local breweries on tap.  So, he helped me select a tasty pilsner style beer.  As soon as I came back to SJ, I started looking for a similar restaurant/ Cafe in our area and was dissappointed to find that we do not have one.  Come on SJ, this one was a winner.  I will definitely go back when I visit again.
