went here for dinner on saturday night after reserving a month in advance!  room had a cool club feel, kinda old.  very loud though.... after the nyt review about the steak, i ordered the cote de boeuf.... while the quality of the meat was good, the flavor was lacking.  i had a beets appetizer - which was good, but nothing special.   all in all, i probably would have rated this higher were it not for the hype... but overall i am not eager to return.
