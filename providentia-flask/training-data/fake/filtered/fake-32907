I have never written a review before but my experience at Perry St. prompted me to write this. My husband and I went to Perry St. for our anniversary and when we arrived we were asked to wait at the bar. 45 minutes after our reservation we were still at the bar waiting to be seated and naturally frustrated. Before we even had a chance to make a fuss about it the staff began to let us know that they apologize and are doing everything to get us seated asap. They brought us a free appretizer and Â promised to "take care of us" Once we were seated we were served by the manager herself and she was amazing! In addition after multiple drinks, appretizes, entrees and dessert with coffee our check came and they weren't kidding when they promised to "take care of us"! our dinner was only $60 we basically were only charged for the entrees. We were moved and touched b/c the food was delicious, staff so nice and they gave us a great deal! Thanks Perry St.
