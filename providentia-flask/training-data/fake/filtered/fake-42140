Just got home from Royale with a group.  We waited 45 minutes for a round of burgers.  Other tables were being served before ours.  The server didn't even have the good sense to give us our fries/onion rings while we waited for the burgers.  She also forgot a round of beers that we ordered.  When we finally got the burgers, they were well done (all were ordered medium-rare) and one had to be sent back b/c it had the wrong kind of cheese.  This is a poor, poor showing.  I'll stick to the Burger Joint or Zaitzeff, next time. If I could give zero stars, I would.
