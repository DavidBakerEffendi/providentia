I went to Carmine's in Times Sq, NYC wit group of friends, we ordered the chicken Marsala and the lasagna. The Marsala was pretty good (could have been better), the lasagna was good. The atmosphere was great, the prices for the food were really good everything was great, but I gave the restaurant four stars because our waitress was not that great. She was extra friendly when the check came because she wanted a great tip.smh but overall I had a great time!
