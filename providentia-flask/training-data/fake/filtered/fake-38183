Greek lady has good food but is very racist towards black people.. They think all black people complain and they want nothing to do with blacks.. I'm gone miss their lamb but I just can't go there anymore cause I was belittled and they made me feel horrible.. So my review is good food but very racist staff.. And only one black person works there..
