My friends took me there for my birthday and the server spoiled the surprise when we sat down. FAIL! Sommlier brought the wine to our table and we had no glasses. FAIL! Â Food was okay but the chicken liver rigatoni was tasty as recommended by a chef on chefs feed. (props to Ansil) Just a really bad experience overall. I want to try again but will probably go to Vetri or Amis next time.
