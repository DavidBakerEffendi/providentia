If you go early enough to beat the weekend brunch rush (around 10:30 on a Saturday and we didn't have to wait) and with a small enough party, this place is yum-ee.  The corn is so good, I would consider going just to stuff my face with that.  I wish it was a little bigger. I guess I just said what everyone else just did...
