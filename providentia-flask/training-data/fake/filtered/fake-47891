Food was delicious, served by attentive and friendly staff in a wonderfully minimal yet cozy atmosphere: The variety of dishes covered the spectrum of food groups, with no craving left untended. Everything was cooked excellently and creatively. I especially enjoyed all the textures paired together to really add that extra something: crispy skin on the juiciest guinea hen I've ever tasted, light yet crunchy beet chips with a tart yogurt atop creamy hazelnut mousse sprinkled with some lightly sweetened toasted oat granola--among many gems. If you're looking to have a food adventure, this is the place to go. Also, the chicken fat-baked bread was perfection. Some reviews are saying the portions are too small, but maybe they're just used to oversized American South portions--I was happily full and did not feel the food guilt or need to unbutton my pants that I usually feel after a delicious meal. I thought $55 was very reasonable for a 5-course meal. Well done, Jeremiah and Fabian! Can't wait to come back!
