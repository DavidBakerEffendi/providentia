The server started off by lecturing us on why the manager, a friend of ours, shouldn't invite us to sit anywhere we liked (it was a slow day with plenty of tables).  He then asked me "What's up, man, whatchu need?"  It was at this point that I realized he didn't want to be at work that day.  The beef burrito was oily and bland and could have stayed in the microwave another minute or so.  When I opened it up to see what was in it, I found two hairs.  I tried very discreetly to catch the grumpy server's attention, but, alas, he responded by yelling"what's up man?  Are you finished?  You need me to take your plate for you?"  His tone was one of arrogance so recognizable that other guests around us stopped talking to see what was going on.  With everyone's eyes and ears on me, I sadly had to announce that there was a hair in my burrito, to which the server replied, after a brief examination "that's just an eyelash".  Nuff said.  Not recommended.
