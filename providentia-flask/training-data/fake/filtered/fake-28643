Just finished a fantastic meal at our favorite restaurant!  Rachel, our server was friendly and attentive.  We started with the Arancini and the mozzarella la corrazza.  The rice balls were excellent and the mozzarella was heaven, basically a grilled cheese on Italian bread with fresh mozz and sauce! Yum!!! For dinner, we had the sea bass and one of the nights specials, spaghetti with shrimp, roasted peppers and broccoli rabe in an oil oil sauce. Both were full of flavor and even complemented each other.  We saved just enough room to share a tiramisu for dessert.  So glad we did because it was the best tiramisu I've ever had!!!! Overall, we had a great dinner and we can't wait to go back!
