we had a surprise party for my sister here. the atmosphere is very relaxed and while it gets crowded, its not overwhelming and doesn't stop conversations from happening normally. it space is beautiful, the brick walls add a lot of character, and the food is really good. really good. I had mac and cheese and it was perfect food for drinking. working with the staff to coordinate the party was easy and exciting. they worked hard to ensure they had enough staff working with just us, and I would definitely go again. it is a very hipster place haha
