I brought my wife to Centro for our anniversary last Wednesday. I have to say we were surprised at just how fresh the oysters were; by far the best we've had in central Jersey. I had the wild boar which was unbelievable, so flavorful and tender. My wife had the crab cakes and she's still raving about them. The service was friendly and good. It was a little noisy but well worth it! We'll be back.
