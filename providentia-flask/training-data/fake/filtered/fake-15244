The food is okay for a take out place but they have poor business ethics. I ordered two rolls of sushi for $10. While I was waiting I was looking over the menu and realized that they have lunch specials. They offer 2 rolls of sushi for $7 and 3 rolls for $10. After finding out about the special, I feel as though I paid more than I should have. So I talked to the cashier and asked why I was charged $10 instead of $7. She said " You aint said nothing about the special, so I can't do anything about it now". First of all she should at least tell her customers that there are lunch specials. Second, she should of refund the difference of price. All I have to say is this place is a Shady Business!
