I dined here for business dinners. beets dish was good, but not great. Thanks to hipstars, this place is supposed to be "cool". But that does not mean their food is spectacular. Might be good to bring someone who are not from NYC though. I used to go to Jean Georges's other restaurants such as Jojo (cozy and nice), Spice Market (Swarmed with people from NJ), Matsugen (closed down). I stopped going because 1. I turned to vegan Â  2. the quality drastically deteriorated , and ABC kitchen may join this category soon.
