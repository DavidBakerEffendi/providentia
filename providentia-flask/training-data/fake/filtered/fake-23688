I am still wondering if the 2 hour wait was worth it.  The great thing about the wait is that they will text you just before you need to be there.  Other Ramen places do not do you the courtesy.   The pork buns are a must.  They melt in your mouth. I had the Shiromaru Hakata Classic with a poached egg.  It was a perfect light spring ramen.
