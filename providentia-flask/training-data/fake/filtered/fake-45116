Over the past few years, I've eaten here a few dozen times and I've never been disappointed. The menu offers a wide variety of some of my favorite options. They have great pasta and salad choices, and the pizza is delicious. Their tomato pies are a personal favorite, but anytime I've decided to go outside the box I've been satisfied. The staff is always friendly and call me by name now. The owner is around a lot and he always has new suggestions. These guys have my tastes figured out. They also have a wide variety of drinks and my girlfriend is always getting their desserts. I have to say, I like them too! I would say the prices are good and the product is of really good quality, and always fresh! I'm never disappointed. I always recommend Trios to my friends, so I invite you to experience the awesomeness. Â Yum!
