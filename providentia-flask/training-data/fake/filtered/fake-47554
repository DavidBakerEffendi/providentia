Arrived in Brooklyn and couldn't find so we got in a cab and he didn't know where it was either in fact he didn't even know which was Brooklyn Bridge! We got out and eventually found but by this time we had hit lunchtime queue, we were determined to wait though and after 45 mins had our seat upstairs. Considering how busy it was we found service fair we had quite a long wait but the prices were reasonable and atmosphere good. The pizza was good but can't say I was bowled over, glad we went but would not wait in queue again. Tip: say you are in couples if group of you, you will get in quicker.
