I have been going here at least once a year (Mother's Day) for the past 5 years.  We sometimes venture out periodically as well when we are in the area.  The food is always top notch and the service is awalys on point.  It can be an expensive evening out but the food is worth the price.  The lettuce wraps are, in my opinion, the best appetizer.  They make it with Chicken or Tofu but I will stick with the chicken.
