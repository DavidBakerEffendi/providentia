Went there last Saturday evening on my way back to MD, place was packed  i got seated at the bar had to wait a while to finally get the attention of one of the bartenders asked for a drink and a menu   got the drink but no menu had to wait again  can't say they were too friendly but ok, I ordered the mussels appetizer for $14 I got 8 tiny mussels one so small I had to take a picture of it never seen such a small mussel a 1/2" at most, taste wise it was good but for that money the quality of the mussels was embarrassing, half way through one of the bartenders realized they had forgotten to give me the bread basket, everyone else got theirs with some dipping sauce but I not me, no problem.  Then my main course came tenderloin stuffed (just layered on top) with spinach and cheese with a very nice sauce this dish was good but worth $30?? I hope the waiters in the restaurant are better then the two bartenders because that might make these prices worth the experience. For me it was a dud and I should have looked for a taco bell Sorry
