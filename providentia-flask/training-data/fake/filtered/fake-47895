Enjoyed a wonderful New Year's Eve at Skara.  The food as always (this was our fifth visit) was superb.  The beautifully tiled room was filled with good cheer and the owner and staff were warm and welcoming.  The evening was topped off with everyone being treated to a dessert of a delicious traditional Greek New Year's cake.  Can't wait to go back to Skara!
