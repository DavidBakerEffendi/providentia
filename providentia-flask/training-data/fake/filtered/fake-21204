Finally, a great neighborhood restaurant!  The food here is delicious, and the room is so calming.  The service here is very attentive and when we asked if we should have the baby back ribs or the sweet corn soup, the waiter said have the ribs and brought out the soup on the house for us to try!!  So far I've had the tuna and the salmom and my husband had the fried chicken, which they will surely be famous for.  Again, they brought out an extra dessert for us to sample.   Food, service and ambiance are all delicous!
