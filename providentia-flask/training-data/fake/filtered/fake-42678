Located in the upscale West Hartford Center area, the Shish Kebab House of Afghanistan was a wonderful break from the tradition and a welcome breath of fresh air and new cuisine.  It's a family owned place with alot of traditional home cooked Afghani cuisine. As you enter you immediately are ushered up a small set of stair which brings you to the first level of seating and the bar.  They had a surprisingly large list of wines which I was not expecting given the cuisine is not something that I associate with wine.  They also have a second level which holds more seating as well as a few small rooms that are semi-sectioned off with more traditional low level or floor seating.  It has a comfortable atmosphere during the daytime and seems that it can convert itself to a trendy night dining spot in the evening.  I believe they offer free appetizers Monday-Thursday in the early evening so if you are not sure about the cuisine I suggest stopping by to have a taste.  They also have a small area for outdoor patio dining. Afghani food dates back for thousands of years, its no wonder, with so much time, why Afghani food is so pleasing to the palate.  At the Shish Kebab House they have some of the best rice I have ever had and their Kebabs, unsurprisingly are a wonderfully seasoned and perfectly cooked, especially combined with the traditional fruits and vegetables of Afghani cuisine.   The service was fast and reliable, although I have only been on quite weekday afternoons.  I would highly suggest stopping by and at the very least trying this wonderful cuisine and supporting the only(as far as I know) Afghani Cuisine in Connecticut.  From what I hear, there are some who seek this place out for a taste of home or of unique foreign country.
