I am hesitant to write this as I dread the day everyone finds out about this place, but I want them to stay around too so here goes! It's such a great and cozy spot with excellent coffee and food. And as of right now completely uncrowded and a great place to work. One thing though - they really need to fix the front door to make it easier to shut. Right now it's impossible.
