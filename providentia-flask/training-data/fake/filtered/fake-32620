My Puerto Rican friend brought me here one night for dinner because I've never had PR food.  I totally loved it, and I don't understand why there aren't more Puerto Rican restaurants.   We usually go there at night. Its crowded, but we can always find a table. Even though the people who work there are all Mexican, they really do Puerto Rican food justice, or so my friend says.   The service is minimal, but quite good.  The food gets out very soon. Here's how my friend & I usually order:  We each get rice & beans and share a meat, avacado, and something else.  Then we just eat everything all together.  Oh, and they also have Goya juices, so you have to get one of those if you don't want coffee.  I've never tried the cafe con leche, but I'm sure its delicious. Our bill came out to be a little over $16, which was a great deal considering how full we were. Oh, and I know that a dance floor would totally throw off the diner style feel of the place, but the music is so great that I always want to start salsa-ing around La Taza De Oro
