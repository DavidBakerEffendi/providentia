Shalimar is one of the finest restaurants in New Jersey.  love going to this restaurant with family.  Their buffet is worth the money.  You also have a choice to order what you particularly like.  Variety of food is excellent, taste is great, and staff is courteous.  Every time I go to Shalimar I enjoy the food and the atmosphere.
