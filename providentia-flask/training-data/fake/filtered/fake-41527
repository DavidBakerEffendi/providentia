This is one of my favorite neighborhood haunts, so it's hard not to be biased. I will say that I have introduced many friends to Amelie and they have all loved it.  Now they go there as well.   If you want a fancy (and spendy) French dining experience go to Le Bernadin.  If you want a great French bistro experience in a cool setting - like in Paris - go to Amelie.  Good wine, good food and friendly service in a cool interior. Consistently great.
