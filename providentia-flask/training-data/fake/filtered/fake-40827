New York's First pizziera has possibly the most perfectly flavored pizza I've had...and I've had a few When I arrived I saw a sign that revealed this as "Best Pizza on the Planet", backed up by a plaque claiming this place anational historic and legendary pizzeria by PMQ magazine and NYC Pizza show. I went for a small margherita pie with Rosa Grande Pepperoni. The cost being $14 plus an additional $3 for extra toppings. Its hard to say something is the BEST pizza in NYC. So many factors come into play. The tomatoes were fresh and cooked beautifully. The crust is perfectly crusty and the seasonings made my mouth melt. Thin and extraordinarily seasoned, I must have come on the perfect pizza day. You would be sad if you didn't stop by this historic part of SOHO and miss out on what it has to offer.
