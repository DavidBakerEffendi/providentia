As a true PIZZA CONNOISSEUR and Italian-American raised in NYC (THE PIZZA CAPITAL OF THE UNIVERSE), I can honestly say that THIS IS "THE" BEST PIZZA ON EARTH... YES, IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN ANYTHING YOU'LL FIND IN ITALY !!!  The Artichoke slice is little piece of HEAVEN !!!  TRY IT ONCE AND YOU'RE HOOKED !!!
