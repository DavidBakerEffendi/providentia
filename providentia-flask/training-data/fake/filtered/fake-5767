Small place but really good Italian - our table had calimari app (very lightly breaded and very tasty), osso bucco (OUTSTANDING), veal parm and the special ravioli (4 cheese).  All were served hot and tasted great.  Prices were good.  Considering the number of places along Mulberry St hawking to get folks to come in, this tiny place was packed.  I would strongly suggest a reservation!!
