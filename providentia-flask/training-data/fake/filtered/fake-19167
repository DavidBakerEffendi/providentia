Wanted to love this place... I am a huge BYO fan but this place was the worst in all areas. The server was down right ignorant...not a smile, not a hello, just a "you know what you want?". Every thing we asked for seemed like such a problem and that we were a burden on her...there were only two other tables in the place!! The food was inedible, the fish was so ove cooked and dry, the risotto had no body or creaminess to it,it was more like steamed rice, and the pasta was In a pool of this loose, liquidy sauce...yuck
