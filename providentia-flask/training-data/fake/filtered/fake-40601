Lombardi's!  It's Lombardi's!!  With its red and white checkered table cloths, old tile walls and floors and the sounds of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin and other Italian crooners the mood is set.  Realistically is looks more than like a hollywood set than the sites and sounds that I remember.  The Four Seasons, Dion and the Belmonts, and other popular songs of the immediate era. Well, let me tell you. If you are not from New York City, then Lombardi's is okay.  It's better then the cheaper versions of $2.00 a slice.  But really, how good is Lombardi's?   I've have had better.  I, a novice, have made better.  Yes, the cheese is fresh, the extras regardless of the toppings are fresh.  The taste of fresh mozzarella is really special when it is fresh. Mouthwater and smooth as silk.  It is a place more for tourists and teenagers who have not savored a true New York pizza. When the Feast of San Gennaro highlighted other Italian restaurants and pizzeria in this SOHO formerly Little Italy neighborhood, that is when Lombardi's was worth the cost of it's pizzas.  The real New York Pizzeria like the real New York Deli are a thing of the past.
