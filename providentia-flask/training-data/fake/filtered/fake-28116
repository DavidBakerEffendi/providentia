Simply Wonderful! My niece recommended this establishment and I had a wonderful time with my friends. The restaurant is very cozy and intimate and it suited my needs just perfectly. We were celebrating our friend's birthday and we wanted a place that was small and inviting.  The music, food and wine was great. The staff was very friendly and gracious.  I recommend this place if you seek quality service and food. You will have a great dining experience here. My friends and I had a great time and I will return again to Grape and Grain. You will not be disappointed!
