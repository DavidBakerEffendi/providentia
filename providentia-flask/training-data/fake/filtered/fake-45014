The pizza was decent and at a good price(I had the margherita) - good dough and cheese, but it was cold.  It was still better than the grease-laden pies you get from the national chain though..   I also got the Brooklyn Blackout Cake - it was obvious that it sat out awhile (I'm guessing a day or two) because it was rock hard stale.  Even before I realized it was inedible, I was a bit disappointed to see such a tiny piece of your everyday chocolate cake for the price listed on the menu.   Cantore's was recommended to me by a local, so I'm wondering if the staff just had a bad day.
