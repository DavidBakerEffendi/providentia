This place is second in sushi to Morimoto's Restaurant only! Minor drawback is the size of the menu, but look in the center and take a look at the amazingly interesting and somewhat rediculous sushi rolls! Wait staff impecable and fun. Everything was fresh and delicious. To make life easy: order the combo platters that they put together full of sushi rolls and shashimi (spelling forgive me). Or go bold and get individual things, but a note of warning, that starts to add up and get expensive.
