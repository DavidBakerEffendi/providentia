Excellent food and service!  We had reservation for dinner after seeing a show on Sunday so every restaurant was crowded as this one was.  But they still were able to seat us within 10 minutes and clearly honored the reservation which many restaurants in Times Square do not.  The hostess, Maria, even made sure that my handicapped wife was given a chair to sit in during the short wait for a table.  Food, atmosphere, clientale and service were all wonderful.  Will definitely return.
