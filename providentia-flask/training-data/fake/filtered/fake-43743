I used to frequent this restaurant quite often, but for the 3rd time in a row, our reservation was messed up in some ridiculous way.  The restaurant staff could care less by somehow making it our fault (3 times) and turning their back to us like they're the only game in town.  Welp Yelp, screw them!  There are about 300 restaurants that we'll now spend our money.  The shockingly rude staff extends to the owner and the tall short hair hostess, who needs some lessons in "lady, you're a hostess."  Honestly, I've never seen anything like it.  Alta: Jesus is not cooking there and your staff is arrogant, rude and ungateful.  Other reviews reflect the same.  Signed:  Pissed and hope you fail.
