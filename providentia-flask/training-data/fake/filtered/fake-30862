This is the kind of place that I'm hesitant to review because I don't want one of my little secrets to get out and the place to be too busy to get in. This is by far, the best, most consistent fresh pasta I've had outside of Italy.  It should share the class of restaurants like Al Dii La without a doubt.  Highly highly recommend the pasta and risottos.  Have loved them too much to ever try a meat dish.
