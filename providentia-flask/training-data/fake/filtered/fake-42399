FINGER NAIL IN THE FOOD. they have nail as in finger nail in the taco. it's not a piece of nail that gets cut as the chef is preparing the food, but the shape of those cut by nail clipper. obviously someone is clipping his/her nail so close to the food in the kitchen. worse yet, after returning that piece of taco (we stopped eating after discovering the nail), they still want us to pay for it. service is also getting worse. only one person (never seen him before) serving 5 different tables. we actually had to ask him to serve water. I will never go back nor recommend.
