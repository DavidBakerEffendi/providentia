Really cute spot on Burlington's waterfront.  It's more of a cafe than a restaurant, so expect to stand in line for a bit (15-25 minutes, maybe) and grab a table as soon as you walk in.  Everything costs about $8 and it's all generally worth it.  I had the heartbreaker (bananas, strawberries with nutella) and the wife had some pesto egg crepe jammed with veggies.  They were both quite good, as was the poutine.  We had the vegetarian version, but it still felt decadent enough to be considered comfort food.  The cheese curds made the dish. Everything tasted really fresh and it was quite a pleasant place to enjoy breakfast before taking on the day.
