I thought going to a Cajun place in Astoria may be suspect, but I wanted something different from the usual. We had the jambalaya. I have been to New Orleans and I know Jambalaya pretty well for a Northeasterner. They not only pulled it off, but it was actually so good I am writing a review here. The place was crowded, but our server Fernando was great. I am pretty touchy when it comes to service and he was one of the better servers I have had in a while which added to the experience. The drinks were pretty good too. When I go back to Astoria in a few weeks, I may just stop back by. Kudos.
