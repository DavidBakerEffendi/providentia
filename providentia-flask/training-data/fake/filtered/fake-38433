Ordered from the pre-fixe menu on a Friday night.  Had high expectations since the restaurant supposedly buys from local farmers.  I was disappointed by the SMALL portions and soup was way too salty.  Guess overall the food was a tad above average, but as a native New Yorker I could have gotten better food and at cheaper prices in NYC. My friend asked the waitress if they can do something special with my dessert like put a candle on it since it's my birthday.  She recommended a different dessert and ended up charging us an extra $10 for it.  We never even got my dessert that came with pre-fixe.  I thought this was really lame and not very customer-oriented. Management never responded to my complaint.
