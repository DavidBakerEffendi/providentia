The bad: I wanted to try something new because my usual sushi place is closed on Monday. The sushi was absolutely terrible. I ordered 3 rolls and ate one piece of each at which point I put all of it back in the bag. The good: After contacting grubhub, I was given half of my money back. I was hoping for a full refund but at least they did something.
