The service was lacking. The main course arrived while we were still eating our appetizers. When they returned, the food was tepid and the chicken breast was not very moist. After dessert, it took nearly 15 minutes to get a cup of coffee. This was the second time I had dinner at the restaurant this month. My first experience was better. Unless one is going to Lincoln Center, there really isn't any compelling reason to dine here.
