For some reason, this was removed, so I will repost it... "Okay a beloved police officer died because of a foreigner and you own some harley's across the street. Doesn;t matter to me. Get some class and better food. " I love Geno's but I just wanted to say...it's ironic that you chastise someone to get some class when you make a statement like that. (HAHA the irony!) I'm sure I speak not only for Geno's customers but for most people around here when I say not to come back. P.S. Officer Faulkner wasn't killed by a foreigner. This case is actually a fairly famous event in other places besides this area, so I'm quite shocked that someone of your knowledge capacity didn't already know all of the facts. Next time you decide to sound like you are better than someone, please get your facts straight. Thank You. P.P.S. The Cheesesteaks are great!
