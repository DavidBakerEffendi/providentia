The mustard seed is perfect for Glastonbury!  It is a much needed addition to the downtown dining options.  The menu is broad, they serve breakfast all day, the prices are reasonable, and on a nice day you cannot beat their outdoor dining. My favorite item on the menu is the buffalo chicken salad!  i order these quite often so I would consider myself a good judge--and the mustard seed's version is excellent!  The sauce is very tasty! Their sandwiches are also very good and overall the menu is very family friendly--there is something for everyone!
