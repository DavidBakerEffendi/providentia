So, it seems to be an early crowd on Friday nights and a late crowd on Saturday nights, but either way, the music is still so loud I can't hear myself think. The food is good. Â Solid, slightly inventive Italian dishes cooked perfectly. I dream about the pappardelle. Today, veal stew with mashed potatoes (more pureed) with an excellent sauce. Its like a modern restaurant with flavorful home cooking. The veal fell apart on my tongue. Glorious. I love it here. Maybe they keep the music that loud to scare off the tourists. If so, I'll keep coming back. The locals are cool.
