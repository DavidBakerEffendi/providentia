My husband and I took our son to NYC to celebrate his 10th birthday.  Many different review sites directed me to this restaurant albeit not super convenient to where we were staying near Central Park.  We absolutely loved our meals and the atmosphere was lovely.  My dish was a pasta with lobster (on the menu) that was very delicious.  Service was attentive and owner/GM and/or chef (not sure) greeted us after our meal and shared a couple of complimentary glasses of moscato that completed a wonderful experience.  Would definitely go back!
