Louis Lunch sells the idea of having a burger made at "the birthplace of the burger". This is a fallacy. They did not invent the meat grinder, hence they were not the first to ground beef and cook it. There is no real way to prove that it was the birthplace of the burger, so why not just adopt it as your motto? The burger is average at best. Decent meat served on dried out and then toasted Wonder-bread with tomato and Cheese-whiz (which they CERTAINLY didn't have in1895), the Louis Lunch burger leaves a lot to be desired. the place was great when the burgers cost $2.50 and it was great when you were drunk wandering the streets of New haven when you could come in and eat 2 for about $5. Now that the burgers are upwards of $6 each, take my advice and pass. Unless of course you want to be one of the many sheep who go there and proclaim it the best burger in the world well, because it was "first".
