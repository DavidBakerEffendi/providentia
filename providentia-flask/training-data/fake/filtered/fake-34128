Grace's Kitchen has moved to the east side of Branford and is now known as Grace's Grill. The new address is 53 School Ground Rd Ste 1, Branford, CT 06405. The new place is slightly smaller with bright decor and changed hours. Now they mostly cater to the breakfast and lunch crowd at the office park where they are located. They do dinners only on Saturday and Sunday.
