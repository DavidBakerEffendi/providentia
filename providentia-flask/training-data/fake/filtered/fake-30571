the service there by the men in front counter was terrible. like, worse than terrible. my friend and i went there for lunch today (sunday 12/22/13) and it says out there on the front white board that they will start serving dinner Â and no lunches starting 12/23/13. while we came in, the guys didn't say "how are you? or how many" we had to wait for the waitress. there was only one waitress. it was awkward waiting by the door (so this is the part where i give this place only 1 star). then the guy tells us to sit by the window. and so we do, when we order we are told that there was no lunch menu price. which is AWFULLY STRANGE since it was 12/22/13 sunday at around 3pm. so i tipped 20% but my friend didn't tip at all and then we left. overall, it was just a weird, awkward experience. i had their summer salad and it wasn't even that good! do yourself a favor and go to winberrie's in palmer square, princeton. their service is not sketchy and their lunch menu is wayy better!
