It was a dreary, cold, and all-around terrible day when we decided to stop in and get some comforting, hot risotto. Despite living right in Rutherford for the last 15 years, we never visited this restaurant before. Inside decor is a nice pinky color, but it is pretty dimly lit. Maybe it's so all you can concentrate on is the risotto! The appetizer, stuffed eggplant, (sort of like a rollatini), was delicious. Four rolls (what a deal!) filled with gooey cheese, swimming in a delicious marinara sauce. I could have had much, much more. Salad dressing was good too- with just the perfect amount of acid. Then came the risotto in remarkably record time. They must have it prepared in vats... Mom got the three cheese risotto, which unfortunately lacked some saltiness and unction. I got the mixed mushroom risotto, which really had an amazing flavor. Layer and layers of mushroomy, brothy goodness that you want in a well-made mushroom risotto. I'd definitely get that a second, third, fourth time. I wish they had a way to "make your own" but I'm sure they'd accommodate you if you wanted extra/less items in your meal. They have a whole set of other non-risotto items, and judging by the quality of the appetizer, these items are probably equally delicious. I was upset by the cheese they brought to the table as it was clearly the dry menace of pre-crumbled, sandy, found-in-a-plastic-container, junk that costs a buck. I would have liked some yummy, freshly grated cheese to top my meal instead of what I had just described. That said, the risotto WAS very well made, the service was great, and the entire meal was affordable. I'd go again, but perhaps I'd bring my own cheese. Yum!
