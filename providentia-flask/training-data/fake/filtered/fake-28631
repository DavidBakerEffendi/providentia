Nice location, food was very good.  Service a little non attentive.  Only problem I had was that I ordered the Fruit de mar, which listed Scallops, shrimp, mussels and calamare included.  My serving did not have 1 scallop.  My wife had the Salmon and enjoyed it.  The pasta fagiole was outstanding.  I would go back again.
