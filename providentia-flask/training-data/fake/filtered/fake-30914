Went to Jimmys last night for dinner. Not impressed at all. I had shrimp and scallops over linguine and the others had chicken parm. The sauce was awful. It ruined the whole dinner. If you go for the seafood alone then it's fine but do not get the red sauce. Lunch is better but I won't go back either way . Boy, do I miss Captains Galley!
