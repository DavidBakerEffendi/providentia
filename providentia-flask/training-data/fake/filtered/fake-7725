Hmm how should I start.... I heard great reviews & was very excited to try. It was first of all in the ghetto (NEWARK). My husband was nervous where we had to park our car, so we eventually moved it to right in front of the restaurant to feel safe. The chef gave us a little start of.. sliced fig with duck which was really good, my husband ordered the tomato salad as an app, it was impressive. I ordered the chicken pot pie and my husband ordered the Bronzini as our main entree. My entree was thouroughly DISGUSTING!! It came out with so much nasty egg on the crust and the inside was like a runny nose..all I could taste was egg.. My husband's fish tasted like nuclear fish from the Hudson River and when he gave me a bite I had to spit it out in my napkin it was that bad, besides the fact that his fish came with "chef risotto" a.k.a. butter rice pilaf, supposedly it was saffron rissotto yet no saffron was in it! The place was loud and hard to carry on conversations, service was super slow took along time to get our food. They tried to make up with irish cream and chocolate after the meal but we just wanted to leave. Upon exiting we were greeted by the hostess who was also getting her car and guess where she was parked directly in front of Orange Squirrel..When there is absolutely no parking in the ghetto you actually allow your employees to park in front of the restaurant EPIC never going here again and will never miss LOL GROSS! What an ending to a disappointing meal..
