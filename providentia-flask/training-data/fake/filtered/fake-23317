Though I can't necessarily pronounce it, Assaggini Di Roma is a fantastic Italian restaurant for a romantic dinner or special event. To begin with, the food is fantastic. Before we even ordered drinks, the servers gave us a small portion of complementary bruschetta. When it came to appetizers, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Artichoke Hearts were well-prepared and robust. For entrees, we ordered the stuffed calimari (with crabmeat) and the fruta del mar (seafood over pasta, including calimari, mussles, and shrimp). Both portions were generous and flavored perfectly. In both dishes, the calimari was particularly well cooked. It's not the quietest place to eat, as they have seem to have live music most nights. The entertainment was a bit silly, but as the night went on we warmed up the the Rat Pack covers and the Rodney Dangerfield impressions. All in all, this is a great place to go if you expect to spend a little money. The only drawbacks with Assaggini Di Roma is the far flung location -- it's a good 20 minute walk through the Ironbound from Penn Station, but that adds a bit to the restaurant's off-the-radar charm. That said, I don't get the chance to eat in Newark often, but this could very well be the best Italian restaurant in the city.
