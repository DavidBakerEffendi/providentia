We've eaten at the Pizza One location in Ringwood several times and decided to try the new location in Wayne last night.  What a mistake.  Apparently they don't have plates because they served us an antipasto in a plastic to-go container and paper plates.  When they brought out our meal, they were in the foil to-go containers along with paper plates.  How are you supposed to eat a chicken parm dinner with spaghetti on a paper plate?  We decided to take our dinners home so we could have actual plates and silverware.  The food was definitely not as good as the Ringwood location either.  I'm definitely going to cross this place off my list.
