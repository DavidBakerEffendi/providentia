One of my favorite restaurants! Highly recommended! It is true that it is a French restaurant not run by French people, but don't let that stop you from coming here!  My fiancee and I first went there for brunch. I had an omlette and salad, he had eggs benedict with fries. Our meals were so good we had to go back. Since then we have been back together and with friends and have tasted many different things including, chicken, steak, calamari, burgers, salads, desserts, coffee, wine and beer, etc. Every single thing was excellent.  The quality of the food is far above average and the flavors are amazing. To me the staff at restaurants are as important as the food itself, and everyone at Cafe Luluc has been very friendly. It is very difficult for me to recommend certain items from the menu because they are all so good, but I will say that they have the best turkey burger I have ever tasted. And if you appreciate chocolate as much as I do, you should try the molten chocolate cake. (Although I forget the actual name on the menu.) The only negative thing I can say, which really isn't that bad, is the cheese plate we ordered (serves two) came with too much cheese and not enough bread. Everything tasted good, they just had the portions mixed up.
