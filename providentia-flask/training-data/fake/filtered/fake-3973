I love, love, love this place.  I have been remiss for not writing a review sooner.   I enjoyed the take out when it was Get Fresh, and I have been delighted to eat sit down meals for brunch, lunch and dinner at Juventino.  The food is outstanding and the service has always been exceptionally gracious. I particularly like the dinner entrees of rack of lamb with tamale and mole sauce, and duck medallions with polenta gratin. The grass fed steak is great, too, as are the roasted vegetables.  Desserts are yummy and the wines they have recommended complement the meals. I always recommend Juventino, and friends who have dined there are so happy with the service and food.   No need to go into Manhattan for gracious service and excellent meals. Try weekday late lunches and early evening dinners.  For prime times, book ahead.  Word is out.
