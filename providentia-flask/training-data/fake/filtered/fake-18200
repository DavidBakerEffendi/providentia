Place is OKAY. The food is great but not something I wouldn't be able to find somewhere else. It is cheap so i guess that's a plus. It is way too hot in the place, I think they need to be mindful of the guests and turn on some AC, I do not want to be dripping in sweat while I am trying to eat my food. Super small place, but if they handle that AC problem then I think it will be better.
