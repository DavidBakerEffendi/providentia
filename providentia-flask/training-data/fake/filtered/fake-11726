Went there again today. A lot of interesting new appetizers such as the broccoli and the new salad additions. The service was good, the waitresses got antsier as rush hour came over the place, but that is to be expected and they were still polite. After I was done eating, I walked out with free candy from the bowl at the cash register. It was good food (awesome spicy rolls) and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
