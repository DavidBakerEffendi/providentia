I went here for lunch with a couple co-workers. The service was great, the waitress very attentive. Another person and myself each got a salad and added grilled chicken. The salad was very fresh and crisp while the tender chicken made it even better. Another person got the Arepa and said it was very good. The plate presentation on all dishes was excellent. The prices made our lunch even better as they are extremely reasonable. Only critique would be to put the salads in bigger bowls because at times they were difficult to eat. I have high expectations when it comes to food and thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.
