Mes Reves is a new French Bistro in Bloomfield.   The food is deliciously excellent and there hasn't been one dish that disappoints.   From the deliciously seared foie gras, succently duck, savory steaks and truffle fries, with the best decadent desserts to round off the meal.   The staff is so friendly and attentive and we were even lucky to meet the chef who stopped by our table to say hello.   Love it!   We will be back soon to dine on more tasty morsels of Mes Reves' offerings!
