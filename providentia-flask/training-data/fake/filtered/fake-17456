This is my favorite bar in the city. It's in a great neighborhood, off of the main drag of 2nd street in NoLibs, so it's near good places to eat and drink without all the noise and crowds. The beer selection and pricing is excellent. The tap list rotates regularly, and there's good bottles available, too. And the food is fantastic. The Abbaye has the best fries in the city, hands down. Even their house salad is tasty: bleu cheese, walnuts, and bacon? sold. I've also had their seitan cheesesteak, fish and chips, fried catfish sandwich (yum!), and a number of other specials - all winners. I love that they use local ingredients and have a seasonal menu, and the cooks know how to cook both meat AND veggies. To top it off, the bartenders and waitstaff are awesome. They're pleasant, attentive without taking up personal space, and pretty chill: all things you want in a good pub. Plus, they openly hate the PPA. Other good points: the music selection, the placement of the TVs for sports viewing, the rotating art on the walls, and outdoor seating. Overall, this place feels like home every time I walk in. 5 stars.
