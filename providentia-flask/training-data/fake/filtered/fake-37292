Really misleading. After reading good reviews for this beautiful looking restaurant my husband and I were eagerly looking forward for some great southern food. WE WERE DEAD WRONG.  We walked in to an empty hostess stand on a Friday evening. After waiting for several minutes the food runner finally greeted us and sat us. It stopped there, we waited another 10 minutes with just water no menus and no server. Finally the original hostess (we think)  came to our table and asked us how our meal was! We quietly said to her that it was not ready because we didn't order because we had NO MENUS. She apologized and said she was sorry because she was running food at another restaurant across the street... Very very weird I digress, we get out menus and finally order our meals. Our meals arrived strangely within 5 minutes. That's all great but 5 minutes for a well burger and double cut pork chop is pretty impossible to pull off. Either way no grips because we waited forever for menus and proper service so we dug in. We cut into each of our food and they were FREEZING...I seriously think these meals were cooked ahead of time and thrown on a plate. The pork chop was like rubber and the burger tasted like seasoning and a poor quality of meat.  We left after a few bites of each others meals just to confirm our thoughts. We left angry and still hungry. The only good thing was the decor. Hopefully they can get it together.
