Everything you would hope for from a French restaurant. Delicious food, great atmosphere, and the bonus - not at all pretentious. Â The staff were all very nice, easy going, and attentive. The quality of the cocktails was a nice surprise. Beer list was short (3), but each one was very good. We had a variety of dishes; all well enjoyed. The fries disappeared very quickly.
