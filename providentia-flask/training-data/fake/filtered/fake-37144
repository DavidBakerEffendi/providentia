In town on business, hotel provided a flyer. Gentleman who took my order was extremely friendly and helpful. Food arrived quickly. Fresh, big portion of salad and a giant Italian hoagie that is among the best I've had. Friendly service, great food and big portions. Wish I had this place near my home.
