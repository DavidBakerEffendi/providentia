Jacob's Pickles is delicious! Â I live in the neighborhood and finally walked in and I'm happy I did. Since then, I've been there 3 times in the couple weeks for dinner. I also recently tried/highly recommend their brunch (I've tried it once). The french toast with strawberries is to die for. The cocktails are also very delicious and many are made with freshly squeezed lemonade. To add to the experience, the management is very friendly and accommodating. If you haven't had the chance to try Jacob's Pickles, you really should. You will not be disappointed!
