Geno's is as good as any cheesesteak place in Philly. We have been to Pat's, Tony Luke's, Dinic's and even though their most popular way to serve them is with Cheez Wiz, you can order them with provolone, which is still the best cheese for a cheesesteak. I think Geno's ratings have been hurt by all the PC people because, when he was alive, he would make people order in English.
