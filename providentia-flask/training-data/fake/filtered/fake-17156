This place serves my favorite drunk food in New Haven: the Jack Daniels wings, which are so powerful they might actually MAKE you drunk!  S'wings also tends to be generous with their sauces, in contrast to the stingy coatings at Buffalo Wild Wings.  The service sometimes seems to take awhile, which isn't normally a major problem since you'll probably be there with a group of your drinking buddies and a bathroom is among their very few amenities, except the experience can be dicey at times.  This place can attract a rougher crowd, especially at last call on a weekend.  I once witnessed two groups in line ahead of me vehemently arguing, and one guy discretely pulled out a knife!  We left, but returned later in the night to find cop cars parked outside, sirens blaring.  At that point, it was the safest joint in New Haven, so we finally got our wings!
