I'm not a fan of brand new restaurants; I'd rather try a new place on someone's recommendation.  However, I'm glad I didn't wait to hear what everyone else thought about MEAL before trying it myself.  What a pleasant surprise! I loved EVERYTHING about the restaurant, including the physical space and ambience.  Very tastefully decorated! The food was beyond compare.  You must try the short ribs :-)   And don't forget about dessert...many choices, but you should treat yourself to the cheese cake lollipops.  I've never tasted anything like these before.  Can't wait for a return visit.
