What a delicious surprise!!!! My wife and I are pretty big fans of Indian food and when we learned about this place, we were a bit skeptical. Having been disappointed with other local restaurants, we did not have high hopes. When we walked into the place, we were the only ones in the place, so we thought this was a bad sign already. We quickly glanced over the menu and realized they had many of the dishes we loved.  We specifically looked for Aloo Ghobi, but we didn't see in on the menu. To our delight, they said they could prepare then dish for us without any problem.  We also ordered Lamb Bhuna and Lamb Curry. The portions were perfect for too and most delicious. BTW, shortly after we sat down, the place was quickly filling up, the phone ringing off the hook with takeout and delivery orders. This will definitely be our place when we want indian takeout!!
