The best steak, butcher/hangar steak ever!!! Everything we learned from NY Chow Report on YT was so RIGHT! Tender, juicy, tasty, succulent. We loved the atmosphere, great music, great service, not a long wait. It was my birthday and it was Â the best day of my life, topped off with a memorable dinner here. Not pricey either. The side dishes were filling, mash, iceberg with blue cheese, other vegies! It was all I dreamed of and more. Great facilities, cleanest in all of NY, as far as we could see. There was no pretense or snobbery, just great food and great service! Glad to have dined there and will do again, in the very near future!!! :) We LOVE Brooklyn and St. Anselm!
