After hearing about this place once too many times i decided to give it a go with my friend. We were promptly seated and i ordered the burger.  All i have to say is it was  definitely one of the best burgers i ever had.  And yes this lady like her meat rare!   The scene is reminiscent of lets say a very busy mom and pop restaurant at the shore on a busy day.  Great energy, but not a place to go if you want to speak softly.
