NOT RECOMMENDED First the food is pretty good (Small to medium portions, don't expect to get really full), service was good during my visits, but...the owners don't really care about your experience, they care about your money...for those well-versed in body language and high in emotional intelligence, you will understand if you go and visit...there is true sincerity, but not at Bruschetta in my opinion of course we had one disagreement about special promotion, it went to the manager who instead of coming himself to talk about it sent one of the servers who pointed to a small line...a fine print...in one of their brochures...difference of $10, which is really nothing, but it goes to show how the "new management" works"...that was the difference of paying little more than $60 vs. little more than $50 for 2 people. For the cost, more is expected...many better places to spend your money
