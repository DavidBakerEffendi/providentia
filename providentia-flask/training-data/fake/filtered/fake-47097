I have not been inside.....A friend brought me some takeout. So I cannot comment on staff or decor or cleanliness.... But the Jerk chicken and Jerk Pork....oh my goodness....heaven in a styrofoam container, had the rice and beans and cabbage. Tried the beef pattie and coco bread and they were delicious too. Looking forward to going in and checking the place out and eating there again.
