I decided to take my son to this restaurant because I was taken there as a child and felt it would be nostalgic.  But it seems that Sonic has taken it's place and this Franchise is on life support.  The food was completely over priced and the food was really bland.  I know this place was established in 1924 but it seems the recipes used then are still in use.  Stewart's we have introduced such cutting edge seasonings such as Salt, Pepper....  since 1924.   I ordered a cheese steak which did not come with fries and chicken fingers platter for my son (no Kids Menus By the way)  two root beer floats for 28 dollars.   Left completely unsatisfied.
