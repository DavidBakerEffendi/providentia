This is a special gem on Grand Street. Malaysian style with a touch of Chinese influence. 1.) Food: AMAZING!!! We (a group of 3) ordered: Homemade Roti Canai (One of the most popular dishes here), Baby Oyster Omelette (5 starts for sure!), Kang Kung Belacan (Must try!!), Nyonya House Special (or Steamed Striped Bass in Teow Chow Style??), Nyonya Young Tofu (Great egg noodles). Drinks: Sour Plum (This drink will save your tongue from the hotness of the food) + Green Apple & Kiwi 2.) Service: GREAT! The lady who served us was very friendly and funny. She didn't rush us at all, which is hard to find in many Asian restaurants. Other staff was nice too. My friend put his phone near the edge of the table. A man working here gently moved my friend's phone and he said, "This way, the phone won't drop." 3.) Price: $$.You get what you pay for in terms of the quality of the food and the service. 4) Waiting: NOT SO MUCH. We were lucky to have a table when we walked in. Others came later and they were in line waiting. However, they didn't wait very long. 5.) Other: The bathroom was clean. The room was very cozy for such a cold winter night outside. I really liked the way they designed the restaurant. People weren't talking too loud. Recommended to everyone whether you are single, couple, "in-the-friend-zone" friends, long-time-no-see buddies, get-together crews, etc. Also, if you are sick with General Tso Chicken and craving for new Asian food, this place is definitely for you to enjoy and discover!
