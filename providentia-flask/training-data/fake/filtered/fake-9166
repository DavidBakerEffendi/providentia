I went out for dinner last night at Alice's Arbor, with a friend and our kids. I didn't realize that they have a really nice kid's menu, with a lot of different items to choose from, which would fit the pickiest eater, like my kids are! My friend, first time there and new to the neighborhood, loved that place too. The food is consistently delicious, and the staff always friendly. I probably come once a week now and I'm never disappointed.
