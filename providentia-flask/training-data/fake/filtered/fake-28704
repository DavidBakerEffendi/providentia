Don't be fooled by the swanky-looking decor. Avoid at all costs and here's why: (disclaimer- lived in India great portion of my life so I'm picky, nonetheless) - Expensive for the minuscule helpings. We had a good laugh when the aloo tikki dish literally consisted for a single, sad looking tikki in the middle of a ginormous plate. -Annoying waiter constantly hovering over us constantly using us if we wanted drinks multiple times, despite having said no previously. Told us that the water was 'complementary' -Maybe there was one dish our table thought decent but the rest of the menu was very average. Also, there is no such dish as the 'Naga beef Sumi.' The tribal Sumi people of Nagaland do not use peanut as a garnish nor use peanuts in their cuisine. -got charged $100 as tip on the card when we put down 20% down in cash despite the shoddy food and service. They finally reimbursed that amount but if I were a business that wanted to appease the customer, I would have reimbursed the whole amount or similar. Going across the river to Jersey for Indian food may not be an option for others but there are plenty of other Indian food joints in the area that will satisfy your tummy.
