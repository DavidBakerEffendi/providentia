Love everything about this place: the concept, the atmosphere, the meat counter, the outside area with heat lamps. I could go on and on. For anyone looking for your typical barbeque joints with a platter of smoked meats slathered in sauce and a few high fat high carb sides, this is not your place. What you have here folks is high quality meats smoked flavorfully and moistely. You can order by the slice (slices) or in pound increments as many different choices as you like. Sides are optional and extra. My favorites were the smoked hot italian sausage, smoked pork belly and the flank steak is primo. Nothing I ever expected to see on a menu in a Q place but it was stellar. The brisket is amazing and I don't even like brisket. I recommend the burnt ends baked beans and a Dry Rub Amber. Nothing but quality here and we can't wait to go back. A special thanks to Stephanie!
