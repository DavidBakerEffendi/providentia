what an incredible place!  food is served 'family style' and, in my opinion, very affordable.  great if you're with a large group or double dating.  everything from the appetizer to the dessert and drinks was lip-smackin' good!  the service was outstanding and i totally loved our waitress robyn.   so.. to tell you about the food..  where do i begin? i couldn't have felt more ITALIAN and even a little..  soprano-ish (can't think of a better analogy)!  all i could say is i wish my stomach were bigger so i could have eaten more!  my 'people' and i feasted on fried shrimp and calamari, hot antipasto, chicken and shrimp francais, penne with garlic and oil, some seafood platter, and another dish that escapes me because i think i had one too many pineapple/mango sorbet martini's.  oh and two desserts... strawberry shortcake and mixed canoli's, yummy, yummy, yummy!!!! this is totally a place you can go with your friends and/or family and not break the bank!  one thing, if you're going there for someone's birthday and you'd like to have that person sung to by the waitstaff, make sure they now the birthday babe's name or they'll make one up! btw..  we went on a friday night, the place was packed to the gills.  luckily, we had a reservation.  the service was quick and wonderful, and we made it to our show with a few minutes to spare.
