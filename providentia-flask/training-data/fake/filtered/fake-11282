I love middle eastern cuisine and the good folks at Ilili do it right. Elegant but casual atmosphere...its a great place to meet for drinks and order ala carte at the bar. My favorites were the brussel sprouts with fig jam, walnuts and mint yogurt. Oh, and the lamb and beef meatballs with cherry sauce. I also tend to think of the quality of one's hummous as the benchmark for a restaurants overall ability. Ilili's will not disappoint...light, creamy with just the right balance of lemon and garlic. MMMM....
