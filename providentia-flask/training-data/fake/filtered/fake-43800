LOVE this place.... Caught up with an old friend who shares a similar appreciation of phenomenal food & of course great company- we shared seven plates, from foie gras, to gnocchi to the brussel sprouts,  everything was delish....couldn't believe I hadn't heard of this W. Village gem earlier.  Can't wait to come back with a group of friends and order "The Whole Shebang" in which they bring your table everything on the menu, which takes the tasting menu concept to an entirely new level, yum......
