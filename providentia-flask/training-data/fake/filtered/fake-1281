My friend and I decided to eat in this restaurant last week.     Beautiful restaurant with an Italian  menu.     We had- Fried Calamari,  Stracciatella Romana Soup, Italian Garden Salad,  Penne Alla Vodka with Shrimp and Chicken Pollo Balsamico.  Everything was Excellent and delicious.      The owner is very kind and professional. He runs this restaurant in a perfect way. We had a long chat after dinner, asking about  how he found his quality Italian ingredients.       Thank you very much. Can't wait to go back.
