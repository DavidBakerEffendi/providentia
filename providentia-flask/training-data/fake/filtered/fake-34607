The food at Cielo was, at best, mediocre.  However, the service was deplorable.  The waiter spilled the eggplant appetizer  down the back of my son's shirt and never even noticed.  Our water glasses were never refilled  and the waiter seemed frenzied and annoyed.  To add insult to injury,  the waiter actually told us our $50.00 tip on a $280.00 bill was not enough! Goodbye, Cielo.  Would never return and never recommend you.  You won't be around for the long haul.
