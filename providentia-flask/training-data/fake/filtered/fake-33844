Ray's -- I'm getting hungry just thinking about the slices coming out hot from the oven! I have my own way of eating a slice of delicious Ray's Pizza. While it is cooling off a little, I tear off a piece of the crust and dab it into the middle of the triangle, giving it a great flavor and a crunchy texture. When I'm finished eating all of the crust in this way, the rest of the slice (the main event) is now cool enough so it won't burn the roof of my mouth. I then take the traditional first bite, which is always unbelievable...it's always worth the wait! Ray's pizza is consistently delicious, and has much more cheese on it than any pizza in the Western Hemisphere --- including 8th Avenue in Manhattan and Cedar Rapids Iowa :) My trips to Ray's are like a night out -- great food and drink, the Yankee or Giants game on the TV, photos of local heroes on the walls and fantastic people-watching. All for far less than $10!! You can't beat it!!!!
