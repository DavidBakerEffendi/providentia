I wonder if the owners/management reads these reviews. I really hope they do. I tried your curry a few months ago and enjoyed it. However, I no longer go anywhere near your business because it is impossible to find a seat I understand you are small. I understand you have only a few tables. But that makes me wonder why you let people who aren't even eating just sit at your tables?? Every time I go there, there are kids sitting at the tables. They put their bags on other seats, they don't even have plates in front of them. They are just sitting there talking. They won't even move their bags so you can sit at a table they aren't even using It's one thing for people to be rude jerks, but what about you guys? Can't you ask them to move for PAYING CUSTOMERS? I guess since you don't care about your PAYING CUSTOMERS, you will eventually find you don't have any! Everyone, you have been warned
