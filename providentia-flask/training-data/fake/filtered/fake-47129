We had a great meal here a couple of Saturday back. We had great glass of house white and then sat down, it is cosy but not in a way I felt intruded into my night at all. I loved the atmosphere and the staff were really good and so helpful. We ordered the Israeli Street Fair, it was really good. Definitely order the crispy cauliflower, it was the best I have ever had. Oh and the Hummus, oh the Hummus, it was just amazing. Then we had Grilled Lamb Chops , so well cooked and sooo nice. Also the Boneless Organic Half Chicken "Under a Brick", which I could eat again right now. Â The prices are reasonable and again the food was just great. The staff is amazing &extremely & I will be back.
