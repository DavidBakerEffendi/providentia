It's small and gets crowded/fairly loud quick during the busy times-- and despite not enjoying places like that most of the time-- Marra's was a delightful exception.  It makes you feel warm and cozy. The food was also excellent.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass with what I believe was mashed sweet potatoes on top.  The bass was quite tender and the sweet potatoes were again.. an unexpected delight. With your meal you'll also get some crusty bread with whipped butter as well as pickled carrots.  I have to say, I loved the contrasting flavors of everything on the table. My date had the eggplant parmigiana-- also excellent :) Isen the waiter is quite the character, and often laughs uncontrollably for absolutely no reason.  I like that. I'll definitely come back!
