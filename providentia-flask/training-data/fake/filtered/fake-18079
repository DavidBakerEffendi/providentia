I was appalled when our group arrived for a 5:30 reservation and was told our table was needed for 6:30!  When I repeated that we had a reservation we were told "everyone has a reservation".  Our only choice was to sit in an overflow section upstairs that has none of the ambiance of the downstairs.  This unbelievable treatment dampened the otherwise excellent food and table service.
