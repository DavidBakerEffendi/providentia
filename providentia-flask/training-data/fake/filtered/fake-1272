Mamagyro used to be my go to for Greek takeout but I will NEVER order from there again! The quality of the food has plummeted and the food is always delivered soggy and thrown together. Last night I ordered my usual Greek salad with a chicken skewer and the chicken was unrecognizable and therefore inedible. So sad considering it used to be so delicious and cheap...not so much anymore!
