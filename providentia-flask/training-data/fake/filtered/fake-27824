I'd heard so much hype about Lucali I was really looking forward to it. What a letdown. The pizza is an acceptably good thin-crust pizza, but it is nowhere in the realm of Grimaldi's (although, admittedly, the whole tourist line thing at Grimaldi's has grown old). For that matter, I found it to be not as good as the pizza at South Brooklyn Pizza on Court Street, which is one of the best new (relatively speaking) pizzas in Brooklyn.  Also, the restaurant is incredibly dark and smaller than a small living room. The first time I went, I felt claustrophobic (which certainly detracted from the experience); the second time I did take-out and found it difficult to navigate the cramped room just to pay and leave.  The pizza is OK. The price is what the market will bear. But this is nothing special. I'd rather have John's on Bleecker Street than this.
