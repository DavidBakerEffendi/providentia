Went to Harlem by myself just to try this place out based on my friend's recommendation. I fell in love with this place! Ordered the Rev Al Sharpton which is 2 fried chicken and waffles, fried okra on the side. The fried chicken is fresh and juicy without the stale taste of oil being re-used multiple times, its not greasy. Unlike KFC in US - disgusting and nasty chicken. The meat just peels off the bones. Yummy! The fried okra was so-so, I think the okra needs more seasoning before frying them. But the waffles are amazing! Waffles are light, crunchy and fresh! I piled the waffles with maple syrup and its wonderful. Â The server was friendly and nice. This meal made my day. Left a happy camper. Definitely coming back for more and introducing this place to my friends. Tempted to try the chocolate cake on this trip but I was stuffed. Next trip I'm going to try it again. and the President Barack Obama dish on the menu.
