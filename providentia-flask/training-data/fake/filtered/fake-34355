Just went here today having read the other reviews here, and I had to come and say how wonderful it was.  I only had the spanikopita and the baklava, but if the other items are anything like these two, I would highly recommend this place.  I come from a Greek family and it was a treat to have such delicious home-cooked Greek food at very good prices ($1.79 for a good-sized piece of spanikopita!)  I will definitely be eating here again!
