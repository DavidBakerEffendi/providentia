We 1st had a drink at the bar. Starving, it was great to nibble on a basket of their chips...fried to a dark, crunchy brown and sprinkled w/sea salt and fresh rosemary. Had 2 of their signature drinks as well. I had a gin martini with capers. Service was excellent! Bread basket had stromboli, foccacia, & sourdough to choose from with EVOO, butter and tomato jam. I had the fried softshell crab w/asparagus, nice and light. My friend had the best octopus I've ever tasted; soft, savory & fresh. Entree, went with foie gras/duck ravioli and she had lamb. Both were decadent, lamb as savory as in the Middle East. The ravioli, the star!
