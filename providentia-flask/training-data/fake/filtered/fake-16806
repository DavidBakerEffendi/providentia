Tried twice to like this restaurant and it failed miserably both times and its all due to the service. This most recent time we came in, were greeted and the hostess said we would have a table in a few moments.  If we had known it was going to be 20 minutes we would have tried to get a drink but when we got tired of waiting for them to get us for the table and tried to get that drink, the bartenders were too concerned with their own conversation to give us the time of day (had their backs to the bar- big NO NO) Made it to the table eventually.  The waitress was very nice.  My husband works in the business so the kitchen sent out a bunch of extras to our table.  They could have been coursed out better but whatever, the food was all very very good.  In the middle of our courses my husband was still eating off one of the salad plates and the waitress came over and took away his share plate from under him- food was still on the fork!!!! BIG NO NO.  To top off the evening, the waitress came over, knocked the candle onto the floor spilling wax everywhere- on my purse, my husbands jacket, and his shoes.  Are you serious?  I would have appreciated someone offering to dry clean our items even if we would never have taken it but all we got was a pathetic "Sorry". Again, the food was awesome but I will never return because the service was so unbelieveably terrible.
