Rated 4 out of 5 stars due to the following reasons. Pros i) The ramen is pretty authentic compared to those from Tokyo, Japan ii) It has great flavour and taste - Out of these 4 different flavours (Totto Chicken Paitan Ramen, Totto Spicy Ramen, Totto Miso Ramen & Niku Ramen), Totto Spicy Ramen is the favourite as the spicy kick adds another level to the taste and is best enjoyed during the colder months. Niku Ramen is the least favourite as the strong pork taste proved too much for me to handle. Cons i) Very long queue as reservation is not allowed ii) Sitting area is too cramp
