Everything started OK at this place. The tapas were pretty authentic and the maduros were great. All was well until the waiter spilled oil from another table's dinner down my leather jacket and brand new leather purse. He didn't tell me, my family had to be the one to tell me. Once I noticed that my purse was ruined, I figured that I'd let the manager know that his wait staff should be more careful because their recklessness had ruined my bag. He was VERY unapologetic and rude about it. He had a very "oh well" attitude about it. I wasn't fishing for it but I thought he would at least offer to compensate us by taking a dessert off of the bill. Thats the least he could do for ruining a $400 bag! It didn't happen! To make matters worse, he then came over to the table to tell my husband to move his chair in so that "no more accidents would happen" as if it was our fault in the first place! Someone should give the wait staff and manager a training on sensitivity and a lesson on a little goes a long way. I'll never dine there again.
