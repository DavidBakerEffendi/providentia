I came to this tent at the Holy Rosary feast because I heard the food was awesome.  I wish I can give no stars because the service is garbage.  Some fat guy with the worst hair plugs I've ever see was the epitome of a disgruntled food service worker to my wife and kids.  I went up to the tent at the Holy Rosary feast to order food for my family.  My wife and kids weren't sure what they wanted right away so he didn't put in our order just yet and we stepped to the side and let the people behind us order.  They were just looking for reassurance that it was ok that they order, so he chimes in and says, "It's ok.  You can order.  It's their first time reading so they're a little slow."  I just had to walk away or there was going to be a scene.  I don't know who this guy thinks he is but that comment was so incredibly rude and offensive.  The next people gave us an awkward smile and actually left just as we did! His name is Rob which he responded to by a group of drunk girls walking by the tent.  I really hope the owners read this because this behavior is totally unacceptable!!! Do yourself a favor and fire him!
