I have dined at Lascala's a few times for lunch since it is close to my office.  I have never been overly impressed with the food but due to convenient location my coworkers often suggest it.  When a friend suggested it on friday I thought what the hell.  Little did I know that I was actually going to be in hell.  I was completely disgusted to find a cockroach in my salad, midway through my meal.  I know my coworkers and I will not be dining there again. They apologized,  but sorry just doesnt make my stomach feel any better!
