I was at Bogota Latin Bistro with my husband this past Saturday. We've been there a few times  before so we knew not to go for dinner because 1. It's always crowded and the wait is ridiculous 2. The food is not the greatest but appetizers are good  and 3. The drinks are over priced after happy hour. We got there at 3pm and ordered some appetizers, It was good. Our drinks were okay but they forgot to put sugar in my mojito twice. Getting the attention of our waitress was so annoying that I just drank the damn thing. I thought it wasn't right that the waitress gave us our check without asking us if we were done. I forgot how this place likes to push customers out to prevent them from ordering drinks before happy hour finishes. I told the waitress we weren't done and ordered two more drinks. I wanted to spend time with my husband away from our busy schedules but felt pressured to leave so we did even though the place had several empty tables. Advice: come before happy hour to take advantage of the drinks because they are over priced and they use way too much ice. Overall, the place is overcrowded and small. The bathrooms are messy with toilet paper all over the place but fairly clean and the food is alright. They seem to not keep the bathrooms tidy. I hope another Latin place opens up in the area.
