Went here with my girl, she loved it.  The atmosphere was alright but I couldn't get over how crowded I felt.  Also the crowd itself was a bit vapid.  We DID go on a Friday night. The Tomato soup was tremendous, and my Panini was pretty good as well.  Would go back a second time,  but probably not a third.
