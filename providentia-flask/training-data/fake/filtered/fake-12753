This review probably won't say anything that hasn't been said already, but I still want to write a review because this is absolutely my favorite restaurant in the city.  My girlfriend visits from NYC frequently and we've tried many of Philly's restaurants (we generally love Garces Trading Company as well) but between the fantastic burger, the charismatic bartenders, and the whiskey selections there is really no place comparable. Obviously the burger is great, which I get with cheddar cheese only (and if you want it more than medium rare it's really a crime, but ok), but also the lobster mac & cheese and the pickled tomatoes with cheese are really fantastic.   It's not a great place to go with large groups because you will need to wait    forever, but if you live in the area and can stop by late night and sit at the bar, there really is no better place.
