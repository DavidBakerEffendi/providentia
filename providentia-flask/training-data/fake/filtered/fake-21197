Everything about this place is spectacular except the food. I ordered veal meat loaf that couldn't hold a candle to the meat loaf I get at the Greek coffee shop a few blocks up for half the price. The waitress advised me to order a side since the mashed sweet potatoes that came with it was more of a garnish. So I ordered hand cut potatoes that came drenched in salt. Ugh. My wife had the rotisserie chicken that was okay, but nothing more. The best things were the shrimp appetizer and the apple pie dessert. I doubt we'll be back.
