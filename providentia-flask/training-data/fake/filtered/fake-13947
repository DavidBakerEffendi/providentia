Good Dog Bar is a mecca for many different reasons. The dark, roadie environment leaves pretensions at the door and the pub grub is elevated beyond expectation. Friendly yet curt servers manage tables effectively while a strong beer list delivers a punch. The house burger of ground sirloin stuffed with roquefort cheese and topped with caramelized onions is the defining dish here - it is cooked to perfection, sandwiched nicely in a perfect brioche bun, with oozing cheese delivering a creamy, sloppy (in a good way!) bite. The shoe-string fries with sweet potato and a house-made aioli complement one of the BEST (top-five) burgers in the city. This is the only item I ever order here. I have had the mac-and-cheese, which turned out to be a bland overpriced ($13!!) dish that doesn't warrant the price tag - there is an under-delivered flavor that should be hitting you over the head as the multiple cheeses fight for top honor (the blueberry corn bread side is unique but dry!). When you are craving a juicy, unforgettable burger, get the house special and happily use 3+ napkins to wipe the bleu off your hands and the crumbs near your smile!
