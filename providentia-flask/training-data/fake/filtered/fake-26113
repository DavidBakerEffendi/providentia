Excellent, fresh food, and a number of interesting Japanese dishes. Â Definitely try to get a seat at the bar so you can point to the items you want and watch the action. There are a lot of great things to try (grilled mushrooms and chicken were our favorites), but be prepared for smaller portions and the bill to add up quickly.
