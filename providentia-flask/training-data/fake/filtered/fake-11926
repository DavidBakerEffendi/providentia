Exceptional service is the first thing that comes to mind.  Their space is pretty impressive with high ceilings. Ok now the food.  The courses kept coming!  Each was more impressive than the next.  What's really cool is that you get to mix and match your courses from their categories (veggies, seafood, meats, etc).  It's definitely worth trying.
