We were smart enough to go on a slower Monday night, the service was very good, albeit a bit unhurried, which is fine if you don't mind taking your time to dine. The ricotta gnocchi was excellent, some of the lightest I've ever had, and while the polenta fries were slightly bland, the gorgonzola sauce accompanying them made me weep, lol. Overall, a bit pricey for a BYOB establishment, but worth going to again.
