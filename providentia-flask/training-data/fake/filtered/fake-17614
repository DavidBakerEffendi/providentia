I love this restaurant! The staff are always friendly and accommodating. The food is delicious and the menu is simple but diverse. I have been here 3 times now with a group of 7-12 people and every time we all left happy and wanting to come back for more. If you call ahead, ask for Chase who is a great guy They can comfortably seat 16 and "tightly" do 18 people if needed. Also, I recommend the Lamb Burger which is delicious!
