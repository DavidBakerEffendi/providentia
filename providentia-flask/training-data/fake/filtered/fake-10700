great place to go and have wings and food in general , everything worked out great I went their for the first time to experience it. I came here because my Atlanta falcons were going to play against the lions , the service was great it was dead to begin with but after wards a few more people came in and the owner was cool and even offered me a luxury seat which was a great addition to the experience I was having already, definitely would recommend this place to any football or sports fanatic that is out their
