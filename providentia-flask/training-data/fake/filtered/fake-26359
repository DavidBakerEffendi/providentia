I eat here several times a month. The food is always delicious! They always use fresh vegetables and meats. I love sushi but the beef teriyaki and miso soup is divine! The people who work at Sushiya are so very kind and friendly. My experience was nothing but pleasant! I highly recommend this restaurant.
