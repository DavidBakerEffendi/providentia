This time I got #26, a Panang Curry-- a coconut based Thai soup. Being diabetic, I asked to switch the veggies to some greens, and yellow summer squash (lower GI), which they happily did. The spiciness was just right, balancing out the natural sweetness of the coconut milk. I also like it that they offer the whole grain rice, much better for me! Apparently the table receives its entrees when they are done. Two of the three times I have been there, this meant that our table had as much as a 10 minute difference in getting entrees. If there were individual plates brought ahead, we could have more easily shared, although since mine was a soup each time, not completely straightforward; but what's a little awkwardness between friends! It can be pretty loud in there, and the florescent lighting is awful. But isn't that more authentic. Best part aside from the deliciousness factor, is that the portions very generous. My bowl of soup was piled so high with the chicken and veggies that I had enough for two more meals at home.
