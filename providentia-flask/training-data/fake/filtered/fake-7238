Excellent food and very helpful staff!   My wife and I are not foodies.  Our 'date nights' away from the kids usually consists of a night at the Olive Garden.  This was our first time at a 'small plate' restaurant and were not very familiar with the food.  At the waiter's recommendation we choose the Chef's Menu.  We got a sampling of much of the menu and it was great!  I can't say I LOVED all of it but that was only due to the fact that we agreed to try everything, even if it was food that we know we usually didn't like.  I would recommend Tinto to anyone!
