this place is incredible! the food is tastier than most indian restaurants and cheaper too! I bought a couple trays of samosas, butter chicken etc. for a party and the people loved it! The staff is obliging and the service is quick and efficient. When I order meat it is also cut cleanly and well packed. Will definitely be returning!
