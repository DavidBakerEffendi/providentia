I heard great things about this place. so I wanted to try it and in Hell's Kitchen since it's food capital NYC.  Went with the recommended dishes the Matador Combo and Peruvian?  The food was more than enough for me and 3 friends, we each ended taking a piece of chicken and some sides.  The chicken was very juicy and the traditional tostones and maduras were delectable.   The ambience was great for a date and gatherings.  I initially couldn't find the place because the signage was so demure.  I had to look for the address and then realized I passed it.  I would suggest to look for the numerical address, if you've never been. Price wise it can go from $$-$$$ depends on the things you order. Overall, great place to eat and drink!  Going back again soon :)
