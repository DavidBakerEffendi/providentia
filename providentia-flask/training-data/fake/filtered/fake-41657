Ashbox is a cute, colorful and simple cafe in an off the beaten path part of Greenpoint. The design of the place is cute meets sleek- really cool lights and nice colors on the wall. Their seaweed avocado wraps are sooooo good! Great coffee, great little station to put in your milk and sugar, nice selection of teas and all at a reasonable price. Dishes are small but delicious. I'm very thankful to this place for providing me with a comfortable and tasty place to hang out during my apartment search in Brooklyn. The staff is incredibly helpful, one of them even offered to help us find an apartment and gave us a ton of great tips! They also dress to match the decor of the store and the bathroom is quite unique- always a plus. :)
