I went to the Dragonfly for the first time this Thursday for lunch and I fell in love. Â The food is awesome, service was excellent, the decor is beautiful and the hostess was so helpful. I wasn't sure if I should stay or go somewhere else to eat but the hostess recommended the "sizzling mongolian beef" and the "angry dragon tempura roll" and I was quiet satisfied with her recommendations. I will def. be back with all my friends next week. To test out their korean bbq !!!
