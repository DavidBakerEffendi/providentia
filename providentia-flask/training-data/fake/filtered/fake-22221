Terrible and I love sushi! I ended up getting food poison never been so sick in my life! When I called to tell them how sick I got they would only give me a $20 credit towards my next meal! I told them I would never eat at their restaurant again!! They obviously served bad sushi. They were very rude when I called and said they can't give credits
