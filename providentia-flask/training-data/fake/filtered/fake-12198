This place is amazing.  The food is always spot on and the drinks are a creative mix of the unexpected.  I recommend this place to everyone who comes to town!  Just to be clear this is not your average Japanese restaurant.  If you are looking for a california roll go somewhere else.  However if you are looking for a unique culinary experience get there as soon as possible!
