This is one of my favorite places in town! The kitchen is small, service staff is friendly, and the food is delicious.  The owners, a husband & wife, are the chef and head-waitress, it doesn't get any more personal than that. I've worked in restaurants for years, and some people prefer the stuffy, obnoxious chain restaurants.  I do not!  I love these little places where I know the people working really care about me and my experience. Anybody that doesn't like The Mustard Seed Cafe needs to relax a little bit and enjoy a good restaurant.  The owner/chef buys all his food products fresh, never off the wholesale trucks like every other chain restaurant.   Definitely my favorite breakfast and lunch in town!
