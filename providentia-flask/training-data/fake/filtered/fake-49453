I actually plotted to go here after researching on yelp.  I had a very early arrival in Philly on a Saturday, so I knew good breakfast options would be limited.  This place was interesting enough and a pleasant walk from 30th Street Station. The service is what I would call "slacker gracious", meaning they don't do anything super special, but they do support your right to hang out and slack.  I was there right when they opened, so I'm sure it's a different story when they're busy. I got the special french toast, which was caramelized pear and honey.  YUM.  It wasn't super sweet, and the bread was substantial without being too heavy. There are two reasons, however, that I can't give them four stars.  One: the French toast was good, but about $3 too much.  Two: they served my cappuccino in one of those generic clear plastic water glasses. Um, since when does one drink a cappuccino from that kind of glass? I am going to go back again and try that creme brulee French toast, though.  It might be good enough to push my opinion to four stars.
