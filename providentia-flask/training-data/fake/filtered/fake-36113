Went there with a friend for breakfast and decided to double my order of Salmon..my friend didn't know that with the Salmon Benedict the egg yolk is runny and when he was going to ask if they could cook them, the OWNER came out and snatched my plate and said YOU PEOPLE( Im african american male) GET THE HELL OUT MY RESTAURANT. I have never been disrespected in such a manner..I would suggest that you DO NOT EAT AT THIS PLACE...THEY ARE RACIST!!!!!!
