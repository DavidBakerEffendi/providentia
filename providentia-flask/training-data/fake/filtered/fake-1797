What a beautiful restaurant decoration was just unbelievable. This restaurant serves truly Peruvian food at its best I have been to over 100 Peruvian restaurants throughout the United States and this has to be one of my favorite ones. Big flavors great presentations very authentic lovely and delicious. To start we have some very traditional Peruvian dishes and they were very well executed, the ceviche sampler is a great way of tasting different kinds of ceviche. Â I also had the causas and they were really good! The winner of the night was definitely hands-down the seafood rice it was kind of a Spanish paella but Peruvian style portions were perfect and it had so much flavor that it was a dish to remember. Cocktails were also very good service was on point. This restaurant gets five stars because it wasn't just the food or the service or that I'm guess it was a whole deal and it made an experience.
