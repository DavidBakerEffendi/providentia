I went here several times with my friends and wanna say that it was the best restaurant I have ever been. Employees were so nice and friendly even though they were so busy serving foods. All of the foods that I have tried were amazing. The side dishes that come along with were excellentl. The best part is that I can always ask for some more when I'm done with it. I have tried different restaurants at Flushing and Bergen but this place was the best
