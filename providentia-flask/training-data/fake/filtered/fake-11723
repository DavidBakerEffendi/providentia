Palace sushi good place For All-You-Can-Eat sushi, this place is as good as it gets. I just docked it a star because I'm greedy and I wanted fresher sushi and faster order turnover time and All-You-Can-Drink as well. When we went, we were immediately seated. We ordered drinks then out came the write-on menus. We ate maybe three to four rounds? For appetizers, the seaweed spicy (both spicy and not) were incredible and I'd highly recommend. As for sushi, everyone has their own preference. A must order that I really recommend is the Edison and Yummy rolls. They will change your life. For dessert, their green tea ice cream doe! I had one of each. They were all good. Nom nom nom. Also, be ready to food coma for the rest of the day.
