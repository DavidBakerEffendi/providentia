New place since late summer early fall 2014. I've ordered cheesesteak, burrito paisano, burrito mariachi, taco salad, chicken cutlet wrap, 2 XL pepperoni, 1 large bacon sausage &broccoli pizza. Everything was great. Grinders are as good or better tasting than Joey garlics. The Place is clean. I live around the corner and have been to all the restaurants that existed here. Aside from Ella's which was here in 2011, this is the best. The pizza passes my kids test & I love the grinders and Mexican food. Please give this place a try. It's pretty good.
