We walked the bridge in a northerly wind and snow storm with the intention of investigating the pizza at Grimaldi's: my buddy from upstate had 2 things he wanted in his visit, and 1 was the best pizza in NYC. We were not disappointed: crisp base, astonishing mozzarella, wonderful tomato sauce, sharp basil and choose your own toppings. We had a basic pie and added mushroom, pepperoni and roasted peppers to the second: we choose the large pie, 8 slices, and split 2 between 6. If there is one "foodie" must do in NYC for lunch, hit Grimaldi's after you walk the bridge: be prepared to wait, but it is worth it. Cash only and no slices so go with a group or an appetite:-)
