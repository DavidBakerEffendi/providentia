Have had the pleasure of dining at this top notch establishment whenever I'm in Philadelphia, and never a disappointment. The service is always attentive and professional, yet not stuffy or overbearing. It's ambiance is relaxing and subdued, with unique surroundings (the giant squid which adorns the ceiling is awesome) and a beautiful location. The bartenders know their trade - expertly made cocktails and a knowledgable staff when asked about their wine list. The portions are excellent, and the food has always been top quality. Plus, the specials are truly just that. There is even live jazz! What a great place to spend an evening. Whether before or after a show nearby or just for a nice night out, you really can't go wrong. Prices are right in line as well. Five stars is not an easy achievement in my estimation - thank you for the wonderful times and cuisine.
