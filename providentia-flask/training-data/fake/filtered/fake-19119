This is the best pizza I've had since moving to New York. I LOVE Neapolitan-style wood-fired pizza and they do it SO well (no burnt dough here!). The ingredients are fresh and in the exactly correct portion. I've had their eggplant appetizer and it was AMAZING. Fantastic tomato sauce that I will be coming back for on a pasta (if I can avoid ordering the pizza). Plus, how can you not love a pizza with Nutella on it? Isn't that possibly the greatest idea ever! Seriously....ever.
