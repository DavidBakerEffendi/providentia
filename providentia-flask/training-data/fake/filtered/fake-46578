One of my favourite restaurants in the City right now. There are some great things about this place: Beautiful outdoor dining area Hidden location Very attractive waitresses, waiters Good food Extremely reasonable price Very good service It's an excellent date spot, or place to hang out with friends. The only reason I give it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I consider the food to be very solid, tasty, but not exceptional. It's not like eating at Jean George's signature restaurant, for example, but it won't dissapoint.
