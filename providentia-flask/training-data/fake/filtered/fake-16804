Seven of us ate at ABC Kitchens last night and we all agreed that the food was amazing but the service was as bad as it gets. The side dishes came after the meal, dessert after we finished our coffee and after asking for more coffee it came after we finished our dessert- forget about milk or sugar. Simply stated, total neglect. We were forever waving our arms to get the attention of our servers to either pour wine or order. It got so bad that we embarrassingly had to ask our servers their names because we were so tired of saying "excuse me". As good as the Pizza, Crab, Chicken, Halibut Suckling Pig and desserts were, I would never eat in a place tha is so rude and incommunicative again for the average price of $100 per person.
