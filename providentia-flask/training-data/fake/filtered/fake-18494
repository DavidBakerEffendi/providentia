First of all, let me tell you that we were staying at the setai hotel for an extended anniversery getaway and had dinner here as our first major meal in the city.  The restaurant itself is very pleasant inside and had a nice romantic feel to it.  Very soft and quiet (though went around 6:30 so the place hadn't filled in fully yet).  The staff were perhaps some of the best we've had (and we went to several high end restaurants over the weekend).  Our server explained everything to us and gave great suggestions.  We decided to go with the 4 course prix fixe which was more than enough food for us and gave us time to slowly enjoy our meal together.  For the appetizer, I ordered the fio gras (I had never had this before but really wanted to try it).  It was nice and buttery as you would expect after feeding a poor duck to death just to get his liver fatty enough to be spreadable on toasted bread!  My wife had the zupe di aglio (garlic soup) which was one of the best dishes either of us ordered all night.  I then had the risotto with duck confit.  It was amazing and perhaps the best thing I ate all weekend.  My wife had the tortelli which was also nice but a little softer on flavor than my risotto.  I then had the tagliata for my meat dish.  It was decent but not amazing.  My wife liked it more than me -- I was fairly underwhelmed by it.  My wife got the sea bass (spigola) which she really enjoyed except that the fennel flavor on the dish was quite strong and caused everything it touched to taste like black licorrace.  If you like that flavor, you'll love this dish.  The fish itself was cooked and flavored nicely.  We both got chocolate desserts which were both delicious.  Overall, we had a really nice time and the food was above average.  No five stars here just because our main dishes were just ok instead of amazing.
