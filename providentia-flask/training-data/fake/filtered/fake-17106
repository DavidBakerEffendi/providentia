We had an AMAZING dinner. Staff was over the top welcoming and our waiter Besfort was top notch. The restaurant has delightful ambiance. The food did not disappoint. For starters we had the crab cakes which are to die for! Followed by the seared tuna which basically melts in your mouth. Dessert was the chocolate molten cake with red velvet ice cream. OMG i'm torturing myself. There are so many excellent restaurants in the city and Sea Fire Grill is one of them.
