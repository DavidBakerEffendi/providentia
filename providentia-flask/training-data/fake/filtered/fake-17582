The only thing I like here are the eggs benedict, I tried to go for other options but I really went wrong on trying them. They exaggerate the portions of french fries and over pour dressings when it comes to salads. So the only time to enjoy this place is brunch if you only want eggs benedict, but we aware that it is very crowded and even with reservation you will have to wait for a table. The service also is affected with the crowd so don't expect much.
