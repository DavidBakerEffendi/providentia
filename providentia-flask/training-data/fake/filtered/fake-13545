Went to Catfish this past weekend for the Mardi Gras Kickoff party and had an absolute blast! The Decor of the place is excellent....old-timey paintings, exposed brick, nice, sexy, low-lighting.....They even have doors on the ceiling! The bar is well laid out and the tenders are quick and polite. We had no problem getting seated and they happened to have an amazing brass band playing the night we were there. Awesome! I stuck mostly to beer, which they have a decent selection of......very New Orleans authentic. The cocktails that my date tried were all amazing, a real highlight! The Pims cup with cucumber infused lemonade was insane! I could drink six of these no problem, and I don't drink cocktails. The food we tried was all really good, and really reasonably priced. I think we had to order a second batch of cornbread with cinnamon butter because it was just that good. I Tried the beef po' boy which was tender and delicious and my date munched on the sausaage plate, equally as good. The coleslaw was super fresh and the portions were huge....I had trouble finishing. All in all we had a great time and I'll go back in a heartbeat whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
