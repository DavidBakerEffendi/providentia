Too Slow! Today I ordered "Pork Chop Peking Style", "Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce", "Chicken with Broccoli" and "Pepper Steak", four dish only nothing fancy. And two of them were even their dim sum dish. I placed the order over the phone at 11:15AM and I got there at 11:45AM since they said it takes 30 minutes. But I didn't get my food until 12:10PM, almost 1 hour after I placed the order. It's just too slow!!
