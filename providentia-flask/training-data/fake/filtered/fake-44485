Come for the awesome beer selection. 80 beers on tap absolutely beats anything else in town; from pbr to great crafts. Food is decent, Irish pub type burgers and the shepherds pie is great. Come after work and you'll find a great atmosphere hanging out for happy hour, mostly professionals from around the area, decent happy hour drink specials. One of my favorite locals in west Hartford.
