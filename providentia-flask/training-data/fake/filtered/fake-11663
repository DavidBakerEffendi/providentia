I celebrated my son's baptism this past Saturday, the 20th and I had reserved a section for 25ppl from 12-3pm. The experience there was amazing, beyond exceptional. We had the family style and everyone agreed the food was delicious. We chose the empanadas, causa, lomo al jugo, pollo a la brasa, aji de gallina, arroz chaufa and the flan. The celebration was a success thanks to their service and accommodations. I'm Peruvian, born and raised, and know about Peruvian cuisine. The food tasted exactly what it should taste as. The restaurant is small but quaint, clean, comfortable, and not loud which is what I've been used to when I 've gone to Peruvian restaurants in Paterson. Another plus, it isn't pricey and BYOB. My group and I will definitely be returning. =)
