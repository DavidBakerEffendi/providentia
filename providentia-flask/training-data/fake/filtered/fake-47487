Not worth it! My party waited for 90 minutes to get in and the pizza was disappointing along with unenthusiastic service. This company is racking in money on simply hype and good PR. While the pizza is made out of very fresh ingredients, there is hardly any flavor to it and the crust is tough and too crispy, on it's way to burnt. Save your time and opt for a restaurant in the area that actually has a view of the bridge as oppose to being underneath it.
