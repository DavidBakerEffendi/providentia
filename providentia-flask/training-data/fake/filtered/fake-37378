I was there last night for family get together dinner.I DO NOT recommend this place for peaceful dining. In addition to their expensive food to their taste and quality ,the staff is very rude and unprofessional.They take the plates off from guests with out even asking if they are done. No use of telling them any special requests. Such a shame. This is first place I have seen that they tax the gratuity. No knowledgeble response. Total rip off. Over all experience is very bad. Be prepared to get rude and unprofessional treat.
