Just last weekend, I went there for my birthday. From the poor service to the extremely RUDE waiter, I'm not sure where to begin. In fact, I won't waste your time with details. Just know in the end, after a LONG talk with the manager our bill had to be adjusted, including "mandatory" gratuity, cake plating fees, and more. This was in addition to being offered a round of shots as if that liquor makes up for comments laced with racism and prejudice. A waiter or waitress who cannot apologize when no one was rude to them in the first place, ought to be fired.
