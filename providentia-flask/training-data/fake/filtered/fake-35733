I was excited to visit this place based on everything I read online, and it's overrated. Perhaps the hipster aura deceives people into thinking the overall experience is better than it actually is. The menu has interesting options for food and drink. The food is fine, but nothing outstanding. Service was bad. The guy we had seemed like he could care less about us and rushed us out of an empty restaurant, and lost money for the restaurant in the process as we would have ordered more drinks. Food would get 3 but service brings it down. Food was hit and miss between what we ordered. I feel like if you are going to prepare some options on the menu half assed don't bother putting them on the menu.
