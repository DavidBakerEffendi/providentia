I'm not one to usually review, but this being a new spot in the neighborhood I wanted to help get the word out.  The Trading Post just opened and it is a welcomed addition to the neighborhood.  The restaurant is beautiful and has a dark yet comfy feel to it.  The food didn't disappoint, everything was delicious.  We had the iceberg salad, beet salad, skirt steak and a flat bread pizza...all delicious.  Looking forward to trying more of the menu.
