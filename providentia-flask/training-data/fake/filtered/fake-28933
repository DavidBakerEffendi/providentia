A while back (say 8 months ago) my wife and I (and dog) were driving from NYC to Massachusetts and searched for donuts on yelp. Sifting through generic Dunkin Donuts reviews I stumbled upon this place. When I went in I was greeted by the owner. We talked donuts for a while. He clearly took pride in his work. I bought an assortment of flavors and he threw in a couple on the house. I told him I'd review his donuts on Yelp and just remembered to do so now as my wife and I were talking about this place as we plan to stop there on our next trip to Massachusetts this weekend. My apologies for the late review. The donuts were delicious and everyone should support this place. Anyone that takes pride in donuts like this man is worthy of all our business. I'll be there again in a few days!
