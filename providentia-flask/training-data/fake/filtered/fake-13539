Love Catfish! My friends and I had an amazing time. The food was delicious (everyone was raving about how good their food was - catfish poboys, shrimp and grits, jambalya, lobster mac and cheese, chocolate cake (like no other), etc.), service was great, prices were on point and the ambiance allows you to just chill and relax.  Everyone promises to be back to support this wonderful business!  Luke is the best!
