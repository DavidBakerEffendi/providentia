I feel fortunate to have a restaurant like The Spot in my neighborhood. Not only is the food delicious, interesting, and consistent, but their staff is competent and wonderful and the price is right. I frequent The Spot with my 3yo son and he loves it - the giant aquarium is a crowd pleaser, as is the relaxed, surf-inspired decor and vibe. The have ample seating outside in the warmer months, and although the only frontage they have butts up against busy Shelburne Rd., it's still nice to have the option to dine outside when the weather permits. I can honestly say I've never had a bad meal there, and I hope they continue in their awesome groove for years to come.
