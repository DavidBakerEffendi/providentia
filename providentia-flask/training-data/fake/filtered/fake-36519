Brought my wife, 2 small kids and a family friend for pizza dinner. Despite the fact that it was a Friday evening, several tables stood empty. That should have been taken as a culinary red flag. First off, we didn't come here for the beer.  Although our friend enjoyed her frozen margarita, my Towering Long Island Iced Tea was pretty watery. The calamari appetizer, slim pickins' -- looked as if the kitchen staff had their fill before the plate went out the door. The deep-dish Numero Uno pizza, presumably the signature pizza, positively underwhelmed. My kids who go mad over simple cheese pizza didn't even finish their small pies. Was it a really off Friday night for these guys?  Even the men's restroom was smelly. For a location surrounded by a multitude of competing comfort-food restaurants in the vicinity of a major shopping mall, one would think that Uno would make every effort to outshine even Houlihan's next door. But it looks like management positioned this business more as a beer joint rather than a grill-restaurant (according to other reviews here). Yup, you might come here for the beer, but not for the pizza or for the Long Islands. Better yet, take your money next door to Famous Dave's, Macaroni Grill, or Panera.
