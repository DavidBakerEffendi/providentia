Had lunch there.  Thought I try a cheesesteak since that is what the name says.  The worse chessesteak I ever had.  I thought the meat was poor quality,  the roll was slightly steal.  Very disappointed after watching the internet for months saying coming soon coming soon.  Now that it is finally here it should say leaving soon leaving soon.
