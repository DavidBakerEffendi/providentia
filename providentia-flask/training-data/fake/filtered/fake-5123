Fig is great - my wife and I eat there about 4-5 times per year. Â Small menu (one of the indicators that a restaurant is good in my opinion), BYO, great appetizers, great entrees, great desserts, inexpensive for the quality of food --- bring cash though, no cards accepted, i've had to run to the atm a few times.
