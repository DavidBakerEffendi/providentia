I have just moved here from Tennessee and really do enjoy this place a lot.  Yeah, sometimes its really crowded and hard to get to the bar but its worth the wait.  These guys have really good food and the prices aren't so bad either.  Coming from Tennessee (where we do have our fair share of legitimate Irish Pubs) this place is top notch.  Make sure to try out the Lobster Mac & Cheese or the Meatloaf.  Talk about awesome comfort food. Their beer selection is as good as I have seen anywhere up here in the 4 months I have been here.  They have interesting new selections on tap every time I am in there and that Monica girl behind the bar is as nice as they come. As for the person bitching about the popcorn machine being right next to the bathrooms, I don't know what you are talking about.  Where else could they have put the machine and its a good 20 feet plus from any of the bathrooms.  There are kitchens in this town closer to a bathroom!
