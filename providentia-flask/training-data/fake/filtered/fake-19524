I've been to Boccone 3 times for lunch, and the $9 special is unbelievable. Delicious bread and oil, salad, and chicken francaise was amazing. So much food! and the service was always quick and attentive, as well as friendly. Decor and atmosphere is definitely more refined than many restaurants I've seen. Will gladly continue to dine here!
