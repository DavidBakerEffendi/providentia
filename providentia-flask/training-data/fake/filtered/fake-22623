The staff was very pleasant, but the food was OK. The crabmeat avocado mango stack was amazing, but the calamari was very tough. My fiancee couldn't finish the Fresh Sole and Shrimp meal, because she didn't like it. I had the short ribs and it was engulfed in sauce. They were Ok, but the dish was about $10 over priced. My mother had a mixture of seafood over angel hair pasta and she said it was good. We were contemplating having a rehearsal dinner there, but i would not even go back for a regular dinner. As we left I observed a Zagat award from 2003. I guess i know why they haven't received another award in the paste decade.
