The best Mexican restaurant in North Jersey (in my humble opinion) So authentic, really a hidden gem. I'm obsessed with the chorizo tacos, chorizo quesadilla's, and chorizo everything. My boyfriend lovesss the chicken burritos too. BYOB which is always fun. On top of that, this place is fairly inexpensive, but never substitutes that for taste. We go here once a week. Great job Casa Piquin
