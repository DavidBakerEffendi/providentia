If you like tomato paste and gross over cooked oregano filled pizza then Kens is the place for you. I prefer heating up a slice of frozen elios to this place. The bar keep was an a- hole. He reminded me of a Boston bouncer that thinks he is so cool because he has some sort of control. Second time I've been to this place (first time for one drink, but a different jerk at the bar). How do they afford such a great location? Horrible place in my opinion
