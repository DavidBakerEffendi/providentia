I frequent this nice little restaurant whenever I am in the mood for some BBQ ribs or Gyro.  Before Think Grill, the Gyro I can get in the area was from the frozen sliced beef offered in diners and pizza places.  Now, I can get one of three authentic gyro meats that's tasty and fresh.  Reasonable prices and the Family Package is a good deal (1 rack of ribs, 1 chicken, and 1 gyro platter with 2 sides for around $40).  Give this clean place a try.
