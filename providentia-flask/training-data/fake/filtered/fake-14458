My boyfriend lives down the street and kept saying we have to try this place, we finally went. Our first experience was amazing, the staff was so pleasant and helpful. We started with the Lump crab rice balls (AMAZINGGG) and then split a specialty pizza, after that we were hooked. I recently planned a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend there and everything was perfect. The owner was very helpful and accommodating to my needs and requests. We had a private room downstairs which was perfect for the group that I had coming. Again, the food and service was absolutely amazing. The owner even came downstairs to see how everything was, I found that to be very professional, I've worked in restaurants for 17+ years and this by far is one of the best I have been in. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to everyone!! You have to try the rice balls if you go though :)
