Visited from the west coast, but originally from Chi-town.  I love my deep dish pizza, but Jiliana's made me "forget about it".   We had the #4 with prosciutto and arugula (yum, the best), and a custom pepperoni with the smoked mozzeralla.  Fantastic!  I had a tap beer (forget which, last on menu, from Maine?) that was very good, and my husband enjoyed a couple of the ciders. The wait staff was charming and attentive, the best we had in NY, and the oven cooks were friendly and helpful when selecting pizzas. Will DEFINITELY go back if ever in NYC again.  Cheers!
