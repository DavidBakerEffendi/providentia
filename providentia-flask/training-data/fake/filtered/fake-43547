OMG, OMG, OMG - this place is simply awesome - first time was on Christmas - wait was tremenous 1.5 hrs., so we went around the corner for a beer and waited until it died down (around 9) - well worth it.  Anything chili will set your face on fire, but well worth the pain, it was delic - great beer selection and the bartenders knew thier stuff when it came to asking about dinner options.  Will be my new go-to spot !
