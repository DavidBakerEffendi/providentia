I have tried Angelo's twice now and was not impressed both times.  We had place food for delivery.   The first time, I had ordered clams casino and lobster ravioli.  Both portions were small for the price that we paid.  The clams were tiny and there were only 6 per order.  They were mostly breadcrumbs with bacon in a brown sauce.  I didn't even taste the clams.  The lobster ravioli did not come with bread or salad, only 5 ravioli.  Pricey! The second time, I ordered linguini and clam sauce.  This was just pasta with tiny clams (8).  No flavor, no parsley.  No bread or salad.   I will NOT be going back to this place again, especially since there are so many other italian restaurants in town.  Very disappointing.
