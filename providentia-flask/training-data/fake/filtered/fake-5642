Wow. That's all that needs to be said to truly try to explain everything about this restaurant.  Initially I thought I was walking into a restaurant that was extremely high end with very weird meals to choose from, but as they say you shouldn't judge a book by its cover.  I consistently recommend people to try this restaurant and have introduced so many people to it, I swear I should be apart of their marketing team! The food is amazing honestly and I am a very critical person when it comes to food.  I'm a food junkie, I love food. All types of food and I am always trying to find new restaurants to go to in Philadelphia, but this restaurant never seems to disappoint! The menu consists of very typical food with an exotic twist incorporating chocolate-based dips and marinades and sauces.  You would probably cringe at the thought of a chocolate-based food incorporated with something salty like fries, but the dipping sauce with the cocoa powder for your fries is to die for! I don't want to dote on the food there itself because the true beauty rests in a separate booklet of deserts to choose from.  I LOVE sweets! Everyone comes to me when it comes to deciding restaurants to eat at, but they really value my opinion on deserts and sweets.  The booklet contains what I would find equivalent to Heaven, deserts galore.  I hope there is a Max Brenner in Heaven actually. Back on topic, the deserts range from traditional sundaes to desert pizzas and milkshakes.  It's so hard to decide on a desert here because there's bound to be at least four things you are trying to decipher between. All I can say for those of you who are yelping and trying to figure out whether to indulge at Max Brenner is that if you cheat yourself out of this dining experience, you're cheating yourself of a taste of Heaven.  Consider that and get back to me when you eat there. I know you will only thank me later.
