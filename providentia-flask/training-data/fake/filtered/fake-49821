The Hightstown Diner is a small town diner right smack dab in the geographical center of the great state of New Jersey. The food is good, the service is good, and the atmosphere reminds me of "Cheers"-where everybody knows your name. It is a great local eatery with the best chocolate pudding on the planet. I would also recommend the roast turkey dinner, steak, tuna melt, cheese steaks, burgers, fries, onion rings, navy bean soup, and cheesecake. They also make awesome milkshakes! The lunch and early bird dinner specials cannot be beat and are an amazing value, especially with today's economy. The patrons are mainly locals and they all bring a great hometown atmosphere. If you are looking for good food at good prices in a small town atmosphere in a metro area, then you must try the Hightstown Diner and say hi to a wonderful throwback to a simpler time.
