This restaurant is my favorite in Princeton hands down.  I have been to Agricola twice with my wife, most recently last night, and we have had a great experience both times.   My night started out with a black tea sour- a great cocktail featuring bourbon and an egg white from their farm.  As the bartender explained, Agricola has it's own farm in Skillman where they source their eggs as well as some produce.  Our table was delayed a few minutes so the bar manager talked more about the concept with us and offered us a taste of a wine we were curious about.  We thought this was a nice touch. The food was also excellent. We shared the octopus appetizer which we both loved - it had a nice char on it but was still very tender.  Following that, I had the braised short ribs which literally fell apart when I touched it with a fork.  The horseradish gremalota added brightness to the dish.  My wife had the arctic char which was cooked perfectly very moist and fresh tasting with delicious fingerling potatoes complimenting the fish. Service and ambiance were also both great.  This is an inviting and fun place to dine  - something that Princeton really was lacking.  Excited to return.
