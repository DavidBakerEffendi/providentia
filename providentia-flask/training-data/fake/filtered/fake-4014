I found this restaurant thru restauant.com. This has turned out to be a wonderful find. It is not often that you find Uni and Hamachi Kama in a NJ sushi bar (they are very costly) but they have it here and it is always fresh & delicious. I have been there many times now and look forward to going again very soon!
