Ever since i was little girl i wanted to go to Italy and try italian real food. Then When I grew a little I went to Little Italy in NYC and thought hmmm i wonder if this is how the italian food is like and I was not too much a fan of italian food anymore :0( ...BUT last year I discovered Eataly !!! It changed the way I saw italian food. Or any Food. I love Eataly. Their Pasta, Pizza, Gnoohis (sp) Veggie section SeaFood AND the best part Cafe!! I Love Eatly ( I think i already said that in last line) But this is becoming my fav past time in the city. Who needs to go out in cold? Eataly is clean and you can get everything there. even real interesting cooking books. I can spend hours hours in Ealaty. Its little expensive BUT hey i dont need to go to Italy to get real italian food atleast So it turns out even! Thanks Mr Mario Battoli and crew !!
