This place lives up to its name. its the standard for gastropub fare in the Philadelphia area. I've had some of the best meals of my life in this pub. They aren't afraid to be inventive, but the meal is always substantial. You won't sacrifice quantity for quality. Do yourself a favor and be adventurous here, and ask the waitress for recommendations if you need help. You will be in for a nice surprise.
