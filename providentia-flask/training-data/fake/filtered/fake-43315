Ive been to many greek restaurants and this was the first that i loved! The appetizers were a small portion so you can get a few different ones and share so you can really get a good variety. The main dishes are not to big but just the perfect size you will feel content not heavy and full! The food is so flavor full its not plain and the flavor does not take over the food! The deserts are great and just the right size!!!!! I hate red wine i really do but guess what i drank 3 glasses of red wine it was amazing i loved it! I cant say enough about the food and the atmosphere the decor is so warm and inviting. I cant wait to go back. It should be on everyones list if they love greek food and a cozy romantic atmosphere.
