My favorite pizza in all of NYC.  Dom is a true artisan.  Waiting for good pizza is tough with a long lunch line which is all too familiar with anyone who has been to Di Fara.  The best plan is to order early and get there early to get some awesome pizza.  Whether it's square slice or round, i like them all.  You just have to try it.
