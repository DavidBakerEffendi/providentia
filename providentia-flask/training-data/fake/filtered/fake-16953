New go to spot- watch out Cafe Gitane! It's one of those places where you want to try everything on the menu, wine list is a bit extensive but in a good way, and staff is really friendly and relaxed. The interior has character and you will find yourself sitting there for hours. Just know in advance that plates are small and seating is crowded (much like a real Parisian bistro). A friend of mine took me and we shared 3 plates - plenty of food plus had a bottle of wine. Spent about $40 each- amazing! Please go and enjoy - Bon appetit!
