They're service is rude and completely self-entitled. Every phone call with them, I was repeatedly put on hold when they didn't feel like talking any more and was hung up on intentionally. Their business practice sucks and I strongly believe that businesses with such poor customer service should not be visited. I highly recommend NOT using Sukhadia for any events. We have wasted hours on hours dealing with them to no avail.
