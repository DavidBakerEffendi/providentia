Not the same anymore! We have been to Le Grainne a couple of times in the past and never had a bad experience. We ordered the mussels which turned out to be too salty! The waiters had to be asked a couple of times for bread and water. For a French place you would expect the crepes to be spot on. But here the bananas they used were underripe with no flavor to the chocolate making the crepes extremely bland. The batter was stringy. One of the worst we have had. Left most of it. Will not be back.
