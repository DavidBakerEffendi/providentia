I've only ever had their falafel laffa, so I can't comment on the quality of anything else. That said: OH MY SWEET BABA GANOUSH. Whenever I'm within an hour of being hungry and within 3 blocks (even long blocks) of this place, I make every effort to stop by. The falafel laffa is enormous and delicious and at, at $5.95 plus tax, an awesome bargain. I usually go at odd hours so the lines are rarely long if there are any at all. Sometimes I get the food to go or stay to eat on a repurposed bowling lane.
