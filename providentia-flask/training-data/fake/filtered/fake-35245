I have never written any reviews on here but I had a blast at Gaia and I wanted to share. I'm from Italy as well and I had many problems to find real Italian food in town and then I discovered Gaia: amazing coffee, delicious and original Italian food and a very cozy environment. The owner, Gaia, is super welcoming, friendly and I always have a good time talking to her. I think it's amazing and give it 5 stars.
