My friend and I went to this place today because we thought they should have nice food and would not be expensive. True, the prices of the dishes weren't expensive, however, the quality of the food doesn't even worth the price that we paid. My friend ordered a vegetable and yam noodle soup for $ 8, but the vegetable seems like coming out as a frozen product, moreover, it was like it was in the fridge for a long time and it was not fresh and has yellowish, slimy looking appearance. My friend told me she can even make it at home by herself. For me, I ordered a salmon teriyaki dish which cost me $10.75, and it was okay, the kind of food you can just get at anywhere. The food wasn't the worst part, it is their poor service that makes me rate them with only one star. There was rarely a service other than food delivery to our table. No water adding, nor asking if anything is needed. At the end of the meal, they asked for 20% tips for the whole thing! Moreover, the way they asked was very rude: the waitress counted the bills in front of us, and told us what we give was too little. I do not think they deserve an almost 20% service tips, not to mention the quality of the food and their attitude! I will never come to this restaurant again, and it is just a below-standard restaurant. I feel if you really want a good noodle soup or nice rice dishes, Menchanko-tei could be a better choice, which I think the food is much better and not pricy either. Â But definitely not recommend Udon West, a kind of restaurant that you can see at anywhere.
