After walking around church street looking for food my girlfriend and I went out on a whim and decided to try Asiana Noodle Shop instead of settling for some of the more generic restaurant choices.  It was some of the best food we have ever had and we left with full bellies, more than satisfied appetites, and money still left in our wallets.  The service is great and very helpful and the food is so much more than we imagined.  The menu is rather large allowing customers to pick from pre-arranged meals or allowing one to mix and match their own meal.  The food it self was extremely tasty and I must say some of the best food I have ever eaten.  We both left we huge smiles and fully bellies.  It is also a great destination for the hungry vegan or vegetarian.  The food is also healthy and leaves you feeling full without the negative effect of drowsiness and lethargy that most restaurants with their deep fried or butter smothered dishes tend to do.  IF YOU ARE ON HUNGRY AND IN THE BURLINGTON DO YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS A FAVOR AND GO TO THE ASIANA NOODLE SHOP.  YOU ABSOLUTELY WONT REGRET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
