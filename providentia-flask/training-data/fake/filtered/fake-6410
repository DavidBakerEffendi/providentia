After reading so many great reviews I decided to give it shot. The cheese sauce served with the fries was delicious, although I like my fries to be a bit crispier. It took a long time for my burger to come out. I got cheddar cheese, bacon, onion, avocado and harissa aioli on my burger. It was such a mess. the whole thing just kept falling apart, everything was falling out and could barely find or even taste the harrissa aioli or my cheddar cheese. The cheese was so melted it was dripping right off the burger. The burger patty itself had no seasoning that was detectable. I truly believe peoples minds are tricked into thinking these burgers are out of this world because of the multiple options of toppings and sauces they are given. The bun couldn't even handle the burger, after 2 bites my bun was falling apart and completely saturated. A great burger starts with a well seasoned patty and a bun that can handle it! I also tried one of their milkshakes which was nothing special. I will not be returning anytime soon if ever. I have had much better and more flavorful burgers closer to home. Not worth the trip in my book.
