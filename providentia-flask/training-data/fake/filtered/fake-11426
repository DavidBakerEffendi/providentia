As a native New Yorker, it's hard to impress me.  I was finally able to get to Eataly with some out of towners.  It was so much fun!    The variety and quality of the food in the numerous food areas was delightful.  I could have grazed there all evening!  We also had some celebrity sightings.  Well worth a trip and I can't wait to go back.
