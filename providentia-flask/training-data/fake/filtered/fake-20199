Wanted to try something different while in NY and thanks to Yelpers for the recommendation!  Good German/Austrian beers on tap and food and service was great.  I had white asparagus with ramp sauce for appetizer - very light and tasty.  For main course I had to try the emmentaler sausage based on all the reviews. The quark dumplings were fantastic.  Definitely recommend!
