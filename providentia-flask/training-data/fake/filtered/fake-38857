Great place. We went last night.  We enjoyed the 10 course tasting, plus 2 more dishes that I couldn't leave without having: Foi Gras & the Grilled Octopus.  I never had MonkFish liver, until last night and it was out of this world.  My favorite dish was the sardines three ways.  My wife's favorite was the soft boiled duck egg with lamb bacon and maple syrup. The entire night felt like we were judges on Iron Chef. The food, service, and decor were top notch.  It was a perfect setting for such a cold night.
