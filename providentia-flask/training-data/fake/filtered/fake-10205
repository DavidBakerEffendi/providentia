I stopped going to Thai Awesome a few years ago because the quality was sub-par to other Thai in the New Haven area. I don't know what's different about the management or anything but I can say that the quality of the food has gotten so much better. It's fresh, delicious and reasonably priced. The service is great whether you eat in or take out. Highly recommend.
