I would like to focus my comments on the Queens Kickshaw's coffee service.   I have ordered espresso drinks about five times, and I have ordered V60 pour over coffee more than a dozen times in the past year. The coffee program is high quality. They stock about four premium bean options brewed to order in a V60 pour over (and also available by the pound).  This means you get an excellent, flavorful cup of coffee. Expect to wait a couple of minutes and expect to pay a little more for the quality; it's the nature of making coffee this way. Espresso drinks at the Queens Kickshaw are the best I've tasted in Astoria.  The quality of the shots is in the same league as Gimme!, Ninth Street, and other reputable cafes.  On two occasions (both in the afternoon, and both at presumably slower times for espresso drinks), the barista has discarded a shot before pulling a correct one to serve.  The baristas warm the coffee cups with hot water and they steam the milk to order for each espresso drink. Overall the people at The Queens Kickshaw make premium coffee well.
