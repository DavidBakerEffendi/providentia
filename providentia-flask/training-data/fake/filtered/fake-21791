A visit to Philly without going to the Reading Terminal Market is not a proper visit. This place is phenomenal with so many excellent choices. This is not a food court where only a handful of vendors are good. Here you will want to eat everything and not have enough stomach space. What to do? Buy some things (like cookies, sandwiches, and chocolates) to go and eat it later. This is a good place to go for lunch or brunch. Even breakfast. You can go to the diner or eat the food of the Amish.
