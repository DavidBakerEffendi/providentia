This place is terrible.  Mediocre food during the day.  At night the bouncers are far too aggressive and create a very negative atmosphere; they use any excuse they can to become violent and in general enjoy their power trip over customers.  Bar doesn't take credit on weekends.  I would recommend staying away from this place.
