Well went there for lunch today and had to walk out before our food came. 40 min. went by and still nothing! Complained to the manager and never saw him again until we got in the car and saw him walk out the door on the phone no less! If this place expects to do a working lunch crowd they better get the food out a lot faster. Will never last in Clifton, too many other good places to go! Will NEVER go back!!
