I usually don't go to brunch that isn't Bottomless BUT I always make an exception for Hope Garage! They have the best chicken and waffles I have ever had!!! They make a maple syrup cinnamon butter for the waffles so you don't even need syrup! The chicken strips are great too but THE BUTTER is what makes this dish so amazing! The drinks are great and they have a bunch of simple syrups so you can kid of customize your cocktail if you want a different type of liquor! One day I will make it there for dinner, but for now? Brunch will do!
