I liked it... Â the pysters were wonderful!! the other food.. well.. not so sure.. the atmosphere was pk.. maybe the place is a little overrated (since I had seen it busy very often).. but overall I enjoyed it.. my boyfriend fell in love with some lobster platter... I am not so sure.. what it was.. something with lobster on a roll.. and the service was nice and easy! would like to go back some time... but I didn't fall in love!
