I used to love going to Jimmies a few years back. They seemed like they used to be on top of their game. Nowadays, not so much. I am nostalgic towards the Savin Rock memories they have plastered all over their walls, but my experience there is something I never want to remember. First off, you'd think a place specializing in seafood would have decent lobster bisque. That assumption was my first mistake. When it came out, and I see another Yelper noticed, it had grown an awkward thick skin on the top of it. I literally had my wife take the first few spoonfuls off the top, because I was refused to eat some thick slop they mislabeled as lobster bisque. It was mediocre tasting when I finally did try some. Too salty for me. Next, the waitress was nothing but completely rude. She not only reeked of cigarettes (and Jimmies has a strong seafood scent, so being able to smell like anything else is impressive) but everything she did was rude and snappy. I couldn't help but get distracted by the bright green piece of gum she was chomping on as she served us. The icing on the cake was when we sat there for over 45 minutes waiting for nothing other than a toasted tuna sandwich for my son that she originally forgot to add onto the ticket. Ridiculous. Only receiving two stars because I remember how it used to be when I was younger.
