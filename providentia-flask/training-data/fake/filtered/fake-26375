We were seated at the end of a long unoccupied banquette which angled at our end. After a few minutes another couple was seated right next to us. Because of the angle the other guy and I were brushing shoulders. I asked the server if we could move to the empty table next to us in the otherwise empty section of the restaurant. She had to check and returned to say the table was reserved. I said the other customer was practically sitting in my lap and she replied that is the "French" style. She offered a table in some other section of the restaurant, but we didn't feel like carrying our meal there, so I pulled my chair into the aisle. How do you get two stars for an otherwise good (expensive) meal? Piss me off.
