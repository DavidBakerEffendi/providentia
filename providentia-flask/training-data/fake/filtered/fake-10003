I am IN LOVE with this place! I am from South Carolina and make sure I stop there EVERY time I am in Philadelphia. The prices are reasonable, I've never had as long of a wait as some people say they have (I tend to go during the earlier morning), the food is amazing and the wait staff is always sweet! This place was pointed out to me by a concierge Â at the Sheraton in center city two years ago and breakfast will never be the same for me! Easily my favorite food spot in Philadelphia!
