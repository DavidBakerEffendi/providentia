I always choose some restaurants and shops that has long line, because i think maybe it is delicious if many people are waiting for it.. But I'm really disappointed with the pizza vendor at Broadway Bites. .I ordered a spicy pizza it was rip-off. It cost 12 dollars! It wasn't worth for the pizza's quality and too spicy to eat!The only good thing is they has good customer service,if you pursuiting good service and you don't mind spend too much money on a not delicious food you can choose that,but I recommended you can skip it!I will never come back!
