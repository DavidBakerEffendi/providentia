Today I dined with a client and a close friend for a business lunch who is a CIA trained chef. To start off my swordfish had the texture of rubbery play doe , his salmon was burnt to a crisp, and the salads our clients had where spoiled. I mean how do you mess up salad!?! Second all of the sides had a frozen and chemical taste to them. To make matters worse I am back from eating about two hours now and I already had to make two stops to the bathroom. Obviously the fish was leftover from the order on Thursday and to charge $200 for a meal that was inedible and possibly unsafe is unbelievable to me. This place should be shut down. The chef we dined with had a great comment facebook friendly meaning great decor with zero gourmet. Please heed my warning and take the extra ten minutes and drive to any of the great restaurants located in downtown Princeton at this price point you will have a much better dinning experience. Our server was also extremely slow and half of the house was empty...
