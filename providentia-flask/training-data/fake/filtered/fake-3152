I went to Mexican Mariachi last week with my friend after our class got out and we hadn't eaten all day so needless to say we were both very hungry. The lady at the cash register was one of the friendliest people I've ever met and I had the Mariachi Plate and loved every bite of it.  The chips and salsa you get with the meal are very homemade and unique tasting and if you're not careful will fill you up before you have your actual meal!  The chips were thick and the salsa was just spicy enough where it didn't ruin the meal for me.  The tostada I had was great also. I will definitely be going back.  I'd eat here over Chipotle and conveniently for me Mexican Mariachi is located way closer!
