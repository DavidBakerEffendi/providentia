I dont do this often, writing reviews! i came on yelp to see whether Malaparte had already some. I enjoyed reading the 1st one because it goes along with how I feel about this new restaurant in the west-west village. i have eaten here 3 times since they open 2 weeks ago. i like the warm and cozy atmosphere - combination of an airy room and cool range of italian and american accents-decor - comfortable marble bar you can eat at. the food tastes fresh and is well prepared every time!! I had the best baked clams and sea-food salad last night, the pizza may become my favorite! thin, focaccia-like with great choice of toppings, "dell'orto" is simple with baby rucola a couple of cherry tomatoes and shaved parmigiano or another with funghi e truffle oil! divine! just like i can have at my favorite restaurants in Tuscany! the salmon was cooked to perfection not dry and branzino what a surprise to find here, my friend had the pork-chop it was  tender and juicy over mashed potatoes, delicious! I got somewhat upset when I read the second review where the whole experience of dining there is described as "not good enough for New York"!! maybe some of us have a different sense of time and appreciate different foods and enjoy writing nasty reviews to a business that can still be looking for it's niche on it's second week! I guess as a diner in a lousy mood one cannot count  on the good italian restaurant to alleviate the agony! try a yoga class! i enjoy the casual buddy-like attitude of the waiters that do just their job and leave you alone to enjoy the meal making sure you are satisfied! it works with me! by the way the vegetarian lasagna is mouth watering and about the only pasta on the menu! but if you really want pasta their other restaurant Malatesta it's where you can get it 5 min walk from malaparte.
