The place is beautiful the person at the parking lot fantastic, the service was absolutely awful!! We went to the bar,Jan 6 2014, had 2 beers and couple of menus. Waited for 17 minutes and none of the two bartenders bother to ask us if we were ready to order!!! Paid our $13.00 for the two beers, no tip, and we gave the copy of the credit card bill with our cell number to the manager of the place on our way out. Still waiting for a call! My worst experience in the tri state since i came back from Europe,by the way i am a chef and owner of two restaurants. Bravo and good luck.
