I've never had dinner here, but let's be real.  The breakfast food is mediocre but I'm so hung over I can barely eat it anyhow. The drinks are the best.  Big Ball jars of strong mimosas and bloody marys are what this place is all about.  The staff is friendly.  They'll make you a nice hot toddy if you ask too.   Good hungover brunch place.  Don't bring your epicurean friends here though.
