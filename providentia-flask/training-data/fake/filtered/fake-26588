Everyone is always bragging about this place and the pizza is horrible! I ate there twice and they burned my pizza, after i told them not to, and they don't use a good quality cheese. However, people are usually drinking beer when they eat the pizza here so they can't even taste it anyway!! If you know what good pizza tastes like, minus the alcohol, your not going to eat here! Just look at the pic of the cheese pizza on the other review, it doesn't look very appetizing!?
