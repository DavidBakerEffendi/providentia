Over-rated.  Had high hopes since this is a Batali restaurant.  This is NOT TAPAS but tapas STYLE.  Portions are large, and the service was pushy and unhelpful.  I was expecting a large variety of light, Spanish fare.  Even in the middle of the day they were over-eager to turn over tables and get you out the door.  This is not the Basque way. On the plus side is the decor.  Skip this place.  Life is too short to be treated rudely.
