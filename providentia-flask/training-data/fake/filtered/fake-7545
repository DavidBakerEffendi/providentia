My initial trip to the Elbow Room was little to be desired. Our server took forever, the food was sub-par, they weren't friendly and attentive.  I've been once and although I'm all for second chances, I've been hesitant to revisit this establishment. I liked the environment but the service downgraded the experience completely.  It's been a few years, I might give them another chance. Maybe not after reading other Yelp reviews.
