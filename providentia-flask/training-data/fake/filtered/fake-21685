Nice looking place. I went with a group of 6 friends here. Most of us enjoyed our dishes and left Â our dishes clean!! Overall, the food was delicious but a bit too spicy for me. And just a heads-up, the Chicken Tikka Masala has more of a tomato sauce taste. The wait time was a quite long, which was due to the crowd of people ordering. However, we sure got our reserved table on the dot (call just to confirm your reservation).
