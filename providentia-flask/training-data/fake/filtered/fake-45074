I've been to the Reservoir several times.  I have ordered take out and have dined in.  Each time I have gone I have only ordered the pizza.  To be honest, I really enjoy the pizza.  The thin crust had been consistently well charred.  The pizza is a bit salty but that's my preference. I'm only giving Bevacqua's a 2-Star rating considering everything but the pizza is pretty unsat.  Waiting for a table is understandable, waiting for pick up after already giving them a 30 minute wait is not.  On pick-ups rarely have they managed to get it right or actually prepared and ready.   Service, in my experience, has been consistently terrible.  The hosts rarely show themselves and servers, well be prepared to have a headache. The last time I went, I didn't even have pizza.  We actually sat down in record time thinking it was luck.  It wasn't.  The pizza oven had died and no staff felt it necessary to share the information until drinks were served.  By the time we placed our order and got the bad news I looked around and maybe a handful of people were still dining.   I wonder how well their new pizza oven is working.
