I've had dinner here twice and just drinks once. All three visits were great. The menu options are decent and the food is good. Both times I had dinner I had fish and it was Â really good and cooked well. I do wish they had some lighter options on the apps and entrees menu. However, they are always happy to accommodate special requests. For instance, all their fish seems to come "crusted' with something, however, if I just ask for pan-fried or simply grilled they will do it. My family enjoyed their meals as well. We had really good experience with our server both times. We had an older gentleman that was very attentive and very honest about the best choices on the menu. I could see that some of the younger servers could probably use some training. Drinks at the bar are great too. They have a good selection of cocktails and the wine menu is great. Would LOVE if they would bring in some QUALITY CRAFT beers (FYI: Miller, Coors and Budweiser will never make a real craft beer)! All and all it's a nice place and a great addition to the neighborhood.
