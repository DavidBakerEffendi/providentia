we have been eating at brick lane for quite some time now.  we even catered from their ny location.  we live in nj and have been to the location at montclair and ridgewood.  we are extremely disappointed with their customer service at their ridegwood location.  we tried to get reservations and had called numerous amount of times to make reservations for a big party, but neither the manager uday nor sanjeev had the courtesy to take my reservation.  we had made calls for a huge diwali party and now for the new years party.  it is a real shame.  i truly hope that someone takes the initiative to correct this.
