I was there friday night around 10pm with my girl friend to eat some tapas ... -First plate asparagus, the best of the dishes...very good! -After warm marinated olives (idk why it says marinated olives, because marinated would be some spices with fresh rosemary and extra- virgin olive oil, it was not that) - ceviche with bread -proscuitto with bread -trufle panini with bread -cheese with bread -ect.... I don't understand why there's so much bread everywhere, its way to much. That is not tapas. Too much bread kills the flavor. It fills up the customer & ruins the true experiene.
