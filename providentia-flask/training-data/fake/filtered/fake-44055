Wonderful experience. My small son loves boats and wanted to ride the SI ferry. The grandparents were visiting so we made it a family trip. The only thing we needed to make the plan complete was a place to eat lunch on SI before taking the ferry back. I searched Yelp for reviews on places near the ferry and this place sounded like a good bet - and it so was. Beautiful looking -- and smelling -- pizzas greeted us as we came in, Frank Sinatra was on the PA but not too loud, the caeser salad had shaved parmesan on it, the pitcher of Sierra Nevada was perfect with the super-delicious thin crust pizza, and the service was completely kid-friendly. Even the mozzarella sticks had flavor! Great place, great experience, would absolutely recommend and come back.
