We have taken to Agricola as our new local favorite restaurant. The food is excellent - the farm fresh vegetables could make for a meal themselves. And of course the entrees are brilliant. The service is very good and getting better, noticeably improved from the first few weeks. Finally, the facilities are beautiful and create a great dining ambience. My favorite spaces to dine are adjacent to the kitchen or in the bar area on the tables by the window. I am pleased to recommend it to anyone, locals or visitors to Princeton. Enjoy.
