Was there last saturday night.  The place was packed and a very nice setting so may wife and I took that to be a good sign, it was not.  The service was lacking, my manhatten was not good and all of our food was subpar. We started with the tri tower on our servers recommendation and selected 3 dips, thai steak egg rolls and dates rapped in bacon.  It's my fault that they were each so random but steak was chewy and the bacon/date combo was odd.   The wedge salad was flavorless, it tasted like watered down sour cream with a bit of crumbled bacon and just as little blue cheese.   Dinner was scallops served over potato cakes, each cake was consistently gummy and there was red cabbage served over top, the presentation was quite bazaar.   The halibut special was just as bad.   The fish as rubbery and lacked any flavor good or bad and was served with veggies that again lacked taste.  There was nothing appealing about either meal. We skipped dessert.
