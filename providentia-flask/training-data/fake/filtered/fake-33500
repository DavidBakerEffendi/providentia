This place is very good - I live a few blocks away on Tehama and it is a quick walk.  It is one of the nicer places in the area & the food is very good - most items are reasonably priced & the brunch is great & priced well.  Some of the specials are a little high.  Service is fantastic.  Overall I would highly recommend.
