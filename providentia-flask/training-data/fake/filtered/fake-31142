Food is good, but service is horrendous. I went last night for dinner, figure how busy can it be on a Sunday night? It was mildly busy with open tables, and only what appeared to be two waitresses. Had to ask for more water twice. Asked for pita bread which never even arrived. In my opinion, not worth spending $60 for two people when the service is terrible.
