I love Habanna! Cheap beer, good drinks, great food- you MUST get the corn! So tasty. The only drawback is on a saturday night the food truck gets a little hectic and it's hard to snag a table/get your food at the same time without a team of a few people! But so much fun, it's worth the wait in line!
