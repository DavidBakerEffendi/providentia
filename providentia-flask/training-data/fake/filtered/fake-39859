Hard to rate...they would not even serve us. We wanted to have dessert and coffee, and when we stopped in to inquire we were rudely told "We don't serve just coffee". We offered to sit at the bar..and we were snapped at a second time. It's not that it was busy...there were only two tables occupied. I won't attempt to return.
