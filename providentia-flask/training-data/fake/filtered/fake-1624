I've given this place too many chances. Whenever I use my debit card there, when I check my account it turns out they charged me like $5 more than what it was at the store. A few weeks ago, one guy who works there sneezed on his hand, picked up the slice of pizza I wanted with that hand, and did not wash his hands before that. Recently, my friend and I used a coupon there, and they charged us double instead. It makes me mad because the food is not bad. They need new people working there, or someone to teac them to wash their hands.
