Dinner was a huge disappointment!  First time dining there and eager to have a good experience.  Service was on the slow side and uninterested, but more importantly, the food was mediocre at best.  Crab and artichoke dip appetizer was flat and in desperate need of a hit of acid or some fresh herbs (though the homemade fried pita chips were good).  Salmon entree was ok, not great.  Seafood linguini really fell short.  Olive Garden does better!  The pasta was mushy (way overcooked), broth was watery and lacking in flavor, and the seafood was fishy and way overcooked.  Only ate it because I was really hungry!  Will not be returning any time soon, in spite of high average rating on Yelp.  Maybe it was an off night, but totally unimpressive.....
