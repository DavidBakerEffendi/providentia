Great spot for groups with admirable crowd management and deep selection. Look: kind of a toned down Joe's Crab shack.  i'll give points for them not stapling crap everywhere and creating to much visual noise.  Kind of reminds me of a nice blend of Water Taxi Beach and Seacrets in Ocean city visually. Food: This was a liquid lunch and i'll give compliments to a very wide and diverse selection of beers and cocktails.  my group was here for the better part of 4 hours and the depth of the menu allowed us to keep things interesting.  I was pleased with their pricing as well with yellow beer running around $4 a can to regional specialties about 6. They sling a fine Michelada here as well. Experience: Staff was very accommodating on my groups dithering as to when or if we were going to eat and move our reservation around accordingly.  This is a very comfortable spot and they bar staff showed some hustle and worked to get folks taken care of quickly at the up and downstairs walk up bars.   I'd ask they put some kind of sign up alerting folks to the relative steepness of the center stairs and i get the impression anyone without full use of their facilities might be stuck in the bathroomless downstairs.  Great spot for large groups and and kids.  The bags/cornhole sets are a nice touch as well.
