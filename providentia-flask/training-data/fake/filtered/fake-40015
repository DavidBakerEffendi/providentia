Never have I ever had more incredible French toast in my life. The syrup tasted as if it had just come from the tree. The outside of the toast was light brown and crispy while the inside was fluffy and warm. It's honestly amazing. The egg sandwiches my friend and I had more great, as well. My table of four split the brown butter pecan tart and dark chocolate torte with mascarpone for dessert. We were left scraping the plates with our forks trying to struggle for one more taste. This was coming from four people who were "too full" for dessert. Nice service, relaxed ambiance. A little crowded and you may have to wait a bit.
