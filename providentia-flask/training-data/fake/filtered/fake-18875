Had it with this place, it is not what it use to be!! The guys working on 17th st are nasty behind the take-out counter. Â Yesterday for the third time while waiting for their signature Artichoke and Margarita slice to warm up I had to endure the Pizza guy once again and his fellow employees curse and use foul language. This time the "Fat Pizza-jerk" was picking in slang Spanish this poor Mexican helper. The little guy had his hands in his pocket not knowing what to do. The language was filthy and the bullying was over the apex!!. I got my two slices and split to encounter too quickly part 2 of the disappointment.... The crust of the Artichoke was stale and dry, the Margarita was better but the crust goneso! So bad energy and stale crust makes me run the other way!!! A fav of mine for Pizza, Artichoke Basille now a nothingness!
