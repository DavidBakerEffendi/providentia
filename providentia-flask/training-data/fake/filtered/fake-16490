Arlington Pizza is a really busy, yet fun and friendly environment. They are now under new management but the staff is basically the same. They are all very friendly and it is truly a place where everybody knows your name. The food is really good and amazingly I'm not sure if it's my imagination but the other day I ordered a pizza with spinach and ham for delivery and it tasted better than ever! I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is new in town cause everyone else already knows it's the best.
