I work down the street and was craving some ramen...  I called Hiro Ramen to order for me and my coworkers, and the unfriendly boy who answered the phone says, "We ran out of to go containers.".  Is this some kind of joke?  Either the entire staff is incompetent or they just don't want to make to go orders. Needless to say, I will never come back.
