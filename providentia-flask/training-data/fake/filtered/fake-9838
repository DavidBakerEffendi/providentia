We went the day after Valentine's Day, and I must say, it was pretty incredible. From the kampachi tartare, which was amazing, to the chili lobster and homemade cavatelli, the meal was fantastic. The chicken under a brick was more than enough for four, let alone two. And to top it off the night, we had milk and cookies. Excellent.
