joined friends here for thanksgiving dinner....first time here.... food was savory....perfectly seasoned......had the salmon....turkey....corn pudding....collard greens....traditional mashed pototoes and gravy with some of the best gravy ever.....had a leisurely 3 hour dinner with a bottle of wine that we brought with us (BYOB)...we arrived there at 100...........the closest thing to being at home without the cleanup!....absolutely a delightful experience for the palate without feeling rushed...the food here is prepared with TLC......
