I really hate to say this because I'm a huge fan of Collichio's.  But Riverpark was totally underwhelming.  The food was utterly bland, predictable, and boring.  Granted, I ate there before their "official opening" so maybe they're still sharpening their menu up, but I won't be returning any time soon.
