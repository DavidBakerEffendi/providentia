the appetizers are a reasonable price, so you can sample more than one appetizer and not pay a crazy price. the food is priced very well and everything is always freshly made. unfortunetly we have gone there on busy nights and they have run out of food. we suggest that you try to avoid going on a friday and saturday night, because you will have to wait a long time for a table and there is not ample room for all the people that are waiting. normally you will get stuck standing on the stairs waiting for a table. the seating arrangement is very cramped...but the food quality and prices make up for it. the dessert is always good as well. just try to go at a not so busy time and you should be okay. do not bring your children....they are best left at home because the tables are very tight.
