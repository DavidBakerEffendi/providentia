Amazing little nugget hidden on an "off the main road" street but well worth the search. The food is unbelievably great. The atmosphere is quaint, nothing pretentious, well lit and small. I cannot tell you how fantastic the duck was, the clams with chorizo, the mussels, the sole, the pork belly, on and on... everything was delicious. Not a single bad dish to be had. The Bread Pudding is definitely the perfect ending. Can't wait to go back.
