I was told about a wonderful small establishment that served the best "soul food" in town...My husband and I drove to New Haven to meet a friend and have lunch.  What a treat.  We were greeted at the door with a warm welcome and inviting enviroment.  We ordered our meal which included, fried chicken, mac and cheese, greens, and black-eye peas and rice, along with a delicious glass of sweet tea.  It was a well prepared meal and the owner and staff should be complimented for their services. So if you are looking for a home cooked meal in a delightful, friendly atmosphere and at a good price visit Sandra's Next Generation....and my compliments to Owners and their children....job well done.
