This was the worst churrasqueria ever. They must not believe in SALT. The rice, beans, pork, and chicken (3 of us ordered) were just terrible. I mean no taste what so ever. AT ALL. The pork was pale white almost sogged up in water. Did I mention it was ALL tasteless!? Very Very Bland! What a waste of money! Never again!
