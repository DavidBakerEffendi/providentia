Since I moved to New York, my mom's favorite hobby has become texting me about different restaurants she's seen on Food Network. Artichoke Pizza was one of those places. I had a friend visit from out of town last month who wanted a transcendent pizza experience in the city, so I crossed my fingers and prayed that my gods, Guy Fieri and Rachel Ray, wouldn't steer me wrong. My food budget doesn't usually allow for dining in, but this was a special occasion so we went for it and ordered a small artichoke pizza to share. After a bit of a wait, the waitress came out and told us they'd made a mistake and gave us a large pizza instead at no additional cost. Based solely on the fact that they fed me for the next week, I'd love this place even if the food wasn't phenomenal. But it is. The artichoke pizza is incredibly delicious. It's a lot richer and creamier than you'd expect, but with the thick crust that just means that one slice is more than enough to be satisfying. The heaviness sets it apart from most New York pizza but, while it's not my new standard, it's nice to have variation every once in a while. Oh, and if you have leftovers, heat them up! Pizza can be great cold, but this one isn't.
