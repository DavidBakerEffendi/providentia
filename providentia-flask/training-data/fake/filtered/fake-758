This is such an adorable place to go for breakfast. We went on Sunday and there was a long queue but it didn't feel too much at all especially since we saw happy smiling faces around us, lovely staff trying to accommodate us, free coffee and cookies till we got a seat! Really cute and chirpy place and the food is totally worth the wait! The hot chocolate for 2$ was yumm!! And so were the pan cakes. Must must try!
