I may be writing this a bit prematurely but I'll allow any who read this to decide on that. A co-worker and I attended the restaurant for lunch. As was only lunch, I ordered the fried mozzarella and my friend ordered a bowl of the chicken barley soup. I knew when I ordered that my appetizer was $10.00 for the plate which I know to be too much but I ordered it anyway. I realized when it was delivered (on a very timely manner, mind you) that I had been ripped off. For a $10 appetizer I expected a little more care to go into my appetizer. I received just 5 bland mozarella sticks. although they were tasty I couldn't stop thinking about how much they tasted like they were straight from the freezer. In fact, I've had BETTER straight out of a freezer. I tasted the soup and although it was nicely flavored, it also tasted a little "fake." Especially the texture of the chicken chunks in it. p.s. Who charges damn near $20 for a plate of gnocchi?!?!?! From now on, I'll just go across the street and get unlimited Zuppa Toscana and salad for half the price.
