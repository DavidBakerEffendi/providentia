PROS: My wife and I fancy ourselves as fried chicken experts, and Root & Bone's fried chicken is among the best we've ever tasted.  The way they lace the honey and lemon into the seasoning, so that you taste the lemon as well as the honey in each bite is amazing!  The macaroni and cheese is pretty good too.  CONS: The prices are on the high side compared to other chicken and waffle places to which we've been.  The pecan pie was a little watery for our tastes, and venue is on the small side, so you might consider taking your food "To go."  OVERALL:  We will definitely be back!
