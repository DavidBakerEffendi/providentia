After reading all the great reviews I went there last week with my brother. The Appetizers (Magic Mushrooms) were great. Unfortunaltely my  Pasta Integrale was a little blend. Also we had to ask vor Parmesan cheese. In what italian Restaurant do you have to ask for Parmesan cheese ??? Anyway the waiters only stopped by asking how everything is when we had our mouth full so how do you give an answer ??? But what annoyed me the mos wast it was so loud I only could talk to my brother by yelling...and the loudness was not from music but from all the guests arround and the room was packed....guess it was the fastest dinner I ever had because we didn´t really stay any longer than necessary
