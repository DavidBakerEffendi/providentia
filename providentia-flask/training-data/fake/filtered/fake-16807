I was very much looking forward to brunch at ABC Kitchen. The service was so poor it diminished our entire experience. Our waitress disappeared after the initial "hello" and we had to engage several other wait staff to assist us. She was not able to tell us the specials without making errors, spoke so softly amidst the noise in the restaurant, she was inaudible. We saw her for our order and then never saw her again--water, coffee, ketchup, bread, dessert menu were all accomplished by us hailing down other gracious wait staff. Â The food was good but sadly, I've had better service at TGI Fridays!!!!! Not happy with the overall experience for a restaurant that has received rave reviews...therefore won't be going back anytime soon.
