We are fans of Laceno/La Locanda in NJ, and couldn't wait to try Sotto.  It certainly didn't dissappoint.  We loved the buffalo mozzarella and the polenta and sausage appetizers.  My husband had the lamb chop special that was out of this world. I had the chicken and ditalini which was a bowlful of comfort.  It was nice to see some of the old favorites, and make a few new ones.  As usualy, the service was impecable.  We will certainly be back...and maybe we'll bring some friends as long as they don't misbehave so that we can come back again and again!
