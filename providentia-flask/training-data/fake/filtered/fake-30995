Fallyn was our waitress and was fantastic at orienting us to the specials of the place (beer=yummy) and her recommendations were 100% on the mark!!  Great app, burger on the pretzel roll is THE best (less bread, more YUM)!  The dessert was ok, would have been stupendous if the choc cake was served warm.  Cold it was dry and ehhh... But overall, great place for a casual dinner!!
