From what I've been told by the locals, both Pat's and Geno's get their steak, bread, cheese, onions etc, etc from the same distributors?  If this in fact true, the only difference between the two is Pat's chop the steak and Geno's does not.  It's really a matter of preference not quality or taste.  In my opinion, the best cheesesteaks in the country are at Carl's in NYC!  No question about it, the bread makes all the difference in the world.
