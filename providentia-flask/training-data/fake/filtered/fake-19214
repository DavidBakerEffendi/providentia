My husband and I have been wanting to try this restaurant especially with the huge rave and high reviews of this place. My sister and her fiancee went there a 1.5+ years ago and said how good it was. We decided to go altogether. All 4 of us didn't think the food was good at all. My sister and her fiancee also stated that the food was not the same when it was first opened. We ordered: 1. Lobster - the dressing took away the other ingredients on the dish. 2. Yellow Tartar - this was OK 3.Scallops - OK, nothing special. 4. Uni Toast - the toast took over the flavor of all of the ingredients in it. 5. BLT buns - too much sauce 6. Oxtail Terrine - this was kind of dry 7. Roasted Bershire Pork Belly - this was OK 8. Hanger Steak Â - tasted boiled Due to the disappointment of all 8 dishes, we decided to go somewhere else to get dessert Not planning to come back! Thanks I originally RATED them a 1 but my husband said to give it a 2, so here goes 2 STARS for this place.
