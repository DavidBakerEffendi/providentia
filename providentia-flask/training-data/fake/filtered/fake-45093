Please get on Seamless already! This gets 5 stars if you go there, and 2 stars if you order delivery.   The bad:  delivery takes forever and they have at least twice lost the order.  Sad panda face. The good:  the soup dumplings.  The crab and pork soup dumplings.  Happy panda face.  If it's winter, get a table away from the door.  I don't know why, but so many times it seems that the door stays open without closing.
