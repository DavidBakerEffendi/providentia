Hi to everyone who's reading this. Before I start I should mention that I'm only a customer of Little Basil restaurant and I don't know anyone personally in that restaurant. I've read Brad A.'s Â unfair comment about the little basil restaurant and I didn't appreciate the way he talked about the employees /owner of this restaurant.I have been buying food from this restaurant for over 30 years and yet, I've never had or heard any complains about the food or especially of the employees. To my understanding Brad was looking to get something for free.First of all according to him,the ad (If there was one) says if you purchase $20 or more you'll get something for free. Well, he spent $19.58 and that's not $20 .Also, he says that he does not believe they're losing a customer over 47 cents. My question for Brad is , apparently he likes the food that he orders it from there,then why he's losing his relationship with them over 47 Cents. Also, he laid about the owner telling him that it was a new deal. She never said such thing to him. To my understanding this thing has been going on for quite a while and he manages to get free things by threatening to cancel his order if they don't give him something for free. Since they wanted to keep him as a "customer" happy, they gave him something for free. Unfortunately, Brad got greedy and kept asking for more freebies. Brad ,you should be ashamed of yourself to bother these hard working people who work at lease 14 hours a day to serve people like you and I .You don't like their food /customer service then I suggest you find someone else to put up with your non sense.Have some dignity and be a man and leave them alone and don't ruin their reputations for your cheapness and selfishness. I'm surprise why didn't Little basil management didn't take legal action against this "man". Fred D
