Never will I go here again.... Noone was in there & we were completely rushed!!! Soup and salad came out at the same time. 3 minutes later the entree came out. Are you serious??? I asked her to take it back to keep it warm. When it came back out it was as hard as a rcok. I've been in the restaurant business for over 15 years... You give people time in between courses. The best part is the manager said he took the Prime Rib off my bill. The special was $17.95. He charged my $15.15 for eating my soup and salad and the 2 sides I got with the meal. Are you serious???? Never again...and I don't recomment it!
