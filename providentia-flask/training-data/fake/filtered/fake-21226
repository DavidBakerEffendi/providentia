Que Chula Es Puebla is absolutely one of the most fantastic mexican places in the city.  The food is bright, fresh, delicious!  The red and green sauce are perfectly complementary of each other and phenomenal in their own right. The dessert case is mind boggling. The BYOB is glorious. I bring folks here when they visit from out of town.
