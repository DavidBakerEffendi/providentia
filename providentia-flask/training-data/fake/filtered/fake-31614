Met an old friend here because of the convenience from Brooklyn and NYC. We were coming from different locations. The atmosphere was superb and the view was spectacular. Above all was the service provided by the server "Genesis". She was not only friendly, carried herself as if she was in the business forever; she was also helpful in picking out our meals. She checked in on us as we dined, but did not impose or disturb us. Sometimes not easy to do. The manager Lance was equally as accommodating and checked to see if we were satisfied with the meal and service. Will most definitely be back and will recommend a holiday party to my real estate firm. See you soon Frank @ aptsandlofts.com
