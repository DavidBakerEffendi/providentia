Had a bridal shower here on March 9, 2013.  Must say, it was excellent. Servers were on their game.  Attended to everyone's needs.  Staff was very pleasant and very accommodating.  Food was absolutely delicious.  Food was flowing and abundant.  Perfect restaurant that went with our "fiesta theme."  There was something for all palettes.  All the food was excellent.  I cannot say anything other than this was a perfect afternoon.  Oh, and the sangria, so very delicous and flowing. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to have a private party. Ole
