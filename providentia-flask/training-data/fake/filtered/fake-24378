We went her Friday night, and we had an open table coupon.  It was really great.  The main entrees were a little spendy for our taste (mid to high 20's) but there was plenty else to choose from on the menu and it was all good and different.  We had the "build your own" guacamole and it was to die for.  I highly recommend getting the truffles in it.  Wow.  We also had tuna ceviche, tacos and a mushroom dish that was all so yummy we wanted to savor it.  The best part though, was a side dish of corn that my husband couldn't stop talking about.  The wait staff was really nice to.  We didn't have any drinks, so I can't speak to that, but we will certainly go back for the food.
