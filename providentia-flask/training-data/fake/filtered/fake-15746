STAY AWAY FROM THIS SH**HOLE !!!! Ate there once - never again ! FOOD IS OVERPRICED & DISGUSTING, SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, the place is UNSANITARY - example is the Mexican who was cleaning our table while we were still sitting down ( trying to rush us out is the feeling we got ) spilled wine all over one of our party - he wiped up the wine on the floor & then wiped the tabletop - while we were still eating - Â with the same towel - disgusting !!!!!! I complained & asked to see the manager - the manager wouldn't even come out to speak with us ( can we say HORRIBLE customer service here ) - would not adjust the bill and our server was a snotty bi**h.... Did not leave a tip - I am disputing the charge with my bank - will NEVER EAT THERE AGAIN !!! And the dry cleaning bill was over $100.00 to remove the wine stains.... They should be closed down. Do yourself a favor - stay away from this place - go to the store and buy your groceries and cook dinner at home for yourself - will be better than this place any day of the week and twice on Sunday.
