I visited Sally's Pizza on 3/9/14 on the cuff.  The Sally and Wooster St Pizza rivalries have always been in existence since I have been a kid.  Because it was a Sunday night in March, the sitting was very quick. During spring and summer days, the lines are out the door. Once inside, it is a small seating area, clean and has the typical ambiance of the small, hole-in-the-wall pizza joint. But their name is renowned and attracts famous people, evident by Frank Sinatra's picture on the wall along with various other, well known people.  Service was quick and the menu concentrates on pizza. If you like thin crust pies, this is the place to be.  I suggest a large size.  The medium, 12 slice, was just not enough for a pizza lover - you will want more pizza and you will find the room.   If you cannot finish it, you can box it up and take it home!  Best yet, all under $20.00.  The soda they serve is a local soda from Foxon Park.  I suggest you try the White Birch Beer soda. I left full but still had room for Libby's Italian Ice/Pastry shop, a slight walk down the street, on the same side - but that is another story.
