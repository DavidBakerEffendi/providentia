Cheese Grill (which is the new official name) is the perfect addition to the Lower East Side neighbourhood. Between the delicious food, great selection of local beers and wines, excellent prices, and (the best) staff, this new establishment deserves far more than 5 stars. I highly recommend the Crispy Goat sandwich. If you have a sweet tooth, the brioche with banana and mascarpone cheese is simply heavenly. You couldn't ask for a more attentive and friendly staff (shout out to Mike!), who are also very knowledgeable about wines. They truly make you feel very welcome and the ambiance has that community/homey feel. It also has a chill vibe (almost reminds me of some cool places in Santa Monica, CA), and on top of it they have a great music playlist! I live in the LES area and I know Cheese Grill is going to be my new watering hole. I'm craving the Crispy Goat right about now!
