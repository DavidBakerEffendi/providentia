Very nice atmosphere, if it wasn't cold we definitely would have done dinner on their spacious and modern looking balcony/deck-too cold unfortunately. I walked in and my table was ready right away (made 7:30 reservations on open table). the server Ralph was good he was attentive and things flowed fluently with the exception of our second round of drinks (we got those on the house due to the long wait for their arrival so that made up for it!). We didn't go for the beer, we went for valentine's day dinner. the food was awesome-absolutely awesome. Everything we had was great. I started with the house salad which consisted of chopped greens, radish, red onion, cucumber, and halved cherry tomatoes tossed in their house ginger vinaigrette (to die for!). the wasnt the prix fixe menu btw just the off the regular menu. For the main course i went with the Steelhead Salmon (best salmon ever) it had the perfect mix of smokiness, sweetness, and saltiness! there were cubed bacon bits, curried apple bits, brussel sprout leaves, and two salmon filets (skin on) the skin was very crispy and flavorful all was topped with a citrus caramel sauce. For desert i had the bread pudding which also exceptional! they formed the pudding into what resembled to slices of french toast. it was accompanied by banana halfs with carmelized sugar on the bananas which added some nice crunch. Underneath the bread slices was some raspberry sauce and they topped it off with two scoops of whipped cream.
