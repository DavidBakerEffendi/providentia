One of the most excellent if not the most excellent meals I have ever experienced.  I love Amada but this tops it.  I was part of a party of four and to say that we overindulged is an understatement.  It was pure gluttony but so worth it.  We ordered 3 tapas each but than kept adding to the order because we were in pure heaven with every bite and wanted to try it all.  From the first taste we were convinced that nothing would top that but every time the waitress put a new dish on the table we were proven wrong.  It was impossible to choose the best tapa.  They were all mouthwatering good!  But if pressured to choose: Shortrib, Oysters, Prawns, Organic Chicken, Duck, Beef Tenderloin, Moules Basquaise (mussels), Oyster, Figs... It really is that hard to pick a favorite!  My advice is to go with a party of four and a huge appetite so you can sample as many dishes as possible.  We were very happy with the service and our waitress.  The tapas were brought out at a nice pace to allow us ample time to enjoy and savor each dish.  The waitress was very knowledgeable about all the dishes and the ingredients and was able to give good recommendations on the wine. I can't wait to go back!
