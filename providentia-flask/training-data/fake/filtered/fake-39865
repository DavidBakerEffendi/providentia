Got to the restaurant with a group of 4. The parking lot attendant was great. Â We were seated without any trouble. The bus boys were very cordial and efficient. All down hill from there. A little different when it came time for the waitress. She was o.k. but a little surly. We ordered appetizers and drinks, no problem. When the waitress came for our food order, not everyone had decided. She advised us that if we wanted to avoid a delay that we would have to order now. which we did. An hour later we were still waiting for our order. By the time that our order had come, one of our party members decided that he wanted his meal to be packed to go. The waitress rather than being apologetic about the delay tried to defend it. As we paid our bill and took our packaged meal to enjoy at home one of the owners stopped us and asked of our problem. When we explained to her, the response was,' why didn't you stop me on my way by and explain to me what happened.' Like we knew who the hell she was. On the way out the door the waitress came out to argue with us some more. We went on our way, got home, ate our food ( not so great) and enjoyed the rest of our evening. Will never return to this restaurant,
