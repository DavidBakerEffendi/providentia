I really enjoy this restaurant.. I've been going to Peaches for the last 4 years. The food is great and I've always enjoyed the ambiance.  However, i went to Peaches this past Labor Day 9/1/14 around 3pm... This was before shifts had changed.  I sat at by the bar area of the restaurant and witnessed what seemed to be the manager talk to the workers/servers in an awful and demeaning way.  This person was a female and seemed to be handling the paperwork for the restaurant as well as the register.  She was giving employees orders and at one point I heard her say "this girl gets on my damn nerves."  I also heard  her to talk to the bar tender who was talking to another worker  who seemed to be spanish,  The "manager" told the bar tender in an aggressive way  "Learn ESL" .   Every time she spoke it was aggressive and made myself along with my company very uncomfortable.  Although we love peaches, we could not believe the way this woman was speaking to the employes at the restaurant.  Many of which, seemed uncomfortable by the looks on their faces.  I do understand having to run a business and keep a sense of order, however if customers, such as myself and my friends that I was with are subjected to hearing the verbal abuse that this woman was projecting I just don't think its okay.  I was saddened by this experience, as I really have enjoyed this restaurant  I also feel no one (and I mean the employees) should be spoken to in such a disrespectful and demeaning way. No one , no matter what their status deserves this kind of treatment.  I strongly feel that keeping a positive work environment would be not only be beneficial to the employees but also the patrons. Please reconsider the way management deals with the employees at Peaches. In my opinion its just not ok.  Thank you... This is respectfully coming from a customer who would like to return....
