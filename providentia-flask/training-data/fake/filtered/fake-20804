This is ramen at its finest. I love when Japanese chains land in the US as at least you know they're authentic. The broth in their specialty is the porkiest pork broth I've ever had. Noodles are cooked perfectly not too soft. Service was very nice. One of the sake cocktails was gross but the food was truly memorable (for ramen!)
