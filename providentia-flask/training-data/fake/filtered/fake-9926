I am extremely disappointed by how my family and I were treated on June 28, 2013. The waiter who took care of us was the least professional waiter we have ever had. He was pleasant, but inattentive. For some reason our meals took about an hour to be served, after several other tables were served, and only after I brought the long delay to the owner's attention. The table next to us also made comments about the level of service that they received. Even great restaurants have "mishaps", yet we expect excellent service from a restaurant of this caliber. My biggest issue is that the owner told me that "everything is on me", but his sister brought over the check and told us that they would split the bill. We were so frustrated with our experience that we didn't argue and just left unhappy. I had come to consider Ola not only my favorite restaurant in the New Haven area, but a warm, inviting place for me to enjoy a great dining experience. My feelings have now changed.
