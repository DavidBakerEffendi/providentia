A few of us ended up here yesterday after visiting a few friends in Astoria. Stella the Greek told us this is the place for good Greek food and seafood. Man was she right. They start you with some warm bread drenched in olive oil. I had the sword fish with lemon potatoes. Amaaaaaazzing. for appetizers we had octopus which I've had once before and this was so much better. Soft and very tasty. It melts in your mouth. We also had fried calamari which had a nice crunch to it. Waitress did take a while to get to us but it is understandable when this place was packed with about a line of 10 people waiting to sit. Will go back when in Astoria.
