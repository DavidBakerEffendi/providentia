Always on the search for new and innovative cocktails, and this is definitely the place!  My new favorite place to sit and snack at the bar (with a bar called Madam Geneva) next door... and my new go-to date night spot with about four different places to eat, all with a different vibe.   Went again for dinner with a bunch of friends and probably ordered everything that was on the menu.  I'd never typically order chicken, but it's maybe one of the best dish that we had all night.  I ordered the pork chop and it was cooked perfectly, and the steaks were AMAZING.  And everything has a really creative twist to it. Really nice staff, reasonably priced for huge portions, and dangerous that it's so close to where I live.
