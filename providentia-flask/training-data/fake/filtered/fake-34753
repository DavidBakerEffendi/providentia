After checking out the reviews, we made reservations for Christmas Eve dinner. We realize that we would be waiting due to the holiday so when we arrived we were surprised to be seated in about 5 mins. Service was less than desirable as we had to wait about 15 mins to get menus from the owner. The waiter finally took out appetizer order after another15 mins. then disappeared and didn't return until after we had received them. The sauce was missing so instead of taking our dinner order first,  he turned on his heel to get the sauce. He returned 5 mins later with the sauce, plopped it down and left without taking our order.  We waited another 20 mins for him to return. He apologized and said he would comp us a dessert and to "not tell the owner."   Because the order was not taken until after we finished the appetizer, we had to wait a longer period of time for the main dish. After dinner, he gave us the dessert menu without saying anything about the comp and we never saw him again at our table. No dessert was ordered because of this. We had to request our bill from another server which had 3 out of 6 items incorrectly priced. When we brought this to the attention of the owner, his comment was "he has no control of the service". The bill was corrected, without further apology. Poor customer service and lack of professionalism..  The time from seating to leaving was three hours.
