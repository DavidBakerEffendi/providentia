The only reason why i give this a one star is because i must click on one of them. To me and obviously to all customers, dining out is an experience to relax and to entertain one self among family and/or friends. My wife went out with her 4 girlfriends and when they came back i was highly annoyed from what i was told. My wife's fish was rubbery and tasted to fishy, which is a no no in dealing with fish. When she returned it and got a pasta dish instead the waiter had an attitude. Also, supposedly the "chef" and "manager"  couldn't be bothered to come out to apologize. The bill came and they had the more expensive dish (which was the fish) because the waiter said they didn't believe her when she said the fish wasn't good. The waiter only had to apologize but didn't have the decency to do that. To add to the fire, the restaurant was not full at all and they tried to move her party to smaller  table in the back  because her friend only came out for drinks and not for food.
