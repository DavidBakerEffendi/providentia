I gave 3 stars just to keep the average score of this place but i would like to write something about Trebar. I just moved to the area, had some friends from overseas over and I realized I dont know nothing about Princeton's nightlife. So, i google to find out: "princeton nightlife" and came this website: shopprinceton.com/nightlâ€¦ There I found Tre Piani and Tre Bar and says: "Although this restaurant it is located at the Princeton Forrestal Village, a few minutes from town, the bar scene is really cool and can result in some rather rambunctious behavior (which is good). They have live music and the dance floor is rolled out on Friday nights." Ok, to make the story short, I was there yesterday (friday), at 10PM. The nice host gentleman from Tre Piani invited us to go check the bar but he warned us that the restaurant and bar were about to close... There was 2 girls at the bar and 1 or 2 people from staff kinda setting up to close at any minute. We decided to leave. So, what happened? Is this place over? We ended up having drinks at PF Changs... how excited :(
