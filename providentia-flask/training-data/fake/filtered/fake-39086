Charming and wonderful on every level. Would go back again in a heart beat! Took a chance on Basso56 based on good on-line reviews and WOW, so glad we did! From the start, I was charmed by the downstairs, below street level entrance... as if I found a little secret tucked away! We received a warm greeting upon walking in and were promptly seated. Our server Micaela, quickly greeted us and provided us with excellent service thru out. Now the good stuff, the food!!!  For starters we had the pear and goat cheese salad, very yummy and the calamari which had a light but somewhat crunchy coating, I likey!  We also had the eggplant which was just ok and the crab cake  which was really good.  For main meal we had the Rigatoni Bolognese, very respectable,  filet mignon with truffle sauce, OMG, is all I can say. Also had the seafood risotto special, which was like heaven!!! For dessert we tried the tartuffo, ricotta cheese cake and biscotti cookies, in spite of that calorie count, I had no regrets!  Of course there was cappuccino involved and I think I heard someone say, "the best they ever had"! The combination of homey charm, warm staff, and delicious food make this place a win - win.
