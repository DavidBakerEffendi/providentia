It was okay. I mean, I've been eating sushi for a very long time, and I've grown picky. Sushi here was indifferently prepared and presented. Rolls were not wrapped tightly and did not stay intact. Pieces were not uniform. Pieces stuck together on the plate and came apart while separating. I ordered a vegetarian dinner. Miso soup was okay, salad, too. Dinner came with 12 pieces of the same roll - no variation, so very boring. For the quality of food, Lee's is overpriced. Service was fine, waiter was friendly, restaurant was not busy.
