Extremely disappointing (insulting) from our initial seating, when we were asked to squeeze through a tiny 7 inch gap between two tables(we are not small). Even though we were seated in tables that close,  my wife and I had to lean over the food to try to hear each other talk over the din of hi volume music.   Then it turns out that the "All Day Menu" is deceptively labeled (being polite).  We were not allowed to see the "All Day" menu.  The "flapjacks" on the other menu were also falsely advertised as including special "maple syrup"  (they must have forgotten a few words like maple FLAVORED CORN syrup). It was NOT maple syrup, it was the corn syrup already on alllll tables. The waitress's response was oh well, that's all we have . . .  The food was bland and warm (not hot), delivered after a 35 minute wait. The "Breakfast Burrito" was advertised as having applewood-smoked bacon --  unfortunately we only got the "smoke",  no bacon.   The final travesty was yet another disappointing conversation with the waitress to explain that we were incorrectly billed at THREE TIMES the correct amount.  She did correct the bill.  A perfectly tortuous ending to a very tortuous experience.  A "1" rating is probably too high.......
