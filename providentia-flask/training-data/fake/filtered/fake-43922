New York Kimchi reminds me of a Korean Kimchi Museum.  Located on a block neighboring Rockefeller Center, it serves a variety of Korean food and exhibits Korean culture, costumes, traditional paper craft, and traditional, elegantly-designed housing architecture.   Most of all, it offers well-developed Korean cuisine including probiotic kimchi and kimchi burgers which the long fermentation process pre-digests and makes more bio-available.  I am so delighted that New York Kimchi serves not only Korean cuisine but also Korean culture and heritage.  It is a melting pot that offers Korean culture and food to discriminating New Yorkers.
