Among the many excellent restaurants along the I-95 corridor in southwestern CT our experience last night at the ULC was truly outstanding. The appetizers, salads, main menu items, the wine selection, the detail oriented and efficient service, pace and ambiance were five star. Considering the sum of these seemlessly integrated dining elements in this experience we all felt that the comparable price per person we paid was at the lower end of what would have to be expected.
