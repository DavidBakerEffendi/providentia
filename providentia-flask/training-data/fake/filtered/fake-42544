Let me start off by saying that this review is based solely off their Sunday brunch.My husband and I went there as part of our 10 year anniversary weekend celebration. If we didn't have a nice waiter and pay the extra 10 bucks for the unlimited champagne it would have been a total bust! The made to order omelets, which cause extra money, we're nasty. Everything on the buffet was mediocre. Nothing stood out and not enough variety. I remember going to a champagne Sunday brunch at Seaview and everything was done with excellence! Plenty of variety and the drinks and food were intoxicating! Moshula definitely let me down. I may still try and see what dinner is like there, but not likely.
