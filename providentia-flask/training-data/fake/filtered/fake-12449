They make the BEST macarons in the world.  Macarons were never a big deal for me until I tried Laduree's and now I'm an addict.  Perfect textures, colors and flavors.  I recently bought all 13 flavors and ate them all in one sitting!  Loved every single one of them, especially rose petal.  Be warned, there is a long wait (30 to 60 minutes mid to late afternoon) and be ready to pay a few dollars per macaron.
