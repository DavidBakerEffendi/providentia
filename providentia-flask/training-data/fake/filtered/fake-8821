Go on a blind date with someone who really, truly enjoys eating and drinking.  Have a few drinks, develop a nice, warm buzz, and when you finally realize that it's midnight, you're hungry, and you don't want the conversation to end, go to Blue Ribbon.  Sit at the bar.  Order a glass of wine or some scotch (or a can of PBR - they keep 'em on ice!) and have some appetizers.  Order the weirdest combination you can think of:  oysters, steak tartare, steamed artichoke, country pate.  And if you don't have the escargot traditional, you're blowing it.  It's the best, most garlicky, buttery, smoky escargot you'll find in the neighborhood.  Order another glass of wine, dip the bread in the garlic butter, tell your date he (or she) must help empty all of the little nooks the snails came in, lick your fingers.  Then go home.  Alone.  Because you DO want there to be a second date, don't you, you tramp? Or just take your visiting parents, sister, or the drummer from your old band back home for dinner.  They'll love it, too.
