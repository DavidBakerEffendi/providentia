LOVE this place. Pizza is great, and so is the rest of the food on the menu. Delivery is top notch, also. One time I ordered a pizza and it was delivered to my door 17 minutes later. I thought they were calling with a question about my order when in fact the driver was in front of my apt. I have been ordering from Fairmount Pizza for over three years and only on two occasions have they made a mistake with my order. No big deal since I order from here weekly. They are much better than other pizza places in Fairmount and are definitely worth checking out.
