Ordered delivery from Wild Wood Fired Pizza tonight and loved it. We got a 16-piece buffalo wings, an order of the cheddar penne, and a medium pepperoni, olive, and sausage pizza. I can't comment on the wings since those were my husband's territory, but I absolutely loved the pizza and pasta. The pizza was generously sized, with awesome thin, crispy crust, and a fantastic sauce. The wood fired penne smelled so good before we even dug in and it didn't disappoint. My kids (3 and 1) ate it all up. The order also arrived piping hot. I will definitely order from here again.
