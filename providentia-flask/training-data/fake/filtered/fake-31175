Wafa's is the answer to the age old question "what do you want to eat tonight?", if you're looking for something off the beaten path. I've never had Lebanese cuisine prior to Wafa's but the staff and menu are more than accommodating, our waiter answered a myriad of questions and didn't mind our gross mispronunciations. Our group of four ended up getting spinach pies as an appetizer and splitting a vegetarian platter, a meat platter, a bottle of Riesling wine, and finishing off with an order of baklava. The platters were a great option because i felt like we got to try a lot of things and everyone was able to find soemthing that appealed to them. Overall the food came out nice and hot, everything was fresh (none of the day old green garnishes, my biggest pet peeve) but most importantly everything was delicious and then some. The meat platter was nice with ample portions of each and I also felt like they were quality cuts and not at all greasy. The platter also came with a scrumptious hot sauce that was definately up there in heat but super flavorful. My favorite part about Wafa's food is the interesting new spices and refreshing combinations of common ingredients. I absolutely loved the moussaka but my favorite by far was the falafel. Id say the prices were more than fair, we certainly got our money's worth. Wafa's has made me a fan of Lebanese food. Beyond this visit I've had their Swiss chard soup and I felt like I had to everyone know how amazing it was. I wish I worked closer so I could come here for lunch! But back to the soup, the thing that got me was the lemon in it, you have to try it!
