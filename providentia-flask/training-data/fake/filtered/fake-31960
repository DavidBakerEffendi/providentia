I am out and out addicted to this thin crust pizza.  It is a family outing every Friday night, and if we can't make it for some reason I start having serious withdrawal issues. The pizza is amazing, and the staff has made us feel like family.  They know us, know what we want, and are very efficient even on their busiest nights.  Ron pours my beverage as I walk in, and hands it to me as I grab a seat!  The hostess and the wait staff are always cheerful.  Come on in, and enjoy the best thin slice pizza in town!
