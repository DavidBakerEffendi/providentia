Service not very friendly or helpful in ordering. We ordered plain noodles for our 7 year old and they came out filled with onions, veges, and meat. The pork with spicy basil has nearly 0 spice so not enjoyable to someone who likes spicy Thai. I even ordered it extra spicy. The noodles despite coming out wrong were tasty and price and atmosphere give this more than 1 star. There are a dozen better Thai restaurants in the area for only slightly more money.
