when i am in the mood for a balanced healthy meal, i think Yalo & Me. I tried all their salads - except the Kale salad- and they were delicious. I'm normally a slow eater, and when the food is delish i eat even slower! love the packaging, the fresh ingredients, the taste and the friendly staff. fav. panini is def Roma ! when im in the mood for something sweet, i keep it simple and order the Nutella Crepe with a few slices of strawberries YUM! and when i feel like doing something different, i go for a savory crepe a must try when in Montclair.
