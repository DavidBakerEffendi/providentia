My husband & I were seated at the table and couldn't hear each other speak because the music was so loud.  The speaker was directly above us.  I asked the Hostess to re-seat us and she said "Oh it's like that everywhere, but I'll tell the manager."   Our seats were not only too close to the speaker but they were also right near the door which kept opening and letting in massive amounts of cold air.   The manager wasn't "told" because our seats were adjacent to the Hostess station and the Hostess didn't move from that area since she seated us. We left.
