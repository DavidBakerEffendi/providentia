When Osteria Giotto opened, I was one of their first customers and would recommend the restaurant to family and friends.  I visited often, but then I moved from the area.  On Saturday August 3, 2013 I was looking forward to returning to this restaurant and spending a great night with a group of friends!  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  I had the Insalata Di Pesce and it lacked flavor and it was gritty.  As we were waiting for our second dish, we were offered bread and some olives.  They provided olive oil for the bread, but when I asked for more olive oil, it never got to our table.  My entree was one of their specials, which was good, BUT two of my friends asked for a mixed seafood pasta special, which included crab.  My one friend is allergic to crab, so she requested her dish without it.  As we waited for our dishes another friend of mine sitting at the table, got elbowed in the head by a waitress.  The waitress apologized.  When all our dishes came out, my friend, who is allergic to crab asked if there was crab in the dish and the server dismissed her comment and gave her an attitude.  She asked him again and he took the plate back to the kitchen without answering her.  So when he came back with the dish, she asked again and he responded, "Yes, it's like that!"  She requested to speak to our waiter and when she told him what the server had just said, he responded by saying, "Well I do have an EpiPen".   In the end, my friend did not feel comfortable eating her dish, so she got it wrapped and decided not to eat anything.  It was a total of 10 girls and none of us will be returning and we will make sure that our family and friends know of the experience we had at Osteria Giotto.
