Warning, do not be deceived by the pictures on yelp.  Chicken and waffles are only served on weekends here. I went there on a Monday and even though it was a Federal holiday they were not serving the weekend menu and wouldn't accommodate my request for it.  I would definitely recommend that they change that.  I hate it when a place has different menus on different days. Overall the food was good but I wasn't blown away. Had the pancakes and chicken sausage which were tasty but the sausage had an overwhelming taste of sage and lavender.  A pretty expensive meal for breakfast, about $45 for me and my husband.  The atmosphere was nice, clean but cramped (definitely felt like I was all up on the next table).  Service ok but we waited a while for the food. Would not recommend if you have a large party because chances are you will be waiting for seats.  But for two it's fine.  I may try it again if I'm in NYC on a weekend just for the chicken and waffles.  But otherwise I could take it or leave it.
