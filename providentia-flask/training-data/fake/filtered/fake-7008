Excellent authentic South Indian vegetarian restaurant in all of New Jersey.   Yestetday was my fourth visit since they moved here from Montclair, NJ. Good value.  Great taste.  Good setting.  Friendly staff.  Will accomodate dishes to your spice level.     Definitely better than Saravana Bhavan of Edison, especially in quality and  price.  All the items I tried were less oily than any other Indian eateries around.  Every head turned whenever a Paper Dosai came to a table.  I wonder how the chef manage its size. Less crowd on weekday evening. Yet to try their Chat special on Tuesday and Friday nights.
