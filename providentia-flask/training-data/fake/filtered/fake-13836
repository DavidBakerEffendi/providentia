Tonight was our first experience with Elm Diner tonight for dinner.  Husband and I were astounded by the scale of the menu-huge and covers all areas of food.  This made us a little nervous, thinking that the possibility of happening upon a needle in the menu haystack would be scarce, however we were pleasantly surprised.   Husband had the chicken caesar wrap-his standby that he gets almost everywhere.  He said this was very good, actually tasted like a chicken caesar salad, not just some caesar-ish dressing on chicken in a tortilla.   I got the special french onion soup (loved) and the chicken tenders platter.  My chicken tenders were very good, fresh, not overly fried or battered.  On both of our plates we got steak fries, which were crispy and hot. Place was PACKED and we were in and out of there in 40 minutes, and never felt rushed.  We will be back for the breakfast!  Our new favorite CT diner.
