Sitting at the restaurant right now. I can't be any more disappointed in this place. The waiter only showed up to take the order. The service is unspeakable, meaning I can't even say anything since they never came around for me to judge. It's too loud mainly because all tables are so close together. Â The food, though, is all right. They have recieved a well deserved 2 stars .
