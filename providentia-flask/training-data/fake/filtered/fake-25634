Birra  - wonderful value for the quality of ingredients served. The crust on the pizza is tremendous.....we only tried the Margherita Pie on Saturday night - the best Margherita pie I have ever had yet.  I have a penchant for Margherita pies, so this is a lot coming from me. Kudos to the Pizza chef!!! We also enjoyed the Meatballs - they were the perfect size for 3 people to share.  Each of the 3 meatballs were slightly over-sized, perfectly seasoned, and drenched in a wonderful sauce (gravy).  I highly recommend to the carnivores reading this.  The gravy is very original yet classic - perfect viscosity and a "something" I can't quite put my finger on ingredient.  I will be back until I figure it out. We also enjoyed the ceasar salad - I love the fried cheese accompanyment.....nice touch. I enjoyed the Dale's Pale Ale on tap and my date enjoyed a wonderful Martini from the bar. We'll be back more than once, the quality again will lure me back to try the balance of the menu.  Nice job!!!
