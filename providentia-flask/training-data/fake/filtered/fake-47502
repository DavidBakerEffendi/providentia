I don't know what all the hype is about. After waiting about 25 minutes in line outside, we were seated and placed our order for a small onion pizza. Then the wait began, a 45 minute wait.... for a small pizza. We were told numerous times that it would just a another minute. The service was meh... the pizza was meh... This is an hour and a half of my life wasted!!!
