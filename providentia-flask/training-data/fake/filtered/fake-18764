This place rocks. It's like eating in your mom's kitchen without actually having to go home. The mac n cheese is some of the best in town, with fontina and cheddar to round out the flavor. And breakfast is served every day, complete with mismatched coffee mugs that make it feel even more like home. Service is friendly and attentive, without being overbearing and you can easily walk out of Penelope for under $15
