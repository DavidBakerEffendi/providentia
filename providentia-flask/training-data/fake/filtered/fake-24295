My wife is ADDICTED to the Pomelo Salad which is a THAI dish RARELY seen outside Thailand!  The Burger and Fries are Fantastic as is the Short Rib dish...  This restaurant is not typical Thai, it is a Labor of LOVE and HONG, the owner is charming and committed to the customer.  It is a casual place but the food is Serious and it is a welcome addition to the Cavalcade of real original restaurants in the E.Village NYC.
