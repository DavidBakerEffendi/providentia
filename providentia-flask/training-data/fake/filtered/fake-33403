It was not the best experience out of the whole Max restaurant group.  My wife and I went to Max Downtown to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  We have been to Max Fish, Max Oyster, Trumbull Kitchen and Max Burger, so we wanted to try Max Downtown.   The restaurant has elegant decor and a nice jazz soundtrack playing in the background.  The host was not very welcoming, but we were on cloud nine due to it being our anniversary. For our appetizer, we both ordered the corn chowder which was nice, but it needed a little salt.  I ordered the Roasted Block Island Swordfish and my wife ordered the duck (I can't remember the full name) for our entrees.  The swordfish was surprisingly huge and the seasoning on the outside of the fish was very good, but the inside of the fish was very mushy.  I suspect that since the portion was so big, it could not cook properly.  My wife's duck was perfectly cooked, but the curry basmati rice was dry and bland. The Kentucky Lemonade and Watermelon moonshine drinks were excellent. Overall we had a good time because it was our anniversary, but I enjoyed the meals at the other Max restaurants better.
