I would walk half a continent to eat at Chef Prasad's Thali restaurants and have in fact directed real Indian (foodies from India!) to the New Haven Thalis -- and they were very happy eaters.  Well, I just went to Oaxaca expecting no less quality.  However, from slowish and indifferent service, to tough taco chips and shells, to a flavorless burger to a "market" piece of salmon that was overdone, dry, tasteless (notthing flakey or tender about any square mm of it), plopped down in the center of a platter with 3 semi-burnt carmelized onions around and a near flavorless sauce (the piece of fish for $22) ... no no no.  Not only will I not return but will also tell my Mexican-food-loving friends to stay away.  There are fine restaurants in New Haven, including the Thalis right at the top.  Lots of great choices but, alas, this isn't one of 'em. Disappointed, Casey in New Haven CT
