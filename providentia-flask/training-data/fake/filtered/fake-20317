Horrible dining experience. After waiting to be seated, empty tables available we had to wait an unacceptable amount of time for appetizer's to remind several waiters we were still waiting for dinners and appetizers while customers around us came and went.  Waitress kept saying how sorry she was after we waited over an hour for our dinner to arrive. She was new, not my problem -claimed she was calling manager's manager on site. We asked for our meals to Be packed up because after an hour half wait no appetite.  Their attempt to rectify the unacceptable service was to comp us 4 glasses of wine which we wouldn't have needed if we were served our meals in  a reasonable amount of time.  92.00 bill and they offer 4 glasses of wine for party of  4 - are you kidding me. I will be sure to pass on my terrible dinning experience to family and friends- this will amount to a lot more than 4 glasses of wine!  Shame on the owners for having such inept help on a busy Thursday night.   Try  Puckett or the restaurant next door.  2 stars food is decent service not worth the experience.
