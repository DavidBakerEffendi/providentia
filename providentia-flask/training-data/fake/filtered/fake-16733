I went for the first time just few weeks ago for a Sunday Buffet.  There were lot of greasy and oily food was there and we did not touch any of them.  We tried mutton Biriyani.  The meat was cooked well but the smell of rose water or kawra water in the rise was too strong.  The taste was OKAY.  I thought of ordering one order to go.  When I brought home the food, next day I saw there was only small 3 pieces of meat and rice they gave me for $14 dollars.  Rubbish.  Never going back there.  Go to Indian Restaurant to eat Indian food.  These guys don't know what they are doing.  Just want to make fast money for their pocket and selling some high cholesterol greasy unhealthy food which can kill you if you eat everyday.  LOL.
