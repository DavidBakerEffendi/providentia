OVERRATED!!!!  Since working in and around Tribeca since 2006 this place to me seems to have lost it luster and IT FACTOR!  I gave it another try after having brunch here one day and it didn't impress me not one bit.  On a business lunch meeting, I tried the meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  WHY???  So apparently the meatloaf was wrapped in bacon... I did my research prior to ordering and the plate arrived, and the food was cold.  The bacon was rubbery and the meatloaf lacked flavor.  Topped with onion ring crisp, I still didn't enjoy after every bite.  It was a very busy lunch hour and I understand the business part, but if you know your'e going to be busy, everything from the kitchen to the front door needs to be up to standards.  Later that evening, let's just say the food didn't "hit me well"  I'm so glad I was home to relieve myself. Thanks Bubby's for keeping me up all night and turning on the faucet!!  My stomach is very mad at me.  I suggest, stick to the dessert menu.  I'm NOT A FAN!!!!!! Thus place is not that serious......
