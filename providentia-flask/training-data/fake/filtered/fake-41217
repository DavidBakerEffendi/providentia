This is the best Ramen we have ever had.  ESPECIALLY their vegetarian ramen which is hands down better here than anywhere else.  My husband gets the Miso Ramen which he loves.  We have been to other great ramen places in the city, but this ones stands out.  If you go during lunch or dinner, you will wait an 45 min-1:30 so we like to go at like 3 or 4 pm. ENJOY!
