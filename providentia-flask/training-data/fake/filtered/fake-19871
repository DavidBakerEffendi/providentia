Recently my husband and I had dinner at Sugar Freak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Upon entering the restaurant we were greeted by the owner. I was very impressed by the decor,it was very  comfortable and cozy. I spoke with the owner about how original it was to use recycled materials. We ordered our drinks and appetizers and received them with minimal              wait .The boudain balls were excellent (both crawfish and pork).The Gumbo was delicious. I had broiled shrimp that were seasoned superbly. I have eaten shrimp in many places but these were perfect. My husband had blackened catfish and thought it was also very delicious. As for the desserts ,the bread pudding and the dump cake were very tasty. We had a great time at  this restaurant and will definitely continue to eat there. Also the staff were very attentive and made us feel welcome. Keep up the good work!!!!!
