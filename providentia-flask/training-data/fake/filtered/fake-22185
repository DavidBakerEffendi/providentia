Fantastic place...I come here frequently from my work in Morristown, and it has yet to disappoint.  The space itself is quaint and intimate, and the service is top notch.   Most importantly the food is what keeps Marras at the top of my list.  The menu is diverse and authentic. I highly recommend the Zupa di Clams appetizer and Cajun Calamari. Delicious. As an entree, Shrimp Parmigiana and Penne Vodka topped with Salmon will impress.
