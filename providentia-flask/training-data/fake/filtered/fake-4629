We recently went to try the new brunch menu and were blown away by the food. The duck burger was amazing and the Grits were the richest we've ever had. The apple smoked bacon was done to perfection. For dessert we had the home made doughnuts which were just right. The service was first rate. The only negative we could say was that the brunch cocktails were very overpriced and the Bellini didn't really have that Peach taste you would expect.
