I thought this place was cool at first, but the owners make people feel so uncomfortable at times. Its true that they're pretty passionate about what they do, but the couple is constantly bickering with each other and demeaning their staff. The one owner, Mike, is crazy aggressive with his employees, he's so blatantly and excessively angry and annoyed. And he treats them badly in front of customers. Its makes everyone there feel super uncomfortable. I don't know why they both have so much resentment, but one thing is for sure: bad management equals bad business.
