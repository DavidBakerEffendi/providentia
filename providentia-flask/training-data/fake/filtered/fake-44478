This place rocks! Definitely one of my favorite hangs in WeHa...or anywhere in CT really. For the beer lover: Easily one of the largest tap beer selections in CT, with limited edition special runs all the time. Ask your bartender or server for recommendations and they'll turn you on to some excellent beers, eg. Otter Creek's Citra Mantra IPA and Lagunitas Sucks were amazing, plus lots of other double IPAs to choose from. For the live music lover: So nice to see a thriving live music scene in the nightlife wasteland that CT can be. If you don't enjoy loud volume and a packed bar then it's not for you, but if you like being around a lot of energy and young, beautiful people then this is a great spot to rock out, dance, meet that special someone, etc. Although the crowd is generally a good mix of all ages. Also, they never charge a cover which is my pet peeve for seeing live bands around CT. McLadden's "gets it" and this is why it's always packed up until last call. For bar food, an Irish Pub will never let you down: And McLadden's doesn't disappoint. So many good choices on the menu, food quality is excellent, service is good but could be a little more attentive during busy times, eg. make sure I have a napkin and setup when you deliver my food. I'm a huge burger aficionado and McLadden's Angus cheeseburger with fresh jalapenos is just about top on my list in CT. Overall atmosphere: Somehow McLadden's achieves that cool dive bar vibe yet is totally classy and upscale. Sure it's a publick house so you can be as casual and comfortable as you want - and you'll fit in just fine - but if you are looking for a late night hookup then definitely dress to impress.
