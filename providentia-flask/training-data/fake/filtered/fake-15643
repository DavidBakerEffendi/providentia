My friends' and my favorite place to get brunch in Williamsburg.  We always order the eggs benedict because it always come out perfectly.  The roasted potatoes and salad that come on the side are to die for.  The decor is cute, and the waitstaff are friendly and attentive-- and on more than one occasion our table has gotten a free scone.  Prices definitely reasonable (for Williamsburg).  Love this place!
