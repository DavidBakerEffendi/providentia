Good traditionally prepared Filipino food is in short supply in the area and Pandan Asian Cuisine & Delicacies fails to deliver on flavor and value.  I ordered the Lumpia which was over cooked and stuffed with potatoes and fell short on the fresh vegetables.  I also had the Kare Kare and it lacked the flavor you would expect from a skilled chef and was skimpy with the beef; I myself have prepared better.  The meal was mediocre at best and not a value so I skipped dessert.
