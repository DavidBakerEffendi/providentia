SERVICE WAS POOR I normally really like to go to this place, especially because it's in my neighborhood. BUT, I went there for happy hour and I was taken aback at how incredibly RUDE the bartender was to a friend of mine. My friend is from another country, and handed the bartender his country ID. The bartender then told him he couldn't accept that form of ID. And when my friend mentioned he didn't have his passport with him, the bartender MOCKED him by chuckling and saying, "well then how did you get into our country in the first place!?!?" If you need to turn him away, fine. But do NOT MOCK someone who is a potential customer. Obviously he has a passport, obviously he got into our country with it, but he doesn't carry it around with him EVERYWHERE - Â I just couldn't believe at how rude this bartender was. I don't care what the situation is, you do NOT treat people that way. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 10 years, and if something like that remark ever came out of my own or my coworkers' mouths, we would have for sure been FIRED. I just want to say I am incredibly disappointed that I had this experience. I am normally a frequent customer to this place, but I am going to have a very very hard time coming back to an establishment that treats people in such a manner. EPIC FAIL on your part.
