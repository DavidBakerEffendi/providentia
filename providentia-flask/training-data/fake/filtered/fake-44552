Beautiful decor. Good service. The fried calamari app was very good, although it could have had more dipping sauce on the side. I tried the beef rendang and it was awful. The sauce was very flavorful but lacked fire while the beef...was this really beef? The meat was very tough, even leathery. Of the 20 or so chunks maybe 4 were tender enough to chew without getting tired. Rendang needs to be cooked long and slow so that the beef falls apart. This dish seems like they took beef scraps and trimmings, threw them in some prefab sauce and heated the lot in a microwave.
