So I'm an avid yelp researcher when it comes to trying out new restaurants.  This place has had 4 stars but when I ate here I thought it was more like 2.   On a positive note, the lunch special was at an affordable price so I can't complain too much.  But in terms of flavor, this place doesn't leave a lasting memory.  I ordered the jalapeno crunch (If I remember correctly) it was a mushroom appetizer that I thought was really flavorless and I didn't even eat the rest.   Be careful though when eating them, the juice oozes out and can burn you.   Then for my entree I had the good ole pad thai.  The pad thai was meh.  I wouldn't go again but it is a good lunch special option.
