I am a Brooklyn native and had Di Fara's today for the first. What a disappointment!!!!! Is what $28 for a TINY pie that was soggy and burnt to a crisp. I was so excited to try "the best pizza in Brooklyn" after hearing the hype, but when I put it in my mouth I could not believe that this is the SLOP they serve up and people actually rave about it. They put a 14 inch pie in an 18 inch box and are too cheap to put a piece of wax paper in the box so the pizza gets stuck to the box. They are also very skimpy on the ingredients. Hardly any cheese or sauce. Check out my pictures of their charcaol slices. Â I really can't find anything good to say about Di Fara's. Most people on line seemed to be tourists which leads me to believe they just don't know any better. You can get better pizza at any neighborhood pizzeria. Do not waste your time. Do not waste your money. Do not stand in line for this pizza.
