Hats off to Luke's Lobster for an outstanding Day after Christmas lobster roll feast provided, with Luke's Lobster help, by our sister in Cleveland!  Ten lobster rolls were arranged for by the General, picked up by nephew Mike and devoured by a grateful family in Chestnut Hill.  Luke's - you made it easy for the General to order and delicious for us tor us to inhale!  A fabulous gift enjoyed by all!  Thanks, and we'll be back soon!
