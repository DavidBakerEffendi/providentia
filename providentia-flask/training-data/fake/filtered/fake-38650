We were so looking forward to L'Artusi opening. We love Dell'Anima and go often to this wonderful Italian gem. After last night's experience it looks like we will continue going to Dell'Anima. L'Artusi is a beautiful restaurant, lively, noisy and visually stimulating with its different stations and counters. The food is good and the service is friendly but good. Yet it does not have the authentic feel of its sister restaurant nor the same quality of the food. The portions are small and from the people around us lots of sharing was going on. Seemed like more of a social event with the food coming in second. Perhaps since its new it will develop its character with time.
