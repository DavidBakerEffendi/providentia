This place was a huge disappointment.  I suppose the food is nutritious, but I can't get past the horrible service.  Waitress was not just inattentive, she was absent.  I even had to get up and go to the counter to ask for a refill while she sat there and had a snack and talked to the cook.  I never did get a check so I left some money on the table and walked out.  Don't be fooled by the seemingly great deals (groupon and others) to visit this place.   Food is mediocre, at best.  The tomato and cucumber salad was if I had put my head in the garden and was eating the stuff dry.  How hard is it to put some local or natural dressing on that?  The portion was big; I'll give Fuel that much.  Next, I had the turkey sandwich (because they did not seem to have the fixings for the much ballyhooed Thanksgiving sandwich).  The sandwich was large, but again, mostly flavorless.  I suppose if you want to feel  good about yourself by eating what probably is good for you, this is an ok place.  I walked directly to another place to get more food though because I felt like I ate a lot of nothing.  I will not return to Fuel as the whole place is running on empty!
