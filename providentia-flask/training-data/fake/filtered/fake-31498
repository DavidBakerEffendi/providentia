Came to Blend on the water for my friend's birthday party & where do I begin?? We waited over an hour after our reservation time for our table at the insanely crowded bar that felt worse than taking the 4 train during rush hour!! When a friend purchased a round of shots for us to break the tension of waiting so long, I ended up with a broken glass & my friend's glass was dirty with lipstick that was not her own. Absolutely disgusting.  Once we were at our table, we looked at our "pre-fixed" menu & ordered.  The little arepas with the braised short rib were really good but that was about it.  The tostone "nachos" were a bit on the bland side but that's personal preference. My churrasco was ok but I've definitely had better elsewhere, not to mention that when I told my waiter that I ordered my churrasco medium, not well, he walked away as if I should figure it out myself. I was able to switch my dish with someone else at my table but I thought that was pretty rude on the waiter's behalf. Now let's go back to the pre-fix menu...it's a bit misleading when you include dessert on the menu but don't mention that it's separate from the main dishes & appetizers. I've never had that experience before because to me, that type of menu should include your food sans drinks & should let you know in a disclaimer somewhere that dessert is not included to avoid awkward situations amongst friends when the bill arrives.   On an added side note: apparently EVERYONE wants to celebrate their birthday here. It was bright birthday sparkler candles left & right. I counted 10. It felt like a giant kids party towards the end of the night. I get it, people want to enjoy the view because the location is really nice but give me a break!  It was so not worth the hassle we experienced. I gave my review an extra star for decor & location but they really need to take a closer look at customer service here.
