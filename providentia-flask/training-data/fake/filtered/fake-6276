Hands down, my favorite place to eat in the city! Anything you get will be completely delicious, great beer selection too. On average we go at least once per week. The specials change daily and are always unique but bust at the seams with flavor. Â Only once was I disappointed, and that was b/c the turkey burger's bun was stale...completely opposite the norm, so don't let that deter you from going. And just as great as the food - the service! Coolest, most chill group of guys work there, always friendly and attentive. It's a laid back establishment so don't expect to eat and run, sit back, relax, have a beer and a great meal.
