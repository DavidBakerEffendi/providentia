This is the second time I went to eat at this resurant. I am very disappointed in the food the taste is good but when you order a chicken pot pie you expect a chicken pot pie not a vegetable pot pie. I  only had 4 pieces of chicken each about the size of a dime.  Would it break the bank if they put a healthy amount of chicken. A  whole chicken in the supermarket costs between 4 & 5 dollars so calculating this you coul probably make anywhere between 2 and 3 hundred dishes of chicken pot pie. Hell of a profit margin.
