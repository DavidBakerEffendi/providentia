Loved the Little Owl!! As a F.R.I.E.N.D.S. fan I had to see it. Amazing location in Greenwich Village. Great crispy chicken and coffee!! a little spendy but there's worse out there price wise. staff was busy yet friendly. a bit small so it's sort of "get in and get out" but no staff actually said that. But it's understandable its such a awesome little cafe.
