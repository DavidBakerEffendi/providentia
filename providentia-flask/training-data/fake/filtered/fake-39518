The food is definitely good value for money and everything tastes delicious. The rice and meats are well cooked with awesome afghan spices. I loved it! The service was fairly quick too despite the fact that it was crowded. I've visited twice already and have tried their mixed kabob platter as well as the mixed gyro platter. Both were very good. It comes with a salad and an unusual white sauce topping. A must try!
