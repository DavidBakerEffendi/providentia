The owner/waiter is incredibly RUDE RUDE RUDE.  He yelled at me and my significant other for putting our winter gloves on the table when we sat down.  For the rest of the duration of our meal, he told us only limited items on the menu were available(smirking and giggling); he slammed down our drinks staining our cloths.  Nook WAS a place I would go to through the years BUT NO MORE due to this guy's attitude.  Get over yourself sir, your restaurant is NOT Le Cirque as you put it!  As far as the food, mediocre at best.
