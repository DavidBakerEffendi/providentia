Dear Cafe Lift, You have been a pleasure to get to know.  You are always polite, smell great, and offer me hot coffee, not to mention you food.  Truly spectacular, eggs Florentine, cannoli french toast, and lemon ricotta pancakes. There specials are always good too. Only thing is sometimes service can be alittle slow. Well Cafe Lift I moved here a couple of years ago looking to make friends and lucky me you were there to embrace me.
