I have never had a good meal here. Mexican food is usually pretty reliable for people who don't like to eat meat, but apparently Tortuga's is the exception. First time I ordered the Vegetarian platter. Everything is filled with frozen vegetables, the corn, carrot broccoli combo kind you get at the grocery store. Bland and waaaaaaaay not worth the price tag. The second time I ordered the fish enchilada, which, I kid you not, felt like I swallowed a hot brick. This actually tasted like something, but messed with my indigestion lie crazy. Only gave it two stars because the department I went with (which includes actual Mexican people) swear by this place and don't see any problems with bland over priced cr*p. So maybe I'm just not ordering right.
