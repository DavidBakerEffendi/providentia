DISASTER!!!!!!!!!  TOTAL UTTER DISASTER!!!!!!!!!!! One look at the Russell Brand look-a-like host and his messy "notebook", and my friend and I should have known to run like Katy Perry across the street to Zesty Chinese. Russell quoted us a wait time of 45 minutes. No biggie, we thought. But about 60 minutes later, we were still waiting to hear from him. When we asked him what was up, he told us in his psuedo-European accent that it would be another 30 and that his original 45 minute quote was "just an estimate".  We parked on the stoop outside the restaurant and watched as he gave away two 2-tops to people who had LITERALLY just put their names down. When we asked him what the deal was, he informed us that "that was a table for 3 and not for two". Three seconds later, he proceeded to call us on our cell phone and ask where we were despite the fact we had literally checked in with him ten times in the past five minutes. After brushing his hair out of his face, he led (or rther pointed us in the direction of) ONE STOOL. That's right. The two of us were to share one stool at the bar. Finally, TWO STOOLS opened up and the bartender (not Russell) moved us at which point she took away our menus before we had ordered a drink. Terrible customer service aside, the food was INEDIBLE. It took us both 4 tacos before we even realized how inedible it was because we have never eaten anything so disgusting in our lives. We physically could not process how disgusting the food was until we ate four tacos. We ordered three types of tacos (squid, cactus, and beef). The squid tacos were passable but dry and chewy. The beef tacos were over-cooked steak with a slice of avocado on top. The cactus taco was freezing. It actually had to be in a refridgerator right before we were served to physically be that chilled. And let us not forget that the tacos were smaller than any I have seen before. They were essentially the size of a piece of ravioli.
