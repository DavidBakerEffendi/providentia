PUB 46 is an awesome place to. Go. Hang out with friends or watch a sporting events. The Bartenders. Are fun and make the drinks good and strong.  Sometimes they'll even buy you a shot.  Its no fancy place BUT its where you can be yourself. You can dress up or come in nice casual clothes.  It has people of all sorts. I definitely thjnk the guys would especially love this bar. If you don't believe me check it out yourself!
