This restaurant is a great addition to the varied cuisine of Astoria.  The owners are extremely friendly and make you feel right at home and like you are the most special customer.  All of the food is great, the appetizers, the arepas and the meat dishes with rice, beans and plantains.  And the sangria is fantastic.  A definite go.
