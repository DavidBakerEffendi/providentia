Bistango is cozy and welcoming. It's a no attitude, no nonsense sort of place. It would probably be somewhat forgettable if it wasn't for it's extensive gluten-free options, including pastas that are rarely found in gluten-free form. Dinner has typically been excellent here, although there are some menu options that could be improved. The chicken and salmon, for example, are great, but the Pork is a little dry. Brunch is somewhat of a let down so I haven't given the restaurant a full 5. But if you're looking for a reliable, reasonably priced neighborhood restaurant or a gluten-free option, this is a great choice!
