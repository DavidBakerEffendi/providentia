I was really looking forward to the food and dining experience here. The food and decor was mediocre.  It's not all it's hyped up to be. We were somewhat disappointed with our server because he didn't know much about the menu and he barely checked on us.   The runners were way friendlier than him.  They have an amazing selection of Italian wines though. The sommelier was very knowledgeable but he didn't seem too eager to help us select a wine. He just didn't seem too into it.  Del Posto, Babbo and Gusto kicks Scarpetta's tush hands down for Italian cuisine!
