well what can i say about this place.. i usually have soups from here which are pretty good, definitely filling.. Now the food I've tried is good but as far as service is concerned it blows.. do i expect the waiter to place the napkin on my lap? NO.. but when the waiter forgets to bring out a dish my buddy ordered or when the waiter sits down across from me to eat his lunch and looks at me like im bothering him when i ask for water..well then that deserves 2 stars
