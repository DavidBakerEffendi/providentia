They are called Good Dog for a reason...they are GOOD, not great. I've never had a bad meal here...and I've never REALLY had bad customer service, the only complaint that I have is that I feel they should have more bartenders during happy hour...the bartender is again GOOD...not great...and he gets a bit flustered...to be honest, good service in Philly is good enough in my book to return!!
