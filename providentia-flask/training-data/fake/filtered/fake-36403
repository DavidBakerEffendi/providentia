Momo-what??  Ok, I've read all the hype.  I even believed all the hype.  I was sorely disappointed when I brought a date for dinner.  Granted, we didn't try the pork butt that everyone raves about, but for the price, our food and service did not measure up.  Fish was overdone, staff was downright rude and pretty much ignored us.  Place was packed though, so maybe it was an off night.
