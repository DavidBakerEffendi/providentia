Great! Small and intimate restaurant. It started out very empty when we got there around 6 p.m., but filled up very quickly. Make sure you make a reservation, because I don't think they'll take you without one. I had the special -- a wonderful linguine with cream sauce and pancetta ... very strong flavor. Oh! And we shared a great bottle of Pinot Grigio that was kind of pricey but totally worth it.
