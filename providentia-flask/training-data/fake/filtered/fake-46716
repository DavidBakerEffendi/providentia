It's hard to make this review objective because Beyoglu is seriously my favorite restaurant of all time.  I almost don't want to talk about how great it is because I don't want it to become more crowded than it already is....so I'll mention the negatives first.  One) they don't deliver!  and two) when you pick an order up, they up the price! Other than that, though, Beyoglu doesn't miss a step.  I have tried almost everything on the menu and I've never had a bad experience.  You're best off going with a group and getting a few meze's to share...my favorites are the filo with feta, the cacik, the barbunya and shepherd salad.   I have had dreams about the bread they serve.... Entrees are large and can be shared as well - try the doner kebab, yum.
