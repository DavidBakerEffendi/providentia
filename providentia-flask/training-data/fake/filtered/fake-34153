I have been a long time customer, having meetings and get togethers with my friends until now.  NO MORE!! My recent visit on tues 5/12/09 was HORRIBLE! I ordered the steak & scallops and my son ordered the rib eye dinner, as we always do. The steak was paper thin full of grizzle and fat. You couldn't even chew it.  The waitress was caring but the manager not! The manager agreed it was no good and offered me $4.00 back and told me sometimes they get a bad batch of meat but can't tell till they serve it. Bull. I've been in the business my whole life and would be embarrassed to send a dish like that, and would gladly refund my customer or offer something else to keep there business. She then offered me a gift cert. for the same dinner explaining she couldn't promise it be any better at a later time. I found her rude and told her keep it my family and friends and I will not be back for any gatherings!!
