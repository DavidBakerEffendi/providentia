Decent overall food, great wings and great beer. The "hot" is barely mouth-tickling and the next step above (ghost hot) is like a fire in your mouth. It'd be nice if there was a middle ground but that is not the point of this review. The food is acceptable-good. The staff is really friendly or so I thought. The bartender had increased their tip from what I gave them (doubled it) and I was very displeased with this. It's not even the money I care about, it's the principal. Not to mention 18% is GENEROUS for how slow and unresponsive they were that day. It's typical that all the blue-collar workers come in for lunch and are welcomed with open arms, but when a business man walks in they see dollar signs and try to squeeze a few more bucks out of him. Will probably not come back despite my liking of their food.
