Had a groupon and went for dinner with reservations. We arrived early to have a fee drinks at the bar. Our experience at the bar was so bad we left and never even had dinner. We were basically ignored at the bar for ten minutes. We finally placed our drink orders and in about ten minutes the bartender came back to ask us our order again. Rediculous for the prices and service so we left!
