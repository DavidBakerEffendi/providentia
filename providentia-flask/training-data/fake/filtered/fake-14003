If heaven existed in a restaurant, it would be Barbuzzo. I cannot say anything more about how fabulous it is. I've tried almost the entire menu on different occasions, and everything is just out-of-this-world delicious. Book a reservation long before you need it, go, and stuff yourself. You won't regret it.
