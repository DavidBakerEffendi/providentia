Mexicali is not the most amazing, authentic Mexican food ever. But I've never expected that, so I'm not disappointed! It's a comfortable restaurant, with a fun atmosphere that's perfect for families, or a night out with friends. The margaritas are great, and I love the chicken taco or chicken fajita salad with the special spicy ranch dressing! The prices are very reasonable and the kids menu has fruit or yogurt available instead of french fries. I definitely prefer coming to this locally-owned restaurant over dining at any of the nearby chains.
