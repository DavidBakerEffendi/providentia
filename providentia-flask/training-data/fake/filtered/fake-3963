I just had an EXCELLENT meal at Get Fresh.  It was my first time there and I was a little worried that there was NO ONE else in the restaurant (always a little off putting).  However, i was intrigued by the menu and the concept and gave it a try. The food was absolutely delicious and the $25 prixe fix menu was such a deal.  Each and every bite i took was delicious.  The menu was well thought out and unique and the waiter took great care in explaining where things came from, what is house-made and what isn't, and what ingredients are used in each dish. The only negative is that since we were the only ones there the ambiance was a little lacking.  I hear it's great for brunch too and cannot wait to try it. Be sure to bring your own wine, and since the prixe fix covers essentially two appetizers and an entree, definitely get a dessert too.  The bread pudding with house-made raspberry ice cream was to die for.
