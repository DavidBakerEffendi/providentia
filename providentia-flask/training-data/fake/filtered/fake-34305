This place has some of the best sushi I have had in the city. I really liked the rainbow roll. I'm impressed at how cheap it was for how good the sushi was. I'm not the biggest sushi fan (because I usually go to cheaper sushi places and they end up sucking) but this place could change me into a sushi fanatic. Awesome!
