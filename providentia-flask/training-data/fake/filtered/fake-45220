Sake Bomb is awesome.  If you love Chinese buffets you must go there.  It has a great selection of Chinese food, dim sun, sushi and desserts.  Additionally the best part of all is the HIBACHI station.  They make fresh hibachi right there for you.  Also even better they have a CREPE station.  Sake Bomb is the Bomb.
