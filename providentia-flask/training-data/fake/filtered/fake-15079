Two and a half stars... On Star Search that meant you did poorly. The food is delicious, but when the service is bad... It leaves you without the experience you were craving. The communication amongst server/ floor manager (host ? I honestly don't know what the other guys roll was). We ordered meatballs to have before risotto. Had to ask for them as our risotto came first. Then we had to ask for water twice. Mainly because the space is small and they had a hard time keeping our tables straight. Pretty sure the table next to is asked do ONE order of meatballs and ended up getting 2 because we had asked. That's called poor communication and table placement folks. :-/ blah...
