I've avoided going to Filipino restaurants since moving to NYC years ago, since the few experiences I had left me disappointed - the food is never as good as Lola's back home! But thanks to Grill 21, I don't have to worry anymore whenever a craving for homestyle food hits. Everything I've eaten there so far is delicious: lumpia shanghai pork adobo (huge portion-enough for sharing) chicken inisal pancit bihon sinigang halo halo special (I got this one with Ube ice cream. Halo-halo was great but the ice cream was a little too subtle on the Ube flavor. Will try this w/ Macopuno ice cream next time) Service is attentive and prompt, place is clean, and the owner Henry obviously puts a lot of care into running the restaurant. Also, they just opened a cute little bakery called "Pan De Sal" on the corner of 2nd Ave and 21st Street where they sell yummy pan de sal and other baked treats. Can't wait to go back and sample more dishes!
