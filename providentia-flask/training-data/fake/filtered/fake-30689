This was my second and last time to this restaurant,  the food was tasteless, it also took an extremely long time for it to come out, and the service was not good.  The servers are more interested in personnel conversation than helping their customers.  The hostess has absolutely no idea how to handle complaints and basically shrugs it off.  Also, the servers are not trained to know their menu. We ordered a drink which the server totally forget to get us, so another server brought it to us.  Think twice before going here, there are better ways to spend your money.
