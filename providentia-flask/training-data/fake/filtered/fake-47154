I couldn't have asked for a better night out!  We have walked past Entree a few times and made plans to visit tonight.  BEST decision of the day! BYOB and NO bottle opening cost.....Thank you!   Salad and surf/turf was spectacular and I was delighted with the fried Oreo dessert.  Pleasant atmosphere and plenty of food choices at a reasonable cost.  We certainly look forward to going back and were very happy with our decision to try somewhere new!
