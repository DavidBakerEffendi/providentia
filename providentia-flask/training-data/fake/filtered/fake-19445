If I could rate this with negative stars, I would.  I wish I would've read the other bad review before I wasted my time.   I took my family of 4 and spent nearly $30 on food that was almost inedible.  All of our selections were tasteless.   Everything had the same texture, mush.   I think they cook it all in a microwave.  And how could they call a perfectly square frozen pressed fake steak a rib eye?
