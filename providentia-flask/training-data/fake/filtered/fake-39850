We were pleasantly surprised to have happened onto this little Thai restaurant!  The decor was small but exquisite.  The food was good and authentic!  The best Thai iced tea ever!  All the soup noodles used a different type of noodle, which was quite refreshing.  The duck noodles were by far the best!  Definitely will go again whenever I'm in town!
