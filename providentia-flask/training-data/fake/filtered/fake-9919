On a whim I stopped in and ordered a cheeseburger. Bear in mind I live in the area and have been to the local diners. After a while the local places tend to to taste the same, or worst than the rest. I gotta say this place is different, they advertise that they use all fresh ingredients and that is definitely reflected in the flavor. I have had two cheeseburgers and the ribeye sandwich. Initially, I thought the ribeye sandwich was small, but it Â made up for that in quality and flavor. The burgers are crazy good, and im gonna go here first when I want one.
