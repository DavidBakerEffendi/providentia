WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT - The hype overshadows the reality at this place. We had a party of 6 and made reservations for a Saturday night. Thirty-eight minutes late, we had to beg to be seated and were finally seated at a make-shift table that stuck out into the walkway. We ordered our meals and were very upset at what was delivered. The Kid's menu offered Mac n' Cheese. For $9, a cup of macaroni - and nothing else-was served on a wooden plank. The kid's Hot chocolates were $5.25 and maybe about 5oz. The adults in our party ordered assorted burgers and sandwiches- all small in size, mediocre in taste and accompanied by 5 waffles fries! I had asked to change the cheese on my sandwich and was told that, since the sandwiches were pre-made, there could be no changes made. After having experienced a long wait and an overly-priced mediocre meal, we did not stick around to try dessert. Too bad..........
