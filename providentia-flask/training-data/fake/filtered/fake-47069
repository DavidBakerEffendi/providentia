I jumped in here for a quick, mid-afternoon lunch, and was very pleasantly surprised!  Extremely friendly, and the food that I had was exceptional (sausage & pepper hero) - I've had a lot of italian food here, there, and everywhere, and this place is AWESOME.  Greeted by chef, owner and bartender on the way in, and chatted with bartender and waitress while I ate.  Friendly, very cool place - I could not believe they had only been open since sometime around November 2010.  Based on other reviews, I'd imagine that you'll have lots of fun coming in during off-peak hours, but you know the crowded, busy weekend nights will keep this place up and running for quite some time, and let's hope that happens.
