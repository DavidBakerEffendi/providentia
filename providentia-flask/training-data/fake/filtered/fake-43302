I love this place....I have been coming here forever.   they always have good food, just the standards....but the last time i went in they had a new menu with new items.  I had the buffalo calamari and the artichoke red pepper dip, which were delicious.  For dinner I had the salmon with citrus butter which was so light and went well with the pinot grigio.  The service was good but the banter at the bar is hilarious.  You will love this place as much as I do.
