As a student from across the street, I can say that Teresa's is definitely the best option for eating out in Princeton. The service is always friendly, the lines only long enough to make you feel glad you got a table and above all the food is fantastic. Great pasta dishes (pecorino Â mmmm...) and even better pizzas. The arugula salad is definitely worth checking. The prices are reasonable, even for college students and the atmosphere is lively, yet not at all boisterous. Great for every occasion, from a family lunch to a pre-party dinner!
