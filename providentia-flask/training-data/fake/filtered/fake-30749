Really bad experience at this restaurant, we came for a family dinner and were from the start being spoken down to. Our waitress/sommelier rushed us at every turn and consistently asked us if we were ready to order when we clearly were not. Just generally all of us felt like we were being rushed out the door, the servers and staff were extremely judgmental and corrected us on our pronunciation of items multiple times. Our waitress dropped the checked and proceeded to lurk around our table until the credit card was put in, when she immediately removed it to ring it up. Not only that but she caused a scene about my dad miscalculating 10 cents on the tab. As someone who works in the restaurant industry I believe that every restaurants policy should be that the customer is always right and and no matter who steps through your doors they are a paying customer and should be treated as such. To be treated as though we were not worthy of being there is definitely not part of a positive experience. I am definitely not returning and I would most certainly not suggest it to others. I will say that the food was good, but not worth the service we received.
