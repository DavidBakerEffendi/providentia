Amazing renovations done to an establishment on it's way out. The inside is beautiful, food is incredible with generous proportions (really good choice with the new chef), and the service staff is knowledge of the menu and very attentive. Was told that it was a soft opening when we went in on Saturday (and it was PACKED). I recommend everyone to try out our new jewel......it's a great escape from the chain and Italian restaurants in the area.
