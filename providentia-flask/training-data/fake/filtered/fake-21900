Best time 2 avoid crowds is before 11.30 and after 2.  Can b manic over lunchtime.  Pennsylvania Dutch aren't there on Mon and Tues so if taking friends 2 show off the Market in all its glory pick another day of the week. Market has pretty good FB page and there is a dedicated foodie blog called phillyfoodlovers.com also on fbook as philly food lovers which runs recipes and posts by fans of the market. Down home diner is one of my favorite places 4 breakfast. Think I've put on 4lbs since discovering the Market!
