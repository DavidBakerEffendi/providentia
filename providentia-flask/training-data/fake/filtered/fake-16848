We got there around 8 pm on a Saturday night without a reservation. We were told that there was an hour and a half wait but it was also possible to get a table in 45 minutes. We decided not to sit at the bar but go elsewhere for a drink, came back in about 40 minutes and got seated almost right away. I ordered the Basil lime daiquiri and my friend got a glass of the Pinot Noir. The cocktail was good - pretty much what I expected it to taste like! For appetizers we ordered the Roast carrot and avocado salad, which was excellent and the sashimi marinated in ginger and mint which was nice but not amazing. We had read rave reviews about their mushroom, parmesan, oregano and farm egg pizza which sounded both interesting and weird. So of course we had to try it. I thought it was one of the best gourmet pizzas I've ever had. Dessert was the vanilla cream donuts with a bacon fudge sauce that our server recommended. Again a little weird with the bacon, but surprisingly good! The service was very friendly and the place is modern and warm. All in all an excellent dining experience.
