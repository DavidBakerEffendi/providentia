Food is very good and they have an extremely consistent menu.  The food is all made on the premises, from the stix to the pita bread.  It's also very affordable, a dinner with my family ended up costing less than 100 dollars and that includes cocktails and a 20% tip. The chicken stix are delicious, as are the chef's special.  I have yet to have a bad meal at this place and I've come back a 1/2 dozen times.
