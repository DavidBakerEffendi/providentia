First time here and I will definitely return whenever in Philly. It is very small with only about 5 high top tables and the bar seating.  The food is New Orleans food and has amazing flavor.  I had the catfish Po Boy with fries.  The portions are plenty without gorging  the catfish hung slightly off the roll and the roll was not chewy or hard. My friend had the shrimp étouffée and again bursting with flavor and spicy.  The beer choices are excellent as well.  The price is great for the quality and portion of food. Wanted to try the bread pudding with bananas foster but they were out. The only thing that could have been improved was the friendliness of the service.  He didn't seem to want to answer any of our questions.  I asked which dish would he recommend and got they're both good. He was very " just tell me what you wAnt because I don't want to deAl with you" attitude. Not horrible did the most basic of service  he could get away with.  Not bad enough service compared to quality and price of food not to return. So I will definitely go back and just hope I get someone else as a server.
