I've been here 3 times and the food has always been great. I found it through Restaurants.com (they no longer are in that program) but it was very good, and I would easily go again. I like the atmosphere better than their competition across the street. I think the staff was somewhat new, as they could have been a bit more attentive, but still, this is a good sushi place. Â BYOB makes it even better. DS
