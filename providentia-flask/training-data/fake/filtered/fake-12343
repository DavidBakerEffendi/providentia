My family and I were in the mood for some soul food relatively close to home. Did a Google search and found Ol' Boys and took a chance.  The food was good and the service was fast and friendly.  My husband had the fish fried rice with a side of mac and cheese and he devoured it. My son had the chicken wings mac and cheese with the yams. He didn't like the yams, but only because they were cooked with raisins. I had the tilapia mac and cheese and greens and was very satisfied. We would definitely go back.  You should support this store to keep businesses in our neighborhoods. .
