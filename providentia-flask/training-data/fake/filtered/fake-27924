I agree with everything Seanmhair F. wrote in his review for Eatalia.  Also the phone number listed on the web is incorrect.   phone number is 215-423-6911.  Frank the owner said he is working on getting it corrected.   Frank was more then accomodating with our meals and special request,   Service was great! Food was outstanding.  Our entrees were Tilapia, Veal, Ravioli and Chicken.  All superb.   Had the anti pasta and long hots for apps.   Both were very good and enough for sharing, we ordered only for 1.  Also had the tiramisu which was the best I've ever had. It was nice going to a small restaurant, feeling important as a customer where they try to do what is necessary to make the dinner an enjoyable event.
