I told the guy not to make my food spicy I said no do not make it spicy you can add a little bit of spice but not too spicy.... Well unfortunately he dumped the whole red hot pepper in there and I couldn't even eat my food and then he looks at me with a dumb grin...  I told him don't you understand me I said not too spicy he said yes it wasn't spicy. I told him look how I couldn't even eat as evidenced by my plate full of noodles I can only eat the meat and the meat wasn't that spicy. I told him look at all the noodles I left on my plate but he just looked at me with a stupid grin. I'll never go back here. .Boo!! ***UPDATE***  I ended up becoming really sick from the massive amount of hot spicy pepper that basically ruined my food. I had stomach aches/cramps and diarrhea for 3 days after. It was such a shame because after wiping down a few noodles and cleaning off the hot pepper from the meat, the food actually tasted good.
