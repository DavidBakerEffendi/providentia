What an exquisite food we had on our son's Bday      We planned to have our son's Bday party in Arusuvai at Monmouth Junction. As usual the party kicked off with kids playing with balloons tattooing etc... Our guest had  lunch before Cake cutting. All items were well prepared and scrumptious especially onion pakora ,Chicken briyani  and Mutton soup (I couldn't say about specific items as a host I didnt have much concentration on food but heard from everybody that all items were fantastic). On that day, the taste of the food is the talk of the party.I never remembered in all Bday parties I have attended, not all the food were tasting good except here in Arusuvai ( atleast a single dish will be tasting average or even unappetizing in other restaurant). Even our friends from Virginia/Maryland had packed for the dinner and next day lunch.What a satisfaction and pleasant party we had. Still I am wondering how they are able to  preparing food  without much oil floating on the surface of food and also not compromising the taste of chettinadu.     When it comes to service, it was good and waiters were attentive.Also I have to mention this here like when we were running late for the cutting cake they didn't even rush us which was good as we could able to attend all our guest( they close the restaurant at 3.00 PM for cleaning but we were able to cut the cake by 3.15 PM and left the place only by 4.00). Finally we felt like we had choosen good place for parting includes food, service,environment,etc....SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND ARUSUVAI for parties for good service and best chettinadu food.
