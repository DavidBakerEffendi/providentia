I love my neighborhood even more since Maia' moved in.  The ricotta pancakes...divine.  Their pastry chef is a goddess and I dream about the brioche caramellato.  really. Coffees pretty close to what you'll get in a bar in Italy.  I only wish I was more of a morning person so I could enjoy the bar/pastries/coffee/newspaper more often before going to work. As for dinner...every meal I've had has been well prepared, quite refined even.  However, the cacio e pepe is a bit salty for my taste.  But I enjoy it so much and am so impressed with the genuine service a la Union Sq Cafe that I only wish they offered more dishes without meat...yes, I know it's called Maialino but it's an italian restaurant - more primi senza carne per piacere!
