Disgusting exterior, dirty interior, the carpets were disgusting.  When you walk in theres so much clutter and not to mention there was no sign of anybody to bring us to a table.  I walked around the whole place waiting looked at the buffet tables which the food looked gross like its been sitting untouched for awhile.  I noticed alot of workers just sitting around or hiding in corners eating ignoring the wondering customers looking to be seated. I was not the only person who left without even eating to other parties left as well as they also complains of how dirty it was in the dining areas.
