Visited the Lebanon location 3 times. Â Food quality was consistently great and the portions were great; the servers are friendly - but there are some managerial things that would dramatically improve the experience. Wait time on visit #2 (for burgers) was over 60 minutes. Wait time on visit #3 (also for bugers) was 45 minutes. Resteraunt capacity on visit #2 was roughly 10%. Servers do not appear to have assigned areas (I notice the same server waiting on both inside and outside tables) as well as having to bus there own tables. Although servers are friendly, curteous, and apologetic they are disorganized and overrun since they don't have bussers or assigned areas. In the approximately hour and a half I was there, I noticed the resteraunt across the street was doing roughly double the customer turnover. The managers present (there appeared to be two) generally stood around with a rag hanging out of their pants and didn't do anything but occasionally check a POS terminal.
