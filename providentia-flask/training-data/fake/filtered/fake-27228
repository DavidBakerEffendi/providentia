I got take out food here recently and was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The Cuban sandwich wasn't really a true Cuban but then again, it was delicious. The volcano fries were also something that should not be missed. If I'm ever in Burlington again I will make sure to stop here and dine in for the true experience.
