Anyone who says this place is not outstanding is looking for the impossible.  This place time after time proves how genuine and good the food is.  Pizzas are always top notch, meals are great, grinders to die for.  Hit it right and get the Italian Wedding Soup, the best around, hands down.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thanks Artie and John and the whole staff.  You are all the best!!!
