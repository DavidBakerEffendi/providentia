The burger was good, the fries remind me of Five-Guys fries.  What I like is the atmosphere and decorations inside.  It's a place I'd want to meet friends and have a drink and dinner.   I also watched the manager, Angela, check EVERY order that came through with a fine tooth comb.  She had them immediately correct a problem if there was one before the order even reached the customer.  I would come back just knowing the service is being taken to the next level with her showing pride in her work. The shakes are good too :) I did wait a little longer than I'd want to get my food on a lunch break but the place had a consistent line from the counter to the door so it has to be expected due to the number of orders.   Overall, check this place out for a good burger and a beer or shake!
