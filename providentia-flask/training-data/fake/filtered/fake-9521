Disappointing--totally charming room and friendly service but waited forever for our simple order and despite staff apologizing Â the (inexpensive lunch) wasn't comped. Probably wouldn't have minded as much if the food had been more remarkable. Mediocre eggplant sandwich and lasagna. perhaps dinner is their forte.
