Ethiopian food is one of my FAVORITE types of food, especially because there is always a good selection of well-balanced, healthy, great-tasting vegetarian/vegan dishes, without having to choose soy or other fake meat products. And I must say, Lalibela surely measures up as one of the best I've ever had (and I eat Ethiopian wherever I go). Lalibela is not only a fabulous place to get wonderfully spiced vegetarian/vegan food, but Meklit (the owner) has begun offering cooking classes once/month. This TRULY sets her apart from the rest! What other restaurant owner would willingly and patiently share her traditions and recipe secrets with anyone who is interested? That is the true mark of someone who is a selfless giver who loves what she does. I went to my first class yesterday and I LOVED IT!! I learned Meklit's secrets in the kitchen, ate a wonderful meal, and left with some homemade berbere sauce straight from the Motherland! Lalibela stands out compared to ANY other restaurant I've eaten at because the food is outstanding, the ambiance is delightful, the owner and her family are welcoming and homey, and NOW a cooking class!!! What more could you ask of a restaurant?!?!
