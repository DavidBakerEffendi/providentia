Ordered the Valentino Special which is a COLD,Yes,COLD fried eggplant sandwich with provolone cheese and assorted peppers.Cold fried eggplant does not work,Sorry! They would be better off serving it as a hot sandwich which is what I figured it would be.(I ate it in store right after they made it).And that was one of their "Specialty" sandwiches that theyve been perfecting since 1922? Wow! Completely Over Rated! Guy Fieri must have owed someone a favor for the way he reacted to their sandwiches.Theyve got the standard Sopranos wall of fame.The cast mustve eaten at every single place in NY and NJ,as I havent been to a single place without at least one of their pictures on the wall.But, like myself,I can't imagine any of them returned for a 2nd visit.
