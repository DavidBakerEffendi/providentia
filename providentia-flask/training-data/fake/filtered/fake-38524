A.kitchen is my absolute go-to for breakfast or brunch. I've only done dinner here once and I was not disappointed. I am a VERY frequent flyer here and I have to be honest, I have had a FANTASTIC experience each and every time! First, I really love the simple decor and the fact that its not big. It's definitely very intimate.  I also really love that there is an option to sit and eat right in front of the cooks! The waiters and waitresses here are really nice which always adds to a good experience...the same goes for the manager who is also a very nice and polite man. So the main reason why I love this place so much is because it is ALWAYS consistent.  Consistency with always having good food and good service makes me always come back for more. Regardless of what you're ordering to eat, make sure you do not deprive yourself of the english muffins they have. OH MY GOSH.....hand's down the BEST english muffin ever.   Try the cheesesteak, its so delicious!  They just added a new item to the menu which is the turkey, bacon, and cole slaw sandwhich. YUM.  Comes with the chips too and its filling but not overbearing. EDIT:  I have to agree with the others, there is a hostess there who really either needs to a. be fired or b. taught social skills because she is not very welcoming and potentially putting off some customers.
