Happy to see Noodle House in University Area - Very nice place and well design restaurant. Well, I am Chinese American came from NYC to try out Sang Kee Noodle House, It was packed in the restaurant, six of my friends and I waited for 20 minutes, service was ok, price was ok too but we all had soup dishes, I couldn't finish the soup and several friends had different soup dishes they couldn't finish it. Soup had lot of MSG in my soup and my friends too! my mother uses MSG but not this much! Perhaps, i try again another time!
