My boyfriend and I took a day trip to NYC. It was his first time in the city. I took him all over the place including the Majestic Theater for a matinee of Phantom of the Opera. I made reservations here for dinner 2 weeks in advance. We were early, they were PACKED, but they sat us quickly anyway. My boyfriend and I are both Italian so this was really a wonderful choice for us. The food was spectacular, our waiter was attentive. Great wine selections as well as entrees and desserts. Very warm, comfortable setting, and romantic to boot. :) I will definitely come back here for our next trip and I will forever suggest this place to friends. Â  We both got CAPRESE salad: Fresh tomato, imported mozzarella di bufala and basil - with Prosciutto di Parma Alex's Dinner: RIGATONI alla Trecolori Sweet Italian sausage, broccoli rabe and sun-dried tomato in a roasted garlic-pesto sauce My Dinner: LINGUINE NERE alla MONSIGNORE Homemade black (squid ink) linguini with shrimp, scallops, squid, clams, and mussels in our flavorful marinara For dessert Homemade sweet Cannoli with whipped cream, strawberries, raspberries and raspberry sauce.
