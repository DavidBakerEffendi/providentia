This is our neighborhood go to spot! We had dinner there Wednesday and the food, service, drinks were great as always. The charcuterie plate is a great value for the money and the bruschetta are awesome. They have updated their menu and added  some more entrees. We tried the lamb shank and Salmon both were perfectly cooked and some tasty brussel spouts with pancetta.  I would not call this small plates, as the portions are closer to entree size. If the mac and cheese is a "small plate" I am afraid of what a regular plate is! The bourbon selection is great and you can try most in one ounce portions- nice on the wallet and minimizes the headache! The glass wine list is mostly under 10-11 bucks, which is great as it is harder and harder to get a decent glass for wine for less than 14 bucks these days. Anyway, this place consistently wins out as our favorite neighborhood spot.
