After reading many reviews, my family and I were very excited to try out this place. Unfortunately, the food did not meet our expectations. We have tried many other Izakayas in the past and we all thought our past experiences were a lot better. Immediately after glancing the menu we all noticed that this Izakaya attempts to deliver authentic Japanese food. My family and I coming from Japan were very excited to try out the food because we were looking for Izakayas that provided the traditional taste. However, the food was mostly tasteless or bland. We all also agreed that the service was very slow. At a Izakaya, we all thought that the food should be coming at a constant pace which is very normal in Japan. This is so you and family or friends can enjoy drinking at the same time with the foods pace. They all spoke Japanese to us with proper service but we wondered since most staff members are Japanese, how might their service be when serving American customers? We understood what they were trying to deliver but thought they could work on more than a few things to make things better. Just to put it out there, for people that have a keen sense of tongue for Japanese food, I would not recommend this place for the listed prices.
