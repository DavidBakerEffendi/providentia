I went here with my beautiful wife Saturday night, and we sat outside on the quaint deck. It was very nice. The wait staff was very attentive and there was a neighborhood ambiance about the place. The food was excellent. We tried he Avacado Fries, Skirt Steak, and the Enchilada's! The Avacado fries are something everyone should try once. The Skirt Steak was cooked perfectly and the sauces they give you are amazing. By far the best part of the meal was the enchilada's! The tomotlllos sauce was out of this world. I would easily choose this if and when I return.
