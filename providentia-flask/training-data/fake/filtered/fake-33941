Pizza is delicious, service so abominable that I joined yelp just to share. We waited over an hour and a half for our take out pizza and excitedly got it home only to find there was no red sauce and our order had been mixed up -- No big deal but after waiting 90 minutes (it was supposed to be 60, but wasn't even in the oven when we arrived to pick up) you kind of want what you thought you ordered. So we called Sally's and kindly asked if we could just come back to pick up some tomato sauce to put on the side. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT I HAD ASKED THE LADY FOR BOTH OF HER KIDNEYS. I was passed off to another employee who was equally distraught and confused by my request for some tomato sauce for our pizza (that we thought would have tomato sauce included.) They declined and said it "is not possible to put our tomato sauce in a cup -- it either goes on the pizza or does not" and that we were welcome to return the pizza for a refund but they absolutely could not provide tomato sauce. I found this whole situation bewildering. Pepe's, modern and De Legna are just as good, and you will likely not receive this whacky service.
