Just went here for the first time for brunch with my sister and mother. Their Hangover pizza is fantastic! The sauce is tangy and flavorful and their crust is thin and crispy. My only suggestion is to ask for the egg slightly more cooked if you do not like runny fried eggs. Â The pizza is huge and can easily feed two people. But I could have sat there and finished the entire thing myself. The restaurant is cute and small. The wine on tap was pretty cool, and is pretty tasty. The check can run slightly expensive, but the portions are a good size and the food is fantastic. I would come here again for a different meal to experience that part of the menu
