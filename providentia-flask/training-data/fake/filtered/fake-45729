I am a little bit of a snob when it comes to food.  Since moving to Philadelphia from NYC its been a bit of an adjustment.  Although there are many quality establishments in Philly, comparable restaurants in NY always blew me out of the water...until I ate are Garces Trading Co. Atmosphere was great, service was great, wine was great, the food was fantastic.  My fiancee and I found it to be the best dinner we have had since we moved to Philly (we moved here 16 months ago and we have been to a lot of restaurants in the city).  Highly recommend the Pasta e fagioli, pappedelle with lamb ragu, and stake frites.
