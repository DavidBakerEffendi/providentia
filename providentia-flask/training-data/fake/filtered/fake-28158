My best spot in New York City. I really enjoy Shade. The staff is always in a good mood, and they give you excellent authentic service with a nice smile. I enjoy the high quality and tasty coffee as well as the nice cold tap beers. The happy hour is a must for me. I have met many nice people at Shade. The music is mostly nice i.e. bar lounge music. Other styles also are played. The food is always very tasty e.g. the crepes. In the event that I should force myself to mentiion one negative thing, then it should be that Shade does not have a website. But hopefully they will get a website one day. Try this nice bar and restaurant, the happy hours are definately happy hours.....
