We arrived about 45 mins after they opened and  I sat and  observed  the following: 1.   Cleaning process  consists of wiping the inside of the glasses (that might be staged from the night before) by placing on top of a clay pitcher so that the hot water inside creates steams and then they shine with a white napkin. 2.  5-7 workers walking around aimlessly looking lost. 3.  Chairs and tables were  being wiped down as if there weren't customers in the business (aren't those things done before opening first thing on a Monday). 4.  My drink was served in a cloudy/dirty glass. 5.  When meal arrived the server literally dropped it on the table with zero concern of how and where it landed (imagine you are mad at someone and to make your point you shove the food in their direction). So with that said, food was okay, the black beans and rice tasted great and the grilled chicken was ok but from what I observed I can't in good faith recommend to a friend.
