I love this place.  The variety and the all day long low prices are awesome.  Great quality and value for the prices you pay.  You get your food super FAST and can enjoy your meal watching a game on the big screens.  The best part for me is not having to tip an annoying waitress.  The recent changes to the place look hot too.  This is one spot to check out for sure.
