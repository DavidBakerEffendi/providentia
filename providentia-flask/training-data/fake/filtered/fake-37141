I just came from Flat Top, and I must say I was most surprised.  I thought it would be good, but it was much better than I thought it would be.  First of all, the hostess and the waitress were great.  The New Orleans coffee was as good as that I recently had in New Orleans.  Also the baguette and olive tapenade were good.  The ginger covered bass entree was absolutely delicious, a very pleasant treat.  The peanut butter and jelly ice cream sundae was a perfect ending to the meal.  As others have said, the place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood!
