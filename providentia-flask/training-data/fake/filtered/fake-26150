I had gone here twice last year and both times it was very good.  Went the other night for my dad's birthday and it was terrible.  I'm not sure what happened to this place but it was empty and we should've taken that as a warning sign.  First it was very cold in the entire restaurant.  They brought out the usual bread/butter and olives as well as a plate of croquettes and those portuguese turnovers that are nothing to rave about but they seem to like so much.  My husband and daughter had the soup which was the only thing that was good that night. I ordered their famous roasted pig, it was cold and tasted like it had been sitting out all day which it probably did.  I had this the prior times I was there and was very good.  My son ordered steak which came out all red inside.  My dad and hubby ordered grilled codfish, they said it was terrible and the seemingly huge portion was mostly sliced potato and very little codfish.  My daughter had calamari and said it was ok.  Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but then again we were the only people dining in the main room.  True the prices are reasonable but the food was terrible and so unfortunately we won't be returning.
