Went in for lunch the day the review came out in the courant and loved it. I normally don't review anything because I am in the back of the house and normally get crucified by people that should not be able to critique food. When its done right it should be talked about, this place was done right. Apps, entree and dessert each thing was exactly the way it should have been and for the quality of food I got my bill was CHEAP. Service was also spot on. I would like to give you some negatives to work on as constructive criticism but I don't have any. Even the ketchups were adorable, yes adorable and you'll see what i'm saying.
