Personally, I don't see what all the hype is about. Voted best pizza in the entire city? Who were the judges... the owners of the place?? The pizza is fine. Not bad, not great. Our classic cheese pizza arrived after a long wait, and was kind of sparse and, gasp, pretty dry. Â I really wanted to embrace my NYer pride and love this place, as its kind of an institution, but after three attempts at eating here and not getting my socks charmed off, I won't be back. Do yourself a favor and head a few blocks away to Lil Frankie's on First Ave for REAL Italian style flatbread pizzas, or pop in to the decidedly unglamorous but amazing Rosario's on Orchard street for a chewy, cheesy NY slice.
