We sat there for 55 minutes, sipping our drinks, and got no food. 45 minutes into it we sent our waitress (who knows nothing about Filipino food) to check and she never came back. 50 minutes into it we sent another waiter to check on it and he never came back either. Finally my wife went back to tell them we'll take the check for our (very good) drinks and go. Then all of a sudden someone who seemed like an owner showed up, the chef showed up... everyone so apologetic and asking to buy us dinner. Unfortunately we had a show to go to and it would have been a stretch at that point. During this time we didn't see any food coming out to the front half of the restaurant, or the bar. We'll give them another chance at some point, but we'll make sure our ticket got delivered to the kitchen. p.s. To give you an idea - our appetizer was fried smelts, which takes about 2 minutes to prepare.
