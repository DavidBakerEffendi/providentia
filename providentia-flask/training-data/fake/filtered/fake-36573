Went here twice; once for dinner (2 ppl), and three weeks later for lunch (4 ppl). Dinner was a little lacking but the waiter was accommodating with the sides (he let me switch in the cole slaw and 1 side with the mac and cheese, which was delish!). We ordered the pork cheeks and pork belly. Pork belly was fatty and generous, but we wished there were more bread because eating pork belly straight up is too overwhelming. Pork cheeks was tasty but the tiny portion was not enough for the hungry male. There's a good selection of beer cans but too bad there wasn't anything on tap. Lunch was much better! We got sandwiches and everyone's portions were more than sufficient. Pulled pork was delicious. Spicy chicken sandwich was good too. Ribs were a bit sad and dry, bland on its own; the condiments are a necessity. The sides seem to be ever changing and improving. The cole slaw flavor changed in a matter of weeks. Overall, it's great and casual. Atmosphere is charming; cute metallic cafeteria trays and checkered table clothes. Interesting bathroom sink. It was a good BBQ place.
