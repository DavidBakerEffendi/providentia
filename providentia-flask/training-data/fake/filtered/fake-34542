I think this place is great! Before you walk in, you can see this is a nice area. Everything looks neat, the creamy color of the building is lovely too. Inside the restaurant, everything is clean and in order; plus, their chairs are comfortable too. The servers are friendly and they really take care of you. Now let's talk about the food. I am a big sushi lover, and when I went to the restaurant the Saturday before with my friends, all we ordered were the rolls. I had one ocean roll and one fantasy roll. My friend had the spicy tuna sandwich and Philadelphia roll, and my other friend had the Godzilla roll. We shared one of their special roll, which is our favourite... we LOVED the spicy tuna sandwich!!!! (seriously, i loved it! The moment i put it in my mouth, I knew I would come again just for this) The sauce was AWESOME! I asked the people there, they told me it was the chef's special sauce. MAN, I loved that taste!!       The fantasy roll was like its name, fantastic!! i think it has shrimp, avocado, lettuce, and crab meat in it but im not sure, pretty much all the stuff i like and would expect from a healthy meal. Especially the soy bean wrap, i know it is very healthy. The Philadelphia and Godzilla rolls were great too. Besides all that, ocean roll is topped with tobiko(that's how people call them, the fish eggs). I don't know about others, but I like fish eggs a lot, because I like biting on them, lol. So I think Yummy Sushi is a great place for sushi lovers because their sushi is different and has got attractive flavors. It is also a great place for a healthy diet. So.... just go!
