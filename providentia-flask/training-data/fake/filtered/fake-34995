If I were submitting a rating based on food alone, I would easily consider submitting 4 or 5 stars.  However, like most people, I think a restaurant experience is about more than just the food.  The service component can really make or break the experience, and this is where Agricola consistently drops the ball. To sum it all up, there is a pretentiousness to the service (beginning at the hostess stand) that isn't necessary and, quite frankly, makes the whole thing feel a bit unfriendly.  Every time we've dined at Agricola, it's felt like the servers (particularly if we are seated at the bar, and 9 times out of 10 we are as the rest of the restaurant is "under reservation") are going through the motions:  this is a stark contrast to the warmth that the flavors of the food and drink exude.     Farm-to-table is supposed to be about community, a relaxed and welcoming atmosphere, and a come-as-you-are experience.  Somehow the stereotypical and wrong elements of Princeton have been infused into the Agricola experience...and frankly, that doesn't make a seat at the table worth the wait.
