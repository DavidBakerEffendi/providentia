Great restaurant. Portions are a little on the small side, and dessert is lacking, but the appetizers and dinners are fantastic. If I had one complaint, it's the seating policy - leaves you a little frustrated to see empty seats that you can't take advantage of "until your full party has arrived." Such is New York... Great restaurant though. Can't wait to come back.
