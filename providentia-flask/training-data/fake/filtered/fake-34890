We've ordered from Danny's three times for delivery since they opened.  Every time we ordered, the food arrived barely room temperature and they are located only 2 minutes away.  When ordering the calzones, it says it includes two toppings.  Well, make sure you order ricotta as one of your ingredients even thought I thought that's one of the ingredients in a calzone.  The pizza is ok- nothing to rave about.  The first and third time we made our order, there were errors.  Won't be calling again and throwing out their menu.  Not impressed.
