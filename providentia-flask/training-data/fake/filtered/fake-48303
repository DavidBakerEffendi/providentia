La Locanda- Newtown Square,Pa. Being a resident of Newtown Sq. my wife and i have had several recent experiences in our attempts to dine in the this establishment. I feel it is important to alert others away from this restaurant in the hopes that they may avoid such bad experiences. Recently I brought a group of eight friends at New Years  Eve to dine here and made a reservation several weeks in advance in order to not be dissappointed by the crush of folks looking for a place at the last moment at such a busy holiday. After arriving on time for our 8:00 reservation, we were eventually acknowledged ( after twenty minutes) and waited an additional thirty minutes,while being told that there was no table for such an unusually large group! All the while, two tops,and four tops were being seated all around us without any attempt to even place a couple of tables together. After witnessing several "gladhanding" exchanges between customers and the the management, it became obvious that only a bribe would accomplish our eventual seating. This I am unwilling to do for such a place ( not that i would even do it in Philly). The owner then proceeded to argue with my wife in full view of all his customers using what could only be described as indecent language. Having had enough, I exited with my party and returned home for an impromptu cook in the kitchen. Events like this I thought only took place on reality TV. The smugness of this restaurant could only exist in a cultural backwater. A previous encounter here( without the holiday pressure) was also incredibly poor and  i guess we were in denial that perhaps a holiday meal with the kitchen humming would result in something better. Please do yourself a favor and seek out even fast food if necessary rather then patronize this establishment. You will thank yourself in the end. Sorry yelpers, this review is obviously not about Pat's Steaks-don't know how the header got confused with La Locanda in Newtown Sq.
