To date, this has been the best pizza I have ever tasted. Whenever my gf and I visit NY Gimaldi's in Coney it's always a must. Service is great and fast. We have gone at a time when they have been cleaning. I wouldn't complain about he wait bc it's an integral part of Gimaldi's and what makes the pizza top notch.
