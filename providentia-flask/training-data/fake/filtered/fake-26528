I went to Oaxaca the other evening with my friend who was new in town. I was immediately impressed, the guacamole is incredible and alone a reason to go. We each got the steak which we were impressed with. After dinner we decided to sit at the bar and enjoy some of the great beers which were on tap. The service was brilliant and the manager made us feel very comfortable. We were amazed to see the place transform from a great restaurant into a lively bar. We enjoyed a few drinks and sampled the tequila selection. I will most definitely return and couldn't recommend the place more. Easy 5 stars.
