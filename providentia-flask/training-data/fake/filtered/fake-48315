If you are planning on going to Philly soon, and you have seen Pat's King of Steaks on the food network, please DO NOT go here!  I took my 14 year old son who is a big Philadelphia Eagles fan and we toured the historical city for two days & went to a the Monster Jam in the Eagles stadium June 9th, 2012.  Eating here was the worst experience out of everything we did in Philly.  Way over rated & taste gross.  I wish we went to Jims or Tony's, I wish I read more of these reviews before we went.  As a whole Philadelphia was great & there actually was really nice people all over the city EXCEPT for Pat's King of Steaks! They are rude nasty people & your sandwich is already done when you order, not made fresh. Plain tasting, in fact my son said I make better cheessteaks at home! and I would agree with him.   Hopefully anyone reading this will think twice before spending 10 bucks for lousy crapping food with rude attitudes.  As as somone else said, they dont care! The sign on the building basicallly tells you to order it right or your a moron, its a matter of how fast they can make their money. BEWARE!
