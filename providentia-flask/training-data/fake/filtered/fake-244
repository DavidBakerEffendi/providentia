My family and I were visiting Philadelphia when we saw Geno's featured on a T.V. show while in our hotel room. Trying the iconic Philly cheese-steak sandwich was part of our plans and the show sold us on Geno's. What a disappointment! It was overpriced (over $8 a sandwich), barely any meat, which by the way was tasteless, and the fries and drinks were also ridiculously priced. My family felt robbed. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME and MONEY! We later noticed that what the street vendors were selling was more appetizing looking than Geno's. The only plus was the quick service--quick to take your money!
