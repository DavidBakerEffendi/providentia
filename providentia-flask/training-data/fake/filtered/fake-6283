I grew up eating Japanese food and this place is the real deal. I wouldn't even be embarassed to bring my friend's super-traditional, picky Japanese grandma here. This place is all about the food: every cut of raw fish I've ever eaten in the past 8 years has been wonderfully fresh, delicious, not to mention well-presented.  The rice and nori accompanying the sushi is also amazingly good, and everything's perfectly proportioned. A lot of places mar otherwise good fish with mediocre/bad sushi rice or nori, or a too-large mass of rice with the slab of fish, but not here.   You can tell they care about the food when even the "throwaway" items (in other places) get as much attention as the fish does here: their miso soup is one of my favorites (inclusive of NYC restaurants) and even though I never order the sweet egg omelet pieces and always thought I hated it (because many people/places make it badly) I love it here...where it's light-fluffy and just the right blend of sweet-savory.   The decor is basic. They had a makeover last year and each table feels more private/comfy now. Lots of medium-tone wood. (Though they sadly also redid the menu and got rid of my favorite don, with sea urchin/scallops/roe).  The waitresses serve you quietly and efficiently.  I know the chef has a reputation for being fierce, enforcing his many rules, but who cares??  You go here to eat good sushi and have a good sushi-eating *experience* (not sit amidst families of 6 with screamy toddlers and strollers blocking the aisle) -- it's a price worth paying in the culinary wastelands of Princeton.
