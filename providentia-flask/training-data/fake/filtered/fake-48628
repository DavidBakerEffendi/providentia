Honestly, everything got ruined by the service. My girlfriend and I ordered before the couple next to us, the party of three next to them and also before three other people who ordered to take out; they all got their food well before we got ours, which was only four empanadas. It was a 25+ minute wait. We also asked for two beers that took them over ten minutes to get from the chiller to our table, which was right next to it.
