Its not bad, its very tasty, they just season their meat with sea salt only but i hate that you cant just prchase the meat by itself and if you opt to refuse the carb overload of endless fries and rice cooked withpounds of butter and salt, you pay the same price as if you bought the combo. thats sad, they make money... Another thing is that the workers do not wear hair nets, but no one seem to notice.
