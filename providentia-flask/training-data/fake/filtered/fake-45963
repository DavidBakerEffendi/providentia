There are several things you should watch out about tops. Even though they have good food and you pay for that, you should be aware of this. (1) the staff in there doesnt care about you, they care about how much money they line in their pockets. (2) if your there after 1 am friday and the weekend, they automatically add 15% to your bill regardless of if you had good or bad service. The Staff there deliberately say nothing for the fact that many people dont read anything, so people add even more gratuity to the bill. The waiters purposely dont say anything to line their pockets. Between the cloth napkins and the slightly good food, they have, and not saying they dont have good food, your paying anywhere between 40 to 50 percent more than a normal diner. People go there because they want to be "in the crowd". After a while you'll find out that its all about the money. I mean in the middle of newark nj a diner charging as much as a 5 star restraunt? Its a business and they are getting away with it.
