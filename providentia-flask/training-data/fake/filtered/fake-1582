Great Food and Great Service! I arranged a catering order through Gandhi Indian Restaurant over the weekend for 15 people and I have to say the experience was terrific!!! The Food was delicious (most restaurants cut corners for large orders- but not these guys). The service was terrific- from the time I placed an order to the time I left the restaurant with trays full of food (they even helped me put every single of the 10 trays into the car with great care). Best of all the price was extremely reasonable for the amount of food they served (even after eating seconds and thirds, there was enough food left over for few dinners). They even provided complementary serving spoons for each dish as well as dessert. I was blown away by their thoughtfulness and over all customer care! I am already looking forward to working with them for my next dinner party!!!
