I can't believe I am just now writing a review for Lupa.  My husband and I have been coming here for years and it is consistently a fantastic night out! Not pretentious, great quality food (the Bucatini All' Amatriciana tastes like the pasta I had in Italy), fantastic wine, and relaxed but efficient service.  We love to park ourselves at the bar and although we always say we want to try something new we usually go for the Saltimboca, Spaghetti alla Carbonara & the Bucatini (we share it all and it's plenty).  Also, took the in-laws here and they loved it! Great go-to spot for a no fuss but fabulous dining experience.
