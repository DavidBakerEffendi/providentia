Wasn't impressed with hot dog and cheese or the french fries. The bun was delicious but that was all you tasted. The dog was probably good but couldn't really taste it in the huge roll. The potatoes are about 1/4 inch thick and round but were just warm and not that good. They should take a ride up the road and try the hot dog served by Five Guys that's a dog.
