Took my girlfriend here one night to try it out; we had been driving around and we were starving! Didn't really feel like doing the same old , Fridays , Applebee's etc. We were on St. George so we stopped by and I have to say I'm happy we did! The food was amazing , loved the tacos and re-fried beans. My girl got the burritos and sweet plaintain rice and the nacho dip was out of this world! Definitely will be going back here soon, not to mention the price isn't too bad. You should go check it out!
