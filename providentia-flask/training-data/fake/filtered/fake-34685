The Thai food here has already been reviewed to death.  The service, however, seemed to have gone down noticeably in the past year.  I come here quite often, almost every other month or so.  My most recent visit was earilier this month with a out-of-town friend.  We chose to sit outside in the back yard because it is nicer and much  quieter.  The table they gave us was right under a tree by the door.  It had birds droppings on chairs and the table.  It took a good 5-10 minutes before I caught a waiting staff's attention about the problem (keep in mind that we sat right next to the door!), and another 5-10 minutes before the waiter assigned to our table showed up and cleaned up the table with cloth.  (I hope he understood and realized it was bird's droppings he was cleaning, and did not continue using that wiping cloth..) Half way into the meal, we ordered two Thai iced tea and a coconut juice.  When the waiter brought them over, he just dropped all 3 glasses in front me instead of giving it to each person.  When I complained about it, his reply was more or less like like "Uh, I am busy, can't you see, just do it yourself."  And yes, we ended up doing it ourselves. In essence, the food there is really good.  Chefs are doing a good job.  But if the waiting staff keep their attitudes like that, they will have less customers returning. Pro: authentic Thai food, and can adjust the spicy level as desired.  Decent prices, comfortable environment though it can get very loud.  The garden is nice, but do NOT sit under the tree! Con: It gets pretty loud in the restaurant.  Cash only.  Service is getting worse than before. Recommend: Pork tender, mango salads, drunken noodle
