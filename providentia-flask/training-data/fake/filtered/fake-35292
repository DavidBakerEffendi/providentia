My wife and I just tried this place for the first time. It was absolutely incredible. The food was made fresh to order and was amazing. They have an awesome craft beer draft list!. My wife is not able to have gluten and they were able to do almost their entire menu gluten free, including having excellent gluten free pasta. I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great date night meal!!!
