Short review: The pizza took forever to come and when it did, it was burnt on top and soggy on the bottom. Don't waste your time. Long review: My mother and I ate here on a Saturday around noon. The restaurant is easy to miss on the street because it is at basement level and the sign uses dark colors. The interior was beautiful, but the tables are way too close together. The pizzas are all sold as 11-inch round pies, which seems like a lot for one person, but is just the right amount due to a super-thin crust. The beverage menu only offered beer and wine, so we had to ask if they had anything non-alcoholic. The waiter only suggested a few sodas, even after my mother asked for something non-carbonated, so we were annoyed to see him bring a cup of coffee to another diner only moments later. I ordered foccacia as an appetizer but what I got was burnt, wafer-thin bread with a little rosemary sprinkled on it. It tasted as bad as it looked, so we didn't eat more than two bites. A set of diners seated after us got their pizzas first. My pizza, the Reginella (cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil), arrived next with a few burnt pieces of basil, which I picked off. The pizza tasted good, but thin crust + cherry tomatoes = soggy middle. Another set of diners seated after us got their order, before my mother's Popeye (mozzarella, ricotta, and baby spinach) finally arrived. The spinach was burnt worse than my basil, and the chef put on way too much ricotta making this pizza soggy as well. She didn't like hers at all. There is one unisex bathroom, kept neat and clean, and it is as beautiful as the rest of the restaurant. The check comes held in a giant wooden clothespin, which I thought was a cute touch. Overall, I feel this place has potential if they could get just their act together in the kitchen. But right now it's all flash and no substance.
