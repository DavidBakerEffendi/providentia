Served drinks then waited about an hour to get our menus. I ordered steak fajitas, which came piece meal, and the beef was charcoal burnt, and the tortillas broke apart. Tried eating it with a fork but couldn't get passed the charred flavor. Told the waitress I couldn't eat it, it was to burnt and she just gave me a stupid look.any decent restaurant would apologize or take at least half off the dinner. All in all it was horrible.dont waste your time or money.also the table was sticky.strange mix of music for mex rest. And very loud!
