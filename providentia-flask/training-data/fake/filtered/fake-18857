We came to this place thinking that it would be awesome. My parents were in town and wanted to try a great pizza place. We followed the previous couple thousand of yelp reviews. It was a mistake, during the dead hour of the day it took almost 45 mins to get our pizza. It was burnt, literally black in most parts and the "chef" argued that this was the way it was supposed to be. Â This is no way to treat a customer. 0/10 would not come back.
