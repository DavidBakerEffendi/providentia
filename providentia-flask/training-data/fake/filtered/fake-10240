Firstly, the service is exemplary - the staff are all very polite and go out of their way to make your experience an enjoyable one. Probably most importantly, the food is just spectacular. The Thai mussels in a curry cocoanut broth for that extra fantastic kick. For entree the grilled hanger steak w/ garlic smoked bacon sauce and buttermilk fried chicken are simply divine. I also think their Brunch is the best in the state, every time I get the crab cake benedict I say this is the best breakfast I have ever had! The bar itself is pretty cool, always has a nice selection for micro-brews on tap.  Also my wife is very picky with her mixed drinks and they go above and beyond to make sure she loves her drink. I also had a small reception of about 45 people and everything was perfect!  There wasn't one detail overlooked, the staff and the management made sure every guest was well taken care of.  Also they took their time and met with me and the wife 3 different times to make sure everything was exactly as planned.  Out of 45 people we only heard praises and not one complaint.
