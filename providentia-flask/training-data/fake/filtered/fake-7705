Went here after softball with my team, super amazing waitstaff, gluten free options, and the margarita pitchers were phenomenal!!  The food was great! Big portions, great flavor and fast service. The waitstaff really has their act together. Our server was Lindsay F, and she was awesome!  Very friendly, we never had to ask for anything, she just knew what we needed before we even knew what we needed.  I would give this place 10 stars if I could! It's also right next to North Bowl... So you can put ur name in for lanes, and when they tell u it will be 2 hours, go over to Dos Segundos, for some great margaritas and great food!!! Thanks Dos Segundos, see you soon!!
