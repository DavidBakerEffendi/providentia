It feels redundant to add yet another good review for this place, but they really do live up.  These guys are so good, I had them cater my wedding.  The food is outstanding, the prices reasonable, and the family that runs it is always a delight to deal with.  I'm glad I don't live in their delivery range, because I'd end up buying their food every night.   I especially recommend the gyro platter and the hummus, and whatever you do, be sure to get their Qabuli rice, which is practically worth the trip all by itself.
