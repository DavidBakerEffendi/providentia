I went there last Friday it was fantastic! We sat at the bar and had dinner, I had the little victors which were amazing and very unique. My boyfriend had the lechon, roasted pork shredded in their house sauce, very tender and went perfectly with the black beans and rice. The staff was very friendly and full of personality. We tried various mojitos, pineapple proving to be my fav! We enjoyed the atmosphere and service so much we decided to stay until the DJ came on. We had a blast! The DJ played a mix of Latin music, house and hip hop. All and all I would definitely recommend!
