Place is terrible. We went to brunch on a random Sunday afternoon, place was empty probably because the food was terrible and over salted. Received 'iced coffee' aka hot coffee poured over ice. After the terrible food we received the bill and was told it was Cash Only. Icing on the cake, do yourself a favor and run the other direction from this place.
