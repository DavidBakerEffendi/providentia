Luuuuuuurve it. Not only is the sushi fresh, tasty and beautifully presented, the staff is over-the-top nice. Truth be told, I've only ever had their sushi because that is the highlight and what they're really good at. One time I went there and had a roll they listed on their special board that had lobster or crab and mango in it which was groan-eye-rolling worthy and when I went back a month later and wanted to order it again, they brought out their specials binder that they have and let me look through it to find the name of the roll. Super accommodating and super tasty, a definitely must eat
