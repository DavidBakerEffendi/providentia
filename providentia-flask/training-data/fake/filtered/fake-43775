Alta has a great ambiance, and the food is amazing. I particularly recommend the fried goat cheese with lavender infused honey and the blue crab risotto. The downsides to Alta were a very high noise level and the fact that, while delicious, the tiny portions at Alta are quite pricey. Overall, if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks though, Alta is a great tapas restaurant, the best I've been to in the city.
