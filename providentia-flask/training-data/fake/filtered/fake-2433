HORRIBLE!!!! I have been to many chinese buffets and this is close to last. One of the shrimp dishes I was eating had barely any edible shrimp..most were just the tail shells with shrimp in it...as if someone ate the shrimp but didn't bother to take the last little piece out of the tail shell...makes me think they took them out of the dirty dishes and re-used them...utterly filthy and disgusting !!!!
