Absolutely love Don Peppes. I grew up in Howard Beach and my family has been (and still is) going there for years. Since I moved to long island, I haven't been able to have decent clams casino in a while. :) Their linguine and clams is out of this world and its family style so there's enough to go around. They don't have much of a wine selection, its red or white. Thats it. They don't tell you what kind or where its from ha ha gotta love it.
