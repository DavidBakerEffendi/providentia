After bragging to my out of town family members about how good the food at Amy Ruth's was we decided to eat there on a saturday night. Our service was mediocore and my wife's meal never arrived. Conveniently the 18% gratuity arrived on our bill.  When my wife complained to the manager $10 was removed from the bill.  The waitress was apologetic of the error in our order, but the manager was extremely rude and unprofessional. To make matters worse after we finished our meal she walks up to my wife and literally tosses a to go order of chicken and waffles on our table and says "Cheers".   I immediately called her back and told her to keep her charity, We had a large party and a large bill and were not there for her charity.  This is not the way you treat a customer who was shorted on service. We weren't there to try to get a free meal. She then got realy rude and told me she didn't need our negativity (ofcourse after getting our money)and she would give the food to the homeless man outside. So we as paying customers are reduced to the level of service extended to the beggar outside. REALLY.  I used to frequent this establishment when Carl the old manager/ owner was there and he was always attentive and friendly to the cutomers.  I was embarrassed in front of my family who for their first visit to NYC had to experience this type of service by our own people in our own neighborhood.
