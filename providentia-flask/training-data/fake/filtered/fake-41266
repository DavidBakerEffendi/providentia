Well, I made a huge mistake when I went here for brunch recently!!  Don't get me wrong, the mistake wasn;t in going there, it was what I ordered.  I had a tasty plate of eggs benedict that was hot and flavorful, but I didn't get the PANCAKES!  and I've been dying to try them and completely forgot!  Oh well, now I have a good reason to go back!!  Service was great and the vibe was cool and relaxed!
