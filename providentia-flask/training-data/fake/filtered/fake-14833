I've attended the Gallerys' Single dances on a Sunday night for many years.  The $6 or$9 cover charge (depending if you know the key word or phrase of the week or not ) can't be beat.  You also get munchies and a DJ playing music you can dance to.  That is if you can find a woman to dance with.  It's suppose to be a Singles dance but yet a lot of women go there with dates.  The women who are not on "dates" are often with their friends and tend to be cliqueish chatting away with each other or just checking their messages on their iPhones.  The singles dances here can be fun if you meet the right person.  But it appears to me that the maority of women here have no intention of meeting anyone new.
