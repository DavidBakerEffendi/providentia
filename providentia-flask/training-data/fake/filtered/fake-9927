Recently y fiancee and I dined at Ola for the second time. We were both very disappointed this visit with both the food and the service. The waiter forgot to put our order in and didn't  tell us until we had been waiting a longtime. He didn't apologize or even offer to compensate us in any way(free drink or something so we waited forever for our food. the food is OK but expensive. We would not  return again to this establishment.
