oh Iris cafe! i love this place. usually coming in for a casual brunch on the weekends, they have great coffee, amazing baked goods and avocado toast and eggs. you just want to hang out all day. Delish! I recently discovered they now also are open for dinner, -being the favorite spot in the mornings- i had to try this!! by night the mood changes a bit, dimmed lights, candles, i would say they turned up the romance factor, and as i came with my boyfriend it was perfect. we ordered a bottle of red wine-  great pick by the sweet waitress, two starters- the market salad and the trout pate, as well as getting the cider- braised chicken and the lamb for our entrees. we digged in and it was beautiful from start to finish. the market salad was in season(i was told the greens were mizuna), perfectly dressed with a tarragon dressing, roasted nuts and beets. the trout pate- to die for. not too salty,on toasted sourdough and with a little side salad. we split the entrees. id never tried cider braised chicken before, so tasting this made me inspired to do this at home. it was super tender falling of the bone. came with brown rice and confit squash which was super yummy. the lamb was sooo tender, well seasoned, and had millet and a bitter green salad on the side. loved the lamb, but would like to see a little more on the plate, you just wanted to keep eating it. finally we ended the meal with 2 espressos and a chocolate torte. the torte- i have no words, smooth chocolate, so rich and creamy. one of my best chocolate experiences ever, iris cafe please do not take that of the list! i am happy to see a local spot serve such simple yet beautiful plates of food. its a little different then the daytime menu, as you can tell both quality and season is in consideration thruout the dinnermenu. ive been back several times, only to have been treated with amazing food yet again.   oh and just a note to Hong. L -they take all creditcards.
