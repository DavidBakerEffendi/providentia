Jumped the shark.   It's sad really.  I've been going to this place since it was called Roque's but I've noticed that it has been slowly going downhill lately.  We went last night and everything was bad...drinks, service and now sadly..the food.   My wife's margarita was not good and hardly had any salt on it.   Our waitress made herself scarce.  We burned through the chips...never asked if we wanted more.  We had to ask for water multiple times but apparently she had an important conversation to conduct with one of the busboys.  She  clearly didn't care to be there let alone care if the patrons were enjoying themselves.  When she finally came around to ask if we wanted more drinks, we said 'No thanks'.  Even though I was craving another Switchback, I was not about to drop any more money in this place. And lastly, the food was not good and that was final straw.  I can usually overlook the other things If the food is good.  The main problem is lack of seasoning.  All the chicken in our dishes was dry and unseasoned.  My wife had a taco and an enchilada and both were basically a tortilla and that bland chicken and not much else.  I had the Polo Mole enchiladas which I've loved in the past but this one was that nasty chicken just drenched in an over sweetened mole sauce and (I agree with another review), served with very low grade rice. I think that was my last trip there.  It's like watching someone you love wasting away.
