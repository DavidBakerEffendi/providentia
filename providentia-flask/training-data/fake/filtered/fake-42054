I've been eating at this restaurant for almost fifteen years. I'm only 28. As I grew older, I tried other things on the menu (the beef pan fried noodles with a couple of Tsingtaos hits the spot!), however, I've always ordered the Chicken over Rice with extra ginger. I've tried the combination spots nearby, tried the other restaurants, but they get it just right, every time. After a couple of years, they get to know what you eat, what you drink, like an old school restaurant, if you're a consistent customer. It isn't the Chez Pierre, but it's one of the best greasy spoons I've been to, and I'm glad it stood the test of time. Cheers to that.
