My husband and I rarely ever go to breakfast or brunch (after coffee, he's usually not hungry until 2pm), but he surprised me this past weekend and asked, 'Do you want to go to brunch?' Â 'Why sure! Pick a place.' We live in West Haven and have never been to Georgie's. It's right across the street from Stop & Shop. Hubby read that it got great reviews, so off we went. The place is cute, cute, cute inside. Retro and sparkling clean! Service was prompt. Hubby was in heaven cause they had eggs benedict, which I don't cook. He loved them. I had a short stack of pancakes and the home fries. The home fries were bland but man oh man were the pancakes incredible! They were the best tasting pancakes I have ever eaten. No lie! They were a bit sweet, albeit a bit thin, but they sure filled me up. I seriously cannot stop thinking about them and having them delivered to my house each weekend may be a new tradition. I opted to pay the $1 extra for the real maple syrup and so glad I did! Yeah, I don't know if I can make it til Saturday to place another order. They were that good!
