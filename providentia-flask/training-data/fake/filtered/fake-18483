Unfortunately our group of 5 did not have a good experience, despite rave reviews from our friends.  We were there for lunch.  We loved the fresh flowers and decor.  The food was good.  However, our entire experience was soured by the staff's "you don't belong here" attitude.  It felt classist .  For what it's worth, our group of women was a fun, well-mannered and highly educated one, but casually dressed on a cold, rainy day.  We left disappointed.
