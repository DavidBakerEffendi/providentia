Our party had to wait 30 minutes for our reservation to start. My duck was pretty good, but the quail appetizer was dry. Luckily it had stuffing, but not enough to save every bite. Unfortunately, my husband went with the cod which was completely tasteless and didn't show the least hint of seasoning; served with a barely there champagne sauce. It was a step up from boiled chicken you would feed your dog. Service wasn't that great, friendly but inattentive. Much better BYO's in the city to go back.
