i would like to rate this a 5 start only give it a 1 star cause the star of the place ( sue) is no longer here and didn't get the kind of hospitality that was said on yelp which i was hoping for and i was greeted by a lady name " inas " which was no help at all to explain the dishes to me on what is good to eat i asked the chef / owner nasser where is sue he just avoided the question and said inas is much better but is not even close as been good as sue on what i read about her on yelp ...so i will not eat here nor give it a 5 star till she is back .....all with me we want sue !!!!! Â  we want sue !!!!!
