Just about perfect. Hell, Brancaccio's is better quality and taste than at least half of the restaurants in the Slope AND you get to chow comfortably at home rather than patiently ignoring inane Slopey banter. Win-win, friends. Here's all you need to know: 1) Brownie: Buy one, eat it, you're welcome. Try to keep it to one a week, if you can. 2) Cinnamon roll: Seriously good. Underrated. 3) Flesh of animals: Flank, pork, chickens and meatballs. Get them and you'll be very happy. Various incarnations and all are excellent. 4) Sandwiches: Rarely do I feel sandwiches are worth the money at most places. Joe's are worth the money. 5) Head's up: This is not a McDonalds. There are not fourteen-million of every item waiting patiently in a gigantic freezer just so you can have exactly what you want exactly when you want it. People love this place and they eat the hell out of the food here every day. Many times, I don't get my brownie. I'm cool about it. If you show up and they're out of something, be cool about it. Use it as an opportunity to try something else and I promise you'll still be thinking, "Oh sweet mother of tastebuds how did I live without this?!"
