NIce warm cozy small place. The pizzas are really superlicious. We had a pie with Mozzarella, Prosciutto, Mushrooms and Eggplant. The ingredients were fresh and high quality items. It had a great crust thats not too chewy, just right. The sauce was maybe the best I have ever had. Its abit pricey ,but well worth it. 100% satisfied.
