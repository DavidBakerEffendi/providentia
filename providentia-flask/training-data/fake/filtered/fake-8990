Only a review for early drinks.  We did a few of the Manhattan speakeasy's this weekend and was by far the best experience.  It started out a little rough as we my wife and I were just walk-up's (no reservations) around 8:30pm.  We explained we just wanted to grab a drink before dinner.  The doorman quickly turned us aways saying "they were over-committed".  As we stood on the sidewalk (which as empty..no one in sight) debating our next move a few people were leaving.  The doorman motioned us over and couldn't of been nicer.  To his credit when we walk-in they were PACKED.  He wasn't just saying they over committed..he meant it.  Once inside a grew, warm atmosphere.  We got the attention on the first bartender we saw...he poured us 2 of the best drinks we had all night, and we were off.  Thanks EO.
