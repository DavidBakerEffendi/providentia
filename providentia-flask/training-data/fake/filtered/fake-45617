This is a small but clean and beautiful place. The staff is very friendly and the food is amazing! I called ahead for a lunch special and it was there waiting when I arrived. I'm pleasantly surprised at how fresh and ungreasy the food tastes compared to regular chinese take out. So happy this placed opened here!
