Nice place. I have ordered sushi from here 20+ times and I have noticed that the special rolls are really good but if you get the regular ones like california or boston it's crappy. Better spend a few more bucks and get a special roll. For a year now I believe they have chinese food as well which is really cool. Sometime I get chinese and the miso soup! Perfect combination. Do not recommend to eat inside. A bit weird atmosphere but they do deliver quick and the food is delicious. Always get free soda :D
