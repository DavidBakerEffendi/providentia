We went to Sampan on a Friday night for drinks and small plates. Between three of us, we shared four small plates: kobe beef satay, edamame dumplings, shrimp pad thai, and cheesesteak bites. All were good, although I think the Continental's small plates are tastier and have bigger portion sizes. The Vietnam Fizz drink (vodka, lemon grass) was delish. It was a relaxing evening, nice atmosphere, hopping place with a lot of excitement. Our server was exceptional.
