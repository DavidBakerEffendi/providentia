Would have been better but overcrowded was not how I wanted to start the night.  Saying that we grabbed a seat at the bar, had a glass of wine each and shared a starter (crostini with goat cheese and a homemade pesto).  Very nice.  A good way to start the evening but nothing special.   Special was my companion for the evening.  Sugar was on my arm yet again for another shot at best date ever.....read the other review from this night to see if we achieved it
