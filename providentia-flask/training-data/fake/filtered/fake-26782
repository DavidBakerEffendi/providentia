Best Turkey Sandwich I've ever had!  The turkey is so tender and flavorful.  The employees pay close attention to detail and really load up up the sandwiches with all the good stuff.  The turkeys are really juicy because Original cooks them overnight.   The Original Turkey is a *MUST* when in Philadelphia's Reading Terminal Market.
