This is a very small, hole-in-the wall spot in a tiny shopping plaza but HANDS DOWN the best pizza in town...and I'm a pizza snob!  The staff is friendly and the food is consistent. I have never had a bad pizza or a bad pasta dish.  From the lasagna to the baked ziti to the stuffed shells to the eggplant parm....I feel like my grandmother made it. They also have a delicious antipasto.  This place isn't fancy. You wouldn't want to go here for a date.  This is a pizzeria where you sit down for a quick bite or pick up dinner and bring it home. AMAZING!
