We typically go to Joe Allen's before or after theater.  Somewhat limited menu, but we like just about everything on it (I don't usually order fish out so not sure about their fish selections).  Upon last visit had the simple chicken sandwich which wasn't simple at all!  It was quite tasty and the fries are top notch.
