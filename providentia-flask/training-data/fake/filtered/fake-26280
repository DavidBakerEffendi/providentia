I have eaten here many times and can honestly say this is the best Thai food in the region, even including wonderful places in Middletown and New Haven. Fresh, inventive, clean, artistic food with flavor and a huge menu. It is run by a small family who do the cooking and serving and is completely authentic. The place looks like nothing, from the street. Inside it is contemporary, lovely, peaceful. Rated highly by NYT, among others. Thai Terrace is a word of mouth place where regulars in the know keep it in business.
