Good, laid back atmosphere with open kitchen and diner decor.  Boyfriend says one of the best burgers he's had in new york.  My veggie burger was a little burnt around the edges but very tasty.  I had chilly on the side which was good too.  Good fries and variety of condiments.  Good beer selection.  Turn and burn service but still friendly and accomindating.  We will go back.
