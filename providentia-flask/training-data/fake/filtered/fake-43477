went 2 yrs ago--wouldn't go back--Waitress on another planet spilled muscle juice down my arm & onto my outfit.--she just kept staring out into space but another waitress saw it happen & ran over.  She took me into the ladies room &  tried to get my outfit clean.--I asked why a waitress in a daze was serving tables & no one could answer.  There were 6 of us eating & it was a nice big bill & no one even offered us a cup of coffee  for what the idiot waitress did & the spots never came out of my outfit which they never offered to clean..  Since i live in the neighborhood its just been easier for me to tell people to eat somewere else & not have your clothes ruined by a dazed waitress.  However, most restaurants would have offered at least coffee.
