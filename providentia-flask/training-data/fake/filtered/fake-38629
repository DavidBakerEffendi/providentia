If only it didn't get so loud this would be a five star place for me. Starting out with the great raw bar - I'm a sucker for oysters and they have not only a good variety of both east and west coast oysters they always seem to be fresh. The entrees are excellent as well with nice pairings of fresh vegetables. I'm particularly fond of the way they do scallops but I've never been disappointed with any of their fish or seafood dishes. I must admit that I have not had much in the way of meat here but that is not what I come here for. It is also a BYO which is a big plus for me. Now if they could just find a way to make it a bit quieter.....
