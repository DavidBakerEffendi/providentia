Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, And a late night snack, seeing on Friday and Saturday they are open until 10pm ( that's love). For all of you little nagging baby's who actually took their time on writing horrible reviews your wrong. I've been coming to Claire's for years now. HM can we say organic, gluten free & vegan. No where's perfect and for all of you people who were " over priced" you don't know shit about organic food. And you wonder why your are waiting in such a long line ?
