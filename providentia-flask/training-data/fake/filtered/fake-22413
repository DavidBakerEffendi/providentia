Let's face it folks, when you go in for comfort food, you want to be... oh, I dunno... comfortable? I'm not talking about the seating (which was fine, albeit drafty), but the wait staff. They seemed friendly enough when they were actually paying attention, but personally I don't go in for feeling like its my responsibility to track down and beg a server for something as simple as a glass of water. If you're going to ignore your customers, you'd better have some darn special food to keep them coming back, and Queens Comfort, with their tiny menu of mediocrity, isn't anything special.
