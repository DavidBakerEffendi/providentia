My husband and I ate here for dinner for the the first time this weekend.  It was recommended to us by a couple of our friends and we couldn't wait to try it.  Needless to say we were very disappointed.  The service was excellent,  staff were super friendly, atmosphere was great but food was NOT good. We ordered the corn bread which was very dry, the short ribs which tasted like they were cooked two days ago and warmed back up in the microwave, the flatbread which was doused in salt and the pasta which was ok.  The best thing I had was the one BBQ oyster.  We will not be going back or recommending to anyone we know:(
