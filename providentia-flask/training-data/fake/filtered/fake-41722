I've been coming to this place for the past few months now and have NEVER had a single bad crumb of thing to eat here, and the people who work here are nothing short of fantastic. I literally just made a yelp account to share my love for Black Tree. Besides the incredible food here, which I could go on and on for days about, I'm posting specifically for a woman named Darra and how she is so important and valuable to the Black Tree establishment. My friends and I just had dinner there no less than an hour ago and we had an AMAZING and WONDERFUL time and it was unarguably because of Darra and her friendliness and efficency. She was the best waitress/hostess/person to spend our dinner with and I could not say nicer words about her. NO we are not staff, NO we are not trust fund babies (I will show you my bank account I swear), NO we are not just friends of the people that work there...we are genuine people who live in this city and love amazing food and amazing people and that is what Black Tree has to offer you. SERIOUSLY this is one of if not my absolute favorite restaurant in this city and I seriously highly encourage anyone who enjoys putting food in their mouth and chewing it and eating it to come to Black Tree as often as they are able to. (THANK YOU DARRA FOR BEING THE BEST WAITRESS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!)
