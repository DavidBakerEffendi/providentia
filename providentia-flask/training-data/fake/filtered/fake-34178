terrible terrible service! we made a reservation from out of the country, and it was cancelled by the owner because he couldn't reach us on our mobile once we got to nyc. we actually went to great lengths to call him back by his "4pm" deadline to confirm our reservation, and he had already given away our table!! he didn't care at all that we had reserved weeks before from out of the country and was unwilling to apologize or accommodate us in any way. do NOT support an owner that doesn't care about his customers. money is his bottom line.
