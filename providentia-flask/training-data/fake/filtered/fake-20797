I went to La Sirene after reading great reviews on Yelp, and it was as good as expected~  It is a tiny restaurant and there is nothing really around it - so I wouldn't recommend going early thinking you might be able to get some windowshopping done :) The restaurant was cozy - reservation is a must.   The service was a bit slow, but the waitresses were welcoming and they made good recommendations (although she recommended almost 2/3 of the whole menu).   We had the mussels with dijon mustard - YUM! - I really recommend dipping bread in that sauce b/c it was amazing. I went 2 of my friends and we each had - cassoulet, skate, and tenderloins. This was the best cassoulet I've had - and I'm not even a big fan of beans!  The side veggies were also good - they came in a separate plate - and mashed potatoes were especially good.   Both the skate and the tenderloins (medium rare) were very very good.   We finished our meal with Profiteroles - the chocolates covering the frozen cream puffs were very very good - it was like eating ice cream.   I must say it was a very good meal - we each payed $36 (including cash and tax) and that is probably only possible b/c it was BYOB.  I'm definitely going again in the spring to see what they are offering then :)
