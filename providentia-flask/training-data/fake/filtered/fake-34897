I took my parents here after my friend said it was really good, we had to wait 1hr on a Monday night too get a table, the hostess was incredibly rude to us. Our starters were good but my main dish of pollock was dry and bland. The menu didn't offer enough variety and I didn't eat it but I still got charged for it even after making a complaint. I would save your money and go to a place with bigger portions and nicer people.
