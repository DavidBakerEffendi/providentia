The food is great! But the staff is hard and cold. The first time I went to the place, the owner wasn't friendly. OK, we all have bad days. But when the staff is the same, Â you think twice. Then I took my family, same attitude. Never again! I really feel sad for them, that they have to follow such a rude and unfriendly boss. I don't know why he is such unfriendly person. I work in the event biz and relations is everything. You can have great food, but bad attitude will kill. Sorry Brisket Town! Good food, but poor, poor attitude
