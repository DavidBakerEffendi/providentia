We ate at Max Fish in Glastonbury on Sunday.  Arriving about 3:30pm, we were seated in an empty restaurant at a booth near the kitchen (perhaps being 3 women may have prompted that type of seating.  Our waiter came and announced that the kitchen didn't open until 4pm.....the sign on the door said 3pm.  He took orders for drinks, which were brought.  Nothing else was offered.  3-4 other parties were seated by 4pm.  He waited on at least one other table(having been seated after us) before us.  Then offered bread basket, which took quite a bit of time to arrive at the table.  He explained that he was stressed.  The food was good.   Dessert was fabulous.  Service was mediocre.  Maybe it was an off night.....but since this is the 2nd time we've eaten here and received less than adequate service (the first time it was very crowded, so lack of service was understandable---but not Sunday's) will probably be my last visit.
