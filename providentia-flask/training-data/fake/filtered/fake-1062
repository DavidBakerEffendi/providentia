I visited this restaurant during the summer. My friend and I were impressed with the interior decor but hardly impressed with the food. I ordered some type of Indian dish that included steak and mash potatoes. The steal was very bland. There was some type of sour-tangy sauce on top of the mash potatoes that I thought was disgusting. When our food arrived, I was shocked at how small the servings were. They're definitely too pricey to have such small servings. We also ordered the tacos; they were okay. I would definitely visit this restaurant again at someone else's expense... Not my own. Lol. I personally just don't feel like such small servings deserve such huge prices.
