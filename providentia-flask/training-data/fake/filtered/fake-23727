Perfect setting, upstairs or down, with solid food and a terrific ambience, staged by some good tunes and an eclectic clientele.  Minor flaw... the "martini glass" ... major flaw ... the hostess, who rudely protected her turf w anti-social mannerisms, a condescending tone, and helped raise the stress level for us all seconds after we arrived.  Luckily, a cool dude interrupted her rudeness and politely addressed our concerns.  Phew.  She was a BUZZ KILL.   (Attended: Wed night 5:30 PM July 16) Solid 4 star spot...
