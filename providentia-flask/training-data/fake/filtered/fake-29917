First Post, I am being pro-active against the saying that people are more likely to post a bad review than a good one and giving some of my favorite establishments a nod. Grew up in Windsor since the age of 5, my grandfather and father before me swear by this place, and so do I. I am what you would call, a human ninja turtle. My favorite food is pizza, I can polish off a large pie from anywhere I have been single-handedly. It's freakish, I only weigh about 170. I eat Pizza EVERYWHERE I go, I have been to Italy, Greece, Chicago, all the boroughs of New York. The only pizzas to rival Wilson for me were Lou Malnati's in Chicago, the ORIGINAL Frank Pepe in New Haven (The expansions are lackluster), and a spot that had no name I could see in Rome (It was close to the Vatican). I would call it an even tie between Frank Pepe's since if you aren't a fan of thin NY style pizza Pepe won't be amazing for you. Me, personally, I love ALL pizza. To anyone who complains about the health factor of a pizza, seriously? If you are such a carb counter then a place called "Wilson Pizza Palace" should be off of your radar. The pies are bursting with flavor, and they are very generous with toppings. Their grinders are enormous and best if eaten on the spot. Their other food I have not explored, the Pizza / Grinders are just too darn good. But some friends tell me everything they make is good. I know the family that owns the place, they are good people and keep everything very fresh and very clean. Do not be fooled by the janky appearance of the building, it is just a piece of Windsor history.
