Very fresh seafood but not particularly adventurous. Noise level can get high and service level can miss a beat (We sat for a very long time after finishing our entres before a waiter asked about dessert). Reasonably priced for a mid town hot spot - happy hour was getting a lot of attention when I arrived at 630PM Warren W (Minneapolis via NYC foodie)
