Had lunch here the other day. Not many inexpensive options around here so I figured a grilled cheese might work well into my budget. Turns out these aren't your grandma's grilled cheese sandwiches! This is the Starbucks of grilled cheese sandwiches. Definitely too many options for me I just went for the plain one with tots. It was yummy although a bit pricey but still pretty good.
