Ok I'm going to tell you thr pros anf cons of my experience eating here. Me and my Friends decided to eat here based on recommendation. When we attempted to go in on saturday it was extremely crowded and because we had no reservation it took a littke while to get seats. When we were finally seated we were treated to service Immediately which amazed me because it was so busy. We ordered different ramon which I've never had before and it was mouth watering. The con was that it was pretty Expensive but i believe that you get what you pay for. So we then ordered An assortment of things from the pork buns to steak and some form of chicken. I ate off of all my friends plates, lol, and i will say for an expensive place  which i never Would of went to if it wasnt for my friends it was a overall good experience. Good music, we got free beer which surprised me, and good food. So i give this place Five stars. I don't know if its normally that crowded but the biggest con is them  not controling the crowd when their crowded to accomadate new guest. Compliments to the chef....
