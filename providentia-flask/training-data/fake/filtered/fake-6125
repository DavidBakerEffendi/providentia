Probably one of the worst restaurants I've ever been to. The menu was poorly designed and difficult to read. The service was horrendous. The food came in very small portions, was cold to the touch, and bland. They didn't even offer bread with the meal, just a couple of breadsticks that were plopped on the table in the wrapper - AND JUST ONE PACKAGE. For the prices being charged, this place was not up to par. I can understand that it's early days for Stone Hearth and they have some things they need to work on and iron out. So to say that all hope is lost for this restaurant wouldn't be fair. But portion sizes need to be tripled at the very least, prices need to be lowered by a few bucks a pop, and the waitstaff needs to get on the ball (don't replace silverware that hasn't been used before the entree is served). To be perfectly honest, this is not a place I recommend dining at - you're better off at the original Delaney's.
