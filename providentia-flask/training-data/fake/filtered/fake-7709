Had low expectations for restaurant week in c.c., really enjoyed this place. The owner was there expediting out the food. I had home-made rigatoni, the real star here was the dessert. I am from Italy and this is one of the best desserts I have ever had. It was a carmel sea salt buidino. Worth the trip I promise!
