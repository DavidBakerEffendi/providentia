I can't say enough about the decor, service, timeliness, etc.  But there are two things that I will have to let other potential customers know about - 1. The sound level in here is outrageous.  I'm a young person and it was a Saturday night and when we arrived, I was excited that the restaurant was buzzy and alive.  When I sat down however, I could hardly hear the waitress and the company I was with.  I had to keep leaning over my food to join conversations.  It didn't help that a 4-top next to us were drinking whiskey by the glass full and were atrociously drunk and shouting at each other.  I had a full blown headache when I left. 2. The squid ink taglitelle should not be on the menu.  The soup...I mean, sauce that it came in with thin and tasteless.  There were only 3 mini shrimp in the dish as it was over run with salmon, and the fresh pasta was stuck together and mushy.  Just an absolutely awful dish.  Had I been in the company of others, I would have sent it back. That being said, I live local and would like to give it another chance.  Perhaps I can bring ear plugs.
