Went here before the Sweet 16 at the rock and im glad I did.  Just a local dive irish pub with great food and cheap beer.  I had the bbq burger and my brother had the cajun provolone.  Both were amazing and some of the best burgers ive had a really long time ( id give the slight edge to the cajun provolone burger).  Cheap beer too.  Def your best bet to go before a game at the rock as its only a 10 minute walk through lovely newark lol
