This is my first Yelp review, but I feel like I really owe Posto a shout out since I will sadly soon be leaving this neighborhood :( .  Posto's thin crust pizza is mouth-wateringly good.  We have regular cravings for it, and it always arrives piping hot and delicious via delivery.  I used to live by Patsy's, which I loved, but Posto kicks their butts!  SO SO GOOD.   We usually get delivery because we love the comfort of our own home, but they have a lot of outdoor tables, which are great.
