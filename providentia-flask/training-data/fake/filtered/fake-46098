The quality of the food is good, but although the staff is polite, the service was awful-  our food took more than 30 minutes to get to our table (and we were lucky, our neighbors were just starting to  eat when we left)-  our sushi did not come all that once-  we were getting them one at a time, but sometimes 10 minutes in between dishes.    The portions were not that big, and the fact that you are greeted by a menu that states "minimum of $20/person, no cakes, one bottle of wine per 2 people" does not feel very welcoming!  We have tried comparable sushi places around the area-  this is not one that we will be going back to.
