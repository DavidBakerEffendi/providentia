My boyfriend and I last minute decided to go on a weekend getaway to Vermont.  I called around to different places in the Woodstock area until finally calling Adam here.  He had but one room open for the nights I was loooking for, a three room suite upstairs (clearly more room than the two of us needed) but Adam graciously offered it to us at a reasonable rate! Arriving here, I was amazed at how quaint and comfy it was. Adam greeted us at the door and had remembered my name!  The room is incredible.  Very cute, comfortable, very clean, loved it! Adam and his staff were very friendly, always there to ask if we needed anything.  Adam was right there with my boyfriend and I closing down his little bar in the back each night! If I have friends looking to get away for the little weekend to Vermont, I will HIGHLY recommend The Parker House Inn! Cant wait to come back again!
