What a lovely place! Â I live in France right now and this place reminds me of a lot of the cafes there. I came here with my family for brunch and it was delicious. Great iced tea (not too bitter and not too sweet), eggs benedict was yummy except it's very light on the hollandaise (good for the arteries but not the soul!) and my only complaint is that the mixed greens didn't have enough dressing. My mom said the apple omelette was a nice blend of fruit, meat, and cheese, my dad loved his ham and cheese croissant and my brother loved his croque madame. We had pretty good service. I definitely plan to come back the next time we visit my bro!
