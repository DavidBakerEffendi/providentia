I had my bridal shower recently and my amazing bridal party got sandwiches from Miss Rachel's pantry as a duo with various different home made hummus'. I had heard from various friends how awesome the food was there - but had never tried it. I can safely say that it was amazing, and I would definitely order food from there again. She also gave us a variety of different vegan sandwiches - as most of my bridal party is not vegan, but open to try different things - which was super helpful for them. I do have to say the peanut butter, apples and agave was a huge hit among everyone, though. Thumbs up!
