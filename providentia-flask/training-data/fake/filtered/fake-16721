Hello there friend...may ask you a question?  Do you know those times where you've wished that a moment could last forever?  Well if you've bitten into Miss Rachel's Sweet Barbecue-Style Seitan, or her Open Face BLT Bites, then I'm sure you do.  If not, well friend, you've lived an incomplete life.   These and other culinary masterpieces were recently featured at my wedding, and the response from all in attendance was the same:  "Amazing!"  My blushing bride and I couldn't agree more.  Yes friend, that moment will linger forever in my memory as one of the happiest in my life.  Never before has a meal so well satisfied the very yearning of one's soul.  The tantalizing aroma, the cavalcade of flavors dancing about one's taste buds...each dish was more delicious than the last.   As I sit back and reminisce I am forced to wonder how much work could go into constructing such a moment...but wonder I must, for the process of working with Miss Rachel and her wonderful staff was not only effortless, but thoroughly enjoyable.   Of course it goes without saying that I would, whole heartedly, recommend Miss Rachel's Pantry for any and all catering needs...but recommend, is just not strong enough a word.  That's right friend, I would IMPLORE you to avail yourself of all Miss Rachel has in her pantry.  These moments need not be saved for such special occasions as weddings, bar mitzvahs, and corporate functions!  These moments can be, and are, made every day at Miss Rachel's Pantry...and they are there now, warm and  delicious,  waiting for you!   My friend, I must ask you...what are YOU waiting for?
