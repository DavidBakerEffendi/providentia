Went to Eli's for lunch & had the turkey burgers, but this one was not good. Fries were mushy not crisp & no flavor. I had ordered food to take home which was clearly put in too early. It was the penne vodka which I have seen there as a generous portion when eating in the restaurant. The take home was cold, scant(not much more than a layer of pasta on the bottom of the container), with very little vodka sauce. There was no real flavor.  It was very dry, not tasty, and a huge disappointment. Have had other issues previously...should have known better.  I will not be back. Too many other good places to eat in and around the area. Done, done, done!!!!
