Balaboosta gets five stars, despite the fact that the food was not perfect (well, one thing was not perfect, but more on that in a second). We sampled a lot of different appetizers, and I also had the skirt steak as a main dish. The falafel meatballs were amazing! I've never had anything like them before, and it's well worth a trip here for these. The chickpea layer gave way to a ground beef center, and the two flavors complimented each other perfectly. Another highlight of the appetizers was the cauliflower. There was a layer of lemon on top of the crunchy cauliflower, which was fried but not too oily. The pine nuts added a nice nutty bite as well. Between the falafel meatballs and the cauliflower, I was in heaven. The one appetizer that I did not love was the hummus. I prefer my hummus very thick and smooth, and the one here was rough, with chunky chick peas on top. It was not seasoned with enough spice or olive oil for my taste. It was, however, incredibly fresh. The skirt steak was delicious too, and I loved the potatoes it was served with. Everything arrived hot. We had malabi for dessert, which tasted like panna cotta. The nuts on top added some nice texture. Our waiters were so nice! We had one waiter, who I think was Assaf, who was super-nice, but then all the other waiters helped out when they could. There was definitely a team effort going on. Everyone was very friendly. It really added to the atmosphere. Usually, every dish has to be perfect for me to give a restaurant five stars, but Balaboosta had that something special, which made me overlook the only dish I wasn't crazy about. The food is super fresh, and it has that pop, that zing!, those unique flavors that are rare to find.
