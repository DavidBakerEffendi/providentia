Went to Tinto last night for the first time w/ a friend. We had the truffled chestnut soup, which was probably the highlight, so good! The Pork belly was another highlight. We also had the vanilla lobster, the verdosa salad (pass on that) , and the artichokes w/ pasta. The desserts were OK...the mato y miel, and the chocolate layer cake.
