i trying several Italian places in town, this is my favorite Italian place HANDS DOWN.  It is the less expensive restauant and in my opinion the best.  You can't go wrong with ANY of their menu items. The problem is that this place has also become so popular that it is ALWAYS packed and usually some kind of wait. Also, if you like nutella, the dessert pizza is yummm. Sure, conceptually, the dish is ridiculously simple, but can you make a pizza crust like Teresa can
