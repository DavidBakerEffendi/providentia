Woooo-wee! My roommate, Randy, and I went here when we were shoppin' round "The Village". I'm not usually a fan of vegetarian food (gimme the MEAT!!!), but I decided to give it a whirl and try their $3 falafel sandwich with hummus. Â  Here is the low-down: 1. Cheap! 2. Tasty! 3. HOT (but tasty!) SAUCE! PLEASE RELOCATE TO SALT LAKE, MAMOUN'S. I could use you after my hikes!
