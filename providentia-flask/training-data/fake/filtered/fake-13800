I recently went to Amalfis for the first time for my cousins engagement party. The food was amazing and the place itself is gorgeous.  After the party was over we went into the bar area. One of the bar tenders, Terri, was extremely rude and unfriendly.  I had mentioned something to my cousin, who goes to Amalfis often and her response was "she's always like that."  .. I went back a few more times and her attitude was always the same. Although, there was another bar tender, Johnny, who was very sweet and kind.. It made up for her attitude.  I recently found out she was let go from Amalfis.. and I think this was a good decision, for the restaurante. Everyone else who works there is friendly, nice and they all have great personalities... they made you feel like family. I recommend this place to anyone, I drive 25 mins just to go there!  Great food, great people. 5 stars!
