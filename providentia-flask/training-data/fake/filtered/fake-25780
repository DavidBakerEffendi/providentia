My family and I ate at LaScala's on Saturday evening.  The food is not very tasty and for the money, very overpriced.  Slices of Italian bread were brought over to the table and the bread was cold and not fresh.  The misto salad was acceptable but the roasted beet and goat cheese was not flavorful.  I ordered the gnocchi and it was tasteless with a few chunks of mozzarella cheese mixed in on top.  We also had the seafood fra diavolo which the waiter recommended and the pasta was overcooked.  Though it claimed to have a wide assortment of fish, there was only 1 shrimp in the dish bordered with several mussels and clams, and very little crabmeat and calamari.  The grilled salmon was not fresh and as we tasted it, we felt like we were chewing bones, since it was rather crunchy.  The waiter did not offer any parmesan cheese to add to our dishes. And the waiter never asked how the meal was; perhaps he knew better. A big disappointment and we won't return.   A restaurant should care about their food!
