The best Lenny and crew are da best!! The chef's table is a 7 or more course dinner with the best of the best.  They feed you till you are going to bust and then they bring out the dessert which magically makes room in your belly.  The Spumoni and asst cakes and ice creams are incredible. Really one of the best restauarntas in the workld.
