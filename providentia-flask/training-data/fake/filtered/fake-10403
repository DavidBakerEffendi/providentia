GARBAGE negative stars !!!! if you've been in a coma for 19 years and your doctor is afraid that eating food with any flavor whatsoever will be a shock to your system, sending you back into a stone cold sleep... THEN THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU, because nothing they had, of the 3 dishes that I ordered had any flavor at all... closed eyes test on the neighbor... couldn't tell the difference between the chicken, the risotto, or the giant chunk of half cooked potato in the 'mashed potatoes' if at one time someone here running things knew what they were doing, they have left a long time ago.
