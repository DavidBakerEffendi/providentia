I love the ice house. Went there over summer time and the outdoor deck that overlooks Lake Champlain is spectacular. The entrees are a little pricey but the food is worth it. The turkey club is great with kettle chips. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is overall wonderful. Would definitely recommend.
