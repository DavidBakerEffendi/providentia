The market is a great place for a quick bite to eat, purchase groceries, or shop for specialty items ranging from soaps to baked goods to cookbooks.  There is a lot of variety, so it's pretty easy to find something for everyone.  Just be mindful about the days and times you want to go.  The market can be overwhelmingly crowded on the weekend.  So unless you want to fight the crowds, I would try to go during the week.
