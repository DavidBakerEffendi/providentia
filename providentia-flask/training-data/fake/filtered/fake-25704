amazing meal. cocktails: smoky empire which everyone raved about, was not my style... a bit too much of a "bacon" taste. spiced and spike was really interesting, but next time i would order that with dessert. entire dinner menu was available for restaurant week for only $38!! some items have supplements, but still!!!! fluke crudo was light and tasty, sweetbreaks were out of this world. never have i had such light, rich (yeah, i know it's an oxymoron) and crispy sweetbreads. i could eat this for breakfast, lunch and dinner for a week! squid ink pasta was indescribably delicious. grilled lamb t-bone was very heavy and rich, and i thought it needed a bright note in the dish (some balsamic vinegar?) to add a little contrast. merluza was perfect - moist, flaky and paired beautifully with a grenache blanc. dont forget to leave some room for either the caramel cake or chocolate souffle. both are totally worth the calories!!!! oh, did i mention the view and the dining room? both were lovely but i thought the food totally stole the show; it was worth the trek.
