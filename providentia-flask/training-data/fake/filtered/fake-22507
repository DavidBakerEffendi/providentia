Lunch with friends on June 12. Two of us ordered one of the specials, Scallops, on rabe with Quinoa pilaf. I had to ask the price of the dish which was twenty dollars. Thought we were going to lose it when the meal was presented with TWO that's TWO SCALLOPS!!! Ten dollars per scallop??? And they were not extra large scallops just average size with the greens just surrounding them. The presentation was laughable. The pilaf, while very good was only the amount from half of a large serving spoon. Stick to a sandwich as our other friend did. Also the chef is heavy handed with salt. $35 for the two scallop plate, one glass of wine and coffee! Make sure you eat plenty of bread.
