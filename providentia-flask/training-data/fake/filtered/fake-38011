Fantastic food, we loved the moonshine it really is excellent.  The pickle tasters are also fantastic.  The obvious drawback is the rate but as long as you can get some drink orders in it is really rather manageable.  I would highly recommend this for anyone who wants some delicious southern inspired food and/or drinks on the uws!
