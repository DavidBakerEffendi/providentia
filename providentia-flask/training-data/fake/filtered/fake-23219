OK. So this place is new. It is just  a month old.  Anyway I predict it will catch on when it gets into full swing.   It is a very nice space with a great roomy bar in a central Village location. Right next to Christopher Street. And the food I had there for dinner recently was delicious. Camarones al ajillo, garlic shrimp,  one of my favorite dishes in any  Spanish or Mexican restaurant, was fantastic Garlicky and not too spicy.  Make sure you have plenty of bread to  sop up the sauce.  This appetizer  was a perfect leadup to the main event, Callitos alla plancha con chile, spicy scallops.These were succulent and well cooked. The grilled asparagus that came with them were also fine, crunchy and not overdone. I understand the cook is expert at using Mexican chiles and it shows. The flavorings are very subtle, never overpowering. Service was friendly and efficient.  I will definitely return.
