My boyfriend and I wanted to try this place for a while. We went today and I told him he'd have to get me very drunk before I ever went again. The fries were just barely lukewarm and soggy. My burger was built backwards it seemed. It just fell apart and the sauce that was supposed to be on the side because I was warned that it was incredibly spicy was all over the burger, melted into the cheese rendering it virtually inedible. It was like fire. My mouth hurt. My boyfriend got lucky: his was half built right. That right, only one half was decent. For the price of this place, I'm completely displeased. I will not be coming back.
