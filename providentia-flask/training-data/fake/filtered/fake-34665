I went there to order my lunch and while waiting for the take out I asked if I can charge my phone for a few minutes. I was shocked when the waiter asked me if I came over there to charge my phone...... After a while I asked a waitress the same thing . She pretended like she can't hear. I assumed she wasn't deaf and I had to ask her if she speaks English at that point...lol Anyways, making long story short...I canceled my order and just walked away. I just wonder if the smartass waiter who works there has a green card..lol Good luck with your crappy service! 0 stars from me!!!
