DID NOT EAT - NEVER SERVED. We were a party of 9 last night and waited to be seated for 1 hour in the tiny waiting area. While waiting we ordered drinks and after another 20 min of waiting - paid our bill and left. The waitress never apologized - even after we paid our bill and were clearly frustrated - no manager came over to talk to us or seat us. They charged us for a drink that we never received!!!! We left and went to Therapy Wine Bar two blocks away on Lewis and had a lovely dinner and drinks. This is a sad turn around from what used to be AKWAABA restaurant of which we were loyal patrons. We were looking forward to eating there!!! This is not enticing us to come back to Peaches. DISAPPOINTED is an understatement!!!!
