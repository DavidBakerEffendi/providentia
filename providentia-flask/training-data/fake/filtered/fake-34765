We recently attended a wine tasting dinner and were very happy with the food, atmosphere and presentation.  The food quality and the quaint atmosphere are great.  We are very picky when it comes to food.  My husband is from Italy and we are used to great Italian food.  The pasta sauces were delicious and the pasta cooked perfectly,  The bread, which is made there is great.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
