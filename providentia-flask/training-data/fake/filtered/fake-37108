Our daughter's wedding was at The Stone Terrace on March 31, 2012.  The food was hot, the service great, and the atmosphere was truly stunning.  When we first met Trish, we knew she would make this day memorable for our special occasion.  From the initial meeting to the last minute changes we want to thank the staff for helping to make the day so wonderful.   Guests are still calling with compliments of the wedding reception.    We are so happy we had the reception at The Stone Terrace and look forward to many more dinners at the restaurant.
