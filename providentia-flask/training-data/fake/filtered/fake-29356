Went here for dinner.  It's like my seventh time going.  The ramen's freaking awesome.  Not sure you can go wrong with any of their ramen choices.  Definitely better than any .99 cent crap you pick up at the supermarket. Why not 5-stars?  The appetizers while good, are pretty small in portions and they always seem to come in odd, strange numbers. Like if you have 4 people, then they give you like 3 pieces of something.   They're open and honest that practically everything comes with MSG (although you can ask them to exclude it) and maybe that's where the flavor comes from... but hey I ain't got no problem with MSG. The only other knock is their wait times.  On peak, you can expect anywhere from a 45 min to 1.5 hour wait to get seated.  You're forced to wait in a small bar area that has little seating, limited drinks and on Friday nights, you can at times be butt-to-butt_standing_room-only with a million other New Yorkers... Otherwise, freaking awesome.
