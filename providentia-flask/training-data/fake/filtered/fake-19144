I just had my wedding reception at The Manor on 10/10/10 in the Regency Room and it was the best day of my life!!! Roman and his team made sure our guests were comfortable, the food was terrific (and this with a group of "foodies"). I still have people calling me to say they dream of the potato soup which was served.... You cant beat the price, the grounds are beautiful and the service impeccable. My only tidbit of advice would be to speak with the pastry chef about your cake if you are deciding to use the cake included in your package....I thought the design of our cake interesting, but not what I had in mind for MY cake...although it was delicious!! I would recommend The Manor to any bride looking for a venue!
