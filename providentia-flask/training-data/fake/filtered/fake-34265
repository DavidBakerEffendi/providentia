Great for authentic sushi lovers. The flavors are all immersed in the fish. For anyone who likes to dip their sushi in soy sauce think again. The waitress told us "NO NO not good idea"!!!! The place is very simple yet has an elegant style at the same time. We had a small sake bottle and the omakse and it was almost $200 for two. Not your typical japanese dinner but great for special occasions.
