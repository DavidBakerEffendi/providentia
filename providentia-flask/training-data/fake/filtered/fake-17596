Had a wonderful dinner here. Reservation was late on a Saturday night, and we were greeted warmly and seated promptly. Service was great; we had a nice recommendation for wine and the spacing of the courses was perfect. Server was attentive but not overbearing. I had the halibut and my date got the duck--both were delicious! We started with the cheese plate that was a special that day and it was a lovely way to begin our meal. The ambiance of the restaurant was perfect. Great for a date, and despite being crowded, not to loud to discourage actual conversation. Loved the decor and feel of the place too.
