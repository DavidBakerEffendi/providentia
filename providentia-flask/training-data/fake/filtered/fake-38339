I had a really awful experience here today. We were a group of 7 mothers who came here for lunch. We had strollers, which can be cumbersome for a restaurant, but the place had LOTS of open room, few other guests, and we had a very large check. The waiter could not have been ruder to us. He was annoyed from the very beginning that we had the babies with us (i would understand at dinner, but at lunch, come on) and he treated us poorly. The service was slow and he was annoyed whenever someone ordered something. Let me add that none of the babies cried for more than a moment the entire lunch. We were not a noise disturbance, and did not cause a bad experience for other diners. Prior to paying our bill, the waiter told us he would not accommodate us in the future because of the strollers. He said we could come back when the back room was open. Considering the restaurant was mostly empty, there was no reason for this. He would not allow me to speak to manager about his comment and said he was the manager. I sincerely doubt he was. Â  Anyway, I won't go back. It's too bad they were so rude, because the food was pretty good.
