This place sucks. They cook nothing more than dog food(meaning it has no taste). Everything is with bread. Chicken with bread, Â hotwings with bread, egg with bread, burger with bread and the list goes on. They have burnt chicken selling to people....are you kidding me ? Yuck ! Disgusting ! I would never recommend anyone to waste there time and money to dine at this place. Very rude owner as well, avoid this place at all costs.
