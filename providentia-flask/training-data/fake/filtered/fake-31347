This is a classic case of the Emperor having no clothes. Â No wants to say the emperor has no clothes, and practically no one wants to admit they were taken in by the hype of this place. The hamburger I ordered was way overcooked, and was in fact cremated. Complaining resulted in snide comments from the manager. The pie is mediocre. The crust was flavorless and soggy. This is another New York place whose reputation far exceeds its quality. There are so many great places in New York. Go elsewhere for good food.
