The place is a nice addition to the neighborhood, and the food is good and reasonably priced. It's too bad that the service is so poor, or I would visit this place more often. Me and my dining companions as well as other people in the bar and restaurant were constantly trying to flag down wait staff on a recent night when the place was not that crowded. Be prepared to wait and don't come expecting good (or friendly) service. If you are in the neighborhood, beau mode and good king tavern are much better alternatives.
