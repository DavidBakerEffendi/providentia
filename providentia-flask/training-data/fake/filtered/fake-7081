Great concept, well executed. Super busy during weekday lunch and weekend nights. Long lines and you hardly ever get a place to sit. You do want to eat your Kati roll hot. I would actually suggest them to do away with the tables and go for bar stools and tables like most of other places. My all time favorite is the Mixed Veg Kati roll. Can't believe they actually increased its price. Also love the Shrimp Kati roll.
