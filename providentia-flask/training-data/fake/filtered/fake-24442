I've been eating at Su Xing for at least 6 years and was so glad to have some place to go when Harmony was sold and went down hill.  In all that time I've only ever had one dish that I didn't care for.  That was the sprial seaweed - which I don't think is even on the menu anymore. The food is excellent, plentious and the place is hospital clean.  As if that were not enough, the pricing is extremely affordable, especially the lunch specials.  They are mostly $7 before taxes and tip and include soup, side dish, entre and hot tea. I had an attack of panic a couple years back when I came by and it was closed, but was releived to see that they were just expanding into the next building. This is currently, and has been for several years straight, my favorite place to eat in Philadelphia.
