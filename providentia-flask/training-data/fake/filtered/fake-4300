Went back last night with a party of 16.  Service was excellent as usual, but that's not why I'm writing.  I want to suggest a dish I had last night.  It was a special I haven't seen on their menu.  It's a scallops and shrimp over linguini in a sauce that's hard to describe.  It's a light sauce with a blend of flavors I've never tasted before.  The sauce is just enough to add flavor, but didn't overwhelm.   Compliments to the chef.
