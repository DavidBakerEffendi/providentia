I had a very nice beer (or two) followed by a mixed green salad with tuna.  Very nice salad, but would have preferred to have the tuna warmed from the grill.  Other than that, the server was very attentive, knew the menu and for and made terrific suggestions to everyone at my table.   Wouldn't go out of my way to get back here, but if in the area...I'd suggest you give it a try!
