My girlfriend had a cheesesteak in a flea market and loved it ..I looked online for the best cheesesteak and it dats Pats's ..we drove to pats from brroklyn ...we were very DISSAPOINTED ....It had no taste and hardly enough meat ..we were starving and still didnt really impress us at all ....Not recommended if you are coming from out of town ..better buy aa steak and make it yourself
