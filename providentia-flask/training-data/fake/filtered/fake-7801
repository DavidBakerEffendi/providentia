The pizza is excellent. Truly a good representation of the greatness in pizza that New Haven has established in it's reputation of great cuisines. They deliver in a timely manner. They are in the middle of the price range, spending around 15$ for a large pizza with toppings and the only reason I don't give then 5 stars is because the pizza has been undercooked 2 out of 20 times we have ordered from them and they got our order wrong once. But this is not enough to stop us from ordering from them, great pizza!
