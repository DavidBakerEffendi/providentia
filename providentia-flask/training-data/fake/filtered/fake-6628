I have been dining at Thai Essence for the past  three years have enjoyed every meal that I have had. Appetizers that are my favorite are the chicken satay, which are whole chicken tender size and not small pieces put together on a skewer like I have had in other Thai places. The raw tuna and spicy mustard is to die for.The fish is always fresh and dishes or cooked to order. The Pad Kee Mow is the best I have had in NJ and Florida. The staff is friendly and accomdating and makes your dining experience memorable. Great place to eat  at reasonable prices.- Steve
