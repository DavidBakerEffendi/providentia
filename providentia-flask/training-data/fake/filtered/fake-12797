I came here for the first time today with a co-worker. She lives nearby and said the food is good- so we came for lunch. I am a vegetarian- meat makes me sick. So I was super glad to find a place that serves delicious Indian food AND is PURE vegetarian (no beef broth, etc.). I had the Spinach Dosa, and my co-worker had the Masala Dosa. Both were delicious (I tried a bit of her's). We also finished off the meal with Masala Chai. So nice! I hope to come back VERY soon!
