I came here a few days ago for my birthday, and it was pretty spectacular. I had a salade niçoise with champagne and finished it off with the Caramelized Banana Ricotta Tart with banana ice cream for dessert. Just an unbelievable dessert, and it only costed $9. Perfectly-sized meal - although, the Indian busboy took my unfinished niçoise away from me long before I had the chance to finish it (that was really the only thing that annoyed me, and before I could say anything, he had already slipped it out from under me, and was nowhere to be seen.) The service at this restaurant is fabulous. Aside from that unfortunate busboy, the entire team was top notch; from the door girls, who safely stored my shopping bags downstairs, to the greeter, who brought us to our table, and even pulled the table away from the bench, so I could easily take my seat. I'd have to disagree with some of the other reviewers, who say that it's a touristy place to eat. If you come on the weekends, sure. But during the week, this is just your average high-end French restaurant, complete with plasticized women, and overactive Instagram-ers. I gave this restaurant a 4/5 stars because of the bitter experience with the busboy. The other 4 stars are well-deserved for the quality of food, promptness and attentiveness of service, vibe of the other patrons (we met a great couple there that night, and other neighbouring tables were inter-mingling too), and the cleanliness of the restaurant and all facilities. They really should teach busboys the same "rules of engagement" as the servers, though. It may spare them a few more disgruntled customers.
