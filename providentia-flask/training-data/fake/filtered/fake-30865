This place is where it's at. As anybody who lives in the area knows there is nowhere really good to hang. But this place, not only is the atmosphere great, the staff are friendly and laid back (yet attentive), and the beer is amazing there! My favorite is this vanilla java porter that is off the charts delicious. Farells ain't exactly my scene, so it's just nice to be able to grab a beer in my neighborhood. I think this place will do very well. I heard about it for the first time on friday, and I've been back twice! Cheers!
