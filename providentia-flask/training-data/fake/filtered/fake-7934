Absolutely terrible! Ordered take out and got home, cut the burger in half and they thought because they blackened the patty that the entire burger was cooked. This patty was uncooked! Not rare but actually uncooked. How dare they claim to be a burger place and sell out food this way. I will never return and advise anyone else from ever going. People will get sick from their food.
