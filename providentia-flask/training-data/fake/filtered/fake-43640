Not worth the price and everyone raves about the truffle fries which I have had at the Capital Grille.  The Capital Grilles are much bettter... The Burger is very average.  Bettter than a Casual dining burger but, nothing special.  The fresh ricotta I had was a little too runny.  I expected a little more attention to detail and a lot more finese...
