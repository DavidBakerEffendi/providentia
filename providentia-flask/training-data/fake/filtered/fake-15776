Horrible service!  First, the estimated wait time was 1 hour - not ideal, but totally understandable.  The wait was actually an hour and a half, so that was annoying since she told us the max wait time was an hour.  Then we're seated.  Then we proceed to see all of the tables around us turn over, order, and get their food.  Meanwhile, we have not seen our server. So we asked the waitress serving the table next to us (who sat down after us, but were already eating) if she was our waitress: she said no and walked away.  So then we flagged down another waitress after a bit and she was kind enough to take our order, even though she wasn't our server, and right after we left, someone came over to say "Sorry for the wait; your server will be here very soon."  Um, thanks, buddy, but too little too late.  FINALLY the guy shows up, at least a half hour after we're seated and we let him know that we put our order in, but were still waiting for drinks.  It takes him about 10 mins to bring water, then another 10 mins to bring my husband's drink (Basil Hayden, not a difficult one) and my 4 year old's milk.  Honestly, 20 mins to get drinks??  Shortly thereafter our food arrived, and was fine.  Nothing to write home about, but people come for the cheesecake anyway (which you can get to go, no need to eat in this godforsaken place).  I shudder to think how long we would've waited for food if we hadn't flagged down that second waitress who put our order in.  I realize it's a busy time, but this waiter seemed to be the only one having a problem being competent.  Never saw a manager or anything - no one seemed to be concerned with the service experience.  Live and learn.
