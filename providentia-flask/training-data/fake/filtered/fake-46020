I was very disappointed with are visit. We had some BBQ snob friends in from out of town and we told them about the restaurant. We have been in the past and had some great pulled pork and ribs. This time not so much!!!  It started when we ordered the smoked ribs and was told we no longer have them. The pulled pork sandwich was not like it was in the past flat no smoke flavor and they forgot the coleslaw.  When we asked to talk to the chef we were told we don't do that!!!! He was more than happy last time and talked bbq with us for over 20 minutes us. The table was dirty and had to ask are server to wipe it down. With a roll of her eyes she did it with a dirty towel.  I now see why the place was empty. We were embarrassed about bringing are friends in and will not be back.
