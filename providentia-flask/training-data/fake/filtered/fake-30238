Goldburger's makes fresh, unique and delicious burgers and EVERYONE should go here! Every burger I have gotten there as been AMAZING - you cannot go wrong! My personal favorite is the Mac Patti burger, which is a burger with a mac and cheese patti on top, and some sauce that gives it a little bit of a kick.  I also love the pizza burger, with sauce, mozzarella cheese and garlic.  Whenever family or friends come to visit I take them here. Also, think about ordering the sweet potato fries and GOO BALLS --mmmmmm-- for dessert. AWESOME PLACE! YOU MUST GO!
