By far my FAVORITE spot for a sicilian slice or pie. I have NEVER had better pizza and there NO place like L & B !! If you have gone, GO! There Spumoni & Ice are AMAZING as well! Outside tables and plently of YUMMY food to go arround. If your in the Brooklyn area L & B is MUST! Just get ready to eat about 4 slices because its THAT GOOD!!!! Thank you L & B for making the BEST pizza not only in Brooklyn, but ANYWHERE!!
