we have been to this restaurant before and i have to say that the service was attentive  and prompt.  the portions are generous, indeed.  however, last saturday i went there with a group of very special people (4 in total) and before i had finished my desert a woman that was roving around the room came to our table and rushed us out because they needed the table for other customers.  i found this to be rude beyond belief.  never again will i return to this place to be rushed out by the management.  if this policy of rushing people out is policy in this place, i rather go elsewhere.  there is no shortage of italian restaurants in new jersey!
