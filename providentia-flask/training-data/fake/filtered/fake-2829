I been there twice and both times it was good but after today I will never go back again. We showed up around 5pm and it was busy but nowhere near crazy. The lady took our name and said it would be about 1 hour and the owner or manager which was a man came right up to us and basically told us it's about an hour and to leave.I was so shocked. He was extremely rude and I will never recommend this place to anyone. I'm going to you place to spend my money and you treat me like crap ya right. There are Â a lot of other palaces in the area that will love and respect your business . Shame on you Cuban Pete's for the way you treat your customers.
