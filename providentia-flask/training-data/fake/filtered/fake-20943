every person who I've brought to this place LOVES the sandwiches here. Not only is it cheap and DELISH, but is also BIG.  These beat the 5 dollar Subway subs anyday (by size, taste and price). I would recommend the pork sandwich, although I've heard that the chicken is also excellent.  Make sure to get it spicy! the jalepenos add a hint of spice, but it's not overpowering.  One warning: although it may be tempting to bring the sandwich home for another meal, the sandwich tastes best fresh! I often stand in the store and scarf down the whole sandwich within 5 minutes.  If you bring the sandwich home, the sandwich will still taste fine, but the bread will be soggy from the pickled daikon and carrots, which is not NEARLY as satisfying as the warm and crisp texture of a freshly toasted baguette.
