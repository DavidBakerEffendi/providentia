Terrible, terrible terrible...Chicken Parm sub was soggy and looked like it was out together by a third grader, buffalo wings are drenched in disgusting sauce, saut√©ed broccoli was literally half a stalk in water and the pepperoni pizza almost fell through the box because of all the oil dripping through. NEVER EVER ORDER FROM HERE. All of what I explained cost more than $50 and was worth less than $5.
