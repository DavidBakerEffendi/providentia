Was very surprised to find this tapas gem.  Food was great, atmosphere was bustling, and service was attentive.  We went on a Friday night around 7 and managed to only wait about 15 minutes for a table.  The place is tiny so you expect to be waiting forever.  All the dishes were excellent.  We had the patatas bravas, fried garbanzo beans, chorizo, artichoke wrapped in ham, and spanish tortilla.  It wasn't a huge amount of food, but enough to feed three of us.  Minus one star because it was so tightly packed.  I heard way too much of the conversation going on at the neighboring table - was tempted to chime in from time to time.
