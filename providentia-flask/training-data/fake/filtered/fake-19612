For those of you that don't know what bibimbap is: It's a Korean dish composed of seasoned vegetables and Korean marinated meat (or tofu) over a bed of rice. Then you mix it all up with gochujang (Korean chili pepper paste) and enjoy! Now my reivew: Sometimes I'm just jonesing for some Korean food and this place always hits the spot. The owner is very nice and always accommodating. They have decent sized portions and the vegetables are always fresh and well seasoned. Definitely one of my go tos when I want bibimbap. It's also extremely quick and healthy so I never feel guilty after eating here. Everyone should give this place a try!
