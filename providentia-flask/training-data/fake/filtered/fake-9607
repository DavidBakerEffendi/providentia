Could not wait to get home to write this review. I would give 6 stars if I could. Today Otaiko hosted a party for my grandfathers 90th birthday and 25 guests. The view is amazing, food delicious and the staff fantastic. What a great experience for the return customers and first timer hibachi goers in our group. Thanks again to the staff and management.
