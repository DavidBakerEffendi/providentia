Amazing food! The service was friendly and very swift. I noticed this restaurant from a friend liking this page on facebook. I'm sure glad I did! Had the Margarita Pizza and the Fedelini pasta! The waitress knew what she was talking about when she paired my wine with my meal Fantastic will be coming back for sure!
