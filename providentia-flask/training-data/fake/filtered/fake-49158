I was in town for work and someone recommended it to my coworker. This place was phenomenal! Living in the desert, I have to have seafood when I'm near the coast. I had crab cakes and diver's scallions. Both were awesome. I eat until it hurt. My coworker had the pasta with Vodka sauce (I forget the name). AMAZING! It would be worth the 6 hour flight for any of their dishes. To top it off the service was great. The waitress was a sweetheart. If I'm ever in Hartford again, I know were I'm eating.
