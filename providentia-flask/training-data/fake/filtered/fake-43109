I have never added a review, but must this time, because at first glance I see many bad ones prior, and my boyfriend and I LOVE Mehek. I would recommend sitting down, however; somehow the food is much better than the takeout. The mutter paneer is fantastic, as well as the samosas. The service is fantastic and the food always arrives quickly.
