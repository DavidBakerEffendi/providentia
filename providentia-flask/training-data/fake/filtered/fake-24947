Despite modest-high expectations, this "wine bar" failed to deliver.  Mediocre food, polite but inexperienced service, and deplorable management make this once hopeful Upper Montclair 'destination' a repeat disappointment.  I am specifically referring to a weak wine list, which I had to return to 3 times because twice they were out of the first two wines I selected.  Not looking to come back to throw my money away on this empty establishment unless the wine list is taken seriously.  Disappointed.
