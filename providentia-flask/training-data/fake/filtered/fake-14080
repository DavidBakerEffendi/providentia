Me and my boyfriend decided to stop here for dinner when we were in the area. We started with the traditional tom yum soup, it was so salty and so not fresh that at almost $6 dollars a tiny soup, we didn't even stay to have dinner. So this may not be an accurate review of all the food but we didn't dare venture further.
