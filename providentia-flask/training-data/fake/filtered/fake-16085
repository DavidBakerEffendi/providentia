Im sitting in a booth writing this review now. I went to this place to grab a drink before heading home on the train. Midway through my glass of wine I had to take a call. I left my drink and my journal and went to step outside, as I got up two people walked in one of which went to sit in my seat. I told him I was sitting there, he asked me if I wanted to sit somewhere else, I said I was happy there. Apparently my seat was next to an outlet and his iPhone was dead. I went outside, took my call and came back expecting the Bartender to have done his job but not only was the same dude sitting in my seat in front of my journal and my wine, five of his friends had joined him. I asked for my seat back, he (maybe she) said "wait, didn't I tell you this was my seat?" I said, "no, you didn't, I was sitting there." His friend came up and said "yo, we be leaving in a minute yo." It was my first time here, I'm doubtful there will be a second. I'd already paid and tipped, tipped well, but I'm still writing this review from the same booth i was in when i started and the dude who needs to charge his phone is still in my seat at the bar. Sorry to the waiter who's section I'm taking up space in! If you need to charge your phone then this is the place to go, if you expect basic decency then it's not.
