Beware of the thirsty cooks! We love this place a lot. The food is delicious, service is always very friendly and you just cant beat the prices. You can even bring a bottle of tequila and they will make you a pitcher of margaritas($12 charge) But they must have some thirsty cooks. Every time we bring along a bottle of our favorite tequila to enjoy a pitcher of margaritas with our dinner, the bottle comes back from the kitchen definitely missing a whole lot more tequila than is in our pitcher. Not wanting to complain or make a scene we kind of just let it go every time. But it really is terrible that they do it so obvious and blatantly. But this wont stop us from going there as the quality of food and prices is always well worth it. I guess we're doing our part in keeping the cooks or whoever is making the margaritas, happy. I just hope they're using a glass and not swigging it straight from the bottle! LOL
