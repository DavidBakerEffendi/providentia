What a gem!! I can't say that we are a fan of the food, except for the won tons and the tea. But that is only because we have never tried Thai food before. I had the Pad thai and it was waaay to sweet for me. But I would still return for appetizers and the ambiance. The service was the BEST we experienced in NYC during our visit!!!
