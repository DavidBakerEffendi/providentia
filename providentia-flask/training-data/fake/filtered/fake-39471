We were looking for a new experience and decided to forego the big chains and try different than our usual go to places. I found this place off a listing for great burgers, jumped onto yelp saw the great reviews and decided this was a place to try. So we had dinner there last night for the first time. It was moderately packed when we arrived for dinner @ about 8:30 or so on a Tuesday. We saw an empty table in the bar area and seated ourselves a few min later we were given the menu. The waitress was great very knowlegeable about the menu, she was very friendly and refilled our waters frequently. I had a margarita which tasted good, I'm not much of a drinker and it wasn't too strong for me, although I couldn't finish, which is not unusual for me. Food came out quickly and was awesome. We ordered chips and pico which was very fresh and delicious, steak , fish, chicken, soy chorizo, and shrimp tacos (we were hungry and wanted to try a variety). I also tried the burger w/waffle fries which I liked very much as well!! The fries were very good and crispy, they even stayed crispy after sitting a while we finished our food. We came out extremely stuffed and beyond satisfied! Very relaxed atmosphere, with great food and service!!
