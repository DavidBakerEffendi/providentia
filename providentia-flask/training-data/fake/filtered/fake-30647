I was expecting a stellar experience since I first heard about Pizza Brain, and expectations were surpassed. I've known Brian since before Tim Berners-Lee created the first web page. We were classmates, so the spirit and style of Pizza Brain was not new to me. Nostalgia is a huge part of Pizza Brain. We often view the past as being better than current times. 'They don't make 'em like they used to.' 'The good ol' days.' . . . Pizza Brain takes everything good that we remember about pizza and keeps it alive. The Noid, "Pizza! Pizza!" The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Pizza Day at school. Pizza Brain has such a large collection of pizza culture that there's bound to be something that touches a personal memory for everyone who goes there. In addition to being a phenomenal celebration of the world's favorite eat-it-with-your-hands food, Pizza Brain serves up slices as well. I had never met dough-slinger Joe Hunter before, so I can honestly give an unbiased review of the pizza despite knowing Brian for multiple decades. I visited with my father and we decided to order a whole pie. We got pepperoni, mushrooms, and carmelized onions on our pie. It's a thin pie whose large slices demand to be folded. The cheese was melty and gooey. The sauce tasted like actual tomatoes instead of thick Spaghetti-Os soup. The pepperoni, mushrooms, and onions just melted in my mouth, and the crust was crispy, chewy, and springy. We didn't have any of the slices that were on-hand, so I can't comment on how they are in single re-heated form. The pie we had was $22.00 so if you can swing it, I highly recommend getting a whole pie so you can experience it at its freshest. It's absolutely worth it. It was even worth the 5 hour drive from Central New York. Don't go alone, bring friends! Pizza is family.
