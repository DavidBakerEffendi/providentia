Just ate at this once beloved restaurant..sorry to say in its new incarnation its just awful.. We ordered two glasses of wine..one pour smaller than the other, though a complaint did correct the situation. I ordered the Seafood Ramen..edible though the shrimp were cooked days before and tasted like rubber and the clams were tasteless. My daughter had the Papaya Salad..seasoning was good though the peanuts were stale on the way to being rancid. Her Spicy Tuna roll was fine, nothing special. We will not return.
