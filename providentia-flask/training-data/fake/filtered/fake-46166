Went on the weekend for lunch, very loud and over 30 min. wait time.  The food was tasty but the noodle soups were overpriced for what you get.  The appetizers were better than the noodle soup.   I never read in any of the reviews that you might have to share a table with other customers, not great if you are sitting at a long rectangular table, with strangers so close across from you...awkward while waiting for your food and not suitable for personal conversation. We did learn from another customer that you can request additional noodles for free if you still have extra soup left from your bowl of noodle soup.   Service was attentive, however, our waiter seemed to have acquired an attitude after he saw my husband try a little of the extra noodles (free) that I had ordered to finish my soup; since my husband had ordered a different kind of noodle soup, I thought he might like to try a bite of my noodles initially before I finished them up...what's the big deal?!  The waiter definitely pist me off.
