two weeks ago, i stopped by this restaurant to have a quick meal with my friends and since we wanted some deep fried food, we decided to go in. Not knowing that the rating for this restaurant was very high, i was very stoked on the tonkatsu that they had. Coming from a japanese family, i know very well about tonkatsu and i had to say that for the very first time, the pork tonkatsu they had was better than what my mom cooks at home.
