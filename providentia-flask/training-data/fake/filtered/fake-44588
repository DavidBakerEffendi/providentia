Mixed feelings about this place, but I'd go back.,   When we arrived, we were told it would be a two hour wait, but then told that it could be a lot shorter.  We hung at the bar for 20 minutes and were seated. The interior is dark and loud with a mix of rap and '80s dance music playing.  The staff is always yelling, so it's not a particularly peaceful place, if you want a quiet meal.  It's a good place for a large group that wants drinks and to have a fun Saturday. The menu is interesting, with a diverse group of appetizers.  The appetizers which were tasty and pretty to look at, but insanely small for what they cost.  A bit of a rip off in the price/size department. The ramen was excellent and extremely filling.  If I went back, I'd skip the apps and just order ramen and some sake. The service was excellent.  Our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly, and efficient.
