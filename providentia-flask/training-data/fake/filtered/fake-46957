I thought this was pretty overrated. First of all, we had a 9:15 reservation (on a Wednesday, no less), and didn't get seated until just after 10pm. And while the hostess was apologetic, I thought it would have been a much nicer touch if she'd actually offered us a glass of wine on the house for our inconvenience, which I think is something most restaurants tend to do. It would have been especially appreciated it in this case, considering we racked up quite a nice bill in the Rose Bar while we waited, where cocktails are $20 a pop. Don't get the fig and ricotta crostini. They had sort of a medicinal aftertaste which we couldn't totally identify. The rest of the food was good enough, but my bucatini al amatriciana was only okay compared to the insane, go-blind-from-deliciousness version at Lupa (where you also get more of it). Our water glasses remained empty for much of the evening, which is a personal peeve of mine. As typically devoted Danny Meyer fans, we were disappointed.
