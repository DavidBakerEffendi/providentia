Great ambiance, great food! Came with some friends on a Saturday for brunch, we all ordered different eggs Benedict, they have about 4 or 5 choices. We all tried each others, and even thought the salmon and lobster ones were really good, the crab eggs Benedict was the best! Also they serve freshly squeezed orange juice. Yumz! Def going back to try their other dishes and desserts!
