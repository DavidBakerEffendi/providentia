Northern Spy is a great place for a casual, intimate dinner. You can cobble together a great dinner from the sides alone. (I actually think the sides outshine the main courses.) The kale salad is a must-order. The chocolate cake I shared with my friend was the only thing that was sub-par: dry and crumbly. Wonderful atmosphere, great service. A hidden gem.
