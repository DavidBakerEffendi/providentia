Food was great.  Nothing wrong there.  But the service is ridiculous.   First of all, it took the waiter what felt like 10 minutes to recite the specials, talking super fast in a thick accent. While he's reciting the specials he becomes distracted and puts his hand to his ear and we see that he has some type of bluetooth device on.  Apparently they need to hear whats going on in the kitchen. Now he's rushing even faster through everything (I can only imagine how long this would have taken if he spoke at a normal speed).  This happens twice and now I'm annoyed and my parents are shaking their heads, laughing. He says he'll give us time to think about what we would like to order and takes forever to come back to us. The waiter returns and acts very impatiently as we order. We didn't wait long for our appetizers or the entree but there is no good reason for the specials to be that long and to be spewed out at that speed or for the waiters to have those stupid things in their ears. I would go back for the food but I would be really nervous about the service.
