The worst service I have ever had.... if this first sentence doesn't make you move to the next restaurant then continue reading.  Once we received our food one of my friends was unable to cut his veal Milanese with his knife. After waiting twenty minutes we were finally able to flag down a bus boy and explained the problem it took another ten minutes to get the waiter and another thirty to get a replacement.  The replacement was fine, but not great.  However at that point we were all done with our meals and while waiting we were never offered another drink not even a refill on the water.  We then sat for fifteen minutes just waiting for someone to offer us something (maybe dessert or a check whichever!) Nothing. After 2 hours we finally got a check and got outta jail!
