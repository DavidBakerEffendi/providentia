Vegan Tree is a delightful restaurant on South Street that I always enjoy. The food is delicious and cheap, especially for a vegan restaurant. The servings are pretty good. An appetizer with a entrée should fill you up unless you are a big eater or are famished. I particularly like getting a Vegan Cheesesteak while in Philadelphia...take that Philadelphia fatty food culture.   And, I have to say, my favorite thing about this place is the atmosphere. It always feels very airy (almost ethereal), positive, simple, and bright. Very unassuming, unlike many vegan restaurants. There is no pretense here, just good food. The service has always been very polite and quick. The staff is very sweet. 5/5.
