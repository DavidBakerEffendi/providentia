Such a great place! We had the best NYE celebration, food is amazing, very fresh and seasonal simple flavors. Could have had anything on the menu! Staff were great, just before countdown they brought complimentary party hats, blowers and headbands to each table so the atmosphere was really fun. Great spot in west village to have amazing food and watch world go by. Highly recommended.
