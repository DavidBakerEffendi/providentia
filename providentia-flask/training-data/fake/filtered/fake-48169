Very nice, not so much a gastropub but a great bar with great food. The place gets ten out of ten for the lighting, design and atmosphere. Best Blood and Sand! Cocktails are really good too. Cute bartenders with even cuter accents. Service not so quick and is really hard to find but overall really well done space and nice fit for 10th street. Great for drink parties.
