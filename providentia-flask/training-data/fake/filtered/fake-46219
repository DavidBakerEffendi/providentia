Why is this place so over hyped?????? I recently moved to East Coast from Cali and heard so much about this place. I was expected to be blown away. what is this about "the best ramen"?! I also cringe with I this. I almost feel sorry for what you guys are missing out on. Maybe I've been spoiled Â with good ramen or something in the past... but this place disappointed BIG TIME. I tried a few other ramen places in the City and was just as good, if not better. I think totto or even hide-chan is better than this place. The fact that I have to wait for 2 hours for mediocre ramen is pretty shitty. 3 stars because the decor and service was good.
