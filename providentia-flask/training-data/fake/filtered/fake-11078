Ever since La Follia opened I was grateful to finally have a great local Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. I've been there multiple times and consider it one of my go-to places when I have friends in from out of town, or even with my family on a Â Saturday evening. The ambiance is cozy and delightful, the staff, is attentive, friendly and highly knowledgeable, the wine list is superb and the food is fantastic. The braised short ribs with polenta special is one of my favorites-other great plicks are the eggplant parm, beet salad and any pasta dish on the menu. I would highly recommend this restaurant and will continue to be a consistent customer.
