Food good to great. Service and customer service BAD. Â A red wine was spilled on us--the glass shattered all over us and wine stained our cloths. A little stain remover pen was brought to our table with a napkin--no one ever said sorry or offered to help--no one asked us if we were ok. my friend plucked glass out of her sweater all night. at some point a waiter rushed by and said we'll pay for the dry cleaning but never came back. our food took forever and we were ignored most of the evening as if the event was our fault. shame on you GTC.
