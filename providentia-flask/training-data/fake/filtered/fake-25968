I went to wazu tonight. I ordered an Italian sub I was the only one there. As the man was slicing the meat for my sandwich someone else came in. The employee pressured her for her order. He had prepared my sandwich and it was sitting there wrapped and ready to go. I only needed to pay. One employee came to the register and was going to ring up my purchase. He was told by a reddish blond man to take out the garbage. So he did. I had to wait while another customer came in and ordered a chef salad, was being made. I got impatient and asked the reddish blond person with his underwear showing can I just pay for my purchase? I was standing there waiting for 2 or 3 minutes by now. He told me he would have to take off his gloves to ring me up. So I said I see its about ur convenience not mine as the customer. He told me Â he would have to take off his gloves to ring me up. Ok so u r more interested in the number of gloves use? He said to me it's a good thing this was his industry. I said yes good thing but he rang me up. Big mistake,. We order for delivery from work , I will def be telling my coworkers on Monday. I was not unreasonable and he should have said sorry no problem. I will not be going back. I almost left when I saw his blue underwear showing. And btw sandwich sucked!!!
