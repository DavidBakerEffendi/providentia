Ms. Pervert and I went by yesterday and were totally blown away. Some quick thoughts: - everything was FRESH and TASTY. - everyone was super-nice and happy to answer questions. - as close to West Coast food as I've come in NYC. - very filling without going overboard. - simple and fast. - thankfully, there's nothing pretentious about this place - are you listening rest of the East Village?
