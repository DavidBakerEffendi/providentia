Love this place. Went for the 16-buck mini lunch special and there was nothing mini about it. The place is quaint and clean and was, at the time of my visit, full of Japanese customers (always a good tip off). Around that price buys you a standard size bowl of hot or cold udon or soba along with a rice dish if your choice. I got the unagi rice with hot soba. Little toppings and dishes were included such as slices of yam, lotus root, pickled relish, carrots and cucumbers. The soba was good. Maybe slightly overlooked but only because I love a tougher noodle. The eel was delicious though I would have preferred a little more sauce over the rice though I'm sure they would have granted me exactly that if I would have asked. No complaints about the service. The waitresses were sweet and abiding. We were also seated quite quickly though considering lunch time rush hour was over, I wouldn't have expected anything too different. Did I mention this was on a Sunday? Lunch specials still exist on Sundays. Will definitely be returning. Over and over. Reasonable and more than worth it.
