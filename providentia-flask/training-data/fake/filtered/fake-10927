Boun Appetito is out of this world!! From the seafood to the steaks to the veal and the chicken, everything is delicious. Tony, the owner, is always around making the experience in the restaurant special. I live in Hoboken but come specifically to Bayonne to eat here. Even better, for the high quality of food served, the prices can't be beat. And there's a full bar; so this is a perfect setting for birthdays and parties too!!
