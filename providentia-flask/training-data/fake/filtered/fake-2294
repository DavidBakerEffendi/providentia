The blueberry pancakes are as delicious as everyone says. It is definitely the syrup that gives it a special touch. The pancakes come out warm and succulent with just the right amount of fluffiness. The wait is as insane as the others say because it really is quite a small place, but if you go during an off time there is no wait. I don't think they are worth a 1+ hour wait. We went around 3pm and there were still quite a number of people there, but me and my sister were seated immediately. She ordered a chicken sandwich and it was yummy but not as much as the pancakes. I cannot wait to go back and try the banana pancakes. The table next to it had it and it looked delicious. Remember, they only take cash!
