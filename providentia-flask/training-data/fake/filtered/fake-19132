I attended a wedding here and I must say the venue is very nice. However, I dont beleive they have the bride in its best interest and the matre de (who is a male and bald if your ever see him) is a complete douchebag. I would never have a wedding here purely because of this guy. The rest of the staff are very attentive, but this guy for me completely ruined my experience. He said hes been doing this for 25 years, so how many weddings have you ruined? He obviously does not know how to talk to people and if the slightest thing goes wrong has no idea how to solve the issue. The Manor could do alot better, but this guy is horrible.
