I'm sorry. I do not understand why people are so extremely enthousiastic about this place. First of all, you have to wait in line for ages to get in. Second, the man by the door who tells you you can come in is highly unfriendly. Like I mentioned before, people wait in line for god knows how long to taste this Grimaldi's pizza and then if you don't move fast enough he starts yelling at you and acts like it's a complete matter of course that you've just waited for an hour. Then finally when we got our pizza, we were both positive that this was the absolute worst pizza we had ever tasted in our entire life. And believe me, we eat a lot of authentic italian pizza. There was nothing italian about this pizza. I think the pizza you can get at your local supermarket tastes better. If you like your pizza tasting like licorice, this is the place to be.
