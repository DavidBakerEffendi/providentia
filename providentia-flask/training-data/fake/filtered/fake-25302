Whoa, the only thing this restaurant is keeping secret is how they are still in business. The bartender, who look's a lot like J. Jonah Jameson from the Spider-Man movies, starting giving my friend and I shit for just asking about drink specials as soon as we walked in. The whole time we were there he was talking shit to us, and the locals (who seem to like it), about everything from where we were from to what we were doing in NYC. On our way out, he yelled at us for not tipping enough. Whew, I'd say that man hasn't been laid in at least two decades - either that or he is just pissed off he has been stuck in Staten Island his whole life.
