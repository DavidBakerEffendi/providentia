My husband and I love this place. There's not a lot of good restaurants around the area and the food is delicious and fancy enough to make up for the cheesy decor and bad music. Faves - mussels in garlic/white wine sauce, special veal chop, steak au poivre, special risotto, banana pancakes, the crispy bacon the brunch dishes come with, good coffee, steak frites lunch, Kronenbourg on tap, and the free chocolate truffle that comes with the check. We have had bad waiters, but we have also had great waiters. As mentioned above, the decor isn't the best, and the bad music can be loud. But the FOOD is mostly excellent and the price is right. Windsor Terrace is all the better for having such an establishment. P.S. The "L'Petit" instead of "Le Petit" used to bother me too. But the food is too good, I got over it.
