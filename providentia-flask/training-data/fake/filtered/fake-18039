My friends and I love this place.  A few of us are from the south and we love the sincerity of this joint!  I love how they label the brisket 'LEAN' or "MOIST".  A great place for delish, spicy, simple, rib sticking food at a fair price.  I would give 5 stars if only the parking were better and the noise level inside were a bit more reasonable...but when it's packed what ya gonna do?
