Went to brunch here today and I must say it was not bad at all. Very clean and quaint location. We had the wing dinner with Mac and cheese, greens and corn pudding, fried whiting and ox tails. The ox tails and cornbread were awesome! The fish not bad but it could have used more seasoning and it had bones which is a major turn off for me. The greens were good, but I did not care for the Mac nor the corn pudding. This DOES NOT mean they were not good, but I am REAL particular about these two since my mom and gram were caterers and I cook myself. My party was over all pleased with our visit, but what REALLY sealed the deal - the desserts (hummingbird cake, bean pie, peach cobbler and pineapple coconut cake) and the waitress Ms Andrea's beautiful motherly smile! Awesome awesome AWESOME!!!!
