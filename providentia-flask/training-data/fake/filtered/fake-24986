this place is a TOTAL CHAOS..the workers are pretty intense man.. they act like they don't appreciate your business..indeed the truth is.. the dumplings are so good and so CHEAP that this place becomes a hot spot, you see lines forming at everytime of the day. you know what i think? i think they are in need of a systematic order management system..they do not use computers nor pencil and papers, they use their brain to remember your orders which do not work that well..actually.,. as i said ..its a total chaos... you usually wind up getting ur orders 20 min later than the person behind you.. but again.. people don't care cuz the food is so cheap and so good
