I lived in Cambodia for several years and learned how to make many Khmer dishes during my time there. This place, owned by a Cambodian family originally from battambang province, makes Khmer food as authentic and as good as anything I had while living in Cambodia. I was impressed with all the dishes I tried and really had no major complaints. I wish the location was a bit more central to downtown and that they took credit card however at the end of the day this place still Deserves five stars.
