Absolutely amazing food and service. My hubbie and myself just left the restaurant. I got curry goat and oxtail. From the front door we could smell the food and they did not disappoint. Walking into Morgan's is like walking into the owner's home. He was warm and welcoming...great way to end a long day after work. Will be back in a few days hope to see you there :)
