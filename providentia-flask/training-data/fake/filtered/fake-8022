we had lunch on 11/11/11 the service was good but there was enough salt on the fries to give you high blood pressure and the grizzle in the burger was enough to break a tooth.   we sent the burger back and opted for an omelet.   We were looking forward to our lunch after reading the wonderful reviews but very disappointed would never go back.
