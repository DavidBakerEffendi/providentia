Had my first El Vez experience this Friday and I will definitely be back! Got to the restaurant a few minutes before our reservation so we waited a few minutes for our table to be ready. I definitely recommend making a reservation if you're coming on a weekend night. Our waitress was wonderful! She got our drinks immediately after we arrived and was around to put in our order as soon as we were ready. I love Mexican and the food at El Vez was out of this world. We ordered the grilled beef tacos, mahi mahi tacos, and shrimp tacos. We also got sides of the creamy poblano corn rice, recommended by our waitress, and the rice & beans. The tacos were some of the best I've ever had. Don't even get me started on the corn rice. It was one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten and I was so glad I took her recommendation. Yes the restaurant is noisy but honestly, do you really expect to sit in a quiet restaurant on a weekend night? I did have to speak above my normal volume but I still didn't feel like I was shouting. I will definitely be back to El Vez, and soon!
