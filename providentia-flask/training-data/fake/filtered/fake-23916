The Bagels are good but the staff and the service is terrible.  The staff is rude, lazy, and are too busy having personal conversations to help you.  The people preparing your food dress like they are going to a rock concert and not serving food. No, gloves, no hairnets, and no aprons. The last straw was a week ago when a girl working there tried to shove an omelet in her mouth while talking to the other girl working next to her.  This was all going on in front of me by the register.  No one else offered to help me, she was not on brake, and I had to stand around and wait for her to cram the food into her mouth.  Then after shoving food in her mouth (without utensils) she grabbed my bagel without washing her hands.  Just what I wanted on my bagel, high school dropout spit!!! NEVER AGAIN!!! I found a new stop on my way to work that actually care about their customers and are aware that most people are commuting to work.
