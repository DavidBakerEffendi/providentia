Holy Greek food Batman! This is the best food truck in the city, hands down. If you haven't tried it, you don't even know. Uncle Gussy hooks it up, and hot damn is it good. The service is fast, the greek friends are too good, and the tzaziki sauce is some of the best ever. Get the lamb, get the salad, get it all before I come in and take it. Try this place, or else.
