The atmosphere was nice,the waiter had no personality but was very polite. The food looked great it made my mouth water before I could even taste it.My girlfriend had chicken parm and I had eggplant parm. we dodged in our food before it even touched the table and was disappointed before it even hit the back of out throats. The food had no flavor at all and tasted worst then the diet food from out the supermarket. Salt and pepper could not help this food. The food was fresh,smelled good,looked good but I would not recommend this restaurant to someone unless they have high blood pressure and want to enjoy a nice dinner without the sodium and flavor.
