Quite possibly the best place to eat on the Rutgers-Newark campus. Customers will be getting the best quality food at such an affordable price! I like everything on the menu and wish to eat here as much as I can! Staff is very friendly and place looks amazing! I no longer have to go to subway for every meal! If this place ever stayed open 24/7, tighten your belt buckles because all the other eateries will be blown away! This remodeled place is also great because there is so much more room for activities! I have to go now, this is making my head spin! Oh God, oh goddddd
