The service is strictly amateur hour. Sat there for 10 minutes before anyone noticed me. Ordered a soda and two apps. Got the soda. 25 minutes later someone came up to me in the bookstore saying one of my apps was ready. I said "That  took long enough." She said "What did you say,"  trying to browbeat me. I repeated myself only slowly this time. She asked me if I wanted to cancel the order which I did. Geez. Give me a break. Food is good tho.
