I checked out Pitaziki because I had heard good things, and I was not let down. The atmosphere is very bright and fresh, and the employees are super friendly. The owner, Khaled, and his son are especially kind, and they gave me great service. I ordered the beef shawerma in a pita. I added all sorts of other things and they all mixed together and made a delicious dinner. The baba ganoush was especially tasty. And the pita was so warm and fluffy...I am dreaming of it still. Check out the outdoor seating in the courtyard area, it had a great ambiance.
