A Texan in Philly and I needed some inspiration.  My grandmother's funeral was coming up.  I was selected to deliver the Eulogy.  I told my dad that I had to go and he had to come with me to get some divine intervention.  A couple of Belgians' best was all it needed.  All my family told me that the eulogy was very thoughtful. Thanks for the help.
