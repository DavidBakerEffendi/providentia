Prosperity is the place to go when I am craving for CHEAP dumplings. 20 cent dumplings?  MY ASIAN SENSES ARE TINGLING!!! Not only was it ridiculously cheap -- it was actually pretty good!  I'm not going to say it's the best I've had, but surely the cheapest. I like the boiled chives and pork.  Its pretty large, and it has enough depth of flavor to make me a huge fan.  The sauce is a must have to cut into that rich pork.
