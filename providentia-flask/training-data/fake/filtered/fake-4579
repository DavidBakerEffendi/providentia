Don't think this place will last long.  The banh mis are nothing special.  The pate is not homemade and the old man who owns the shop is horrible.  When I asked for some water, he said he was too busy to pour some!  When I asked why there was pork on my chicken sandwich, he said, "Read the menu.  All the sandwiches have pork."  The type size saying that is about 9 pt.  I also had to beg for a napkin. With such nice people next store running the new Cuban place, get a great pork sandwich place there and skip Zon.  You'll be glad you did.
