My husband went to Noir 2 weeks ago and really enjoyed it. So he wanted to take me. We went and had dinner last night and it was wonderful. I had the french onion soup and he had the putein. For dinner, he had the Montreal steak and I had the Pappadelle Bolognese and all the food was so delicious. The service was great and the atmosphere was casual and fun. I also had the hot chocolate with cherry infused vodka which was just unbelievable. The owner came over to talk to us several times which does not happen at most restaurants. I highly recommend this restaurant and we will be going back many more times.
