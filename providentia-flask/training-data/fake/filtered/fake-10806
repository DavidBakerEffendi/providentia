we went here for my brother's birthday at his request.  I had the blood orange margarita and only drank 2 sips.  It was so sour and just didn't taste good.  We shared apps and by far the best was the marinated pork over a corn cake(not sure if that's what t called).  Very juicy and flavorful.  We ordered the 2 guacamole sampling and had the one with roasted red peppers and feta and the one with truffles.  Both were fine.  They didn't mix in the add ons just sprinkled them on top of the guacamole.  I don't think it added anything to the flavor and it masked the true guacamole taste.  I ordered the chicken tacos and got just that.  Three tapas size tortillas, a piece of chicken, lettuce and cheese.  Very small and dissapointing.  My hubby had the pulled pork tacos and they were yummy!  Thankfully he let me steal one so I could enjoy something here.  The pork tacos were pilled high with flavorful pulled pork.  Not bar-b-q style, but mexican seasoned.  The churros were very good and came with a creamy chocolate sauce.  I had very high hopes do to neighborhood buzz and reviews, but I will not be returning here.  The awesome velvet booths and photobooth aren't enough to carry this place for me.
