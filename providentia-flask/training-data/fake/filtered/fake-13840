I wanted to treat my daughter to her first experience of authentic Thia food and I was very disappointed. I have had authentic Thia food and have been very pleased, but I can't day the same about this place. First, I have to say that the seating was quick, mostly because it was empty but for two other customers. The waitress brought out a pitcher of water that had little ice and tasted nasty. The pitcher it self was so cloudy that you couldn't even see thru the bottle. We had there lunch special and it included a thia salad. The dressing on the salad again nasty only because it was served warm over the salad, not even cool. We had the shrimp and CHKEN dumplings as an appetizer and it was lacking flavor. I never had dumplings as dry as these. My daughter was also not impressed. We had two entreesś. One was the  Red Curry ,witch is Sliced meat and eggplant in Thai red curry with coconut milk and Pad Pik King witch is Stir fried meat with mushrooms, peppers, onion, ginger, and garlic with special sauce. My daughter was not at all again impressed with this choice because she expected it to be spicy and it was not at all. I was not impressed with my Pad Pik king because the flavor didn't seem to be thru out the entire meal. While sitting there trying to have a conversation with my daughter over a quite lunch I have to say that it was hard to hear each other over the loud conversation going on in the kitchen while our order was being prepared, can that be why our food was not the best of the afternoon because they were otherwise engrossed in a unneeded convo that distracted them from cooking to the best of their ability. SMH!! I would always ask my husband to stop every time we passed the restaurant because I wanted badly to have Thia cuisine but having experience all of that I'm glad that the experience wasn't with him cause I would have never heard the end of it when ever we would drive pass again. Safe to say that I will never be visiting this place again.
