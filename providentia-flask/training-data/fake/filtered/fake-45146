was here Saturday night 8/2/14 for my anniversary with my wife & another couple. We were seated by the hostess and soon after our waitress came over, greeted us and recited specials. As we were looking through the respectful menu, we all of a sudden heard a woman scolding one of the employee in a very loud tone. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  After reviewing the business info and reading about the "quiet atmosphere" and the "no good for kids" we assumed this would of been the perfect place for us...... Unfortunately we assumed wrong!! It was a very noisy atmosphere, The inside could use some updating, I feel that the bar tables that are lined up against the wall in the entry way should be in the bar area, our table inside the main dining room was by a wall that had very noticeable paint chipped off of it, & the artificial plant that "I kept hitting my head into" on the separating wall looked like it has over lived it purpose. As for the food, everything was brought out in a timely fashion & was full of flavor.  I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a nice quiet dinner.
