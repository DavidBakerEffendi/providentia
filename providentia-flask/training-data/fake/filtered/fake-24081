We consider ourselves "foodies" and we had plans to go a nice place on 11/3/2012. We had reservations at a restaurant that on the surface was amazing, but after looking at some reviews, it seemed like we would be better postponing our dinner for something "amazing."   We googled "molecular gastronomy" and we found Marigold Kitchen.  We called MK the night we cancelled our other reservation, but they did not have a table available  ( I called twice hoping they would have an opening) Nevertheless, we made a reservation for 11/10/2012. We were patienly awaiting our reservation. When we arrived, it was a humble atmosphere. One where you could feel completely comfortable considering the level of food we were about to experience. We chose the 5 course tasting menu with the fish and meat as the dinner options. That was only the beginning! They served about 7 amuse-bouche's. The dinner was so amazing, but the amazing tastings you will experience before you even have your meal are enough to talk about to everyone you know. We had truffle popcorn frozen with nitrogen, so when you bite into it, smoke comes out of your mouth! We also had Halibut ceviche, Caprese Salad Dippin Dots! (unbelievable), ravioli with salted chocolate, a homemade craker with cheese that oozes out of your mouth when you bite into in (and many more). The kitchen seems capable of anything you dream/imagine. The five course meal was just as imaginative and creative as anything you could dream. The desert  was an experience as well. Our server (strawberry blonde!)  was helpful, and knowledgable about everything we were trying/experiencing. (My husband and son tried (sweetbreads!) I have never been so awoken by a meal such as this. Make a reservation and you will not be disappointed :)
