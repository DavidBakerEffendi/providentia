THE BEST Japanese I keep running back to for more. Am a great fan of many of their dishes, but the one that is absolutely unlike anything else is their tofu salad. Â It is getting increasingly difficult to be able to find a table without reservations though in spite of years of being a client. Great pity, but the food is worth the trouble of a reservation (they take a message and get back to you).
