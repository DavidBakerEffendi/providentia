I ate here Wednesday for lunch and liked it so much I went Friday night with my husband and dog to sit and have a smoothie on their patio/sidewalk seating. Â The girl at the counter (Friday night 8/30/13) was extremely rude!!! I walked in and the girl asked "for here or to go?" I said "me and my husband want to sit outside. We are just gonna have 2 smoothies." Pretty simple Friday night right? FYI there was NO ONE else on the patio. She says "you can sit outside and wait for a server to be with you". When I went Wednesday I got everything to go and it was counter service. Due to the fact we were not eating and no one else was on the patio I did not think it would be a big deal to get the smoothies at the counter and have them outside. The girl told me no. She said I would be taking up a table for someone who wanted to eat there. Did I mention there were 3 tables in the whole place with people at them and NO ONE ELSE outside. I told her that was a pretty silly thing to lose a customer over and she was straight faced and rude about it the whole time. I live on 13th and locust and wk on 15th and walnut. I WOULD have been a regular customer. Thanks for the reply Rocco:)
