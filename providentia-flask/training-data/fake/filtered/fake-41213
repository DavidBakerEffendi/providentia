This place has THE BEST RAMEN IVE EVER HAD...it also has the longest line ever. But that's okay. You know why? Because the moment they mispronounce your name you know its time to sit at a crowded bar and enjoy a true delicacy. The crowd actually adds to the enjoyment in my opinion. It builds up the anticipation and you will not be disappointed. The broth was incredibly rich and had a tremendous depth of flavor. The noodles were pretty good, I felt like the texture could have been better...but man its all about that broth. I'd bathe in it if it was socially acceptable. Can't wait to go back.
