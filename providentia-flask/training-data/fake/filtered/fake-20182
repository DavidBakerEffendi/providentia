This place is a gem in the neighborhood.  I'm a huge foodie and very picky about food in NYC - I've been to them all, Per Se, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Sushi Yasuda, The Modern, Bouley, Daniel, etc.   This cozy spot is just good, old-fashioned home cooking with a great menu, ambience and great people.  Tomas is very fun and inviting and can cook up a mean dish, and is also quite the pastry chef (delicious almond croissants on the weekends!). I always start out with the curried shrimp - it's the perfect starter, and I love the smell of the curry emanating from the kitchen.  My favorite main dish is the roasted chicken - it is incredibly flavorful, moist and just hits the spot.  I pair everything with German Riesling from Mosel. Saturday nights are a blast.  The very talented Rachel brings her Ukelele Saturday nights at 8pm to perform Island music that is soothing and relaxing with dinner.  The staff is attentive and uber-friendly, and the food always hits the spot with generous portions.   Lovely people and a real gem in a neighborhood packed with Dim Sum and Chinese restaurants.  A welcome break from the usual Chinese places.
