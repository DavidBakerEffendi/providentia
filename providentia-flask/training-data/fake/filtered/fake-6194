My coworkers and I have been coming to this restaurant for months for their amazing soup and salad. However, we had to stop going because we get charged different prices each time we go! Not only does the price change, but there's a certain blonde waitress that we get on a occasion that is absolutely horrible with service. She makes the dining experience dreadful! Needless to say, we will not be going back to this establishment especially when the wait staff refuses to disclose when management will be on the premises to rectify billing errors. It's such a shame when employees are at fault for the restaurant's loss of business...
