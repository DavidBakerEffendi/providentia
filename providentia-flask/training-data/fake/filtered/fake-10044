I've been meaning to come here for brunch for quite some time but was put off with the long wait times mentioned in the reviews and no reservations policy. Surprisingly there wasn't a wait (Sun. brunch around noon). However they won't sit you down until your whole party has arrived. In general, I didn't think the wait staff was very attentive or friendly. The party that was sat down next to us (after we were sat) had their orders taken before ours. I got the frittata, which was very good. The Irving farm coffee was excellent but I don't understand the reasoning for how they serve it. They give you a metal tin and you then pour it yourself into a metal drinking cup. Both are the same size! The tin doesn't hold more then the cup. It's pretentious. Now here comes the reason for my bad rating. We ordered a side of bacon for the table and when I broke a piece in half there was a HAIR BAKED INTO THE BACON! I'm not talking about an eyelash or a small piece of hair; a conservative estimate would be 2 inches. I tried to get someones attention and could not get it, I just saw the hostess dancing around with a waitress (keep in mind it wasn't busy). I'm all about having fun and a festive atmosphere but don't forget to pay attention to your customers. Finally I told our waitress and she apologized once (coldly) and replaced the bacon. When the check came (and our waitress gave us her first smile!) I was expecting at least the bacon to be compensated for and maybe our coffee/juice or perhaps a desert plate brought over but none of that happened.
