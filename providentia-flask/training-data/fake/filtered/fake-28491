Mac and cheese, hold the hair!  I went there last night for dinner, drinks were great and we were looking forward to a good meal, then came the HAIR in the Mac and cheese( it can happen). When I complained to the bartender she gave me a look as if it were my fault, then asked if I would like another one, yes please. I can't prove it but it was the same dish minus the hair, plus extra cheese. I actually said that it looked like the same dish and the bartender gave a creepy smile. I refused to eat it, the bartender actually said "you ordered it, you should pay for it, I came close to making a scene, and walked out.  I don't know how a woman can hold a job as a bartender with that  kind of attitude. Stupid children working behind a bar. Can't go back, but it's because of the bartenders attitude, not the HAIR IN MY FOOD,
