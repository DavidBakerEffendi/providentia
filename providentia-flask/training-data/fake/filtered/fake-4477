the tables are small and cluttered, adding the chips and salsa and guacamole made the space even more sparse... but the kicker was when the waiter brought our food and handed it to us... and we were left holding it while we tried to make room for it on the table ourselves.... poor service, to say the least... they could've at least cleared away the unused table setting... we tipped anyway but will not be returning
