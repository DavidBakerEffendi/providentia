I ate at Stella 34 in August 2014.   I would have to be held at gunpoint to return here.  Seriously.   One Star is only for the atmosphere.  It is hip and comfortable and the servers wear chuck taylors.   The food however deserves zero or negative stars.   I sat at the bar and had a chicken sandwich with potato chips.  One would think that it would be difficult to completely botch a chicken sandwich and yet Stella 34 has done it.   The chicken breast was so thick that I could not fit the sandwich in my mouth.  What is going on here?  You guys cannot pound out a chicken breast to less that 2 inches?  I was very disappointed.  Also, the potato chips had no salt.  Again, what is going on here?  You guys do not put even a speck of salt on potato chips?  Incredibly disappointed.   The best part of the meal was the water.  How sad.
