Me and the boyfriend eat here at least 2x a month. We've tried everything on the menu (except pork dishes).  The guacamole is fanastic.  The pictures of Sangria are tasty and reasonably priced. The food is always fresh.  There's never a long wait for service.  And sometimes the band plays live music.   I highly recommend that you try it if you love Mexican food.
