Delicious, genuine, great value.  While visiting NYC, met a couple of friends for dinner on Monday.  Yes, the dining room is cramped and noisy, but well worth the wait - enjoy hanging out with the friendly owner, have a drink at the bar next door.  No reservations, cash only, but go for the food!  Superb tuna salad, and a spicy seafood stew with fresh and tender ingredients - nor rubber squid here.  The house wines are excellent too.  Let's just hope that success doesn't spoil this little gem.
