Baja's is the most amazingly fresh, delicious, mexican food I have found in Connecticut. When it comes to salsa, some like it hot, and Baja's knows it. They have an amazing salsa bar with everything from a deliciously fresh mild chopped salsa to some very spicy and deeply flavorful options. The fish tacos are great, and all their seafood tastes like it was just caught. I have to rave specifically about the pollo asada. It is crispy, flavorful, and tender, and it makes a great filling for the huge but unbelievably delicious Rafael's Especial burrito. You may need to take half home, but you will love eating the leftovers!!
