Super friendly and food is fantastic!  Treat yourself to Grilled Vegetable Whole Wheat Pizza!  Tender arugula, grilled marinated eggplant, roasted red peppers, garlic and fresh mozzarella drizzled with olive oil and balsamic atop a thin crispy crust. All of the flavor, none of the guilt! You won't find this slice of heaven any where else in town!
