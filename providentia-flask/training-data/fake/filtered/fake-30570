Horrible. They forced us to sit at a corner table as we are teenagers. This table was horrible, lacking basic napkins and even a white cloth on the table, like we were less worthy than everyone else. They also forced us to pick up the food from the front desk, instead of having it served to us all under the fact that "we didn't order under a menu,". Food wasn't that great, let alone the steep prices, but that's not the point of this review. It's to express the poor treatment of their customers. As we walked in, a waitress asked us for the number of seats, and was about to proceed us to a normal table, but a man at the front desk stopped her and told us to order from the front. We, unknowing, did so and were placed at the table described. Immediately we felt uncomfortable and asked a waiter to move. He said that you have to order an entire pie, so called a "dinner", to be allowed at the table. we explained to him that we did so knew that we had met the requirements and asked the "grinch" at the front desk if we could move,  where he promptly and sternly replied, "no". So we sat there eating food which we had to pick up ourselves, and were even further let down by the waitress giving us paper, yes, PAPER cups for us to have water served in. I don't understand why this had happened and why they would assume that because we are young that they had to put us in such a place, but if you don't want to support horrible service and want more bang for your buck, forget about Dusal's.  Manny Y is right, the owner is one hell of an jerk!
