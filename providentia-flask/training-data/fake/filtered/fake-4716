After my daughter, who doesn't eat seafood,  raved about the calamari at Blue, I knew I had to give Blue a try. I was delighted with the menu.  The food was fantastic!!  When I told them how my daughter had loved the calamari, they said although that was only on the dinner menu, they would kindly prepare it for myself and my friends. The waitstaff was terrific as well....it all contributed to a wonderful dining experience.....if you're ever on Staten Island, you must visit Blue.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!
