I have to say that this place has the BEST burger I have had in my entire life. I recommend rare - it's so juicy and so delicious. It could be grass-fed and hormone-free--I don't really care--but it is SO delicious. And get it with blue cheese! The only bad part about is the salad you have the choice of getting with it (or fries). They only have one kind of dressing, an unpleasantly tart lemon vinaigrette which they coat the salad in. Wish they had a balsamic, or that they would have told me the first time I ordered it that the dressing already came tossed... But oh well. Still worth five stars here... That being said, I have to take two stars off for the place itself. It is the most pretentious hipster place I have seen. The bartenders there have this air that they are so much better than you based on the Urban Outfitter and J Crew outfits. The tables are so close (I was waist-to-waist with the customer next me) and it is always so uncomfortably warm in there. Eating at Five Leaves has become almost unbearable for me. So do what I do. Order to go and eat comfortably in McCarren Park next door or at home. It will be nice, cool, and not pretentious. If you get the salad, ask for no dressing and use your own.
