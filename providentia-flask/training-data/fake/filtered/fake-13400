We came here for lunch last yeay in Late january when visiting our daughter at Dartmouth and were very impressed with the service, decor and food. This spring alas our hopes were dreadfully dashed. The sweet girl who greeted and sat us last year has been replaced by a null and void waiter who's mind could have been anywhere else and his beard needed a good trim. The carpet looked like it had been treaded upon by a thousand oil workers but we were near the kitchen and a lot of black grime could be coming from there. There was dust on the cieling yuck! The food has taken a great fall as well as we were anticipating the same uniqueness we had last year and all our hopes were dashed. The options were so limited and basic like they are trying to make the move from fine dining to a mediocre pub. When my wife ordered her pad thai she was expecting a Canoe Club twist on the classic but all she got was a bowl of Â very spicey broth, some chunks of chicken and some veggies over noodles- this is not pad thai by any stretch of the imagination. My daughter got a grilled veggie wrap wich she thankfully raved about and I had a steak wich I got last year and loved but they pulled a fast one on me as this year's was very small and came only with a handfull of fries. The Canoe Club is not what it was or could be. We will not come back. The Melkin family
