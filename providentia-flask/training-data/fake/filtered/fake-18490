My best friend and I arrived after reading some Yelp reviews.  We were offered the main dining room with a price fixed menu of $88. We accepted and were escorted in. We had a first course of poached shrimp and later I enjoyed the monkish. Overall, it was acceptable and the food was cooked well. I was happy to find that the portions were very small. This helped modify the amount I ate at such a late hour. The bread was horrific...bland and hard. For dessert I had the cheese plate which was uninspired.  They gave us two muffins to take home and a macaroon which was not stellar. There was one waitress there who had worked a double shift but still offered us great service and conversation. Our main waiter was less amicable.
