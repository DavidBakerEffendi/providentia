Awesome place!!! The Lock Yard is a casual bar with a laid back vibe. It's a great place to kick back, have some beers and enjoy a bite to eat with some good friends. The backyard/patio is spacious with nice decor, perfect lighting and heaters for the cooler weather. They have a great variety of food. The beer selection is wide enough to satisfy any beer drinkers pallet. The service is outstanding. The manager/owner is a super cool dude and makes you feel like you're family. I recommend this place to anyone who is looking to have a great night out. Amongst the vast number of bars in Bay Ridge, Lock Yard is a diamond in the rough.
