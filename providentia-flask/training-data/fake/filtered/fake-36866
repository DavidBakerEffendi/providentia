My husband and I have just moved to the area and were looking for a spot of Sunday evening cocktails. I'm happy to say we wandered into Walters and had a great night sampling ALL of the rum cocktails off the menu. The cocktails were delicious, the atmosphere chilled and the bartender, Tommy, attentive, welcoming and friendly. I'm looking forward to popping in again soon and having a go at working through the tequila selection of cocktails!
