A great place for brunch or dinner. Must haves: Truffle fries, honey and ricotta, flash fried oysters, chopped kale salad, mussels, shepherd's pie, Five Leaves burger. And the cocktails are equally amazing - They make one of the best sazeracs! Â Too bad there's such a long wait nowadays, we used to be able to just walk in.
