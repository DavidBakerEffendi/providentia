Crikey!!!!  I'm in LOVE with this place even though there's not a koala or kangaroo in site.   The fare is magnificent!!   The grilled watermelon with pan fried squid is amazing!   I can't get enough.  Really... I'm black... I CAN'T get enough.  It's just an all-around great place to be.   And don't overlook the homemade sorbets... Although my dessert is hanging with all the Aussie hotties... the two Chris-es and that hunk Alan.... Oh boy watch out when Warren starts mixing his evening specials.   Run, don't walk to Flinders! NOW!!!!!  A million stars for Aussie hospitality!
