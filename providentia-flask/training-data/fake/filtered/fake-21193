This is the old Elaine's which has been restored magnificently.  The atmosphere, the Bar and the Back room are a 10.  However the food is seriously disappointing.  For such a neat neighborhood spot it's a shame that you can only go there for the atmoshphere.  If they improve the food I would be there all time!  It's so cozy, but the food has to be upgraded!
