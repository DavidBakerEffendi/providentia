Second time here and they've expanded their menu.  Just popped in for a quick burger on my way home and I think it was better than the last time I was here.  I just had their americano burger this time around and tried their onion rings for the first time.  Whoa...  They have desserts now too and I really cannot say enough about the salted caramel zeppoles that have not already been said.   Nice to see the place busy.  Small establishments in Rutherford that serve excellent food are hard to come by.   Thanks again Bergen Burger - till next time........
