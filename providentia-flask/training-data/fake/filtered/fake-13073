I wanted to hold my kids 1 st birthday here. So, I went to take carryout to taste the food. We ordered chicken, paneer shahi and mixed veg pakora at around night 10:00. Paneer was shredded not in cubes, and pakora was only fried besan no vegetables. Chicken also sucked, I decided not to have birthday party here
