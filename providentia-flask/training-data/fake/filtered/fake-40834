I can't conclusively tell people that this is the greatest of all the pizza places in the world as Lombardi claims, but still, it's one of the better ones if you like thin crust pizza. Â As far as cheese and bread it probably doesn't get much better, but don't be fooled into thinking they're the only choice!
