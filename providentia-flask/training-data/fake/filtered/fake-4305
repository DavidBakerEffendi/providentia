A truly incredible experience last night... not in a good way.  First, incredibly high prices for a BYOB.  Then, the entrees took over an hour to arrive in a place with a handful of tables and not all occupied.  To top it off, the food was cold when it arrived, or at least lukewarm, in a restaurant where you are practically sitting in the kitchen.  All that for $220 for four before tip!  I heard so much about this place and was terribly disappointed.  The original Dmitri's on 3rd and Catherine is WAAAY better and at less than half the price!
