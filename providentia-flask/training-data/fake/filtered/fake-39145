Stopped in with a co-worker for lunch. My co-worker received his meal. As he was finishing his meal, my burger was finally ready. Unfortunately, the burger was screwed up to the point of being inedible. Definitely not happy to have wasted my lunch hour. Fortunately there are many quality eateries nearby; I need not be tempted to attempt to eat here again. I cannot recommend this establishment unless you enjoy having your time wasted unnecessarily.
