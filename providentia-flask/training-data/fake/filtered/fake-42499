I've been coming here since they opened and it is still one of my faves in the hood. Be warned that everything is small plates and the food comes out as it's cooked. My personal favorites: the meatballs, zucchini with almonds, lambchops and nearly all the bruschetti! Really delicious!! My only quibble is that they are a little heavy-handed with the pepper-- need to dial that down a notch. And the dining room is an acoustic nightmare. Trick is to go early, because when the room is full, it's impossible to hear-- and I'm not old!
