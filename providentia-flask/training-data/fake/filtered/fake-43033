A friend of mine recommended Montana's to me since he lives in the area. I'm glad I got the local's insight because this place rules. I ordered the swordfish entree and my friend ordered the beef tartare. Both dishes have an impressive balance of flavor and were very satisfying. I was especially interested in the liquor selection they have. You can tell that the bartenders really know their stuff. I work in bars myself and I always appreciate a good craft selection. I definitely plan to come back in later seasons and see what else they can whip up.
