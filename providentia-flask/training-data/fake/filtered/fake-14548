Had lunch here today and was pleasantly surprised.  Fresh, flavorful dishes clearly prepared with love.  Would recommend the vegetable momo dumplings, Chicken Chhoila and lamb chili (was like a Nepali stir fry).   We loved our meal so much we are following up our lunch with take out for dinner so that we can try the fish curry and the goat momo.
