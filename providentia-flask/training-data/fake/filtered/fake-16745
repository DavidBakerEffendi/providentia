As a person who's worked in service before I'm rarely compelled to come on here and write a review.  I was shocked that I had never been to this bar.  I had a first date here last night and had an awesome time.  The date wasn't awesome but the bar was super cool.  It's a nice and cozy little place, the vibe is perfect for date.  I've been in New York for quite some time now and can honestly say that 90% of the places out there are just not very cool and play awful tunes.  I literally had to ask the bartenders the name of every tune they played.  It was great.  They were both super friendly and funny.  They made my awful date kind of the best date ever.  I highly recommend going and having a glass of wine.  I'm definitely going to make it my go to date spot.  The only downside was no food.
