First time at Vonda's Kitchen and I couldn't have been happier! The staff was welcoming, the atmosphere was bright and friendly and Vonda greeted us herself a minute after we were seated. I had the ox tail with rice and beans - my first time for ox tail and it was great. I'll definitely be going back soon.
