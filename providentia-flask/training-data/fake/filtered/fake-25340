Grand buffet is one of the best chinese restaurants in the area.  I usually go there for lunch, they are always busy.  I love the black pepper chicken and peanut butter chicken, they are my favorite!  I am suprised by how much seafood they provide on the buffet during lunch time. I tried their steamed white fish(what the tag shows), pretty good, very fresh, they have shrimp on the hot buffet, also cold shrimp on the salad bar, and guess what  i see crawfish!  love them!  for 7.29 all you can eat, don't think you will find a place with better deal with that much seafood. and I know they even have more seafood on the buffet during dinner time, but i never have time to try it., they say they bring out crab legs, clams and stuff, and steak  and frog legs on weekend menu, I've got to try their dinner menu too!  their steam table is always hot, i like it that way.  They have a hugh salad and desert bar,  all the fresh fruits and can fruits, and all those cakes!   but i gotta say my favorite part is the softserve ice cream meachine, they have cones for you to take away!  un.. but they don't serve mix dirnks only beer and wine.   but that won't stop me from going back, because guess what i did, i peek through their kitchen window, and their kitchen is very clean!  so is their bathroom!  that's all i care about, the cleaness!  and the food is good too, friendly waitress,  i  like it!
