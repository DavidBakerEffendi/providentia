Brooklyn Fare - WHAT A SCAM!  The sashimi was good, however the staff was like being in a scary movie!  We paid $275 a person to be belittled and abused.   The Chef Cesar was autistic and was social inept.   Not to mention Michelle Smith, who was down right a mean girl.  As she looked down her nose and accused me of things she has no knowledge of!  If you want to pay a lot of money to be looked down upon and abused for some good sushi, small portions and too many different sauces and you still walk away hungry, then waste your $275.00 per person on this Snotty, not really classy illusion of great cuisine and impeccable service- NOT!  BOO HOO ON YOU!  RIP OFF!
