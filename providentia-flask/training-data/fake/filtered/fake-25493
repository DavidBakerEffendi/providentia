I went to Leunig's yesterday for lunch. I wanted to take my girlfriend out to a nice place as she just had a baby. My husband and I have been going there for over fifteen years. I WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN! We had the baby in a stroller and asked to sit outside. When the table was ready the gentleman directed us to a table with two chairs and no room for a stroller around it. I asked him where we were going to put the baby? He then said we could leave the baby and stroller in the walkway on the other side of the chain. I was appalled by this. There was also a table empty that had four chair and plenty of room around it for the stroller. I asked if we could have that table instead, as she is a first time Mom with a five week old baby. I was told that table was for four people. So we left and went somewhere else. My family will never go there again. The service is atrosish.
