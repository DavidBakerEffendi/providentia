Not so happy about finding this place.  The parking was horrible.  The service was awful, failing to bring certain things to the table, like spoons for using the sauces,   we had to go to another table to get them after waiting 5 minutes for them. The wait staff told us they were " Swamped "...  Strange as there were maybe 6 people in the whole place,  most at the bar drinking. The way the orders are placed is crazy,  completing a " score card " type of ticket,  the wait staff does NOT take your order., you do...  All three orders came on the same one tray the wait staff drops off at your table,  you must figure out  what Taco is what and who ordered it,  very confusing..   The food was " okay " ,  but the Tacos were very, very small,  I mean real small..  A bottle of beer will run you a cool $5.50 a bottle and mixed drinks are from $10.00 to $13.00 a drink.  The final bill was incorrect,  over charging us by $10.00...   I was very disappointed,  I had heard the place was great,  not so great to me.  I will NOT be returning to this place.
