Dined with some friends of mine for brunch today, (Saturday 8/31).  THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE.  We enjoyed everything from apps to dessert. Drinks were amazing. Had to wait for a table, but didn't mind since cutest hostess at the front (long brown hair, blue eyes, perfect smile) Our server was great, attentive, and informative. There aren't enough words for the food. Perfect all around. Will be back very soon.
