My wife and I took the walking tour and had a blast! Scott is friendly, enthusiastic, and so knowledgeable! From history, to the ovens, to the pizza, he knows it all! Unlike other tours he's not trying to sell you stuff or hound you for tips, (double-decker anyone?) He just keeps it light, fun, laid back, and before you know it the three hours are up. Being Canadian I have never been exposed to the simple greatness of authentic New York style pizza, now I can't get enough and make it at home when ever possible! Cannot say enough good about Scott or the tour, would recommend this to anyone! Next time we're in NYC we will definitely take the bus tour!
