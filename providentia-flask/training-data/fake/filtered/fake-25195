This is a very cozy Italian restaurant. If you are Italian and like Italian food, you will feel very comfortable here.a lot of things are imported from Italy. The food is very good and has very nice presentation. I gave it only four stars because the skirt steak was not good at all it was very tough we asked the waiter where the steak was from, he said not from America.our country has the best beef. I'm not going to get into why, but my father is a butcher and I can say that the US does have the best beef Â  you can definitely tell it wasn't American raised cow. My dish was excellent it was a homemade pasta with pancetta and Pomodoro sauce , it was a little salty but it was enjoyable. the desserts were to die for. the best thing I need to say is our waiter his name was Adam a young nice b Young man, he reminded me a little bit of Adam Sandler. He had perfect presentation, consideration, always was looking to make sure we were satisfied. One of the best waiters I have ever had, in many years of dining. Definitely check it out, if your meat lover don't order meat. Other than that you will love the place. I also want to add that it is a BYOB but you can order your wine and the store down the street will personally deliver it to you.that's awesome!
