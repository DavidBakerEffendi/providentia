Horrible service and the manager was unprofessional. We had an issue with our bill (we were confused about an extra $16 charge) and he came over to discuss it with us. Instead of trying to ensure customer service, he was defensive and rudely stated that in the area we are in 20% gratuity is common. I have no problem leaving a 20% tip if the service is justified. Moments before our issue with the manager, a man next to our table was arguing with the manager about not having to pay for the hookah he didn't even use or get since he had to leave due to an emergency. The manager then tried getting the man to just give him a $20 to call it even. Never going back! I wish there were pros about the restaurant but unfortunately I will never stop foot in this establishment again or recommend it with the present management.
