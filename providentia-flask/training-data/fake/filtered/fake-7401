another place i haven't been to in years and have worried that it wouldn't live up to the expectations in my memory. and again, as good as i remembered.  the house specialty--the bistro burger is delicious, but what stuck with me was the chiliburger-- the chili is so meaty it's like they just crumbled another burger on to your burger.  it's like meat with meat on top.  meat with a side of meat.  it's like you went to the nearby magnolia bakery and got a cupcake but the cake part was ground beef, and the frosting part was also beef, and the sprinkles were cheese, or if you don't like cheese, more beef.  yea.  you have to really like meat.
