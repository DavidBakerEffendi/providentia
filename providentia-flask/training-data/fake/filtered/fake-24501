This is not typical pizza. The pizza has a thin crust cooked to perfection. I would eat here every day but then I would have to spend all night in the gym. Needless to say I love the pizza. I have eaten here several times and sampled many of the pizzas. My favorite is the 4 cheeses. The only downside is the no reservation policy. Whose time are they wasting? And the tables inside are uncomfortably close. Outside you can't be more than two at a table except for one table for four in the front. Otherwise the service is fine. The female hostess always says their will be a wait even when tables are empty. Hopefully they fired her because she was not there the last time I was in. But tonight I decided I could not deal with the wait at Posto and had a delivery for the first time. The delivery man was prompt. But they have a cash only policy for delivery. Well I do enjoy Posto pizza so I accept the punishments they dole out. Still worth it even with all the rules and by the way. Posto will not break the bank with the personal pizza only $7.50 and you can skip dessert and walk to the Italian bakery on 2nd avenue.
