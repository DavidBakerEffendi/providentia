Stopped in for some take out. The staff was really nice. Invited me to the bar and made suggestions for a good entree. The decor was really interesting with tree branches hanging from the ceiling. I'd like to come back to eat in one day. I ordered the Kao Soy with chicken. It was a soup with curry broth. The broth was really great. It has coconut milk in it and was the perfect blend of sweet and savory flavors. The portion was a good size. I paid $13 even with $1's worth of tax. I'd come back again.
