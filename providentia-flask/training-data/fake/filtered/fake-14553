I went in for lunch one day with a friend and we ordered two Baja burgers and several glasses of naraganset beer. I was impressed with our waitress's knowledge and enjoyed the food however, I rated this a 1 because I believe what our waitress did was totally unacceptable. I was paying in cash and my friend was paying in card. We told her to do a partial card/cash transaction. I gave her more money than half of the bill because I wanted change and I told her that also. She came back with none of my change and charged my friend all but 32 cents on the bill (the total was $60.22). At first I did not want to assume she wanted to pocket my cash for herself as tip but it seemed fishy to me since I have worked as a server before and theres no way she could have put in the rest of the cash for the bill because only 32 cents was left and the math on the system would not add up. When we called her over the talk to her about it she immediately asked if she had put in the wrong amounts, and this was even before we said anything to her about it. We were charged the correct amounts after she fixed her error. My experience at the Milford, CT location was delicious until our waitress left a terrible taste in my mouth... I loved the food, atmosphere and selection, but a waitress trying to make extra cash on her lunch hour by pocketing money is not a place I would return to. Customer service here is unacceptable. Sorry.
