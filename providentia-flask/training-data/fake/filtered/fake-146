What a shame.  Brought my family to Philly for the holidays and wanted to try out this establishment.  What a shame to see the racism in this place.  People were so rude, we left and went to Jim's at 400 South St. They didn't want my dollars, so I would never eat here nor would I recommend anyone do so either.  What a shame...
