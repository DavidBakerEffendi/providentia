I love this place, everything about it.  The first time I went, they really welcomed me.  I found quickly that this is the best UES place for coffee, not bad since it is only a few blocks from my place.  I went for cappuccino this morning and after some errands, got la madunina- really good prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, kalamata olive, and tomato all for $9.  Some items are pricey like their salads but their sandwiches with quality ingredients are so worth it and reasonable for the area.  I also love reading there in the afternoon with cappuccino or tea and a small plate of cookies.  One warning- know how to get a seat- go straight back and tell the hostess, then wait in front where there are no assigned seats, grab one if you can get it.  It also totally dies down after the lunch rush.
