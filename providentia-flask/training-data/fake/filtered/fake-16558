I like this place a lot. Everyone working here is very friendly. I always order the za'atar manakeesh with fresh veggies. It's great, albeit not as great as the za'atar manakeesh I've eaten in the Middle East! They also have a wide selection of arabic desserts. The prices are very friendly on the wallet as well.
