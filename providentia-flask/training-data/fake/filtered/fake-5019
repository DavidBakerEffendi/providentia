Best tofu place in Korea-town. When I go to eat here I usually pick one of their tofu dishes and the LA Galbi dish. It's always taste good the few times I have eaten here. Also, the appetizers come with a mini whole fish which is quite delicious. Every time I am in the midtown area around Penn station I would make this a definite spot to go to when I am in the mood for Korean food. Would recommend to all my friends!
