I was a little worried about this place being off the beaten path and being able to catch a taxi back to our hotel from here in the evening. Web pics only showed dark/lonely 21st St.   But, it is actually right on the corner of 1st Avenue and taxi was no problem. We three made a reservation for 7:30PM Halloween night but got there an hour early with no problem getting seated.  Ordered Crispy Pata, Sizzling Sisig, Pork Adobo, Bangus Sinigang & Kare-Kare.  I can't speak for the latter two I (Americano) only ate the Crispy Pata, Sisig & Adobo which were all very good.  Actually its only the 2nd time I've had Sisig actually Sizzling, could hear it coming from the kitchen (and on an Iron Skilet on wooden serving board!)   The waiter was great and the food came in short time. If Filipino food is on your short list of things to do in NYC, I highly recommend Grill-21.
