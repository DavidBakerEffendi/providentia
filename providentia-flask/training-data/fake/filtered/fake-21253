We love this restaurant. Not a cookie cutter like so many, quaint, in an old Victorian house. Great selection of teas and great sandwiches and salads. Fresh scones are terrific. Tea sampler sandwich and tea cakes was great.  We go for lunch every other week we like it so much.  Owners are so sweet and kind and can cook to order.
