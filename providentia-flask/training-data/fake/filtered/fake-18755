Kind of a cool place but I don't find the food to be high quality. The sandwiches are named after streets in town (the Walnut, the North Fullerton, the Grove...etc.) which I gues is fun, but they are really nothing special. I had the South Mountain Ave sub there once and the Turkey was bad so I couldn't eat it but I suppose that can happen anywhere from time to time. The baked Virginia ham club is my favorite there, and I do go ther from time to time, but I give it an average for deli's in the area. Definately not as good as Belgiovine's up the Ave a bit past the police station.
