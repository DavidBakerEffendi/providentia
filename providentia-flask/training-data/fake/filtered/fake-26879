It's a Christmas Miracle! A real taqueria in New York City. I didn't think I'd ever see the day after moving here 3 1/2 years ago from San Francisco but today I finally had a real burrito in the city. If you're looking for a West Coast style burrito this is the spot and it's the real deal. It wouldn't be the best place in SF but for NY I give it 5 stars. Anyone who can't tell the difference between this and Chipotle or thinks Chipotle is better has either never been to California for a burrito or doesn't know what a real burrito is supposed to taste like. Hint: they don't have Jasmine rice in them nor do veggie burritos have carrots, bell peppers, or other veggies. Chipotle is Mexican fast food (owned by Mickey D's) and not very good Mexican fast food at that. This place is a real taqueria with fresh ingredients and no frills style. The only thing missing is horchata! And for those SFers out there, the review below that said the burritos taste like Gordo's is right on. If you want a real burrito, this is the only place to go in NYC.
