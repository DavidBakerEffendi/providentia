I took my 95 year old mom to Jimmie's to celebrate her birthday. We brought an ice cream cake which they refused to put in their freezer because they supposedly had no room. I find it hard to believe that a restaurant that size had no room for a six by six cake box in their freezer. The food was not great. I had the broiled seafood combo and the swordfish was very fishy tasting which leads me to believe it was not fresh. Of course we had to eat ice cream soup for dessert! It will be a long time, if ever, I return to Jimmie's.
