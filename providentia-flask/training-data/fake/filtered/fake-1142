First attempt:  The waitress won't substitute the flavor of ice cream in their special dessert and had an attitude about it, and so did the manager.  This is after we even offered to pay more for the substitution! Second attempt:  The food made me sick, literally.  It was the pulled pork sandwich! Third attempt:  Waited over an hour for the food to come out, with my two year old, and the waitress never said sorry once.  Furthermore, she didn't even bring out the french fries, the whole order had to come out at once. I will NEVER go back to Jones!
