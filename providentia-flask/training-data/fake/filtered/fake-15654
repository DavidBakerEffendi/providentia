I ate here with 5 girlfriends on our last night in NY, it was the worst meal we had all trip! We should have sent all the food back, but we were so hungry having struggled to find anywhere else to eat (it was Halloween). Even the humous was disgusting! My friend and I had chicken tacos which tasted as if they had been reheated and two other friends had virtually raw burgers (they asked for medium well). The only nice food was the duck and the fries. One of the waitresses was so rude that we refused to give her any tip. It was such a shame as this was our last night. Might be OK for a drink but I would advise that you avoid it.
