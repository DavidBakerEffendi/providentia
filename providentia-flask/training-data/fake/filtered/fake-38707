What a fantastic, fabulous and most importantly, DELICIOUS dining experience.  Oh, and the staff?  Just wonderful.   I'm hooked... from the near perfect martini at the bar as I waited for my pal to arrive --  to the homemade bread and butter to start the evening.  MOTHER OF GOD!   And that's before the yummy salads (one with apples, the other with brussels sprouts) and scallops graced our table!   I slight error caused me to miss out on the short ribs but now I have something to look forward to when I dine there again SOON.   Oh, wait ...  what really rocks the house is the crack addicting side of sweet potato/kale au gratin.  Done!  Do note that this is a small neighborhood restaurant so seating is tight and if looking for a quiet little corner to chat - it can be challenging.    But if its fun you are looking for with a great staff and awfully good food - go for it.  (The owner deserves a shout out, too.  Thank you Mr. Marshal)
