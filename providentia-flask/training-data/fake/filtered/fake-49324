GREAT FOOD & WINE !!!!!!!! It was such a wonderful experience!!!!!!! I went there on weekend to enjoy the day~ and guys who were working there were amazing! They are not only handsome but also had gooooood manner!!!! It was very pleasure for me to meet Fadzio the owner. He was very friendly and funny! I don't think I have to mention about the food since there are so many reviews already talking about how the foods are great from there!!! Let me add one more here, the price is very good! Compare to food, this price is nothing but donation.! From now, I go there as often as I can go! SUCH A GREAT PLACE !!!
