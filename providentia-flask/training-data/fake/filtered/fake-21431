Wonderful pizza, not to mention the service!  Everything was as good as it could be. We sat at the bar where we could see them making the genuine wood-fired pizza. The entire staff was friendly and generous.  One of the chefs making the pizza talked to us about making wood-fired pizza.  After we had our delicious Crudo pizza, our woderful waitress brought us a bag of cookies.  Sadly, I'm allergic to nuts, a main ingredient in italian cookies, so she brought me some soft serve ice-cream (I'm ten).  It was delicious! It was like vanilla, but with more depth.  Everything was magnificently perfect
