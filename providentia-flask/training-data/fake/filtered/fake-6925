To those that dont know: one dollar slices! All day... every day ... That is what the new owner told me. They updated the storefront and it looks great. I always stop here on my way home after night out in New Haven. I tried their subs too, meatballs and chicken cutlet are delicious. I can't believe these people writing bad reviews for this place.
