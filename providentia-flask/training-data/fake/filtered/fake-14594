Thanks to our nephew who gave us a gift card this our first time at Plan B Burger Bar.  The service was excellent (our wait person was Liz).   I had the Turkey club burger and my husband the three mushroom burger.  They were both cooked the way we requested.  We split a fancy fry and onion rings.  We also split the cheese cake desert. We will be going back!
