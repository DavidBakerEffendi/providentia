I cannot believe two people from Morrisville said how good the food was. Have you ever been to the Bristol Farmers Market???? This place is TERRIBLE!!! Nothing hot here. Food has either been sitting around for hours or was re-heated. Â A half rack is 5 bones with a little meat hanging on for you to pull off. Mac and cheese would be better if it came from a cardboard box. Frozen French fries for 6 dollars? 3: dollars for a Big Gulp of soda? I will not waste any more time on this review, don't waste your time going there for BBQ the Mc Rib is more BBQ than Funnibonz.
