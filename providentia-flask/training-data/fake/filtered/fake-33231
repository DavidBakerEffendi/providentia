My fiance and I gave this a chance on a Friday night for dinner and a movie. When we got there the place was jammin. We had read mixed reviews so we did not expect too much but hoped for the best. Pleasantly surprised for a movie theater restaurant. We were greeted right away with a smile by a young lady at the host stand but were told there was a 15 minute wait. Seeing a couple of bar seats open we jumped at the chance. Worked out great as bar staff was right on it. The bar menu is very creative and bigger then the dinner menu so it took a few minutes to register but by the end of our experience we were experts and it was fun to explore. Dinner menu simple but interesting. We didnt have a whole lot of time so we kept it simple. Couple of apps,Southwest wontons and Stuffed muchsrooms, both really good. Split the pesto chicken. Cool presentation but a little dry. The bartender had them split it for us!! The place seemed to be a working machine, and everyone seemed attentive. For us we had fun which is all we wanted. Capital Grill is next on the list. The area seems to be filling up!
