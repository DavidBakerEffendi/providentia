I've been going here for 30 years and find the food to be consistently pretty good.  As for the gift certificate, always call beforehand to see if a restaurant will honor it.  I've had some expensive disappointments also.  Many times the online offers are outdated and the restaurant staff says that they haven't been associated with the online offers (restaurants.com and the like) for literally-years.  So it may not be the fault of the restaurant, but rather the fault of the online site.  They'd be more than happy to take your money after the contract with the restaurant has expired.
