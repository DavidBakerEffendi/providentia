It's always nice to have a great experience after a place has been hyped more than you suspect it might deserve. Lombardi's was perfect.  We were seated in separate dining area down the street.  We waited awhile, but somehow my wife and I ended up with a free half-pour of Yuengling each.  We had the classic Margherita and a side of breadsticks.  The pizza was excellent.  I can't really say any more - it was perfect. The breadsticks were a bit surprising, but shame on me for expecting the butter drizzled garlicky stuff we've come to expect.  The breadsticks were fresh-baked, stick-shaped loaves of bread and they were wonderful.  The marinara was more than enough. The servers were great and the atmosphere close but not crowded.
