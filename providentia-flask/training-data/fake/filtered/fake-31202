I eat there twice a week. The home made food is wonderful, try the stuffed cabbage, grape leaves, small spinach pie, tabbouleh, hummus,... I can't name them all. Lebanese cuisine can be spicy at times but I love how well balanced Wafa's food is prepared yet I hate hot spicy food. The baklava are amazing, not over sweet and with real rose scents. The falafel or lamb sandwich is excellent (lamb marinated in wine!!). I think I'm going to sell my fridge and eat there everyday! No more cooking! :) And all prices are very fair. Go say hi to Wafa on my behalf (Fred from France).
