Very  uneven in regard to service and food.  Two of us had scallops with mashed potatoes and kale for $ 30.  Only four scallops, which were decent, the kale was so tough we had a good laugh wondering if one us would choke. The mashed potatoes were about three to four table spoons at best, and passable. When we commented on the kale, the waiters only comment was " do you want something else, how about some potatoes ". No apology, no attempt to please us. He later brought out a small dish of spinach and handed it to me, nothing for my daughter-in law !  My daughter's pasta dish was extremely salty; she was unable to eat it. They did remove the charge for the pasta dish. Our waiter asked for our comments, but would smirk after we made them. The restaurant's decor is attractive. The food is not and service are not... over priced and skimpy.
