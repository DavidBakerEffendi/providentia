I eat a lot and appreciate the amount of good quality meat on the subs. My GF likes the salad selection (Grilled Shrimp especially) The daily specials keep things changing on a regular basis and I vow to eat enough to get one named after me. The owner introduced himself and the service as a whole was great. I'd recommend FD Subs to anyone who asks
