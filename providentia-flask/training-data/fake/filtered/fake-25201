I ordered a cake from this place 2 days ago. I was pretty excited since this place has good food and I had eaten there before. I should have known something was wrong when the woman answered "hello" instead of a professional "champs". I put my order through and thought everything was on for my mom's birthday party. I called 2 days later to check the status. Unfortunately I had spoken to a ghost because my order didn't exist. Lesson learned. Champs is a cute place to visit once a month, but with such an unprofessional staff, it won't grow into much more. The staff is friendly, but we are not your friends. We are your customers. Be professional and reliable. If you dont, you'll leave more people like me. Vegan, without many options on your vegan mom's birtbday. I guess some peanut butter will have to do.
