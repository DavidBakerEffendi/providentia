In my opinion the #1 place for sushi in NYC. The neutral tones of the decor were soothing. The sushi was incredibly fresh and served in well-prepared bite sized pieces (unlike the gargantuan slabs of seameat a la Tomoe or Japonica). The aspect that separates Sushi Yasuda from other places is the attention to detail. Though portions were small, the food were exquisite (down to the soda I ordered, which came in a little teacup - too cute to hate on). Even the green tea mochi for dessert was creatively arranged in a way that was so simple and zen-like that it became a conversation piece.
