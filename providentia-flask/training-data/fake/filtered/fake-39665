Just ate there for lunch today, the place was packed (which is always a good sign). We sat at the sushi bar since there weren't any tables immediately available. We got the maki sushi lunch special. All the rolls were beautifully made and the fish was fresh tasting. My favorite roll so far is the Yellow Tail Spicy Roll. Its a great spot for a work day lunch. Service was fast and attentive.
