Told by another guest to shut off our flash, because it was bothering them; we listened   and we stopped taking pictures.  then we were having a conversation and were told to stop talking because they did not appreciate us talking while they were trying to enjoy the music, all this time I was having trouble keeping up with the conversation because everyone else there talking  were  preventing me from listening to my friends sitting right next to me.  The third time the same guy sitting directly in front of our table  turn to our table and started banging on our table demanding for complete silence because he did not feel like listening to our table, to make a long story short we requested our money back but management did not want to give our money back so we stayed until the last song.   Seriously this is a BAR not  a concert hall, most people were talking and trying to have a good time,  too bad because we were ordering drinks and spending a fair amount of money in this place.  Have to say if you are looking for a fight then this a place  be.  stopped at The Office Bar and Restaurant and we all had a better time than at Trumpets Bar and Restaurant. This place is not worth my time nor my money.  Patrons be ware!!!!!
