Very delicious and tasty Tex-Mex food.  Our office (located in Hamden) orders regularly from Taco King.  The people running Taco King are always friendly and accomodating.  Besides food being excellent, it is also reasonably priced.  Much better quality than Taco Bell.  Taco King's menu has lots of variety -- to please everyone.  Some very popular dishes (ordered regularly by our staff) are:  Steak Fajitas, steak & chicken nachos, Chicken Tostada Salad, Chicken wing & rice & black beans, Shrimp in Soft Taco, Chili soft taco.  We've never had a problem with our order.  Food was always great-tasing and fresh.  A fantastic take-out place.  Highly recommend it as our office has been placing orders from there regularly for many years.  Way to go, Taco King!!!
