Love it!  I have been waiting for six years for a place like this to open up in Montclair.  This is the best coffee shop in town.  The coffee is delicious.  The pastries are also so yummy.  And the food...!  There are so many great options.  My kids love it!  The service is friendly.  They will even modify dishes for my kids, basically making something not on the menu that my kids will eat.  The atmosphere is relaxed. I highly recommend a trip to Red Eye!
