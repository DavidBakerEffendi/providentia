I am always in search of authentic Mexican food and never thought I'd actually find it in New Jersey especially with all the ChiMex joints ("Chinese" food spots that also make "Mexican"). Anyhow, the food is AMAZING at Agave. I have been here several times and everyone I bring also loves the food. The service is friendly and they actually let you enjoy your food and conversation without constant hovering. I do wish that they had a broader delivery area as they do not deliver to my job which is less than 10 minutes away and on Springfield Ave. On another note, my friend who is obsessed with soccer was happy to find that they were showing the game he had been searching for and couldn't find. This is my new go-to when in Newark.
