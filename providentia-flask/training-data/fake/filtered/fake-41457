This was my first visit to Rincon Criollo, I brought my son and his wife. When we first walked in we loved the coziness of the atmosphere. The Staff greeted us warmly, and were attentive right off the bat, although it was very busy. By the time we left we were extremely happy we decided to go there because the food was plentiful, but most of all it was out of this world. I have eaten Black Beans who knows how many times, but Rincon Criollo's were the absolute best. I also had the Roast Pork, as did my Daughter-In-Law, and we both concur. THE BEST. If you had no teeth, you could still enjoy it. Also tried the Shrimp Cocktail. The Shrimp were huge, but very tender, sweet, you could tell they were very fresh. The other appetizer we tried was the Spanish Sausages. Another tasty dish. I am also not big on Avacado but tried a Salad with Avacado, Lettuce, Onions, Tomato. It also was delicious, and for dessert we had the Coconut, Caramel Custard....OMG......I wanted to take the entire batch home. It was cool, sweet, creamy, the taste was off the chain. I highly recommend you give Rincon Criollo a try, I know we will be returning to try other items on the menu, I am certain we will not be disappointed. Do yourself a favor, go on down.
