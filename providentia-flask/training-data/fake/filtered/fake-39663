The food here is pretty good and better than most others in the local area. I order delivery from here occasionally and they seem to be pretty good about it. I've been inside at one time and saw that it was clean and the atmosphere was really nice. When I went in i even saw that they  had a sushi bar. Quality wise food is really good, price on the other hand is a bit higher than what one would typically expect.  Overall I do recommend it to others to try.
