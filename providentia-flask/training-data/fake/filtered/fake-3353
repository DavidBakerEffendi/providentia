went there twice in one week. first time the girl at the counter was kinda blah. maybe it was because it was dead in the middle of the day and frigid outside (and inside too, turn on the heat). second time was dinner time and it was a gentleman working the counter. BOTH times w the girl and guy serving me the kept their gloves on to handle my money. after they finished the transaction, went right to handling the tortilla and making the food with the same gloves (who knows how long they have had them on). they are fn .01 a pair. they are made to be changed in between food making and non-food making activities guys. food: veggie taco: 5 rating..out of 10 the veggies were tasty and fresh from what i could tell. cold FLOUR tortilla was, eh ....cold? flour-y? tons of lettuce to fill space....i ate it all and it was ok beef taco: 1.5 of 10 again w the FLOUR tortilla that was again cold. at least if you are going to use flour....heat it up a bit. very greasy beef. low quality shredded cheese, tons of lettuce. tortilla was soaked through by the time i started eating it, which was less than 4 mins from the time i received it. made me feel ski-ill after eating it chicken quesadilla: 3.5 of 10 shredded dark? meat chicken. with shredded cheese. on a low quality flour tortilla (full size) then put in a george forman to "grill" it. don't give you any salsa, but you get a shot glass sized side of sour cream. i had to pan fry it to get some crisp at home. was very greasy and just not great. i get it you don't have grills or any heating elements w gas. but make a menu that works w induction, and microwaves. you can still get that grilled taste w/o a flat grill.
