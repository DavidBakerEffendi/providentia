Food is good and honest but unfortunately the staff let's down. - waiters are poorly trained and the food and their service is average. - front of staff is extremely arrogant and completely lack of costumer service. And it's not a small place as many people think. There is a large room upstairs with comfortable tables and staff but 50% of tables are always empty even on the days you were made to wait for 45 min!
