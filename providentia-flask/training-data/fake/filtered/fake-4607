Casual ambiance but still charming. There is a great variety of options on the menu and the specials were amazing.  My companion found their meal to be wonderful while mine was fair.  The noise level can get high at times. The service that night was inattentive and we had to make 2nd requests a number of times. But when the staff is actually serving you, they are polite, welcoming and genuinely hope you enjoy your meal.   Perhaps not on the top of our list to return but was happy to visit there at least once.
