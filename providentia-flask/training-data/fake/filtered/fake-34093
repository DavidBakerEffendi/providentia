Went to the Steakhouse on Saturday night - it was fantastic! Great atmosphere, great service and exceptional food. From the moment we walked in the host was polite and friendly making us feel right at home. My wife an I both had the bone-in-rib eye and it was FANTASTIC. Our server, Ivan recommended it we couldn't have been more happy. Ivan was tremendously helpful and friendly all night which added to the experience. I would recommend this place to any of my friends/family.....ask for Ivan!!!
