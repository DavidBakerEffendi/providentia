I do not recommend this restaurant. We ordered the dheopa khatsa, nepali salad, laphing, sekuwa mushroom, and choila. The dheopa khatsa is inedible. It was described as beef honey crumb, but ended up being a chewy, gelatinous, spine-like mass of cartilage mixed with onions. The nepali salad is not a salad, but rather, a few sliced up cucumbers and carrots with a slice of lime. Not what you would expect from a restaurant. We didn't get the laphing because they messed up our order and instead charged us the more expensive gyuma, a blood sausage dish. Not to mention the food was all cold, because it took around an hour and fifteen minutes to deliver. The sekuwa mushroom and choila were the only things that we could eat. If you are thinking about ordering, don't.
