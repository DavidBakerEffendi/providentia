BURGERS ARE HORRIBLE....SAVE YOUR MONEY Burgers are bland and not tasty at all.  Only options are tomatoe or onion on two pieces of wonder bread.  At 5+ bucks a shot I would think you could get at least a slice of cheese instead of some crappy spread.  Once is more than enough for this overated old establishment.  Hello 5 Guys........
