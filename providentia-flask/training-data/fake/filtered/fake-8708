My boyfriend and I went here for the first time last night. We arrived 20 minutes before our 5:30 reservation, but were seated promptly. Everyone from the host to the waiter to the woman serving the bread (even fellow customers!) was so warm and friendly! Before we ordered we were given some yummy crusty bread with olive oil and a dollop of some sort of butter or cream in the middle. We were also given a complimentary appetizer of duck liver bruscetta. I would never normally eat any type of liver, but decided I would be adventurous and eat whatever was put in front of me. It was so tasty so I am glad I tried it. We ordered the $33 - 4 course prix fixe option. Everything was delicious, but by the time dessert rolled around we were stuffed. My dessert was crepes filled with Nutella and marshmallow and topped with figs. Very rich, but good. We were also treated to a complimentary shot of Sambuca. All in all, a very enjoyable experience and we definitely are going to go back.
