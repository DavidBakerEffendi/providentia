Meh is right - They carry good beers, but charge too much. Although the staff has some pathologies that need professional attention. I'm happy to pay $10+ for a exquisitely crafted cocktail, but not here, not when so poorly rendered by bartenders that act offended to hear how the patron likes her drink. I'll frequent a LES coke bar for that type of pretense thank you very much.
