I recently had dinner at the Yardley Inn on a Friday evening. The hostesses could not have been more pleasant in their welcome and accommodating me in my choice of table. However, the server, who is a long time staff member, left a lot to be desired. It was quickly apparent that I was not a "regular". After I was seated, I watched another table (who must have been regulars) be warmly greated by her and immediately given a carafe of ice water and snacks. She even sat at their table to take their orders. It seemed like forever before she came over to me. Over the course of the meal I had to ask for bread as she was removing my bread plate after my salad; I had to ask the busser, who was great, for a carafe of water and finally once my dinner came I had to stop my server from putting salt and pepper shakers on a shelf so that I could use them. In addition, another couple came in and was seated in same a row of tables, two down from me. As they were walking to the table the woman said, loud enough for me to hear, "well, I guess we won't have our favorite table this time!" I was apparent the comment was directed at me since I was the only other table in the row. This comment was certianly not the responsiblity of the restaurant but was embarrassing. I will continue to visit the Yardley Inn but I will be absolutely sure I have a different server. I left feeling very dissappointed in my experience.
