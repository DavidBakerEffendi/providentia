Been twice since it opened-both at the bar.  First time the bartender was great, not overworked, and talkative about the beer.  Second time was extremely different, seemed really rushed (although still willing to let me sample 3 beers before I decided) and it felt like the whole place was understaffed. $4 for a pickle is reasonable-it must be a HUGE pickle, because I had 8 full sized spears on my plate.  I would like to see a single spear served with a meal though, or the option to purchase a smaller plate. Tried the hot sours-only a bit hot, and some sweet almost bread-and-butter flavor underneath.  Paired well with the mac n' cheese, although I wish there was a crusty/crunchy topping on the mac. On my first trip I got the biscuits and fixins' which were excellent.  A bit on the dry side for some, but perfect for me.   I'm forgiving the service because I love their food ethics, and this is the best beer selection in the (immediate) neighborhood after George Keeley's, but with an entirely different atmosphere.
