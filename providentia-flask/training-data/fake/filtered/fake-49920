My family and I frequent City Steam Brewery and have always had an excetional meal and top notch service. The hostess sat us right away and withing a couple of minutes our server was there for our drink order. The beers are fantastic and the homemade lemonade is a favorite.Every meal ordered has been efficient, hot and delicious. Some of our favorites inclue the beer battered chicken sandwich and a special around the holidays -the turkey/stuffing balls. The staff is great with our kids too. Don't forget dessert. The chocolate pecan pie is so good!!!
