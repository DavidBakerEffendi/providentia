(A little lengthy but worth reading!) About 2 weeks ago me and my boyfriend tried The Terrace because it came highly recommended from a friend of his.  He didn't remember the name but we knew it was on Dixwell near Sushi Palace...so I searched accordingly and came up with The Terrace and Thai Awesome.  Considering Thai Awesome had such great reviews i assumed it was that one, however driving down Dixwell my lovely boyfriend saw The Terrace and insisted that was the one his friend was talking about...(this will be relevant to my review I swear!) Now for my review...we walk in and immediately you are in a bad Ikea ad, but anyhow we get seated look at the menu and I'm totally turned off by the menu prices! By far the highest priced Thai food I've ever seen (I've eaten at Siam Orchid, Thai Taste, Bangkok Gardens, and even a  place in Newport, RI) My first thought was "damn we should have went to Thai Awesome!" but my boyfriend insisted I was being cheap and even though he read the Yelp reviews he thought we should form our own opinion.  So we get our food (spring rolls, drunken noodle, and pad thai) the portions are sooo small especially considering the price! Although what was most disappointing was that the flavor just didn't satisfy a Thai food craving, it was just okay! So now that we were still pretty hungry we seriously considered going to Thai Awesome and ordering some stuff to share!!! Moral of the story: 1) boyfriends listen to your girlfriend when she tells you not to go somewhere 2) LISTEN TO REVIEWS! although its good to form your own opinion people write reviews for a reason! and 3) I wouldn't recommend The Terrace to any person who loves Thai food
