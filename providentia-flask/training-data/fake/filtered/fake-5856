Love the food here.  This is our go to place for thai in the area.  The roti starter and pad thai are always delicious.  The other reviews note the service...yes it isn't the "typical" service that one would expect in the area but everyone is always pleasant and the service is quick.  And it's a BYO which is always a plus.
