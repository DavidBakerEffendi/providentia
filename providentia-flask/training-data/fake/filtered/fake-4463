Really disappointed with this restaurant- especially because of my love of Mexican style food with margaritas and an outdoor atmosphere. Definitely a shame that each time I have gone has possibly been some of the worst service I have ever experienced. I don't mind waiting to be seated, but once there guests should be promptly greeted. I've had to go up to the hostess and ask who our server was.. glad I did because she herself did not know.. saying "well we're changing shifts right now." The server only came to our table once to take our order.. And was never seen again. Until I had to go to the hostess for a second time and ask for our server so we could receive our check. Pretty unenjoyable- will not be returning.
