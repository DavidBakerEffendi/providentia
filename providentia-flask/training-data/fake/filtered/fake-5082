Was there on a recent saturday night. Had an awesome cocktail called "One Night Stand". I usually go for wine or beer but this drink surely made it to my "try again" list. Felt a little comfortable after a couple of those drinks because most of the crowd is definitely younger. A bacholerette party seemed to be enjoying their pistachio shots. The place was really filling up by 11 pm. I bet the lucky people in their 20s are pleased that there's finally a place for the younger crowd in west hartford center.
