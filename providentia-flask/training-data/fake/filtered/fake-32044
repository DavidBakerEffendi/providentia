The food is okay for an Italian restaurant but given that it is in southern Connecticut I would expect better. Food is traditional but nothing exotic or special. Nice average meal but nothing that you would remember a few days later. Portions are ridiculously large. I personally dislike restaurants that give you twice as much food as anyone could possibly eat... as if quantity could make up for quality. Prices were average to slightly above average. Decor is also average ... after all it's in a strip mall. If you're looking for a really nice Italian restaurant you can do much better in Southern Connecticut than Gabriel's. Note: We went in a few days after the massive snowstorm. The service was the worst I've seen in any restaurant in 20 years. The manager said that several servers were unable to make it to work. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt. But restaurants should warn you if there is no one there who can wait on you.
