I really loved this place. I went this place when I visited NJ. The price for HUGE sandwich is very affordable. No, I think it is really cheap. I tried hot chicken sandwich with balsamic sauce, and it was really delicious and sandwich breads were amazing as well. Â Also, french fries and onion rings were great!!! The place was clean including restroom, and all the staffs were friendly as well. I will definitely come back this place whenever I visit NJ and this town. One of the best sandwich place!!!
