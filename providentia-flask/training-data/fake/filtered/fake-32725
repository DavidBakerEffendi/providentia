At Vesta Trattoria and Wine Bar for brunch on Sunday, I thought I died and went to heaven.  The butter milk pancakes were huge and outstanding.  I had to take a dogie bag home because I could then finish savoring the cakes topped with fresh strawberries and bananas and REAL whipped cream.  I was amazed at the side order of bacon crisp that was greaseless because it was obviously prepared on a grill.  All that for amazingly little money.   The table down a bit ordered a breakfast pizza that seemed to exceed 15 inches.  Although I could not tell what the ingredients were, the smell made me resolve to order one of those on the next visit. Viva Vesta.  I will be back. Vesta markets at the Brooklyn Grange, an urban farm in Long Island City, with acres of space atop a building on Northern Boulevard. You know the produce is fresh when grown locally and delivered at its freshest to Vesta.
