Joya has been one of the best most affordable restaurants of the last decade. This spot always delivers great food at an extremely reasonable price. Vegetable springs rolls with tangy sauce are awesome. Â As well as fried calamari, chicken satay etc I'm a huge fan for chicken padthai and there curry chicken.
