I tried this place today and I have a few comments. I really liked the food, but the portions were ridiculously small.  I ordered the three meat special platter.  I got brisket, burnt ends and pulled pork.  All three were delicious but 1/4 lb of each?  For 34 dollars?  It comes with two sides, I got the mac and cheese and the mashed potatoes.  Both sides were good. If you spend 34 dollars, shouldn't you be able to feed at least two people? The woman at the counter was unbelievably nice.  The interior is spotless and clean.  Watching the workers actually weigh the tiny portions they give you is a bit much. So for 34 dollars, you get a grand total of 3/4 of a pound of meat, with two sides. I would recommend this place to a friend, but the prices are way too high for what you get. The owner should either double the portion size or reduce the prices, otherwise people will just opt out for something less expensive.
