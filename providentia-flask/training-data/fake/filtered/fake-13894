I walked up around 11:15 and they weren't opened yet but a employee was outside and said 11:45. I came back and there was a bit of a line but there was someone (I think the owner) giving out free tator tots and sauce for those waiting! YUM! I tried the three cheese melt and it was also good. Over all awesome except maybe the line. I hope it gets faster.
