This is a review from a non-brunch lover. I'm kind of anti-brunch, don't get me wrong, I love breakfast foods and coffee as much as the next New Yorker, but I don't believe in paying $15 for eggs and toast that I can make at home for pennies.  So I don't brunch too often.  My idea of a good brunch is somewhere I can also get a good lunch while my friends can get brunch food. This place ticks off all the requirements.   I got yummie mediterranean food (the veggie combo plate) while my friends got eggs and pancakes.  The hummus and tabouleh were fresh and hit the spot for a light lunch.  They have substantial looking sandwiches and salads as well.   Will you wait for a table?  Absolutely.  But that's everywhere in New York for a weekend brunch, so don't gripe about it.
