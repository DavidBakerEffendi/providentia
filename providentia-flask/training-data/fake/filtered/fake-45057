Ended up going here on a whim, turned out to be really great. A small sized restaurant but nice and quiet. The staff was very friendly. The pizza was excellent. It was up there with some of the best pizza I've had. The right amount of cheese, sauce and crust made for quite a delicious meal. It felt like a real quality pizza, like the kind you would find in New York. Would definitely come back on a regular basis if I lived closer.
