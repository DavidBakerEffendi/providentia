I didn't find the food here to be tasty - at all. I thought I'd get a club sandwich because their roasted turkey, bacon, mayonnaise, and cabiatta bread would all be special in some way, not just ingredients I'd rather buy myself and slap together - which would have probably tasted better anyway. The brie did not seem fresh or very good and the carrot soup was bleakly sweet. I'm not one to criticize too often, but I was disappointed by Caf√© Henri's attempt at French food.
