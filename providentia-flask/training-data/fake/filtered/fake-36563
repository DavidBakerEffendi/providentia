I'll make this short and sweet and preface it by saying that I'm a BBQ fanatic.  I've had BBQ in Texas on several occasions, which is why I was so looking forward to this meal.  Lucky for Monica, they ran out of brisket and ribs, because that's my beef(no pun intended).  The BBQ needs help folks... The ribs had more bone and fat than meat.  The brisket was very tough.... Brisket smoked right should never be tough.  The sausage was smoked way too long and was dry inside.  I watched their video about their trip to TX and how they would not open up until they "get it right", well they didn't.  If you only have five main items on your menu, you better nail them all. On a better note, the Mac and cheese, very good, the greens, very good, and desserts, very good.
