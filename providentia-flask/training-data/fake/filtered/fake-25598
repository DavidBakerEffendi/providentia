Gluten Free Avenger here to say the day!  Dah-duh-DAHHH!!!!   I'm here to tell you this place rocks.  It has many glluten free things on the menu.  I mean like a LOT! Me and my friend came thereSunday for brunch.  We both ordered soemthing called __SOMETHING__ Benny.  It was way yummy, hollandaise sauce and all (GF).  And there was a cobbler/crumble thing for dessert?  It was excellent.  As was their coffee.  They have almond milk creamer as well which I appreciated cause I recently got gluten poisoning at another restaurant in San Francisco three weeks ago and now eating dairy is not so pleasant of an experience. The food here is so good thar your non-GF friends will love it too.  They have many gluteny options for them.   They also have Daura GF beer!   The Gluten-Free Avenger pronounces this joint an A+.  First because it's just an A+ and second because it's near impossible to get GF in New York City.  For reasons that aren't clear.  One lady from a different food estabishment in NYC said, when I asked for gluten free, "Oh no all our stuff has the full sugar and fat!"  This is what we're dealing with.   I'd like to go back there for lunch right now but they don't open weekdays before 4p.
