I am absolutely in love! The atmosphere is laid back and relaxing, the owner is friendly and makes you feel at home ! First things first drinks are amazing! It's been a while since someone made me a good drink and let me tell you I had both the Grinch and the PomPom cocktails! Highly recommend ! Now the biggie! The turkey duck chicken meatballs are the bomb! And the hanger steak is the way to go! Everything is beautiful in appearance and taste amazing! One mistake I made unfortunately I didn't listen to the trio option of desserts ! 3 for $10 and it would of been worth it! 10 stars!
