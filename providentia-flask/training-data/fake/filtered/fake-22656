Arrived before 8:00 pm on a tuesday night and the place was crowded as hell. Was told it was a 45 min. wait so we snagged the table up front, ordered a beer and glass of wine and then was seated 5 min later. Not bad, although wasn't able to sit out back, which is what everyone seemed to be waiting for.  Ordered meatballs and gnocchi and split both, neither was great or terrible, just blah. The crostinni came after the entrees were placed down which was kind of weird, and we never got water, even though everyone around us was being refilled every minute. People around us were having long dinners but ours seemed rushed and nobody checked on us until after we finished, and finally got water. Was it because we didnt order a bottle of wine? So sue me, I had beer. All in all, not up to the hype. Something funny though was a lady who walked in and while everyone was waiting for a table,  ordered a bottle of wine to "drink out back, " because "she was a regular." If you have to tell the bartender you're a regular, you're probably not. Then she paid and said "Brilliant".  Yuck.
