I took my son back to Thomas Jefferson U. today and he suggested that we eat here; he has many times.  We both had the Betty Burger medium rare (his recommendation) and a Stella Artois.  The Betty Burger is ridiculously delicious...and very messy; but that's ok.  Honestly the best burger I've ever eaten. Will definitely consume one again!!
