I am a regular at this place.  The fellow just says sees me and says Hello and tells the guys what to make.  The food is tasty and authentic and full of flavor.  The shawarma is delicious and unmatched anywhere else I've had shawarma.  The falafel is hot and fresh.The nut-covered filo dessert is delicious and fragrant with honey.  The prices have risen over the years ($12 for a platter of shawarma), but the quality, taste and service are all high.  On a rare occasion I noticed the tahini sauce had a less-than-fresh after-taste, but remember: I eat there A LOT.
