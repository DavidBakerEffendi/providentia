I don't know why they are proud of themselves.... Taste is not that special, and amount of each foods is a little bit.... And I don't know Maybe I had a bad luck but, the they are so rude... I didn't feel any motivation from them to take care of us. So, I didn't pay a lot of tip for them, but when we left, they asked us to pay more... Â I wanna pay tip, when I am satisfied. So, anyway, to me Totto is suck!!!!
