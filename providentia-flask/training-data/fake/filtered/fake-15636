My friend introduced me to this restaurant in our neighborhood, and I have been back 5 or 6 times this summer! I love the place. It's comfortably dark in there at night, with little glowing candles. I always try to sit in the garden. The waitstaff is friendly, and the food is delicious! My favorites? The lamb burger is juicy. It comes smeared with a feta-yogurt sauce and perfectly salted, crispy fries, with a ribboned cucumber salad on the side. I also recommend the mussels. For dessert you must try the Earl Grey Creme Brulee. I've never tasted anything like it.
