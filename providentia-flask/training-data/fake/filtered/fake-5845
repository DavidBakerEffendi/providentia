We went last Saturday, on a really chilly evening.  The service and food were excellent, although they did run out of my first choice for main course.  I had the short ribs which were divine.  The cocktails and wine were very good. The physical environment for our dinner, not so good. Presumably because it was busy, we were seated in the bar area and for starters, it was FREEZING (they did eventually turn more heat on, but we were both shivering).  The biggest issue though was that they put us at a table that was just too small for two people to dine comfortably.  We had to juggle menus on our laps, move our water bottle and glasses around to get to the olives & nuts we ordered to go with the drinks, juggle wine glasses and bread plates... it was just plain awkward.  These tables must be meant for tapas or bistro food, not a full dinner.  When we go out, we like to chat and enjoy and it's tough to do that when you're so squinched you're worried about knocking something over the entire time.   Although it was in other respects really nice, and a big improvement over the old Wine Press, I wouldn't go back there unless they could guarantee a more comfortable table.
