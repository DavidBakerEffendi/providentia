Always looking for decent places to eat in the West Village/Union Square area, a friend introduced me to this Cuban diner. Though it is open 24/7, the food did not disappoint at all! I came here on a Saturday in the late afternoon with a couple of friends, among them a Mexican and a Puerto Rican who gave a thumbs up to their sweet plaintains! If you're looking for a heartier dish, try the ropa vieja.... delicious slow cooked beef! I ordered the ceviche limeno, which was a bit too tangy for me. If you're not feeling the Latin vibe, there are decent basic breakfast choices served all day. Friendly and attentive staff, very affordable, sanitary, nice decor, no wait time for us, and best of all, open all day & night!
