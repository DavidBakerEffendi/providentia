I hosted a surprise 30th birthday party for my boyfriend and City Tap House was the 2nd stop on our tour.  My original plan was to stay for 2 hours and I had a fire pit reserved outside for that time.  The party planner, Jessica M., was amazing.  So accommodating and helpful.  She setup the reservationand included some drink specials for our group.  When we got there, however, the service was not good.  In addition to taking a long time to take our order and get our drinks, they would not serve the guest of honor due to him being visibly intoxicated.  We were reprimanded for being too close to another party, but the people in another group that took up 1/2 of one of our tables were not told to move.  The manager was not helpful or apologetic at all and we left as soon as we could get our bill, which was not an easy process either. All said and done, the atmosphere here is great, but there are too many inconveniences that inhibit you from enjoying it.  I was very disappointed with my experience and wish I had not included this bar in the party agenda.
