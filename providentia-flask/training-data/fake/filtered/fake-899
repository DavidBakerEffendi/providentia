Great restaurant. They have two menus - one standard chinese fare and one Taiwanese. The chinese stuff is good, but the Taiwanese is GREAT! I work next door and have sampled many of the dishes. The lady who runs is is super sweet and I am consistently impressed by the quality of this place. It would be an easy 5 stars if they took credit cards. They are set up cash only for now. Â Hope that changes soon.
