I like to order specials in places like this as they are usually something fresh and different.  Linguine with clams sounded good.  It was a rather good dinner but nothing spectacular (home made pasta with 9 clams).  I did not ask the price but was surprised it was $27 when the check came, which puts it as one of the most expensive items on the menu.. I feel this was way overpriced and they did me a disservice by not stating the price when they went over the specials.  Not sure I will come back
