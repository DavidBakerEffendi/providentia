Just opened and stumbled upon it by accident .. grab some lunch (fish and chips) and a beer and it was delicious! the happy hour was great w/ cheap drinks and cool people. i hear the night life hasn't picked up yet but the place is gorgeous and just needs to catch on . .it used to be Doyle's corner but the owners gave it a well needed makeover, it could be the best looking irish bar in philadelphia, seriously! Kitchen is now open till midnight on the weekends and Thursday nights which is a wonderful!!
