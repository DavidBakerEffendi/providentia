Went today for the first time, and love this place.  Adorable spot, adorable block.  Am a big fan of University Falafel on 12th and University, but it's closed early on Fridays, so I tried Taim.  Perfect falafel.  "Flavors" without being ridiculous and trendy, perfect seasoning and garnishes (I asked them to add pickles, which they graciously did).  Super nice staff.  Cozy and lively place.  Eat-in is just a handful of bar-style perimeter seats, but was fine for a quick bite.  Looking forward to going back for the somewhat overpriced but lauded Date-Banana-Lime smoothie.  And that will be soon.  Love!
