Disappointed with their service after two & half years of giving them my business. I should have gotten a divorce from cafe George long time ago but glutton for punishment I stayed. Finally, I have to verbalized my issues, they have Â specials listed and when I call to order they say rudely we don't have it & this happened on multiple occasions. How can stuff be out when you open at 7am and I ordered it at 8:00am & no it's not muffins or bagel or anything that people can order in bulk but home fries. I have no problem paying for convenience, no issues with them misspelling my name, no issues with their inconsistency with food whether it be bone in the Turkey sandwich or wilted salad or many more issues with the food. What I CANNOT stand is mental abuse specially RUDENESS..., I am NEVER going back to Cafe George, I would rather walk 30 miles in the snow then go back to that place. We are OVER cafe George...
