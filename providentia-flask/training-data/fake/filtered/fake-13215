No excuse for a dirty restaurant.  Ate there recently  food was good however I looked up at the ceiling and saw the air vents which were loaded with dust. Just imagine all those dust mites falling down into your food. You have a great business, Raymonds, but it might be time to do a little housecleaning. Look around at your ceilings and walls. Maybe it's time for Robert Irvine to come and visit.
