On 2/2/14 I wrote a review about Taylor's Tap and Grill and was looking at it today and learned my review was taken down. I noticed that all the bad reviews are left up and none of the good ones. This is wrong and how can any business get a review if all they keep up are all the negative ones. I for one am pissed. In my option why should any trust this web site. Abby B.
