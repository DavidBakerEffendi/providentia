Found Joe's Shanghai on yelp. It's trully as good as it gets. It's located on a side street in China Town and we got there late only to find a 45 minute wait. I am glad we decided to wait, because we had the best chinese food I've ever had. I had the braised pork which I saw some one else at our table order. This is a house specialty which is a must order. My friend ordered general tsao's chicken which I thought was stupid to order in such a place. To my surprise it was by far and away the best I've ever had. cash only, group seating, so so decor, out of this world food
