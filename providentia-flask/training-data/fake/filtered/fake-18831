I went with 2 vegetarian friends and they were VERY pleased with the food choices and the quality of their meals.  I tasted their "mock meats" and was really impressed with them.  I had hot and sour soup that was excellent and a chicken dish that was also excellent.  I no longer live in Philly but would absolutely recommend this spot and would go back again.
