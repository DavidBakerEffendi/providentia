Always deliver so I can only review the delivery guys. Always a pleasure. I am a good tipper 30%+. All I can say is:: Buffalo Chicken Cheesesteak with Buffalo Sauce and Blue Cheese Swirl. Bread isn't like NYC, however its always fresh and fits the area. Location might be hard to find if you are not a resident of PBoro, I HAVE seen frequent accidents at the corner, always stop or yield even if you think you can go.
