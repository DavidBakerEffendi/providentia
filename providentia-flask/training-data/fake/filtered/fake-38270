I'm a true believer in giving credit where credit is due and the Hidden Vine did everything right last night. Our server was knowledgeable about the food and wine and made some solid recommendations. We started with the bacon wrapped, Gorgonzola stuffed dates (AMAZING), moved onto the strawberry/pear salad (very good but the raspberry dressing was a bit too sweet for me). When we were halfway thru the apps, our waitress returned with apologies from the kitchen; they were out of the salmon my dinner companion had ordered. Normally a huge faux pas in my book but they recovered well. Not only did she bring a sampling of paia to taste when he considered ordering that as replacement but she returned ten minutes later with a complimentary appetizer from the chef... four wild mushroom ravioli topped with shrimp. The pasta dinners were tasty and plenty for two meals. We ordered an oreo mousee pie to go and Â let me tell you, what a great way to end the night. It's nice to see a restaurant getting it right. We'll definitely be back.
