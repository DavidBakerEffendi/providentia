Meh. After reading and hearing a ton of hype about the Village Whiskey burger and duck fat fries, my husband and I ventured out of South Philly to try it out. We were super lucky and excited to find two open bar seats without having to wait an hour. When I asked the bar tender if the burger came with fries, he laughed and said that other restaurants only do that as "filler food" and that we'd have to order them on the side, they're just that good. And that the burger is so amazing that you don't need fries. We thought "fair enough, must be good." We got our burger and the fries. At best, the burger was mediocre. It was juicy and on a nice bun, but otherwise a very expensive ordinary burger. The fries were also pretty standard. There were few and they were presented nicely in a little cup, but pretty standard. While we were full at the end of our meal and it wasn't terrible, it was just average at best. The bartender was a bit cocky about the food which also was a big turn-off. I'd rather head back to our hood at Royal Tavern for a delicious, juicy and flavorful burger + plate of fries for less than half the cost.
