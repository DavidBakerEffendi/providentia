The first thing I notice is the atmosphere, but it's the last thing I care about. Efficient wait system, put you name on the list hanging at the door. Open cooking area that gives you a good look at the big vat of fresh chicken broth being made and roast pork being seared in front of you. Nice. The kitchen is small but they turn out the bowls fast. I ordered the Chicken Paitan Ramen For a chicken broth, this was excellent. Just the right fatty content for a chicken broth. There was some rice floating around, which was just weird and distracting. The pork was good, but could have been a little more moist. Searing shouldn't dry it out, such is the point of searing. There was a good fat content though, so that saved it a bit. The noodles were very good. Cooked just right, they start out a little hard, but that what you want. Quickly they start soaking up the broth and get perfect. If the start out soft, they are a soggy mess by the end. The seasoned egg was excellent, but should be served as two halves. Also, you need to order it as an extra, it doesn't come standard. At $10 a bowl, it should be included. Boo. Service was attentive. Rating: Will definitely be back. Hopefully they'll have a pork broth for the fall. nycramenaddict.blogspot.â€¦
