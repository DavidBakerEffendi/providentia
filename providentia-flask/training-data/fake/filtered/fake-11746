Sultan Wok is awful. The Customer Service is awful. The lady who answers the phone and takes your order is nasty and rude. I been there many times and I see how she hands everyone else money back in their hands. But if your of color she places it down on the counter after you gave it to her in her hand. I been to many Chinese places and never seen such. I give them two thumbs down.
