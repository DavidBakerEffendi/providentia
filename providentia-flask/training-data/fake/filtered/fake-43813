Landmarc has been one of my favorite restaurants in NYC for the past 6 years.  For the 4 years I lived in Tribeca I would go weekly.  However, my most recent two trips to Landmarc have been disappointing.  The service was off, our steak and burger (both of which are usually amazing) were lacking flavor, and other dishes were just weaker than usual.  I'm hoping this is just a fluke because I really do love it here, but my fear is that it's not what it used to be...
