A longtime JC favorite. Real Italian cuisine , vareity of tasty pies, decent prices, and a big menu ! U can order delivery or eat meals in there dining room (no slices in the dining room). Â This IS a Jersey pizzeria !! Only complient is sometimes there delivery can take over an hr, esp on wkends or big game days. Otherwise a quality establisment !
