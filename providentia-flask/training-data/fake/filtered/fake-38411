Yay, a Japanese restaurant where I leave feeling FULL without spending a fortune!  i've been here for both lunch and dinner, and both times, I left full and satisfied.  I love their hot egg custard - it's so soft that you have to slurp it.  They even have spicy stews akin to Korean kimchee and doobu chigae - my first time from a Japanese resto - and though it was too salty, it did have a lot of flavor. And the decor is modern and airy, kind of fancy, without being at all stuffy or too cold. Caution:  they are nazi about not allowing drinks from outside - I had to chug down my iced coffee at the door (from home, in a small, plain, generic cup - wasn't even splashed with big logos from you-know-where).
