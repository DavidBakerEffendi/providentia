I don't give 5-stars unless it's ridiculous. Perhaps I have no 5-stars unless I'm pumping some establishment that I really enjoy, and believe they are not getting the appropriate kudos due to ignorance. In the case of Â The "Minetta Tavern," I'll keep it simple. It met my expectations and the hype. That's impressive. Great Drinks, and fairly reasonable. $14 for a Hendricks Gin Martini. (Not bad for one of the hotter places in NY.) It was prepared w/ style by Frankie. Seriously. As busy as he is, he's a consummate professional. I stood witness. He made every cocktail with the same care and panache. Food: I had to have it, since I was dining solo. G-friend wouldn't "get" a $26 B.L. Burger, so it was my opportunity to sneak one in "Me Belly." I'll share the bad boy steak and marrow for two, the next time we're in town together. (Lots of kudos for the red meat that was in abundance about the premises, making one's colon a bit nervous for the future... too bad...) Back to the burger. It hit the marks, seriously. The purity of flavor, crust on the meat (chewy, lovely bits), caramelized onions and complimentary bun (all w/out any added condiment---okay to add the lettuce/tom/pickle at times) (It would be a sin to add ketchup and mustard, seriously.) I did get the cheese on it, and swiped half of it off one side of my burger so that I could try it the way "both" chefs like it. I'm in the middle on cheese debate, but the cheese that was swiped that dripped onto the fries, oh yeah,--all good. I'd do it the same, all over again. Great burger. None better in my lifetime, thus far. It was worth every dollar. Plus, the Minetta Tavern is a good NY experience. Dig in. Work, Drink, Eat, Love. They have your back--and they're worth every buck. I'll be back. TheBC
