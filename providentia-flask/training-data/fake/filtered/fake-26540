I just bought two dinners to go and paid $35.   When I got home the amount of food in each was a pittance!  Very disappointing and not a good value.  The injera (ethiopian bread) was not authentic as it was made with flour.  The food tastes good but the whole experience seems to be tailored to less well informed population.  For good authentic ethiopian food and reasonable price got to NYC or DC!
