I love sushi and go to different restaurants all the time. The sushi at Sushi King by far my favorite. The sushi is fresh and I love their rolls, for example the Pink Lady Roll. They have a pretty hot menu and I am planning on trying the all-you-can-eat next time which is very tempting to me after seeing what they have on that menu. The service was nice and the price was fair. They interior was nice. Hope to get back their soon
