Contrary to other experiences at other establishments, even when this place is packed wall to wall, I always receive top notch service from the manager, to the bartender, to the servers. I have nothing but positive experiences with the food as well. Regardless, this place gets packed early, so get there quickly, and be ready for a solid evening of good beer and great food. Finally, the eclectic mix of hipsters, wookies, professionals, and families always makes for a good time of conversation.
