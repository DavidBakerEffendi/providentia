So myself and my wife stopped by this bar the other night. What a Good choice!! The atmosphere was wonderful..good music and the food was really good!!We had a great time!!!! Taco Tuesday was alright with me.. .tacos for a $1 simply brilliant., how could you go wrong with tacos and coronas. I had a deep fried hotdog with kraut and mustard that was amazing. Rugs and Riffys is a great place to go to unwind and not put a dent to your wallet..
