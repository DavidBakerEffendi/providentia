My friend said it's not the worst food ever, but I beg to differ. The chef must have tipped over the salt jar and infused all dishes with saline solution. Even mac and cheese had an exuberant amount of salt. This restaurant will receive no star and no love from me. On a good note: The waitress was perky and friendly. Ps: They don't take AmEx.
