Sidecar, oh sidecar.. what would I do with out you? I have fallen in love with a bar, and it's name is sidecar. I find myself coming to sidecar to start my night, and typically to end my night. The best is the outdoor seating during the summer- you all should check it before the cold weather creeps up. Their bugers are tasty, as are their chili, salads, nachos, and so on and so fort. This is a great place to go solo, with friends or on a date. The staff is always so friendly, and the food is mouth watering (and affordable!).
