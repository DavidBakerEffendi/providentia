NEVER again will return - Sick twice as a result of meals at Hearth! One year ago, I went to Hearth for dinner with my husband. I threw up all night as a result. My husband convinced me that this must have been a stomach bug, and NOT Hearth's food. This time, my husband is eating his words - and not much else! He has been sick all night and day from our return to Hearth. I had a bum stomach all morning too - probably a result of trying his meal. On top of this, the service was SLOW and the restaurant was HOT! Â  We've learned our lesson with this place!
