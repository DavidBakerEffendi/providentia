This place is very high priced. The activity wall when you walk in is always broken and the mining for gold is broken also. The laser tag is something you could make in your basement with old and out dated equipment. It does not even compare to laser quest. Arcade games are the Same as when they opened. The other activity are alway closed or broken . Nomads what a joke maybe good for 1 visit but I still feel like I am being ripped off.
