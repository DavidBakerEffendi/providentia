Okay, so food was alright, but the service? Horrible! I walked in here to have no one greet me, no one to check on how the food was after it was served, and then had to wait nearly 20 minutes after finishing my food for the bill to come!! Is this normal for this place? Went here twice, each time with terrible experiences
