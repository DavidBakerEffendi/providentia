This review is way overdue.  I have been going to Catahoula's for the past 3 years and the food and service are always great.  I always get the hush puppies, mac and cheese balls, stuffed burger, and bread pudding and everything is always delicious.  The chef is always pleasant and comes out to ensure everything is to our liking. Thank Catahoula, I will be seeing you soon!
