I went into Munchy's in Wayne for the first time yesterday.  I ordered the Royal Flush and it was better than I had heard! My girlfriend ordered the grilled chicken wrap and said it was delicious.  The staff is very friendly and the place is very clean.  When we left the staff asked us how was everything and wished us a good day.  I will definately be back! They also deliver so that is very convenient!
