I have been a patron for 14 years and it gets better all the time. I AM WRITING THIS BECAUSE JERRY IS ONE OF THE BEST CHEFS THAT I KNOW. His also a great person which is evident from the loyalty of his patrons AND EMPLOYEES. The quality of the ingredients and the style of preparation makes all the difference and puts this place FAR above the other restaurants in the area if not all of Bucks county and for that matter most of Philadelphia. Just look at ther specials taht rival ANY top restaurant Â you know. We are lucky to have this in our own backyard. It is snowing like crazy but I am still going there to pick up an order that I know will be OVER THE TOP! Did I mention the homemade rolls?.....
