COME HERE IF YOU LIKE TO GET INSULTED AND TO LEARN SOME THAI CURSE WORDS. We came here on our memorial day vacation. We came here at around 3:00pm. I asked the guy at the front desk if they were still serving lunch. He said YES. Me and my family came in and got seated. We ordered 2 lunch specials. After the food arrived we realized that the quantity of 2 dishes was barely enough for one person. The pad thai shrimp had one shrimp and the chicken was hidden under the pile of vegetables. We asked the server to get the menu and he responded that we have to order from the dinner menu since it was close to 4. I said we are already here and are in the middle of the meal, besides its close to 3:30 and not 4. He said he will check with his boss. The boss came with the menu with an attitude, rolled her eyes and said she was doing us a favor by allowing us to order from the lunch menu in her thai accent. She may have cursed when she left. We ordered one more dish. While we were eating our last dish, the boss came right back with our check and said we should finish quickly since the dinner quests are coming. The place was EMPTY. There was one couple besides us. I paid her promptly but did not give her a tip. She then came right back and rudely asked me why I did not pay any TIP. I told her TIP is for customer service, not to be treated like beggars. She said I did you a favor by allowing to order from lunch menu.  I told her I don't want to argue with her. I just wanted to finish my food and leave as fast as we can. While we were leaving I could hear the boss and the waiter murmuring (cursing).  NEVER EVER WILL I COME HERE OR RECOMMEND ANYONE TO COME HERE. THERE IS THAI PLACE ON EVERY CORNER OF THIS STREET. IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF RESPECT AVOID THIS PLACE EVEN IF THEY ARE SERVING FREE FOOD AND YOU HAVE BEEN STARVING.
