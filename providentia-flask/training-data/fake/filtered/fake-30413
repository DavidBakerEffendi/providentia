My husband and I were intrigued by a newspaper review of The Kitchen Table and decided to try it for dinner. We were attracted by the commitment to using sustainable/local food.  We had an early reservation on a Thursday and the restaurant was empty.  My husband ordered the fish and chips (fish with tiny potatoes) which he liked but he was disappointed with the aioli which tasted like mayo.  I had the bell pepper stuffed with barley.  The red pepper was huge but there was not enough stuffing for the pepper size and the barley was very bland. The salt I added gave it some flavor.  We shared the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  It was rich with a good chocolate taste but kind of dry and crumbly.       We like the decor, service and use of locally sourced foods, but the food needs some attention in order to make this restaurant a destination.  They have a lot of competition in New Haven.
