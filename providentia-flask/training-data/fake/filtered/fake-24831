So I have been frequenting this awesome Brauhaus and have been lucky enough to be served a few times by a authentic Bavarian Queen, by the name of Hannah, whose last name is also the name of the place, go figure. BEST waitress service EVER. Some places are just meant to rock, and this is one of them. Â Don't forget your stein, you will need it.
