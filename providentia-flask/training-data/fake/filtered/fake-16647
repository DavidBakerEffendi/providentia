Food was alright, however,  $10 cover charge for music is unfair when you are dining in.- a $60 for a family of  6 paid for cover charge.   When complained about it to the manager, he was quite rude and hangup the phone on face. Manager or owner (not quite sure) has no business ethics.  I DO NOT recommend this restaurant.
