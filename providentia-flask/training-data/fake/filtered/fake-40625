their pizza always comes out soggy and cold. ALWAYS. i love pizza so even soggy and cold is fine but when i'm seated at a restaurant getting fresh made pizza right away i expect it to me at least not cold.  and because it's always packed i always feel rushed to finish eating. and this is probably why the pizza never gets hot enough. they're too concerned with table turn-over.   always disappointed even though i want to so love their pizza.
