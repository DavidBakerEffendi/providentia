We have visited this place a few times, and liked the food and service, but the last visit was unpleasant. Longer than usual wait and we had to ask for a change in the table as they tried to sit 7 of us in a smaller table. One of the margaritas we ordered was served with a dead fly. No, it wasn't a Spanish Fly. See description for Sp Fly if you need to learn more. I would think twice before visiting again. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spâ€¦
