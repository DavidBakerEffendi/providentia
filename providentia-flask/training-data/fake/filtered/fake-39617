If you are in Philly, do yourself a HUGE favor by heading to the terminal, deal with a long line and get yourself one of DiNic's sandwhiches/hoagies. It's just heavenly but unless you got an unwordly appetite- share!! They are humongous!! They do have long lines, but it moves pretty quick. There is bar seating as well as many seats in the Reading Terminal. DiNic's is a MUST - I would drive to Philly just for them.
