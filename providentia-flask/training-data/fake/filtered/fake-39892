Wife and I visited The Skinny P on a North American trip. Staff was a rude weird bearded dude who might be an owner. I've had crepes in the past but mine was horrible. I'd hate to waste food but I had a hard time eating the undercooked wet pillow.     And how long does a crepe take to prepare? Not 30 minutes! Wife was unhappy with her "edible arrangement" and couldn't finish hers. Luckily we hit the road and found a real breakfast establishment with realistic prices.
