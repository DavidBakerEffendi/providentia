Got there late on a cold Thursday night.  Got ribs and pulled pork platters between two of us.  Sides included mac and cheese, collard greens, stewed tomatoes with green beans. Everything was fresh with fall off-the-bones ribs and moist pulled pork.  I'm a fan of Carolina sauces and wasn't sure about the house sauces.  Turns out they are perfect for the style of ribs and pork (mustard being a favorite of mine).  This is not BBQ of simple enthusiast, these guys know that they are doing. I did not try the collard greens, but mac and cheese is really good, but what impressed me was the stewed tomatoes and green beans which was a true delight. My biggest fear for this place is the fact that it is in NJ.  NJ does not understand or appreciate good BBQ.  I've seen several southern BBQ places open and close in NJ.  I'm hoping this is an exception.  Fingers crossed. I look forward to lunches.
