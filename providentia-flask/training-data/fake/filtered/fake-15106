i've been in nyc for vacation and have eaten at Risotteria 3 times. each time we were seated immediately, once for lunch and twice for dinner. the staff was very helpful in helping me find which risotto to order to ensure it was gluten free and dairy free. it's not horribly expensinve considering everything is cooked to order and the portions are quite generous. i had the risotto cooked vegetarian style (to ensure dairy free) with chicken, roasted red peppers and kalamata olives...delicious every time! unfortunately, i was not able to try the famous breadsticks since they are not dairy free but my family told me they were delicious. They also enjoyed their dinners that were not GF.
