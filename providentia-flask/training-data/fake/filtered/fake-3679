Now that Villa Barone has been bought out by the original head waiter and chef, the place is a joy to go to!  The food has always been fantastic, service as well, but you were unfortunately never sure what type of mood the old owner was in and how it was going to affect your meal.  The owners now, we consider friends and whenever we get a night free of the kids, this is where we go!  The food is fantastic, especially the bread!  Each meal comes with salad which I find so rare these days and it's a decent portion and always good.  I love their dressing!  The chicken and veal is always tender.  Try to save room for dessert because their tiramisu is out of this world.  Anyone who was turned off by the old owners really should give it another shot.  The menu is the same, same recipes as it's the same chef but the ownership is 100 times better than before and it's quite obvious!
