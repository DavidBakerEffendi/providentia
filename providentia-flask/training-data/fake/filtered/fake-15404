I' ve been wanting to try this restaurant for a while now and last week I had the chance to go. My sister was here for the weekend so I thought it was the perfect place to enjoy a nice dinner. The place is amazing, so cozy and the food is unbelievable. Â Though they dont have the liquor license yet, the food and the ambience is so worth it. My sister and I had the parrillada for 2 with rib eye, short ribs and chorizo. Sooooo good!!!!!For dessert I had the panqueque, a caramel and banana crepe..... the best dessert I've ever had!!! Im sooooooooo going back again, cant wait for the backyard and the liquor license.
