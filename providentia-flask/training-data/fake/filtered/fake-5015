Here are.... Very very delicious BBQ and my favorite tofu soup Best thing is I can choose kinds of tofu....kimchi , dumpling, pork, seafood, and so on... This place is awesome!!!!!! Lovely service, moderate sound control & deco. Relatively inexpensive compared with steak house,too , not bad.... I'm definitely going back there again!!!!!
