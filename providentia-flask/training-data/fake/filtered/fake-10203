I am a big fan of Zinc's.  I go for what is local on the menu  'cuz I love knowing my dollars are making a difference here where I live. The other night I sat at the bar.  The bartender started telling me how much she likes working at Zinc which of course impressed me more.  At the end of my meal she brought me a most delicious raspberry and white chocolate dessert...rounding out a near perfect experience.  I think anyone would like this place.
