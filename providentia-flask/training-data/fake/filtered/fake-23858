Two of my closest friends and I went to Sampan for dinner.  Usually, I steer clear of Asian fusion because of some very bad food allergies.  This type of menu is a minefield for me.  I am happy to report that not only did I made it through the evening without a medical disaster, we had a great time. The bar serves some really exotic drinks that both my friends consumed with relish.  Our handsome waiter steered us through the menu and made several great suggestions that we all enjoyed.  If there was one drawback, it was that the menu is so varied (and a bit pricey) that you can easily mix too many flavors together at once.  Overall, a great place the I would definitely recommend visiting with your friends.
