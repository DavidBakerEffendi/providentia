I've been here three times with my bro and thought I should finally write a review. This place has some of the best service and food in Williamsburg. The staff is very knowledgeable and friendly (which is hard in Williamsburg, I always feel like the pple (who are normally hipsters) who work at these establishments have an air of superiority and no personality, but not here. The food quality is superb. Each time I have went the food has tasted so fresh and cooked to perfection. There was a minor mishap, where they brought out the wrong plates of food, and it was handled very nicely. The menu changes, but whatever they have will not disappoint you. I love this place and hope it continues to deliver the goods!
