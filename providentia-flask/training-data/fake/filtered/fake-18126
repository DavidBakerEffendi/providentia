Gorgerous seating for small and large parties.  music could"ve been louder but then again not everyone is open to greek music.  ( I am not greek i just enjoy the ambiance) Wonderful wait staff, who are bountiful in knowledge of the ingredients. Special Occasion yes.  A regular place for me no, very expensive.   Food was amazing
