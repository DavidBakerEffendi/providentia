The food is alright. I like the presentation of the foods but not the taste - most of the dishes are either oily or salty. I can see they try to be creative about the presentation. While comparing the food, interior and the service with other restaurants in the area, the price is too high. You can get better quality food, similar or better presentation, and nicer atmosphere in the area with less money paid. The waiters are sort of clueless. They messed up our orders and didn't deliver two of the dishes we ordered. They were tried to convinced us for foods which we never seen ... we had to insist on having them check back their computers and notes and finally got the food...
