Great space for hanging out with friends. Food is delicious and unique. Music is great and beers are on point! I read the reviews on this place and people really don't give it enough credit. Yea, they serve nuts in bags. Get over it. It's not 11 mad.it's a swanky east village joint. Would def make this spot a regular. Duck salad and lamb breast in beans is the best!
