Came out for restaurant week... Enjoyed some Monday night Jazz in Bushnell Park and dinner at Hot Tomatoes. What a nice night out. We ate on the patio. Enjoyed the garlic bread, rigatoni bolognese, and wonderful berries and biscuit for dessert. My table-mates enjoyed fried calamari and the garden vegetable lasagna. Our server did a great job, really nice night out for some great food
