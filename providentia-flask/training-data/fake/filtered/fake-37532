My husband and I went in on Sunday afternoon for lunch.  We sat at one of the bar tables.   The bar tender waited on us.  My husband ordered two appetizers, a salad and pork with figs as his meal and  I ordered the pork sandwich with broccoli rabe. We told him to bring everything at once.  My husbands two appetizers came and he said mine would be right out.  10 minutes later I asked where my sandwich was and he came back 2-3 mins later with it.  It was obvious they made the mistake of putting appetizers out first, but he didn't even apologize - said nothing.  My husband was just about done eating when my sandwich arrived.  My sandwich was good.  But the fries it came with had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.  When he asked how everything was I told him the sandwich was good but the fries were old and I said - "these weren't made fresh" and he said - "oh yes they were, he just made them".  Come on, everybody knows what fresh fries taste like and what warmed fries taste like.  Why did he have to lie.  I know it was a Sunday lunch and the place wasn't busy but if i can't get good service and fresh quality food at the lunch prices, I am certainly not going back for the hefty dinner prices.
