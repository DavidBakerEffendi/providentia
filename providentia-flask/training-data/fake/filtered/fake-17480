After reading all the great reviews I decided to check this place out. What a disappointment. The food is just not that great..its not even good. Yes, the interior is fantastic, it has a great vibe, the service was ok. Visually, the food looks great. it is artistically presented fit for a magazine. But for me it when it came down to taste...it just doesn't cut it. I tried 5 different dishes and each one ranged from mediocre to disappointing. It seems to me the chefs are more concerned on presentation rather than taste. The mix of ingredients do not compliment each other. I found the produce to be lacking and not as fresh as one might expect for the price.
