Fabulous find on a very cold night in February.  Delicious Italian food (though we were expecting Hungarian based on its name).  Cozy dining room, lovely service and very reasonably priced, quality food.  The eggplant appetizer was out of this world. I'm still thinking about it!  The lovely waitress even gave us $5 worth of quarters so we could jump on the bus going uptown.  Highly recommend!
