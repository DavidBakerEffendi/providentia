I hadn't been here for a while, but I always enjoyed it. This time was sort of mediocre. Our server had a very nice personality and was attentive. She did not know what the drink was that my husband ordered, and when it arrived, it was ok, but not what it should have been. The bread and oil was very good. I ordered a pasta dish and my husband ordered a pizza. His was very good and mine was average. My issue was that we ordered a carafe of house wine. We poured it into our glasses and had a few sips...tasted fine (I had had a glass before getting the carafe). I looked at my glass and the carafe and it had "stuff" floating in it.....a fair amount. I thought it looked like herbs and thought that maybe they used the carafes to mix the salad dressing. We waited, but finally told the server. She said it was the cork..(I drink wine regularly and it was not the cork...there were curly pieces of something in there)...they asked if we wanted another, but we were pretty turned off at that point and just asked them to remove it from the bill. The manager came over and said that maybe it was grated cheese, which made sense as it sort of looked like it and it rolled up and disintegrated in my fingers. They took it off the bill and apologized, but really didn't seem very concerned. It was ok, but I really probably will not go back there- something was off.....
