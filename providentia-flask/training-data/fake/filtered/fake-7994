I have frequented this establishment a few times in the last two years.  A dear friend of mine loves it for whatever reason.  The food is decent and plentiful.  The Italian dishes are of northern Italian cuisine which is ok but they could do more with dishes which call for sauce or gravy as we call it being from the Newark area.  the major problem is as follows:  Parking is awful, the restaurant itself should think of relocating  to the Franklin Ave area of Nutley, because the place is way too small and decor terrible.  Lastly, as a frequent customer, I had a bad experience a week ago.  I had reservations for 7:00PM on a Saturday evening.  I had been 15 minutes late due to locating a parking space near the restaurant.  The receptionist gave my table to another patron despite my plea about the lack of parking.  There was no apology or offering of a drink on the house or a small consideration off the billing.  This ends my future visits to this place.  Oh lastly, if your known to the establishment or a friend of the staff you get preferential treatment.  Definitely not a smart or wise way to do business on their part...   Bob B Nutley, NJ
