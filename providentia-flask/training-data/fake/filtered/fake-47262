Went to dinner at Luca's and it was amazing.  The service was excellent and our server, Nick, was very attentive, knowledgeable and very pleasant.  The night began with a bread basket of HOT assorted homemade breads... All were excellent.  Appetizers for 4 of us were excellent, making it difficult to chose a favorite.  The excellence didn't end there appetizers were followed by an assortment of entrees - we all chose pasta dishes.  EXCELLENT.  Coffee, dessert and house Limoncello followed.  Hats off to the staff, the Chef, and bakery chef!  Will definitely return.
