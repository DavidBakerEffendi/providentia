This spot is a neighborhood gem.  Understated decor and a solid menu of comfort food.  We started off with the biscuits, which were delicious: warm, crispy on the outside and tasted buttery fresh.  The Dr. Pepper ribs small plate was even better.  The sauce was tasty but not overpowering so you could still taste the perfectly cooked meat.  I fell in love when I bit into the meatloaf sandwich.  It looks huge when it comes out of the kitchen and is very filling, but doesn't make you feel heavy afterwords.  The meatloaf is wrapped in bacon, with lettuce, chipotle sauce and mashed potatoes in between two slices of bread.  Divine.  Dessert was fresh strawberries, blueberries, cream and fried dough.  While I didn't get any daily servings of vegetables in, I enjoyed every bite. The best part, however, was the staff.  Everyone was friendly, helpful and seemed to love being there.  I'll definitely go back.
