Paisano's has been my favorite restaurant in Bergen County for a long time. It has a nice atmosphere, with very fine dining. You can choose from many hors d'eouvres when you get there. For entrees I usually get Potato Gnocchi in a Bolognese sauce. They hand you bread at the start, and I'd say it is 5 stars.
