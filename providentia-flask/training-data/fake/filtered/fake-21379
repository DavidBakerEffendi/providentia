Food, winr and service were excellent - especially mac and cheese.  Unfortunately the place is small and seating is cramped.  The place is taken over by a proprietary group of neighborhood regulars on a nightly basis - makes it hard to find a seat and hear over the roar of self involved Upper Eastsiders.
