Every dish is a work of art! I   held a party for my daughter's baby shower. I've enjoyed the delicious, fresh and creative food twice before-- but I t wondered if cooking for 40 people might be a challenge to this hidden gem of a restaurant.. The chef /owner of this authentic, family run restaurant helped planned a great menu for me.  Well, after the party,  I got so many wonderful compliments from my 40 guests. Everyone raved about the delicious salmon, chicken with a light goat cheese sauce, and  the unique desert that the chef made special for us was, It was a twist on a cannoli that was beautiful to look at and tasted like heaven.  The service was great, the staff was kind and attentive, and the party was a big success.  It was amazing how every dish was perfect , even with cooking for such a large group.  I highly recommend Malagueta to anyone who enjoys creative, flavorful food that is out of the ordinary.  It's fairly priced and the atmosphere is colorful, and full of class. It is a wonderful alternative for parties, family gatherings and special occasions.  I know it won't be long until my guest become regulars, too.
