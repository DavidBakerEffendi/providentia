Been here many times- live in the village- this place just keeps getting worse. The service is nothing short of horrendous. Attitude and incompetence, it's shocking. Food is un exciting and it's just not really fun either. People in the village have stopped going here for all these reasons. Will no longer go back unless I hear things have changed. Would rather spend my money at lartusi, August, bobo, Rosemary's to name a few! Check out other spots in the west village, no need for the attitude! Â Food is bland and over priced.
