Last night we went to this restaurant for my co-worker celebration dinner & the owner was very disrespectful to my staff. He kept skipping our party of 9. When we brought it to his attention he was rude. He began to say he did not give a f__k & we can go. Why would we give our $ to a business that treats his customers like that. I will never go back & do not recommend this place at all. Food is not authentic cuban food. Mambo Tea is way better
