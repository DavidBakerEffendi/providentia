Our family went to the Mill on the river for a family function this past weekend with about 60 people. The place is beautiful, but that is where it ends. The mill seems to be riding on the beauty of the setting. We went here a couple times years ago, and felt ripped off for what you get, and this function was no exception. The kids (and that is what they are, kids) that were serving the group were obviously undertrained, if ever trained at all. Actually, it seemed like they were all hired the day before the function, and the person who hired them said, "your hired, your first function is tomorrow night, good luck". Our table had 12 people seated, one bottle of water, that was never refilled. They brought us rolls, but there weren't enough for the whole table. The waiter brought more when asked, but no butter, so we had to ask for that. When salads came, they brought two, then the rest of the table had to wait for theirs, two at a time, some had no dressing on them. When the meals came, again, two at a time, and barely warm. Everyone at the table was laughing at the portions. If you are on a diet, this is the place for you!!! LOL! When the cake came, it was so thin, you could read a book through it. I know how much this function costed the family, and for what was given for that obscene amount of money borders on criminal. Poor service, small portions, high prices,,,,but great scenery!!!
