I've eaten here three times- once a la carte, once for the brunch buffet, and my friend and I just got take-out from there.  I wanted to like it, but this place is terrible.  This time, the two of us paid $25 for the Chicken Biryani and the Seekh Kabob.  The amount of food we got was embarrassingly small- not enough for the two of us, and certainly not enough for $25.  The kabobs were dry and only tasted like salt, none of the other delicious spices that typically season kabobs.  There were a few pieces on a bed of onions- that's it.  The biryani was very hot (spicy hot- my mouth burned), but completely lacked flavor.  As for our previous visits, the service was fine, but I could have gotten better food from the frozen section of the co-op.  I know we are in Burlington and not NYC, but this is an Indian family from India, so I expected slightly better.  Also, my boyfriend's jacket still smells like Indian food from the time we went there six months ago.  Won't be going again.  However, if you're in the mood for a lassi, I did enjoy the plain sweet lassi I got there twice.
