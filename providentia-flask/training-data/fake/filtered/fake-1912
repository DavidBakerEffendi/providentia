First a shout out to a fellow review and you know who you are: "We went and sat there for 4 hours, drinking and eating...." Really? You hogged a table for FOUR hours when you know that there is a 3-4 hour wait to get in? And then you tell people to go early due to the wait? Thanks??? On to my review.. After attempting to eat at Brooklyn Crab the first time and having to leave in shame and humiliation we went back because we were sure the service and waiting problems had improved. WRONG!  Not only were we told no tables were available for hours (despite all the empty ones right in front of us) the hostess treated us as if we were an imposition. Fool me once, Brooklyn Crab, shame on you.  Fool me twice, Brooklyn Crab.. you just suck.
