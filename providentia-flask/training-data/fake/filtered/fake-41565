Great raw bar, very reasonable prices for fresh, generous portions of high quality seafood.  The party line is that the owner also owns a fishery in Maine, and the restaurant cuts out the middle man.  True or not, the price is right for a sumptious selecion of fruits del mer.     Also has good drinks deals which are important if you're waiting at the bar for a table, this place can get busy but the wait staff are friendly and accommodating.   Highly recommended.
