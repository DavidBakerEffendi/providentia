So fresh and refreshing!!  Relaxed but classy vibe.  All food was so scrumptious--my husband and I have already agreed we are eating there at least once per week.  The jicima, cucumber, watermelon salad was fantastik.  All desserts are made in-house, and the vanilla bean rice pudding, bread pudding, and flourless chocolate cake knocked our socks off.  The fish tacos were so lightly fried they didn't feel heavy in our full bellies.  And the plantains were not at all greasy.  All the food was seasoned just right.
