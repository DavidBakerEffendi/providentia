I think it's funny that people are so crazy with reviews.  They've done an amazing job so far and this place is pretty relaxed and the food is good.  The hype is annoying--how about we talk about the living and the amount of effort that has gone into making it work.  The truffle fries are bangin' ($8?  really?) and the brunch egg sandwich is REALLY simple and good---especially if you like sage.  Ricotta pancakes good too. Congrats all around...and kudos for sallying forth with the project.  Someone is smiling from heaven, mate.
