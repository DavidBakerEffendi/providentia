Expensive restaurant, awful wine and tiny portions. The bill was $150 per head. We ordered an Italian Sauvignon Blanc, which was dreadful (but not corked, so didn't send it back). We moved on to Chianti, thinking it would be a safe bet, but it was also pretty bad. Either this restaurant is not procuring its wine properly, or more likely it is not shipping and/or storing it properly, as I have never had 2 bottles of Italian wine this bad in Italy or anywhere else in the USA for that matter. Avoid!
