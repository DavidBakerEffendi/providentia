Was there on Valentines day 2013 and the food was not good. The food was good the last 3 times we were there(about 1 yr ago), but things have gone down hill. My wife had the Risotta as an appetizer which had much to much sausage and very little rice & did not taste like Risotta. Her entree of Veal LuNello, which is s signature dish was tasteless.She felt the Veal was recooked. I had Parpadello as an appetizer and it was swimming in tasteless sauce, and was more like a stew. My entree was chicken on the bone(el forno), which was very dry and the chicken was very tough, probably recooked. I think their problem is they have too many specials(15-20), and they probably precook most of those dishes. Small local restaurant run by families have much better food and at half the cost. It doesn"t pay to go to an overpriced restaurant where the food is less than average. Â Never again.
