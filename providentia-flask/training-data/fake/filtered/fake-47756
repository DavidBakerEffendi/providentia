The first time I went to Grimaldi's, it was early on a Monday night in January. There was no wait at 6:30 p.m. and the restaurant was virtually empty. The pizza was delicious and we were so happy that we'd made the trek over the Brooklyn Bridge for this pizza that we'd heard such great things about! The second time was a warm Saturday evening in May. The line snaked down the block. I thought to myself, "Was this pizza really so good that I'm willing to wait in this line to eat it again?" But my parents were with me and we'd already walked across the bridge, so we just decided to wait in the line, which, surprisingly, moved quickly. We waited less than an hour to be seated. And the answer to my question was "Yes." This pizza is ridiculously delicious. By far, the best I've ever had. I live in D.C. now and miss it so much.
