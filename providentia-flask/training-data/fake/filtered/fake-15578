I have been a frequent customer to this new establishment. The food is Fantastic!!! I do have to comment on the staff, specifically the PREGNANT waitress ... Or according to her, the manager. She is always miserable, furthermore, managers should not be waiting tables and accepting tips that's illegal. May sound ignorant but I feel uncomfortable with a pregnant women handling my food. I must say though, Every time I come in, the small white waitress Tina, is the most kind young lady and very pretty. she always delivers the best service and remembers my name. I am always confused though, since I always see Tina managing and doing a little bit of everything and the "manager" sitting around or waiting tables. Seems a little backwards! And where is the sports memorabilia ?! DEVILS, GIANTS , KNICKS?!
