I think, if there is a heaven, and we all get to go, I hope that Max Brenner's is their caterer. Like the Kraft Services of Heaven. I think the menu is filled with more delicious creations than i could ever eat in a lifetime. I went here last week after dinner at Chifa, and had the peanutbutter crepe with dulce de leche ice cream. I am still dreaming about it. I have not been able to stop talking about it- and will return after every meal out in the city from now on! ( i hope!!!!) ps- the staff was really friendly, we arrived kind of late, and became pretty giddy from the chocolate... couldn't stop giggling, and they were just as happy- how could you not be, working around all that chocolate?!?!?!?!? ten stars in my book.
