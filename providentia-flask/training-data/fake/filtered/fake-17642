I went to Jane for a Sunday morning brunch today and it couldn't have been better.  We were seated immediately after walking in and were served promptly once we were seated.  The waiter was very friendly and helpful and always made sure we had everything we needed.  I ordered the vanilla bean french toast (which is my favorite thing on the menu) and it was absolutely delicious.  The other people at my table also thoroughly enjoyed their meals as well.  I would definitely recommend going to Jane any day for a nice, delicious brunch.
