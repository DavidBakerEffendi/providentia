Best Chinese Food in Bayonne.  I tried nearly every Chinese restaurant in Bayonne.  Nothing compares to this.  It is very affordable and can fit in anyone's means of budget.  They offer large portions within their meals.  It is not like 90% rice and some meat.  The meals have perfect portions.  They have a nice, warm, cozy, friendly atmosphere.  The workers are very polite and friendly.  I usually dine in and enjoy the fireplace while watching the news.  The restaurant is always clean and the tables are clean right away after the customer leaves. My favorite orders are chicken and broccoli and boneless spare ribs.  Their boneless spare ribs are very tasteful and has a lot of sauce on them and with only a couple of cents can be prepared with extra sauce.  I always leave the restaurant satisfied and full.  I would recommend this to everyone I know.  I have been a loyal patron every since living in Bayonne, 2010.
