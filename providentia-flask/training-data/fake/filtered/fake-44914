This was undoubtedly the worst Italian food I have ever eaten. The service by our very young waiter was horrendous, and that's the reason I'm giving this place ONE star. The only assumption I can make is that this place is simply a clip joint. Being located as it is in a strip mall with a high volume of shoppers, it has succumbed to the temptation to rip people off, since it's unlikely they'll be back. and with the food and service here I wouldn't blame them either Let's start with the house wine. It came in the smallest, half-filled glass I've ever seen. Two or maybe three ounces at most. A couple of sips and it was gone, prompting the waiter to appear offering to sell me another nine-dollar refill. By the way, it was barely drinkable cheap Italian plonk that would sell for maybe six bucks a bottle. Then came the Caesar salad. Geometrically chopped tiny chunks of romaine covered in powdered parmesan, drenched in dollops of bottled (bad) dressing, and covered with a thousand symmetrical croutons. We finally realized it was a caesar salad kit from a grocery store, and a low-end one at that. The came the mains. My wife's lobster ravioli was okay, but not as good as that from any proper Italian chain (Carabba's, Brio, et al). It was doughy and drowning in a pink rose sauce. On second thought, it wasn't okay, it was bad. However, my veal parmigiana was NOT veal!! I'd bet the farm it was a pork cutlet, which kind of looks like veal when cooked, if sliced thinly enough, but which, unlike actual veal, is much more fibrous and tough, with a denser consistency. It was topped by gobs of horrible gloopy cheese and a thin bottled marinara sauce. I've had the frozen boxed veal parmigiana from Costco, and that stuff is ten times better than what Tuscany serves you. Bottom Line: STAY AWAY! I'll certainly never eat there again. And neither should you!
