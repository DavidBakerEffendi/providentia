My wife and I made the mistake of going to Bar Tano tonight. We had the WORST service we have ever had in any borough of NYC. First, we sat at the bar while waiting for a table and watched another party of 2 walk in off the street and be sat before us.  Our appetizers came with our meal, my wife received the wrong entree and I was forced to eat my entree while she waited for hers.  She then received the incorrect entree for a second time. She originally ordered a mozzarella panini with pesto. The first panini to come out was ricotta and eggplant.  When it came out again it was missing the pesto. When we told our server about it, he came back and slammed a cup of pesto on our table and walked away. We then decided to leave with her only taking two bites out of her panini.  We were only comped for her entre, even though our entire meal was ruined. The worst part was that our server never even apologized. I would never go there again. Our ENTIRE night was ruined and all we received was 12 dollars off our bill.  I'm usually not picky about service, especially when a place is new, but this was ridiculous.
