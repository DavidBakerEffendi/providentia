I live in Park Slope, my partner and i had been working all day so we decided to eat a dinner outside because we were celebrating our 5th aniversary, so we didnt want to pass up this date. We found this place, Bogota Latin Bistro, so we enjoyed it... its very confortable, nice ambiance, exellent service and the food is very delicious, they have lot of plates of meal to enjoy... i defenitely recommend it, for the lovers of exellent cuisine.
