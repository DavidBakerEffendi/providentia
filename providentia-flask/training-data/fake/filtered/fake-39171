If negative stars were available I would give Lillie's negative 10 stars.  The service was horrible and despicable.  As other reviewers posted, Lillies is especially incompetent when it comes to specialized menus such as brunch menus.  But even aside from that it's just common sense to take the customers' orders 5-10 minutes after they sat down.  We were a group of 40 with reserved seats on October 28, 2012 Sunday and arrived at 12:30pm.  Only after repeated prodding of the 2 waitresses and the hostess, did they finally take our brunch orders.  It took Lillies 1.5 hours to bring out our food while we All commiserated and derisively concurred that we would NEVER return again!   You only get one chance at a first impression. Lillies screwed up in an astronomical and irreparable way and multiplicatively by 40 to the infinite power since We will All tell our friends, relatives and co-workers NEVER to go to Lillies (both locations-in Times Square and Lower Manhattan).   And the person who was paying the entire bill got her food absolutely Last!  The waitresses, waiters, cooks and hostesses seemed inexperienced and oblivious to what their jobs entail.  You don't wait 30-45 minutes to take people's orders!  It didn't matter that the restaurant gave us complimentary wine and mimosas to toast the special event which was the reason why we reserved 40 seats. To add insult to injury, the patrons who arrived long after us got their orders first while We All sat there for One Hour to One Hour and 30 minutes Starving to death!  The restaurant wasn't crowded at all, but the waitresses, hostesses, waiters and cooks were Totally Incompetent!  They could have brought out 100 bottles of Free Liquor but the Damage Was Done in a Major Way!  All 40 of us Agreed multiplied by the Trillions of Other People we'll Forewarn that We will NEVER go Back to Lillie's Restaurant again!!!
