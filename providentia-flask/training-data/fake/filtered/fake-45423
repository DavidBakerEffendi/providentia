Uhmmm, where to start. French & Mexican? Could be weird. It could be good. Here, it's GREAT! I had queso fondito for 2 - delicious in a little caldron. What a great way to beat the chill. Then I had Raviole du Royan - cute little ravioli stuffed with goat & Gruyere & parsley with Emmental cheese on top. Sounds heavy, but the portion was perfect and I was in HEAVEN. Then finished with trio creme brulee with Madagascar Vanilla Bean, Hibiscus & Nutella. Say What! Coffee was French press from Brooklyn Roasting Co. REAL COFFEE!!! Coming in for Lunch/Brunch next Friday. Cool that they have it Friday - Sunday, I can use a good Friday jump off! I gotta try the Callipo Tuna Nicoise! Staff is super nice - the bald bartender with glasses is so French and not in a bad way. Really cute (and shaved heads make me smile)...Way to go, a welcome addition to the neighborhhood.
