Visited Skara Estiatorio with our son who had just returned from studying in Greece for 3 months. We were looking for an authentic Greek restaurant, and boy did we find it! The appetizers were excellent. The entrees were all extraordinary. Have been to Lithos in Livingston which has good food and is quite expensive. The prices here were quite reasonable for the food offered, and the staff was extraordinarily friendly - conversing with my son in Greek. We thought the food was as good or even perhaps a little better than Lithos in a less pretentious atmosphere. All 5 of us enjoyed the experience,and my son thought the food was very much like that which he had recently enjoyed in Greece the past 3 months. Hope to return soon. Great place!
