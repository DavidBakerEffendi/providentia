Qualified as a soft open review: Overall: Â fantastic and reasonably priced meal. The Great: obscene meatloaf sandwich, bread on both sandwiches, price The really really good: brisket, wedge salad, cinnamon doughnut The ok: cheddar scallion biscuit(needs more flakey biscuit goodness); brisket sauce (needs more punch), atmosphere needs more personality Looking forward to helping them test the waters more, looking forward to the finished story.
