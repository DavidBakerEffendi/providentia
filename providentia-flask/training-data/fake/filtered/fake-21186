I'm a regular at Cooperage and it's always outstanding.  The food is amazing.  I'd suggest the scallops, crab cakes, or free range chicken with grits.  They have a really great southern chopped salad as well.  At lunchtime the ham sliders are to die for!  The wine selection is great and there's always a fun specialty cocktail being featured. The service is also excellent.  Everyone is very friendly and accommodating.  Dining at Cooperage is a MUST!
