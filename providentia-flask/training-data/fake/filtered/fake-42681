I've been to the place quite often it is GREAT. That being out of the way, the food is AMAZING.  It's just like the afghani restaurants i used to visit in Islamabad, Pakistan (where I'm from), and Jalalabad, Afghanistan (where i've visited in the 90's).  NOTHING is bad.  The best thing to order?  Order the PAKORAY for the appetizer.  It comes with a hand made chutney sauce that i last ate at an afghani man's roadside stand in Islamabad.  I love it.  It's a beautiful place where one can take friends family and acquaintances. It's a bit higher priced then other, but the presentation, experience and the place itself makes up for it.
