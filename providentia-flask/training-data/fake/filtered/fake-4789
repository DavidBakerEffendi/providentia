Let me just say, I received better service at the McDonalds on 40th and Walnut than at Lovers and Madmen. I came in at 4pm, and every single table, windowsill, and couch was full. That having been said, there are less than 20 seats available in the place, so you better hope that you go when nobody else is. I ended up sitting down at the table for children with those miniature chairs. It was not comfortable. I opened up my laptop to check my calender and to finish up some work. I had a meeting there in 15 minutes with a friend. After 2 minutes, the barista came over and told me if I wanted to use the free wifi, I would have to buy something. I was not using the wifi, I was writing a word document, and checking my non-internet calender. I considered buying something just so that I would have a place (albiet uncomfortable) to sit until my meeting, but after one glance at the overpriced menu, I decided to wait outside instead. It was cold, and there was nowhere else nearby where I could go to sit, so I just went outside and leaned against the wall to finish up my NON-INTERNET work. The barista then came outside of the shop, and started to yell at me for stealing their internet. He didnt even let me speak, to tell him that I wasn't, in fact, using internet, because he couldn't stop screaming,"DON't PLAY ME!". I ended up having to just walk around for another 15 minutes. I did not end up buying anything off of the overpriced menu, and the barista was a pretentious, self-important jerk. I would definitely NOT recommend this place to anybody.
