First time ordering.  We ordered crispy vegetable spring rolls, Thai herbed wings, Tofu Pad Thai and Tofu Pad Se ew.  Enjoyed the wings which were similar to Bon Chon korean wings but larger and moister.  Sauce was a bit sweet and would consider more spice, vinegar and herbs or just a nice hot sauce.  The wings were well seasoned and tasty without the sauce.  The Pad see ew was delicious with a hint of basil.  Ask for the red pepper powder on the side to control the amount of spice you want. Pad thai was good but a slightly thicker noodle, more cilantro and a touch of basil might add better flavor.  My wife thought the noodles were a little greasy but I think not as greasy as Spice! Noodles were cooked perfectly.  Portions sizes were very generous and flavors were great.
