We thought when we moved into center city,  we would find many great restaurants. Well, how about many good restaurants. Did not happen until Meritage. The four of us were overwhelmed and frankly, shocked to find the quality and taste of our dinner, from beginning to end. We all ordered the tasting menu. micro greens with two large diver scallops done perfectly. We ordered the divine hanger steak that arrived with baby veggies that were roasted. How much better could it get?  The chocolate dessert, that's how much.
