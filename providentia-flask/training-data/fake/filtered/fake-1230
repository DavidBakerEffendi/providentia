I don't know about all these good reviews but this was one of the worst experiences of my life. My two friends and I sat down at a small table for dinner.  We all ordered drinks and then ordered 6 dishes for the table to share.  The waiter told us that it was not enough food and that we needed to add more.  It was on the late side and we weren't that hungry so we said we were fine and that if we wanted more we could get it later.  The waiter told us that we were only allowed to order once and that if we wanted something we had to order then. The food came and it was nothing to write home about.  We finished our food (which btw was the perfect amount) and each ordered another drink.  The waiter told us that they would need the table and that they had a bar next door.  We told him that we also wanted dessert and he said that he would comp the dessert and drinks if we went next door since they needed the table.  We did not see anyone waiting and there were 4 or 5 other tables available at the time.  It was 9:30 and they closed at 11, so I cant imagine that they really needed the table.   We were annoyed but we went next door.  There was no room to sit or stand and the bartender had no clue what were were talking about when we said said the items were supposed to be comped.  We walked back over to speak to someone and they just gave us a business card for the manager and told us to email him the next day.   The customer service was awful and the food wasn't even good.  I will never be going back.
