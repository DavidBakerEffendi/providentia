I love this place - absolutely no pretentious behavior from anyone and a nice antidote to Yale.  Don't get me wrong - Yale does great stuff, but you are grounded when you walk into The Anchor.   Can't beat the fries.  "Open Reading" night on Tuesday is another excuse to go.  Service always good, and you see the same people which is fun.  You can have/engage in serious conversation, no one bothers you.
