I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for years. While I have always enjoyed their Italian food (especially the Chicken Sorrentino), tonight was a special treat. Owner Raima was in the kitchen cooking and prepared several Mediterranean dishes. We ordered the spicy shrimp as an appetizer, and the sauce was amazing! We also ordered two of her entree specials..A baked salmon dish and a lamb skewer dish that were both phenomenal. A homemade Baklava for dessert was the perfect ending to an exceptional meal. DO NOT MISS OUT on this incredible food! Â I am hopeful that these dishes will become a permanent part of the menu as this would be a wonderful treat for anyone dining here!
