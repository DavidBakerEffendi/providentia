Wow - what a surprise! Newly opened, The Terrace serves the best Thai food in the New Haven area. Located in a tiny white building that's been a BBQ place for many years, the interior is sparse, but modern and attractive. Not your typical American Thai restaurant, the traditional Thai dishes are each prepared with a unique Terrace taste. The extra care taken with each dish is obvious. For example the Fresh Rolls, served elsewhere with sweet chili sauce out of a jar, are accompanied here with homemade spicy basil sauce. The unique and tasty Massaman Curry is deep red with tamarind. And the crushed peanuts in dishes like Satay are pan toasted for an extra-nutty flavor. The chef's classic French training shows in the desserts. Try the "Spaghetti Ice Cream and Meatballs" - spaghetti shaped vanilla ice cream with a berry-wine sauce and chocolate truffles. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Special requests are welcomed.
