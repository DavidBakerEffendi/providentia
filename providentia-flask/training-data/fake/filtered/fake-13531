Food was absolutely INCREDIBLE. So good, so filling, we were so happy with it. However, we went on Monday night. The place was full, but service was extremely slow. They seemed very understaffed and stressed, which reflected back into our own feelings. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks (Voodoo Bloody Mary's are SO GOOD though), and we didnt get our food until over an hour after being seated. And we were super hungry. Overall, it was delicious and we'll be back for the food, but the service was incredibly frustrating and the experience would be so much better with a fuller staff.
