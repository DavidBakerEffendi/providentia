Marathon On The Square is the most awesome place to come if you want stellar customer service, attention, and great food.   I have come here on occasion to celebrate occasions: birthdays, holidays, even a date or two...and every time, in the last year and a half since I've been coming, I've received nothing but the best service, hands down.   While the rest of the city scrambled with reservations, overcrowding and general all-around madness this past Mother's Day, my small party enjoyed a rather relaxed, well-paced time along the bar, away from the general seating for brunch.  Our server Jason was perhaps the most on-point server I've ever had.  If we came in after a peak rush, you;'d never know it.  The staff were cool as cucumbers, all about their tasks and no one was slacking off, even if they could..   Jason suggested a local summer ale on tap, which was crisp, yet refreshingly light, with just a hint of body.  Went exceptionally well with my tofu scramble w/ mixed peppers, tender potatoes, onions and cherry tomatoes....most restaurants can easily mess this one up...not them....exquisite, and not oily! A gem of a veggie dish! We also ordered chocolate chip pancakes....we held back from crying, it was so good.  Real bittersweet small chips folded into the center of the batter and barely melted, not gooey, and oh so buttery....the syrup couldn't wait to mingle with it on the plate, and neither could my fork.  Damn.   All throughout, the atmosphere was breezy and pleasant.  A softball game was on the telly,  and our bellies were full and happy, and full of great conversation.   Please, by all means, book your get togethers, meetings, etc here.  They will meet your needs! *They also have great lunch and dinner offerings!
