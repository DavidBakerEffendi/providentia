The attitude of the host and hostess at the front door was terrible.  i have been to Locande Verde numerous times and have spent a good dollar there which pays their salary.  I was at the restaurant last night (Oct 7, 2011) and was told about an hour for a table for my party of three.  That was ok and I accepted such.  As  I stood near the reception area and heard others come in and get seated who also did not have a reservation, i questioned an approximate seating time.  I was told that the table that they had for me was taking longer.  They then approached me and said that they could offer me a table in part of the hotel attached rather than the restaurant.  This was completely unacceptable and when they showed me the table and area, no one was sitting there.  Was this because two of my party were college students and it did not fit their ambience and trend??!!  The staff must remember that (most of the time) the customer is right and that the customer pays their wages!!  Overall, the wait is NOT worth the food or price or ambience and definitely not the worth of meeting the front line staff at the door.
