Atmosphere is nice, but ultimately doesn't matter. Despite paying for the larger Entree Sized meal, the portions were very small, especially considering the price. Shouldn't be leaving a $200 dinner for two hungry, especially being given the opportunity to purchase a larger Â portion. Disappointed over-all.
