I live close by and have ordered from here a few times. I am always disappointed. Their service is terrible - it's always noisy and who ever answers the phone is always rude. They also never know what's on the menu and when it's time for me to pick up my order they usually can't give me what I wanted. Then they blame me for not giving them my correct phone number! The empanadas are ok. This place is way over-hyped. There is definitely better food in the neighborhood.
