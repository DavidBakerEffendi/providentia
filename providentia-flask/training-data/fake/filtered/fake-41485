Only speaking from my experience at the sushi bar, haven't been to the restaurant. I asked for two salmon rolls with cucumber, and what they charged me as was an alaskan roll without avocado. To me that seemed unfair, but the food was good. It was funny because I only had 13 dollars in my wallet and with the price bait and switch it came to 12.98 without tip. I put my 13 dollars in the checkbook and left quickly. However as I was walking out, I planned to come back the next day and give the sushi man his tip. When I walked the next day, he smiled at me, maybe he didn't now I didn't tip or maybe he didn't care. Either way, I handed him 3 bucks and left. Ill be back though. Good sushi.
