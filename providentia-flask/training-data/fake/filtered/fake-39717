This place should get 3 stars, but gets 4 for the setting. It is in the Ayer building, and is gorgeous. It's a pretty casual setup -- you don't need to be dressed up at all, but if you feel like it, it's fine. We tried many of the dishes, family-style, and found that this was the most effective way to order here. Some portions are a LOT bigger than others, and most of the dishes are worth a try but maybe not worth your whole meal. As for desserts, we only tried the Chocolate Parade, which was a bit of a letdown. The drinks menu is actually pretty great. Overall, it's probably not worth the money, but was fun to try out, and the setting is a good date night setting. Very cute and romantic but not TOO cosy.
