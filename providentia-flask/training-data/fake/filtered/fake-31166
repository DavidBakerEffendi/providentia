Amazing food!!! Best Lebanese food I've had in a very long time and Wafa (owner) is a sweet heart. I had the Kefta kebab with tomato bulgar and hummus, delicious. The restaurant itself is very cozy and the service was on point. This restaurant is definitely going to be my go to spot for traditional Lebanese food. Highly recommended.
