I kept hearing all the buzz about Amy Ruth's so I thought I'd give it a try. I was looking into the different soul food restaurants of Harlem because I'm having a  party coming up and was looking into getting it catered.  It was a huge disappointment. The menu is definitely overpriced. I ordered The Ludacris (Fried Chicken Wings with Mac N Cheese and Candied Yams). It was definitely a huge let down. I definitely cook my own soul food at least 5 times better than what I tasted. The chicken had absolutely no flavor to it; it wasn't seasoned at all. The Mac N Cheese looked liked a layer of shredded cheese just sitting on top of it. And the candied yams just tasted like something was missing. I would not recommend coming here. I only had one dish but first impressions obviously will not keep me coming back regardless of the other dishes that might be good.
