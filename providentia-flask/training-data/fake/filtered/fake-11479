People who are giving this bbq place more than a star or two are doing potential customers a disservice. Having passed this restaurant several times and being inticed by the smell, i decided to stop in for a early dinner. The menu was filled with very appetizing choices, but the food did not live up to its expectation. The bbq sauce is medoicre ,so that contributed to the low quality of food they were serving. The corn bread was dried out, the mac n cheese was dry, the potato salad tasted like it could be purchased from fresh grocer. The burger that had bacon, & onion rings was a decent size but the onion rings were very limited and the burger had no flavor. The best part of the meal was the mixed french fries, but they are only average. Â Anyone who is thinking of visiting this vicinity please rethink that decision, I have had better tasting food at mcdonalds a place I stopped eating at 7 years ago.
