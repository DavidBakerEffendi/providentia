Cute little place in the West Village. For the relatively low prices, the food was surprisingly good. Had the brie drizzled with honey and pine nuts to start, then the tortellini with crab meat and sun dried tomatoes. The ambiance in the restaurant is nothing special, but if you're facing out, you get a nice view of 7th Avenue South.
