I went to Claire's for lunch yesterday with my 3 children. Once we got seated, my 10 month old started crying and whining. After a few minutes, the owner approached me and asked if there was anything she could do to help with the baby. I replied "no thank you". She then proceeded to tell me that 'many customers' were complaining about him. Given that my 2 other children were very hungry, I controlled my comments to her. I asked her if she preferred that we leave, to which she hesitated, and asked if maybe I could take him for a walk or something.....It was a pretty cold and windy day, so I replied no. I have never experienced this type of reaction from a restaurant owner, much less in an already noisy restaurant. I will never eat there again.
