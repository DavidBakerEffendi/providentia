I went here for Valentines Day and I was pleasantly surprised.  It was not the regular dinner menu, rather fixed price 5 course.  Each course was wonderful.   The service could not have been better.  It is a very romantic and small establishment.  However, based on the outstanding quality of the fixed price Valentines menu I will return and give the regular menu a try.  It has the feel of an upscale Greenwich Village restaurant.
