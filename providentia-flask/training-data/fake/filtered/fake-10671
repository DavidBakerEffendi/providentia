I just love the sushi in here!! like the name of Beyond Sushi its way beyond any sushi I have ever had and I am not vegetarian. The sushi was so flavorful and its the first time I didn't have to add soy sauce to enjoy the sushi. The flavors just exploded in my mouth and I didn't want to spoil the deliciousness of the food.
