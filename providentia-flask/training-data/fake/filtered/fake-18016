The food was absolutely delicious and it is the reason I would go back.  As a vegan for many years now I know what quality fresh vegan food tastes like or does not. The portion sizes are enough to fill me up and the price is reasonable considering the amount of time that goes into preparing this type of food.  Fresh vegan food takes extra time and therefore the price seems fair to me.   On the other hand, the service was not superior.  I have gone twice and on both occasions it was the same thing that happened. I got great service at the beginning up until my food came.  Then it just ends. I have to wait around forever to get my check. Why? I would go back just because the food is so good.
