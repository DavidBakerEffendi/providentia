I will start off by saying I was over the moon once I heard there was an Indian restaurant in Nutley. Unfortunately this restaurant did not build  up to my expectations. When I was first seated I received a glass of  lukewarm water (no ice nor lemon)  All of which I have asked for.  Than the food came out.. Not hot but warm and not tasty. Quite frankly I would go so far of saying the food was gross. Krishna is compatible with a nasty takeout Indian restaurant.
