I was startled by the horrific, racist stickers all over this place and believe they are Anti-American. If you order food in an accent, you may not even be served! This is despicable. By the way, JOE, Â the US government and the United States DO NOT have an official language and your grandparents could speak English either. By the time the nasty cheesesteak came out, I was not hungry because of the hellish atmosphere of this place. Cheesesteaks are food. It is not necessary to have a racist, Republican montage of images everywhere, reminding people why Americans have a bad reputation in the world. Serve your dead, hormone-ladened cows. Leave the rhetoric out.
