My best friend and I went there for dinner tonight, and it was wonderful! The drinks were delicious, and reasonably priced especially for this area.  My friend had a chicken sandwich, which she absolutely loved because they had gouda as an option.  I had a bison burger that was cooked to perfection.  I added pineapple and cranberries and this delicious Sriracha sauce, and even fresh mozzerella! I think the prices of the burgers were fair, considering all of the premium additions I put on it. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu, and we asked a LOT of questions. She was attentive and recommended the parm fries, which were devoured within a few minutes. The manager had stopped by our table to make sure everything was okay, and he couldn't have been nicer. All in all, I had a wonderful experience at The Counter.  I can't wait to go back and try their tuna burgers.  Tuna burgers! How many places do you know actually have tuna burgers?!
