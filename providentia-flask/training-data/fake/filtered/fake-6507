This was the worst experience I have had at a restaurant in a long time.  We sat at our table for 20 minutes before the waiter showed up to even ask for a drink order.  I'm not exaggerating, 20 minutes. In fact we were just about to walk out when he finally showed up.  Then when I ordered the beef tenderloin he didn't tell me it was served uncooked until he was walking away and I requested medium.  At that point I had to rush and choose something else.  In my haste I went with the Gnocchi topped with crab meat.  It arrived and the presentation was awful, it looked like someone had just thrown it together.  On top of everything else, the dish tasted horrible.  I would recommend going to the subway restaurant next door for what I'm sure would be better service and better tasting food.
