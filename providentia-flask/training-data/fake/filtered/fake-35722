Last winter, I was in town for business and my flight got delayed thanks to snow. My hotel offered a shuttle over to Panevino, which I decided to take advantage of and grab some dinner. Well, I walked in and the hostess stopped chewing whatever she was eating long enough to give me my seating options (I later found out that she's actually a manger! Eating at the front door!). Since I was by myself, I decided to sit at the bar. I told the bartender, Brandon, that I'd never been here before and asked him to give me the goods on what they did best. He asked me a couple questions about what kind of food I liked and then went through each section of the menu giving me recommendations based on what he thought I would like and telling me the things that he liked best. I decided to do a simple tri-colore salad and their Red Snapper dish, based on his recommendations, and was generally really happy with my selections. To top it off, I had a great conversation with Brandon, and a manager who was named Greg. They were both really funny, nice guys. The reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is this: At one point, the manager who was at the door when I came in and another slightly younger lady who seemed to also be a manager were trash-talking a customer who just left with a waitress at the hostess stand, not 6 feet away from me! Between that and the eating at the door, I was mortified! I asked the bartender about it, and he could only shrug. Anyway, I went back this past week, again because of the convenience and hoping to maybe get a decent conversation with my meal. Unfortunately, it would seem Brandon and Greg have moved on. Unless you're taking advantage of the convenience of a hotel shuttle, you should too.
