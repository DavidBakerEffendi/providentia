My favorite mexican place in Philly! Great food, good beer selection. It's a bit loud, so conversations are hard. Wait staff is hit or miss it seems, but it is also always packed whenever I go. Even with those complaints, this still gets 5 stars for being hands down the best place to eat in NorLib's.
