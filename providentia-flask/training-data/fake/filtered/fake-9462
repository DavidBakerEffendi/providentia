My husband and our 3 children had the best breakfast on Saturday morning. This place was straight out of the past and the kids were able to order waffles and bacon, pancakes and fresh fruit.  My husband had the cream chipped beef (which was huge!) and I had an omelette.  Food was hot and served quickly by a very friendly waitress. I'm so glad we stopped.  It was pretty easy to find off of the turnpike too. We'll definitely be back.
