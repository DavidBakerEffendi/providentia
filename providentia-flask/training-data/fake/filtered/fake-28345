Mama Mia it's a whole lot of food & more food! Carmine's is a wonderful dining experience for Italian food while dining in the NYC... For those visiting the Times Square area I advise stop in for some chow. *** CAUTION *** Carmine's is serves family style portions. Meaning you get large amounts of food. A salad realistically could feed 4 to 6 people so either make sure your hungry or bring friends. Now the food is delicious. I've enjoy everything from chicken parmesan, garlic shrimp in angel hair pasta, Spaghetti & meatballs and several salads. "Damn I'm drooling writing this cause I now want some now." It's a huge menu and it's all quality food as you would expect. Don't fear the size, just bring appetite.
