When my husband asked me what I wanted for dinner, my reply was Indian food.  We live near Edison, but don't often venture over there for dinner, so we figured we'd give it a shot.   Urban Spoon is a spiffy establishment, both inside and out.  My main qualm is the fact that someone rated their menu as $$, with which I strongly disagree.  For two people, our dinner came to $57 (before tip), and that was without ordered any alcohol or soda in addition to our meals.  While the food was very tasty, the portions left a bit to be desired.  My husband's chicken vindaloo was a rather small portion, while my chicken biryana was quite large.  My husband's meal did not come with rice (contrary to many other Indian restaurants we've gone to), so we had to order that separately to the tune of $6 for a side of plain basmati rice.  The naan was great, though.  I preferred the plain naan, but my husband was a big fan of the garlic naan. Overall we enjoyed our meals, but next time we'd probably consider sharing a meal and ordering an appetizer.
