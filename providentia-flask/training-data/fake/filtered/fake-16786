I make it a point to eat as much pizza at as many establishments as possible and La Fourno is by far my favorite. The pizza is brick oven, thin crust, with delicious toppings and the best marinara around. Beyond the pizza, I have sampled their salads and dessert. Both are fantastic. I did not think that a house salad could be so impressive but it was huge, with a fantastic vinaigrette, and filled with more diverse toppings than one would think possible. I don't normally eat dessert but decided to trust that the tiramisu would be amazing, and it was. My parents have had their entrees on numerous occasions and are always pleased. On top of that, the owner is super friendly, the sounds of Frank Sinatra greet you upon entrance and the servers are almost embarrassingly Â eager to please. South Street is a scary place reminiscent of the Wildwood boardwalk but is well worth traversing in order to get to La Fourno.
