made 2 interesting discoveries yesterday: 1) mural art: the mural arts tour is yet another good reason to visit the city of brothers, it's basic its hi-tech, it helps young people, I learned something about "finigans wake", and , well I'll stop here. 2) llama tooth restaurant: you can sit on the patio and enjoy their fine fare between 2 of the finest mural arts works in Phila. Thanks to the Haitian artist sharing his memories of home.The food and service were excellent. WE sat with a couple from Boston who made similar comments about the program and food.
