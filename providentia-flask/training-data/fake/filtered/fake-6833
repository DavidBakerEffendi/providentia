I've walked by here a lot but finally went in. Even though it is my neighborhood Bed-Stuy hasn't been much of a food destination until recently so I've been cautious. The food here is kind of far-out and (overall, from my limited experience here) remarkably good. I'm more of a sampler/grazer than an entr√©e kind of guy so that's what I went for. The Nippon Nachos are plenty cheesy and tasty - remarkably so. Being a Southerner I am a fan of deviled eggs, maybe even preciously so, but the bizarre, deep-fried, bacon-filled E666s won me over but I wouldn't make a habit of them if you want to live. My friend had the steak tartare and said it was excellent. Also, all of the times I had walked by I never noticed that there was a bar, but there is a small, pub-ish bar tucked around the corner in back also servicing a pretty pleasant back yard and manned by Laurieanne who is about the friendliest bartender I've met and worth coming in for. I'll probably be back to laugh at her in the back to graze some more in the front.
