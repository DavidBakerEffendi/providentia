Wow!  I'm not sure why we haven't gone to Harry's before now.  We'll definitely be back.  We went recently on a Thursday night and arrived during the dinner rush, so we waited in the vestibule for about 20 minutes before being seated.   Like previous reviewers, we found the space small, and after experiencing the food, we wondered why they don't expand the Bishop's Corner location -- guess one doesn't mess w/ a good thing. We started w/ a bottle of Hob Nob Pinot priced at just $16! That's unheard of in a restaurant!  The entire wine menu features really decent wines at exceptionally low prices.  Kudos to Harry's! We ordered a nice sized and very fresh house salad that we split among our party of three.  Then on to the large pizza with pepperoni, onion, fresh mozzarella and basil.  Amazing thin crust pizza and well-seasoned pepperoni.  The crust was crisp and stayed crisp even under the toppings and even as the pizza cooled.  Some thin crust pizza gets soggy as it cools.   While we didn't go for desert, they brought a complimentary scoop of lemon ice for each of us.   Harry's stands up.  Well done.  Definitely on the "go back soon" list!
