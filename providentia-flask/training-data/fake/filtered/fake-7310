Dear Mr. Keith McNally, On September 19, 2011 I took my brother and his family to your restaurant to celebrate his birthday. Each of us have eaten all over the world and we all looked forward to dinner at a French bistro. The ambiance was festive, just like in Paris or Lyon. We had drinks at the bar while waiting to be seated.  When we were seated we had a young waitress and a fantastic Asian gentleman assistant who's supplemental services were intuitive and excellent. I thought I would share with you that we did confer with the manager at the conclusion of the meal. He was not very helpful.  My sister-in-law ordered the night's special of sea scallops for $32.00.  Our entire party was astounded that the entrée came with 3 scallops, a few pieces of corn, and something green with no sauce.  We should have returned the plate for something more substantial but it was a birthday celebration and she did not want to create a commotion. A second member of our party ordered the Steak Frites for $34.00.  The meal was prepared to order but the cost per serving size and quality was again astounding.  We discussed, that had we been in France and ate the same meals, we probably would have had more food on each plate for substantially less cost. The manager did nothing to assuage our concerns about the price and quality of each meal.  He stated the chef sets the size and price for each plate.  I must say these two meals did not measure up to comparable restaurants in the city and do not invite customers to trust the menu nor invites one to return to your restaurant. No bistro in France would serve such plates at those prices and deliver only 3 scallops on a plate.   This is why I am taking the time to write to you and let you know the displeasure of our dining party.
