Have been there twice and both times the service and food were awesome.  The  only problem is it can get really crowded and not exactly built for comfort.  Dishes that are fresh, flavorful, local ingredients for a french/Mediterranean driven menu.  Spot on execution, thoughtful, and attentive service.  Casual and welcoming atmosphere.
