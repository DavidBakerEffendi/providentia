So I decided to try something new tonight, and though their were alot of mixed reviews. The food was GREAT! I had a chicken and lamb kabob with rice, salad, bread, and a choice of sauce. I was surprised it was given a bad review because the food was excellent, the service was so friendly and the place has a great feeling to it. I will come again and again! you must check it out,
