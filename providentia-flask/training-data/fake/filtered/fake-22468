Not many places to eat late night 9:39 ish - ate couple times past couple weeks - good atmosphere - food hit miss - pricey - service at this hour awful. ate high top - other night bar - if I heard one more time - "of course" for something I already asked for- or waiter offering for example bread & oil ; forgets olive oil - I ask "of course"could I get lemon for water- when ordering wine - " of course" - must request again which would not be a problem if you can flag down bartender. The night w/ waiter "seemed surprised when one part of order didn't arrive notwithstanding another waiter delivering a part of our order said it would be coming - obviously didn't check with our server . Server puts down check - but I would like dessert  " oh, of course" picks up check and gets dessert menu.  Need more water - "of course" scoop glass into ice add faucet water - the other night ate at bar - nice enough bartenders - a lot of "of course"- difficult to get their attention- who's running the place - ps love the music but - sir, sir sir, to get waiter and they can't hear - they need more customer queuing. service is just mediocre or maybe better described not professional- especially for its prices.
