I stopped in with a friend for a quick drink at the bar before heading to dinner and the show at  Sleep No More, which is conveniently located just across the street. The space is nice - simple and modern with a front that opens up to enjoy the breeze if the weather is nice. I love a good cocktail, and was impressed with the drink menu. Everything went lovely until  we went to pay the bill. As a courtesy, I generally try to leave a tip in cash if I can when I pay with a card. I signed the card receipt, crossed out the tip, and handed it back to the bartender. He had a discussion with another employee, a server I'd presume but I'm not sure, who promptly handed the signed receipt back to me and informed me curtly that the tip isn't included in the charges. I hadn't even left my seat at that point, and I'd had no intention of running off without leaving a tip. That was a bit unfriendly and rude. Though I enjoyed the drinks and the space, I'm not sure I'd return. I left feeling a bit unwelcome and offended. If you want a drink before or after the show, see if you can't snag yourself a reservation at the Gallow Green - the McKittrick's rooftop bar.
