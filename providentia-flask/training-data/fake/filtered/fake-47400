I held my birthday here two days ago. Our party size was 14, and Sotto 13 was wonderful about it. They were very accommodating, didn't mind that I added a few people at the last minute, and the waiters were very helpful and accommodating throughout the whole night. The food was delicious - we ended up trying almost all the tapas and 4 or 5 of the pizzas, and everyone loved the food. The atmosphere was also perfect. There was plenty of space, the lighting was cozy and romantic, but not too dark, and the music and noise level were just perfect. No one needed to shout to be heard around the table, and we didn't feel like we were overtaking the entire restaurant. I highly recommend this place!
