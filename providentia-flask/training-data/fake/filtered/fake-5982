When I heard about this new place, I looked up the menu and immediately had to check it out with a group of friends. The place was tucked in a clothing store on the 3rd floor which made for an unexpected and surprisingly cool experience.  We went out to the rooftop to get some cocktails which totally hit the spot.  It was a large rooftop space with plenty of cool covered seating areas.  We didn't spend too much time there since we had reservations but would definitely hang out there again before the weather turns colder. The food was amazing!!  The highlights for me were the sweetbreads with that amazing ranch hummus sauce (there is not enough places in NYC that serve ranch dressing!), the monkfish cheeks, the banh mi poutine and of course, the whole roast pig head.  The pig head is not for the faint of heart but it was delicious. The service was great and our server and hostess were charming.  I would highly recommend this place. I need to go back to taste the rest of the menu.  A very welcomed addition to the neighborhood.
