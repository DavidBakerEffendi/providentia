Amazing thin-crust pizza with great sauce.  My eating partner and I ordered the calimari as an appetizer; the portion was larger than I expected--and I'm a big guy that likes to eat... a lot.  We also had the buffala (sp?) pizza and it was just as good as anything I've had in New Haven, CT (which is pretty well known for its pizza).  The beer list features all Italian beers (note: the one that begins with a "P" tastes like Heineken, which I hate but that's just me.  The next one down the list is a bit darker and not bad but not great).  All in all, not a bad little place and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a reasonably priced and casual place to grab some authentic Italian pizza.
