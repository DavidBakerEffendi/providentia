I love this place! The brisket is amazing; tender with the tastiest pepper rub. The sides are great too. The first time I visited, I had the German potato salad and the second time, I had the coleslaw. Even though the brisket is my favorite, the ribs are outstanding as well. The atmosphere is very cool; dim, exposed brick - often accompanied by live music. The staff is very friendly. The last group I was with is well-versed in BBQ and they agreed that this is the best they have had. While I am not a big eater, one of my friends remarked that they have never seen me eat so much! I highly recommend visiting. Go tonight!
