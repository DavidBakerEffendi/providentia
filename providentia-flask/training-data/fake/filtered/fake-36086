My husband and I have found our new FAVORITE Italian restaurant.  We were in Phildelphia during Christmas week and the conceirge (of a fairly "high end" hotel) recommended this place to us.  At first we thought he was kidding (who goes to S. Street anymore??). He assured us he was not kidding.  So, we went.  WOW!!!!  The food is amazing!!!  The pasta, the pizza (my husband had a white pizza with duck and drizzled with balsamic), the bread were just delicious!!  The staff were very friendly  (even the owner who checked in on us twice to make sure that everything was good....it wasn't good....it was great!". We live about 1.5 hours away but we have promised ourselves to make the drive back to the city to dine at La Fourno again and again. Make the trip to S. Street. Go to La Fourno!
