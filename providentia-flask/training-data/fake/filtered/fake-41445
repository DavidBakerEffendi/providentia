I hate giving this place a so-so review because I have been coming here since I was a kid and my family hails from the same town they come from in Cuba. First of all, every time I have been there in the last ten years there is always some poor Latin American children (that are sent in by their abusive parents) to sell trinkets and flowers. It feel like one is in Cancun and you don't know what to do when they come to your table. I don't know why they allow this, it's abusive. Those poor children - their parents should be arrested. The Spanish omelet was flat - it's supposed to be thick and full of potatoes. The black beans where OK but a little cold and they needed something to give it an oomph! The arroz con pollo (chicken and rice) was OK, but again it was missing something and it could've used some beer in the cooking water (this is an old Cuban cooking technique for this dish). It also had no saffron (I know saffron is very expensive) and only a yellow food coloring was used. However, here come the good things: The Ropa Vieja (shredded beef in a tomato sauce) was very good, and well seasoned - the chef knows what he is doing! The plantains were sweet and plump. The croquettes nice - good appetizers! The sangria was good too, as was the Cuban coffee. The service was also very nice and friendly. I like the fact that they are on Facebook and are reaching out to their fans and the community in general. The Facebook interaction is good because the owners give a heads up of what's happening and what the specials are. Overall it's a good place but it can still do with a bit of improving even after it was featured on the Food Network Guy show. Another good thing is that the subway EL is down the street for those city dwellers that want to travel to Queens. My encouragement to the public is for them to come and visit the place.
