I love this place!  I've been here a few times with friends (including celebrating my bday here)  and we have enjoyed it each time.  The decor and ambience is really cool - I love the look of the spot.  I also like how there is an upstairs with a separate bar.  The food is also really tasty - I've had the mac n cheese and the parm truffle fries (which are addicting).  I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about with regards to service - I found everyone, especially Mandi, to be super friendly and efficient.  The music is great, the drinks were well made, and the atmosphere was chill and classy.  It's a great place to watch sports (they have TONS of flat screens) or you are just looking for a fun place out with friends.  Def check it out!
