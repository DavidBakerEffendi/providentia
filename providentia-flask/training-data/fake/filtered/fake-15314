came here about a week ago, had an alright time. our server was awkward and food was a resounding 'meh'. though the potato leek soup was absolutely divine! definitely the best part of the experience. it is a cute space though..i just wish the price, quality of the ingredients and care in menu choice was reflected in the taste of the dishes.
