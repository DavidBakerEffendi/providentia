I was really stoked about coming to Loco Pez, I heard really good things about the place. However, I was disappointed last night. It wasn't so much a big deal beings that it took forever to get from the entrance & over crowded bar to the back where the "hostess" would be. I told her we were excited since it was our 1st time...she mumbled turning her head to point to someone else to speak to. The wait was 20-30, no problem. So, we asked the bartender for a drink menu and he made someone else get it. I was really uncomfortable to be there with my boyfriend, no one was polite that worked there and the menu was very very limited. It is cash only.
