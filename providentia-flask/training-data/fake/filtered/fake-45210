I went in for lunch this afternoon and immediately loved the atmosphere. The staff was all very friendly and we were seated right away. Dayna, our server was extremely helpful and gave us great recommendations. We started with ham croquettes and a chicken empanada. Then I had the cubano sandwich while my friend had the turkey cubano. Both were delicious and we will definitely be back soon.
