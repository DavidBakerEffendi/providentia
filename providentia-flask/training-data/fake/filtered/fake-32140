We hosted a holiday luncheon at Edison Ale House even though we had many other venues to choose from.  The manager, Tom, was amazing to work with and tailored our buffet lunch to our budget.  The food was amazingly good:  Chicken Francese, Roasted Sirloin of Beef, Penne Vodka, rolls, salad, and drinks.  We made changes up until the last day and the management and staff graciously made the adjustments.   The service was great!  Everything was ready for us when we arrived and we never had to ask for refills.  Yvette was right there to make sure everyone was happy. No other bar/restaurant in the area provides the level of service that we experienced at Edison Ale House.  I've been there before and have never been disappointed with the menu items we chose (pizza, salads, burgers). We all have choices on how and where to spend our money.  Edison Ale House will always be my first choice!  Everything is consistently good and the service is great!
