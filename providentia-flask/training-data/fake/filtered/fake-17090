I ate lunch at The Sea Fire Grill twice and it was fantastic both times. I'm a fairly picky eater but I had no problem ordering off the menu.  The Organic Scottish Salmon and Pan Roasted Organic Chicken were delicious!!  They were cooked to perfection.  The decor of the restaurant is very elegant and there is a fireplace in the back room that adds a nice romantic touch to the space.
