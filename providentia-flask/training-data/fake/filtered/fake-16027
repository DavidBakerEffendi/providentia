We made a reservation for dinner on Christmas day back in November for our party of 6. The restaurant cancelled our reservation 2 days in advance (December 23rd) because they decided to close the place for the holidays all of a sudden. They probably didn't get enough reservations or something... They tried to reach us by phone, but my phone didn't work properly in the US. So we got a cancellation email from Open Table. It didn't really matter that they could't reach us by phone, as they were cancelling on us anyway. We were very dissapointed. Being Belgians ourselves, we were looking forward to having our Christmas dinner here...
