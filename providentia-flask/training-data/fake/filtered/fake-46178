Just to be clear, I love the Modern ramen at Ippudo. If you like great ramen and don't care about the service then scroll down to the next review. Last night would have been my fourth time there. I was told that there was a 30-minute wait for a table for two when I told the hostess to put my name down. My husband has not arrived yet and had to run over to Kmart pharmacy across the street to get some saline solution for my baby. I made it back 20 minutes later, so did my husband and we checked back in with the hostess. She said maybe 15 minutes more. So we stationed purselves at the bar - it was happy hour - 2 for 1 Kirins!  We stayed put even though I'm not a big fan of crowded bars. After about 20 minutes, the other hostess went around asking for everyone's name so I figure, hey they're doing their best. After 10 more minutes, there was a bigger group that clearly came after us  that got called so I approached the hostess. She said exasperatingly - we called your name 20 minutes ago! I go, no we were right at the bar we would have heard. She kept insisting - I called your name 20 minutes ago - we looked for you at the bar, outside, and nobody came! It's gonna be another 15 minutes. No apologies, excuses, nothing. Of course we canceled and left. A big bowl of beautiful ramen is not worth being treated this way. Went to Ramen Setagaya. Maybe they think that being insanely popular makes them think that it gives them a right to be rude.
