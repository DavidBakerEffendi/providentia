WOW...The Paris Inn has all you need or could ever want......WOW is the best way to describe how you are treated here....I had my daughter's sweet sixteen party on September 14th 2013, The food was perfect , I had 80 guest not one had a negative comment, every time I went to a table I was told how nice the place was, how good the food was and how nice the server's were. The service was outstanding, Liz is the cream of the crop. The day after the party my Aunt passed away I had to find a place for the re pass, I called Liz she said "no problem"...."I will take care of everything"....and that she did. If you are having a party or just want a place for lunch please do not hesitate go to the Paris Inn, It's run by family and  they treat you like family.  I will be going back for a Marching Band and Cheerleader Banquet Dinner I have to plan. After my experience I would not even consider going anywhere else!
