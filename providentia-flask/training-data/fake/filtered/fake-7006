'Excellent' is one word to sum up our continuing experience at the Mysore Woodlands in Parsippany. Set in surroundings that remind one instantly of rural South India, the service is warm and the food is great. Both the buffet and the a-la-carte are generally outstanding, the North Indian items on the chat buffet Tuesday and Friday evenings could do with some improvement though.
