I don't brag about places i go, nor do i usually take the time to discuss them. But after leaving Max Fish, i make a point to bring it up. If you've ever been to a Trans Siberian Orchestra concert, you leave in awe, and wanting more. So when we left the concert for dinner at Max Fish, it was like a slice of Heaven. The 2 compliment each other. Atmosphere, food and staff were UN believable ! We spent 3 1/2 hours eating 5 courses, and left not even feeling stuffed. The pace was perfect, and as each plate was taken away, it alerted you to the fact that another exciting dish was on its way out. The only way i can sum up this awesome meal and experience is by these 4 words: " In House Pastry Chef "   This needs to be on your " Bucket list "   .
