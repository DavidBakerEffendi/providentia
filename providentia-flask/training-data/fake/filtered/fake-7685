This BYO is my go-to place for Italian when friends are in town.  The owner and staff make you feel like you are eating at their home.  The food is delicious and the portions are generous.  I can bring my friends with dietary restrictions here because of their gluten free offerings and I have never had a bad meal here.  I strongly recommend.
