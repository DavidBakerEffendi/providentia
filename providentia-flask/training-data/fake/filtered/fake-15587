Thank you! I have to say that this place is by far the best little gem in Jersey.  I'm a New Yorker through and through but unfortunately I have had to take up a job in Jersey, Newark that is.  I was truly unhappy about having to leave the City but this place makes it all better. I feel like I found a New York style sushi place at Jersey prices.  The place is beautiful, sophisticated and yet cozy.  The Sushi is awesome! Fresh and very well priced.  I was coming for dinner on a regular basis and now that they started the $12 Bento Box lunch specials I find myself here twice a day.  Anyway, I just want to say thank you having this place here, you make my workday bearable.
