Nicest people work here and great people at the bar.  The food is excellent and you won't get better wings and place else.  It is one of the last bars that are about customer service. It is nice to be sitting at the bar and have a good time while being able to talk to the person next to you without having to yell over music that is making your ears bleed.   This is the only bar that I will continue to go to and look forward to going.  Great bar for sports games and good times!
