I love Thai Kitchen III!  I went for the first time years ago with a friend who is gluten-free and the menu was safe for her to eat.  The food is absolutely delicious!  The waiters are constantly making sure your glass is full (literally) and they are very helpful explaining the items on the menu. The menu is very detailed and the spice-control using the elephants gives you the liberty to make your dish mildly hot or very very hot!  I love the service and I haven't eaten anything there that I didn't like.  P.S. Get dessert!  They're all amazing!  I choose to eat here for my Birthday with my parents and every time I come home from college I make a point of eating here with a friend.  I can't get enough of it!
