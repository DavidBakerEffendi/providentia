Roberta's is kind of the go-to "special occasion" place for my housemates, but I'm really not feeling it. I don't think it's worth the price nor the wait, to be honest. It's great that they use quality ingredients. It's great that they have their own small garden. It's great that they are doing good business in the neighborhood. Still, I can't get over the price and the wait. Definitely not the best pizza I've had in New York. On more than one occasion it's been underdone and dough-y. I've had both super patronizing service and a server who couldn't have cared less. It's also super loud inside, so be prepared for that. After waiting 1.5+ hours, it can be a little overwhelming to be crammed into one of the picnic bench style tables next to strangers and surrounded by so much noise. This place would be so nice if it were chill and a bit cheaper. Oh well.
