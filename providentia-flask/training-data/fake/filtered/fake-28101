great physical space ruined completely by really bad really loud music as some of the other commenters have mentioned. food wasn't anything special at all. i could easily make at home and frankly do a better job. our waiter was very good, patient, friendly etc. that was the redeeming quality. otherwise not sure why this place exists.
