An Excellent restaurant.  The hostess Ariana is very nice and friendly unlike in many other ethnic restaurants in the area.  The menu has a large selection of ethnic Afghani cuisines.  I tried several of the items on the menu, and they were Amazing. It is  difficult to recommend just one item, you simply cannot go wrong with your choice.  However, I do recommend getting the Samosa and the lentil soup as a start, both are very good. If you are a first timer you might want to consult Ariana with her recommendation for an entry. Not only the quality of the food is excellent, but the portions are quite large. I am not sure about the other reviewers complaining about the portions; if those portions are small, then you should stick to an all you can eat buffet. I end up taking half of the meal to go, because there is simply too much food. In addition, the atmosphere in the restaurant is very nice, quite place with some nice music in the background. I recommend this restaurants for families, couples, or if you are just looking to get a nice lunch or dinner with friends or alone.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
