Yuk. I was so turned off by the rude staff and stupid racist signs they had that I just took one bite of what looked like steamed rubber and threw it in the trash. It looked and tasted like a heart attack. I don't know how bad of a food you must be used to eating to enjoy this greasy rubber looking hot mess that they serve. I would not even feed this to my dog so I definitely don't recommend this for any other human being.
