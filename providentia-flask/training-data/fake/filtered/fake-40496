We had an EXCELLENT experience at Bridget Foy's. From the location, the Service, the Food and the atmosphere. Our waitress Bianca was great!  We sat out on the street at a tall table.  Great draft beer. Started the night with muscles in a coconut curry sauce. That was so good (I confess I was a bit hesitant with those flavors mixed) but found myself looking for a spoon when it was all eaten so I could finish all the sauce. I ate all sides sooooo good.  My daughter had a veggie burger that was 'meaty" and tasty, my sister had a really nice specials salad and my husband had mac and cheese and sides too.  The waiter with the  handle bar mustache helped us out determining what the 21st amendment covered.  We were curious because that was the name of one of our beers.  The south philly location (no trouble parking) was a fun place to sit and watch folks come and go.  I'd like to go back again soon.
