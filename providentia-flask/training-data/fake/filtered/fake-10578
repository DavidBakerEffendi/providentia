Stopped in for dinner and i highly recommend the spot.  Nice small space.  Pretty busy but we only had to wait about 30 mins at 8pm on a saturday.  Solid menu and cheap oysters.  Order a side of fries, they don't get much better.  Overall it was a very comfortable, casual place with great food.  Waitress was cute/nice and even gave us complimentary jameson nightcaps.  The salted caramel pudding was also a nice touch.  I'll definitely be back
