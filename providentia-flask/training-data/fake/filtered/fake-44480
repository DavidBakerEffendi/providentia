McLaddens has such a great atmosphere. My husband and I tend to come in on Sundays - he loves how many beers are on tap! The service is also great - there has been the same girl waitressing each Sunday, and she couldn't be more helpful with the tap selections! Definitely making this our regular Sunday spot!
