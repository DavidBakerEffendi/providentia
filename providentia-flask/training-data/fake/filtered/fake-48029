I had my friends birthday party at this place.  It was recommended by a buddy that works up there near 54th, and it was a great call.  The 3 Monkeys is an awesome place if you like a good times, sports, many, many draft beers, and food that is off the beaten path.  You might be able to get wings and a burger on the menu but the mussels were amazing, their sliders kicked ass, and it's just better and different than the typical american fare bar menu. The service was great. The bartenders all know their draft beers.  They know where their from, and most importantly how to describe how they taste. Lastly, the atmosphere was great for a Theater District bar.  It isn't very touristy,  Happy Hour specials were great, and they had a DJ later on.  I'm looking forward to going back there sometime soon.
