Every Monday I get ravioli and sauce from Cuginos. Their food is fresh and delicious, the store is clean and we organized, and the staff are always helpful. I recommend them for a walk in lunch of yummy sandwiches, or quick and easy take home food to prepare a fulfilling meal for the family. I really can't say enough wonderful things about them! I highly recommend the ravioli (I've had them all- cheese to crabmeat!!) with their vodka sauce. They always have great specials as well!!
