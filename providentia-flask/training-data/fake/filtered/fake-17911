Sad to say, Giotto ain't what it used to be. One example among many:  the tuna tartar, which used to be 100% tuna, is now 30% tuna and 70% chopped tomatoes.  Asked the waiter about it and got a shrug.  The specials?  Same tired "hits" over and over again (the seafood pasta, for example, has been a special for at least five years).  The place is always jammed with the usual NJ slobs who'll eat anything (look at the crappy  wines they bring in) and think it's marvelous. The decor?  Oh please...   Stale and moldy.  One thing hasn't changed:  The poor service.  You're rushed for the next seating from the minute you sit down, and instead of one waiter or waitress taking care of you, you get a succession of snotty wait staff who treat you like a pest.  It's very sad.  This used to be a terrific restaurant, but over the last few years it seems Roberto and Lucca just stopped caring.  They'll milk it for all they can until people get wise and walk away.
