I was here with my boyfriend last Saturday and we really couldn't resist but to say WOW!!! first of all, our server was superb. His personality really makes anyone feels welcome in the house especially when my boyfriend was about to ask for a second drink, he asked first, in a funny way, "I guess your second drink is calling?" Besides, he explained every single questions we have about the food with enthusiasm and not even felt irritated like most of the servers in the city does. As a fun note, one can really sees that he stands out of the rest because he is the only Asian server with as cool hair style. Food wise- i have the Filete with medium- comes out just good, tender juicy as how the server said it is.... my boyfriend was stuff with the seafood paella. good job!!!! definitely will be a regular here soon.
