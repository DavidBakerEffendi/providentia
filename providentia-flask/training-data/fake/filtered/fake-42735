I eat at Elixir at least 2-3 times per month!! I can't say enough about Keith, the bartender! I never have to ask for my drink as it is sitting on the table before my butt can hit the seat. I have never had a bad meal here. My favorites are the Roasted Chicken, Truffle fries, Caesar salad and the Salmon! I will not tell you my favorite drink as I don't want them to run out of it before I return again!..LOL...The Owners are wonderful and did I say Keith was the bomb.com??? Enjoy!!!~
