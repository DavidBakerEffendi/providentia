I used to live right in the heart of Center City.  I'd go to Sabrina's Cafe when I could.  It's right in Italian Market.  I like weekend brunch the best because the line is ALWAYS very long but worth the wait!  We killed time exploring the Italian Market or just chatting with other strangers on the line list.   I have eaten there for weekend brunch, for weekday brunch, lunch, and dinner.  I cannot emphasize enough that if you are up for an adventure, weekend (especially Sunday) brunch is the best!  Due to a scheduling conflict, our only option that one day was weekday lunch so I could show it off to a woman from Quebec.  She fell in love with Sabrina's Cafe!   Regardless of the time of the day, I always left Sabrina's Cafe very satisfied.  Just one suggestion if you have no patience in line:  it's quicker to get a table when the group is at least 4 people - as in less than one hour wait, guaranteed.
