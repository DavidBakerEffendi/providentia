Great Pizza... this stuff is the best! Restaurant has tight seating... its not the best for young kids... and there is a line you stand in that can take quite a long time. However, if you are with friends and have time, it can be a great evening out with some of the best pizza in the city! Crust is crisp, with a great flavor.  Topings are very fresh.  Tomato sauce was just right!
