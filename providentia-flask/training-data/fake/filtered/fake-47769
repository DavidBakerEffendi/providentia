SO OVERRATED! My boyfriend and I had been wanting to try this place for ages...went to brunch which was ok, nothing great. We went for dinner and it was terrible...we both ordered sea bass which was so salty that it was inedible and we both sent it back! Something I rarely have ever done. Then we got risotto instead which was not much better. I don't mind a cozy restaurant but it there were so many tables in there it felt claustrophobic. There are so many other great restaurants in this neighborhood I would go to Applewood or Al di La instead.
