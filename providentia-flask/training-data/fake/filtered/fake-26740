I happened to be in Hartford for a Phish show and I saw Woody's featured on the T.V. show Man vs. Food. I stopped in for a dog and wasn't disappointed at all. Their Â "Deputy Dog" (which is a hot dog covered in pulled pork, bacon and cheese) should have songs written about it! Absolutely delicious!! My only complaint is that it is a little hard to find because its in the lobby of a building. I must have driven back and forth three times before realizing where it was. They should have more signs outside so people know where it is.
