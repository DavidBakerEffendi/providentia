My fiance and I were craving good shabu shabu.  We decided to venture out and try a new spot and found shabu tastu.   After waiting 30 minutes we were sat (not bad for a saturday night with no reservations in the east village) and had a fabulous meal! The food was great, service ok but everyone was helpful and friendly.  The meat was fresh and tasted fabulous. I would recommend the prime rib eye and pork.  And in the end the reduced broth with veggies were a treat. I can't wait to go back!
