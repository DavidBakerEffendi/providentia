My waiter was very attentive - too attentive. Maybe because it was early and not very busy. The wine list is good, but what's up with the food? I got the Sea Bass. Came out in 5 minutes... Wasn't good. Not for the price. I like the ambiance, but there are soooooo many other places in NY, i won't be eating here again.
