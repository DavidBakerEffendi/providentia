Visited Philly and " heard" good things about the place . Actually, I just left the place and am now writing this review ( seated) from my hotel bathroom.... I thought to myself, "whoa", $18 for a buttermilk fried chicken must be the best chicken in Philly. Not even close. The chicken was slathered in honey and did not have any seasoning. Apparently the establishment thinks buttermilk is the only secret to making good chicken. I guess my fault for selecting the item and should've gone to North Philly. I was also looking forward to the mashed potatoes, but again was disappointed. Straight box potatoes which should never be on an $18 plate. The total bill was $60, but at least my lady liked her burger.  Tried it once , but won't try it twice.  One must be careful to trust what Yelpers say, especially if they probably have little experience to compare true fried chicken to that of Silk Diner's. Oh well, off to Chipotle
