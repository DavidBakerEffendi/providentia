My friend took me for my birthday dinner here and I have to tell you that I was truly impressed. I ordered their veal marsala and it was perfectly moist and tender with a hint of marsala saucece garnered with mushrooms sliced to perfection . The service was fast and efficient and the owner always took the time to find out how we are. The ambience was calm and warm and the the lighting subdued Â and not blaring! I definitely will recommend this restaurant to anyone.!
