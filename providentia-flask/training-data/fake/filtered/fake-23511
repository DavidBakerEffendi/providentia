I recommend this place to seafood lovers.  I had the scallops which were wonderful, but there really weren't enough of them. Although the portions were a bit small for the seafood dishes, they were delicious and well prepared. I went there with some family that catches their own fish and hunts for their own food on a quiet night and they were pleased with the New York fare.  The linguini was probably the best value on the menu and was very tasty too.
