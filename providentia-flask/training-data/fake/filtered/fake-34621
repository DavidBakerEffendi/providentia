Went there on Friday.  The food was GREAT!  I I was with four other people and they loved the food as well.  I thought the place was absolutely beautiful...loved the decor.  I don't have one complaint.  The service was great  and the food was reasonably priced.  Looking forward to going back again and again.  I would definitely recommend this place.
