If you want Thai food in New Haven, you can (1) grab some greasy Thai at the food carts, (2) go to one of the nasty Thai places downtown on Chapel Street, or (3) go to Rice Pot.  Their noodle dishes are pretty good and their curries are fantastic - especially the panang curry.  In fact, Rice Pot is one of the few Thai places that even serves panang curry.  It's definitely worth the trek up State Street.
