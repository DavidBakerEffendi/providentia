Today was our second time at Moonshine for a work lunch and we were definitely not disappointed.  We called ahead this time in order to make room for our group of 9 and to request tables in the back, which they provided.  Lunch time here is the perfect time because it's not too crowded and there's enough room for a bigger group  The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating while quickly taking our order.  The appetizers we ordered (buffalo chicken dip and calamari) were just as amazing as the first time we had them a few weeks ago.  Everyone tried new entrees this time and we were all very pleased with our choices.   Among the lunches were the strawberry walnut salad, the blackened chicken pesto gnocchi, the mediterranean panini, the chili, and a few others.  Everyone left Moonshine in a happy and full mood.  We look forward to eating there again!
