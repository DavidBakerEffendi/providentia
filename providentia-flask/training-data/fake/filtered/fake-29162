This was the best Chinese food I've ever had. And I'm not a Chinese food snob. It wasn't greasy or oily or covered with all kinds of who-knows-what sauces. I had vegetable fried rice, it was full of vegetables, good ones, and nary an onion to be found. The rice was actually fried, not sloshed around in an oil-filled wok. Shrimp and broccoli, perfectly cooked broccoli, the smaller size shrimp (not the giant ones which are too chewy). And fried vegetable dumplings which were huge and beautiful and filled with chopped mushrooms. Â The price was close to what you'd expect to pay at a Takee-Outee. I don't think I'll ever get Chinese food anywhere else again.
