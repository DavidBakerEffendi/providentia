HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SERVICE! I ate here last night was very torn. Although the food was VERY good (one of the best fish places in the area) the service was just awful. I waited for a table for about 20-30 and saw two couples walk out while waiting. Tables were available, they just were not cleaned up from previous diners. After finally sitting down, I ordered one of their specials, a soft shell crab wrap. About 10-15 minutes after I ordered I was informed that they used the last crabs and did not want to serve them because they were not up to par. We were chatting with the two tables on either side of us and they were not happy with the service as well. Although it must have been an off night, it made a lasting impression. I am very hesitant to return.
