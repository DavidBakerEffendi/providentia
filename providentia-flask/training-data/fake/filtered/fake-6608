This used to be one of my favorite restaurants! Yesterday we went for lunch. I ordered red curry with chicken and rice. I went to eat the rice and there was a bug sitting in the top of my rice. I sent it back so upset! This had been a good restaurant in the last few years. The waitress brought me a second plate of rice. I took a bite and then spread the ball of rice out on the plate and to my horror there was another bug! Why didn't we leave at this point, I have no idea. Do you believe she took the bug off the plate and rubbed it between her fingers...why, yes it was a bug! We had to ask her to remove the plates of rice. Then, I try to eat some of my curry but I was so upset! The waitress wants to know if we want to take the leftovers home....NO THANKS! Then, the bill comes...she charges us for our complete meal....including my dish w/ bugs! I told her I was not paying for th bug dish. Give me a break!!! Still not feeling well this morning....and it is Thanksgiving day. :(
