Our family just had a wonderful dinner at the Gold Standard Cafe in University City/West Philadelphia - and I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. I had e-mailed in advance about our dinner because it was a birthday celebration for two family members, and I got incredible individual attention. They seated us by their cozy fireplace (chilly evening)  in their absolutely beautiful dining room and, after our delicious meal, came in with a candle-bedecked cake the chef prepared specially for us. It was wonderful! The room burst into song! Our host could not have been friendlier, stopping to chat with us and with other diners and making us all feel like we had come into his personal living room! Our dinners included a steak, a quiche, a veggie burger, and  salmon carbonara (mine) - and each of us raved about the quality of the food! In fact, I think we've established a new family tradition - birthday dinners at the Gold Standard Cafe from now on! I recommend this restaurant to everyone - you will totally enjoy it! And I love University City and the 48th & Baltimore Ave. location - such a beautiful part of Philadelphia - diverse, fun, kindafunky, different. Oh, and I see one reviewer complaining about a wait - we made reservations ahead of time - it's a very popular place for good reason! We didn't have to wait because we planned in advance. AND THE SERVICE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER!
