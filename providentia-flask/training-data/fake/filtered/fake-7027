We went out for a girls night dinner with a new baby and were expecting a long wait.  However, we kept getting passed up it seemed and waited a LONG time.  Finally the owner realized we had been waiting for a long time and recognized that we kept getting skipped, and had a new baby (who was very well behaved).  He made it right for us by automatically bringing us free appetizers and providing us a table immediately.   The food was awesome and I would most definitely return because the experience ended positively for us.
