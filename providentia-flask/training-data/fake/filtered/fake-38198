Greek Lady is the best! It's the perfect spot to grab a quick dinner with friends, or get food delivered late at night. The food is tasty, convenient, and cheap, and there's always so much to choose from. The salads are HUGE and the mozzarella sticks are the perfect comfort food. I would also recommend anything on their brunch menu. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. Even on a busy day, they get your order out as quickly as possible. And from my experience, their delivery is always faster than expected. Every time I have ordered Greek Lady off GrubHub, the food has been at my door in under 30 min (although it's usually closer to 15). Bottom Line: Whenever I need to get great food at a great price with awesome service, I know Greek Lady is the place to go.
