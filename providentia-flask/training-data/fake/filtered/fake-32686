I have been coming here for the past 5 years and every time I go there is constantly new specials and new updates and ideas. The manger is a very nice guy and is 90% of the time available at the PUB. Every time we go there he comes to our table and shakes our hands, the same that he does to all the patrons there. They changed their menu 8 months ago and they have very good appetizer selection along with new sandwiches and wraps. Thee Pub is best know for its best Thin Crust Pizza in Town and the Buffalo wings. Now they have Tuesday Night special which they called "Buffalo Night Out", all buffalo items is $5 and 50 cent wings along with beer specials if you have an orange tshirt on. All their employees are dressed up in orange tshirts and sneakers. Every time we go their we always have a good service. It is a very friendly bar, everyone knows each other. It has a better atmosphere now than when we started coming here. overall it is a good place to come and hang out and have a cold beer and some good food.
