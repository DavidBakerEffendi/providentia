visited ruts hut today, gotta tell ya, if you've had a nathans coney island dog, ny style, these "rippers" from ruts hut are ghastly!!!! they taste like hot bologna on a bun...no snap, not much real hot dog taste, very bland...i guess im spoiled because we have the best here in ny...come try nathans in coney island brooklyn, and then see what you think of your beloved ruts hut.....no comparison in taste, quality and true hot dog satisfaction!!!!
