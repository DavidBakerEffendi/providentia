Went for a weekday lunch and at $8 it was awesome.  Wait staff very nice.  order nice pot of green tea and proceeded to buffet.  Awesome lobster tails, whole prawns, coconut shrimp, wonderful fresh asparagus, salads, clams on half shell, and shrimp cocktail.  Very good food.  Owner even brought prawns to our table when i said that my husband wanted some but another diner kept taking almost entire tray.  Good food and will go back soon.
