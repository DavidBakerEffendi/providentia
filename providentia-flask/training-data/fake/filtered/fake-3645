My coworkers have been raving about this place for months so I stopped in yesterday.  My friends and I arrived just as they opened at 5 and we sat at an outside table for 3 and a half hours eating and drinking.  The whole place quickly got packed but the staff never made us feel rushed.  Instead they brought us a free round of drinks and chatted amiably.  Michael overheard me talking about my upcoming birthday and took the initiative to bring me a massive brownie with a candle.  The service was outstanding.  We felt very much like we had found a neighborhood gem worth returning to regularly.   We had the burger, warm lamb salad and flatbread.  All were excellent.  We just need to go back and try the fried chicken now.  It looked delicious!
