Fabulous!!! Tight quarters inside - unbelievable food ensures you don't care.  Guacamole Fresh, Fresh, Fresh. The ceviche was awesome, guacamole was very good. I had the spicy jalepeno margarita & it was excellent! The food portions are small and a little pricey & the place is super packed. Service is awesome!! And friendly !!! Next visit will be brunch. !!!  And soon!!!
