A rediscovery of an old favorite! I had to stop by because I was nearby (I normally travel north from my apt. on Saint Marks). Coming here is like traveling to Italy for a moment. (And yes I've been there & am & speak Italian.) Â Always delicious. Always authentic. The rule of "Good, fast or cheap?... Pick two." applies. When they're busy, you may have to wait five or ten minutes longer BUT ITS WORTH IT. It's inexpensive & delicious. Support this great local shop.
