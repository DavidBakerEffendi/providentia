Great addition to the city. I've been to this place a few times now, and I've been impressed everytime. Once it was hopping with a Dj that was mixing dance with classic soul tracks, and on a weeknight it was more like a comfortable neighborhood bar with really tasty food and a nice beer selection. Â One time I could tell that the bartender was new to the trade, but she was super friendly so i didn't mind. Overall, I'm glad to have this place around.
