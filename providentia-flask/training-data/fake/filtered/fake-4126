What are two things that I need to order when I'm at a German restaurant? Beer and Sausage. What I found? A huge assortment of beers! 16 on tap and 178 bottled and 10 canned! Talk about choice overload! My friends and I couldn't just have one, we had to try a few. Each different type of beer came in a different glass and the beers were just absolutely tasty! I ordered the Bratwurst and tried a bite of my friend's order of Schnitzel! Let me tell you, the Bratwurst was just the best! It left me wanting to order a second plate, but I was awfully full. The Schnitzel was delicious, but I'm more of a Bratwurst type of person. I am definitely coming back here the next time I'm in town again!
