This restaurant capped off my recent trip to NYC to visit family for the holidays,and I have to say, I was blown away by everything about it. The ambiance was perfect. It was dinner on the night after Christmas (12/26/12), so it wasn't crowded, but the customers who came out in the rain, like ourselves, seemed to enjoy dining in such a top-notch restaurant. Our menu was as follows: The sparkling water was plentiful and the waitstaff did not allow our glasses to go below half full. Very attentive. I had a ginger margarita, and let me just say, my local bar needs to learn a thing or two from the bartenders at ABC. Squash toast with ricotta cheese----so good it makes you wanna holla! Crab Toast---Spectacular. Did I say how much we love seafood, anyway? Mushroom Pizza with that farm fresh egg in the middle. I thought the egg would be over easy, but it was just a raw egg. Wasn't keen on it mind-wise, but my palate sang! Brocoli Salad with Sweet Potato cubes and what tasted like a pistachio pesto! ....to die for! Shared a Lobster --- delicious! To top everything off, we shared Gingerbread Cake (totally delectable) and Three scoops of sorbet (heaven!). We left completely satisfied with our meal, delighted with the service. From the coat-check girl, to the hostesses, to the servers, we were taken care of. All of our needs were met before we knew we had them. Wally, our waiter was so very knowledgeable, his assistant was extremely attentive, Â and though my companion had dined there before, their suggestions in tandem were right on the money. I will definitely return when I'm in the city again!
