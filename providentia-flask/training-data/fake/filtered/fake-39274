Dry, dry, dry - every dish is lacks sauce. The ribs are dry. The re-fried beans haven't been fried even once - they're tasteless - no cheese, no crusty edges.  If you've ever been to a real Mexican restaurant, you'll be disappointed.  God for the salsa and chips - they are the only thing that's good or qauthentic on the menu
