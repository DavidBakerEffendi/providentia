had the all you can eat mussels deal. it was alright, nothing too special. the first pot was filled the 2-lb they stated. ordered a next batch and it was half the first pot's size.. and got the third pot and then it got smaller again. i mean i get it's all you can eat, but why are you giving me less mussels that i'm supposed to get in the pots after the first pot?! the fries were good though =D
