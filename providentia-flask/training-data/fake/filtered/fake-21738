I am writing a review for Bills Friendly Auto service. I am relieved to hear, recently, that Bill is no longer in charge. I was told he sold it a year and a half ago. I read bad reviews that were two and three years old. One review said he was "condescending", another, and this is my favorite "the worst of the worst- buy life insurance before you bring your car in." I knew him years ago. His arrogance interfered with focusing on his customers. I recommend to the new management that they change the name. He changed the name shortly after Lenny passed in 1987. They can make a new start. New name, new attitude. If my husband and I are on Long Island, and need help. We will bring the car in now that he is not there.
