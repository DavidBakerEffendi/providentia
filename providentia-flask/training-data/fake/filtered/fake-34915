Alright, the food's pretty tasty- people who dine here are interesting, the alley it's down is cool, you feel cool inside, etc. Â  However, this isn't a "hidden treasure" in any way, everyone on earth goes here at least once - and since i live near it, i am frequently asked by european tourists " Which way is Freeman?" All i want to know is... WHY does the staff look like they're fresh off the Oregon trail??????
