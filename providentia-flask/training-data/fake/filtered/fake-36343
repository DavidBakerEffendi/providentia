First off...had to make the reservation over a month in advance, and still only got a table at 5:30.  Just sayin.  staff was helpful and nice. the decor is fine but honestly nothing special, although the skylight that opens up is pretty cool.  STICK TO THE PASTA! Here's what we had... Apps... Raw Yellowtail - didnt love and not a lot of flavor Braised Short Ribs Of Beef - really tasty, actually tasted like beef stew. Creamy Polenta - f'ing amazing...seriously.  was licking the bowl.  if you like mushrooms, you have to order this. Pastas... Black Maccheroni...was actually not as good as i'd hoped and a little cold Tagliatelle...delicious cream sauce, highly reccomend Spaghetti..basic but very tasty for plain spaghetti Entree... Seared Scallops...actually was pretty dissapointed by this.  didnt like the texture or flavor, and the cauliflower tasted like something i made.  i didnt even finish it, which for me, doesn't happen. waiter was very knowledgeable and helpful and i would certainly go back...as long as my boss is paying.
