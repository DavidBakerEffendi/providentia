Not just pizza! This place has the best veal and chicken francese that I have ever had. And by the "best" I mean better than the "29" Zagats-rated restaurants. The veal and chicken are always fresh and tender and the batter and francese sauce are always light with a wonderful lemon fragrance. I travel from Westchester NY to pick up these francese culinary masterpieces prepared by Pasquale - he has the magic touch! If I was offered my "last meal", I would choose veal francese from Pasquale's - it ain't just Pizza!
