Great addition to the neighborhood!  I especially love the sides -- rice and beans, fried plantains, and of course the desserts (5 stars for the big bananna cake). The empanadas are great too.  So it's a little noisy, but it is supposed to be a funky, festive atmosphere. We've also done take out a couple times when we were in the mood for a quiet evening.
