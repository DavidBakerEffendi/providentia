I grew up in Wayne and I've been waiting for a good pizza place for a while now.  I tried this place the other day and I was blown away, their pizza is amazing I don't know what they are doing different maybe it's the sauce, but it's best slice I've probably ever had.  When you walk in you don't even know what slice to choose because they have so many different selections you want to eat all of them!
