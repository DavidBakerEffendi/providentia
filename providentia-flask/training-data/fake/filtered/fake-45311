Passing through West Hartford and stopped at Rizzuto's. There were 3 people in our party, and with all the plates, the food was very hit-and-miss (some dishes were over-salted to the point of not being edible. The service was crap; our waiter was trying, but has no idea what to do at all. What Italian place doesn't have a table red? Most importantly, for the love of god, Tiramisu shouldn't be chocolate cake with some icing on it.
