Obviously people like this place. And to be honest the food is not bad if just a little over priced. What gets me time and again here (as I've given more than one shot due to ease) is the absolutely atrocious service. Having been in the industry myself I am very, if not overly patient and helpful when it comes to the quality of my server. Gauge me, give me time if I need it, pick up the pace if you can tell I got somewhere to go. Smile, fill my water and %20 plus is yours for the taking and I'll even clean up after myself. Don't get me wrong I've nothing against the French cafe style but why they must be equated with bad service may have it's roots in the obvious. When someone is seated, I believe 5 min. is a pretty long time to wait for a first approach. At ten min. I start to feel like I'm in the back of the bus. After dropping the check, 5 min. is a pretty long time to wait for a check back. At ten, I start to wonder if your interested in my $$ or if this one's on you. In a place this small there's no excuse. All you've got to do is look away from the tip of your nose to register your tables progress. No luck. This place would fold if not for their busser/food runner who appears to do ALL of the work. A better experience is right across the street at Rafaella for less $$, better coffee and a bit more elbow room.
