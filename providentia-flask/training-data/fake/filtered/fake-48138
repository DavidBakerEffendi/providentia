We had a great experience at this restaurant.  We were a party of three and we shared a selection of appetizers (crostini and meatballs) and pastas and then had the bronzini and rib eye (tasty and tender).   What a treat.  We loved it!  The food was plentiful and we took home a lot of leftovers.  We also had a selection of deserts.  The corn gelato sounded weird but we decided to try it and we loved it.  The staff was really great.  Even though every table was full they did not make us feel we had to hurry.  I can't wait to go back!
