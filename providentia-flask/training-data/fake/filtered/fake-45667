I have dreams about their spicy Korean fried chicken!! If I could eat that every day, with a huge side of kimchi, I would.  Theirs is the best I've had in awhile. Great atmosphere, too-beautiful & cozy at night.  I've been a few times, and now that they have outdoor seating I'm going to try their brunch!
