Went there today before a concert at the Prudential Center. Waited over an hour and a half for our food which never came. Waitress was polite, said they were having problems in the kitchen. I said we could not wait any longer. The manager handed me the bill. For what, I have no idea. I tip our waitress and explained why I was not paying for something I didn't get and left. I will never go here again. Don't waste your time at this place. Find another place to eat and save your time and money. I would not recommend this place to anyone. The staff is friendly,  but the manager is unbelievable.  The only way she must have a job there is that she is related to the owners.
