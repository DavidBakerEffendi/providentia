Just returned from the ConTav so disappointed....It has really gone down hill.  food was just ok.  But what was worse sitting in the bar, i ordered a drink from the specials menu, it was Maple Manhattan they were out of Maple Bourbon so she substituted Fireball..  Just awful so she offered to make another I ordered a regular Manhattan she served it in a shot glass and charged me $8.  Like to stay local but will not be going back anytime soon!
