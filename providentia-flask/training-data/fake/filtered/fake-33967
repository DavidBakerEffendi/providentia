If I could I would give this 10 Stars. Excellent pizza, excellent service, and great prices.  We can feed our family of 5 for under $20 including drinks.   Even my 8 yr old who is a cheese pizza purist loves this pizza, she just wont eat the blackened charred crust edge.  More for me. We have never had to wait more than 1/2 an hour to be seated and food is delivered to the table really quickly. Best pizza to try, recommended by a local, Mozzarella and Onion.  We were told they soak their onions in olive oil till tender.  So sweet and yummy. Because of work we get to live in new places every 3 months.  We tried to eat at the competitors: Sally's.  We placed our order and never got the pizza there, they lost our order at Sally's.
