This is a good Italian restaurant located in Hamden, CT.  I can't speak to the entrees as much, but the pizza and sandwiches are solid.  However, beware, as certain items are overpriced (ie some entrees and drinks to go).  One of my favorite items is the DiMatteo special combo (eggplant, meatball, and sausage parmigiana) for 6.95.  I come back when in the area, but make no mistake, not the same as some of the classic famous New Haven pizzerias.  I believe the owner is from New York originally, and I have found the food to be very satisfying, but this is no Modern or Pepe's.  Don't believe the amateurs and outsiders!
