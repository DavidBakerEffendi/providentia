I went to Beecher's on Friday night and every drink I had was delicious, the happy hour deals were fabulous and the macaroni and cheese was decadent. Our bartender was Phillip and he was super friendly and attentive. Not only did he make great drinks from the menu, but we asked him to create us something new and he made a cucumber, ginger lime drink that was to die for! I hope that in the future some of his drinks become regulars on the menu. Phillip made us some of the best drinks I have had in the city. I would recommend the Player's Club and also encourage you to give the bartenders some freedom to come up with a special creation - I am confident you will love it!
