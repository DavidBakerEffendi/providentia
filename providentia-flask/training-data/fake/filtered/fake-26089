WOw!  This is a great place to bring friends and family from out of town.  The prices are a bit steep but the food is fresh and delicious. I am not a crustacion lover but I absolutely love fresh fish.  I have been here three times and the only thing I can tell you abotu the appetizers is that they disappeared after our waiter put them on the table - Lol!  We had bbq wings, shrimp and some variant of fries for appetizers... my entrees have been pecan crusted talapia - yummy, pan seared salmon - delish, shrimp something or-nuthah -- (lips smacking nostalgically) and the sides, mashed sweet potato, asparagus tips, string beans, garlic mashed taters and something else! Oh and they DO serve nice drinks!  Good stuff folks!  But as I write this, I must admit that I worry my review will make my wait time for seating even longer. :-/  Ho-humm spread the joy right?
