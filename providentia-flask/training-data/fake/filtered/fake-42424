This restaurant cannot be described as your typical southwestern Tex-Mex restaurant, and they're proud of it! They manage to be something different, while still being recognizably "Mexican." Delicious offerings with lots of variety and interesting things to choose from if you're feeling adventurous. Cozy, intimate space that is clean and comfortable. Helpful, friendly staff. Reasonably fast service even when they're busy. Huge portions of delicious food, and they have large boxes on hand to help you take it home and finish it the next day!
