I've been going to Jean's for about 4-5 years now and their food never seizes to please my tastebuds, OR my wallet hahaha!. They have a wide choice of foods that cater to meat lovers to veggie lovers. Â I think I've suggested Jean's to just about everyone I know that goes to my school...and I'd suggest it to you too! Jean's is a very nice little Cafe/Deli, clean, great food, and amazing service/staff! I just wish it was open later!
