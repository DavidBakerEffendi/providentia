One of the best pizzas I've ever had. Yes, the wait is long, but after waiting even longer at Sally's for much worse pizza, that puts it all in perspective for me. Be aware - the lines can be deceptive.  Pepe's line is longer, but they have a larger dining room and move through it much faster.  Sally's line in shorter, but once you're seated, you WILL still wait more than 2 hours for your pizza. We ordered a bacon and mushroom pizza.  The cheese was perfectly melted and seasoned, the crust was the perfect thickness (actually thinness), the mushrooms were, well just regular mushrooms, and the bacon was the perfect mix of crispy but with plenty of fatty grizzle left on it.  Badly cooked, over-crisped, rock solid bacon can easily ruin a pizza, but Pepe's clearly pays attention to details. The waitress was really nice and rushed our food for us because we were in a hurry.  Great service as well. A gem really.  I didn't expect to get amazing pizza in New Haven, of all places, but Pepe's was a really nice surprise.
