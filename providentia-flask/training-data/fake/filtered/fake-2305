i LOVE this place. You always see Korean girls on the street nearby with their map and you just know they're looking for Ippudo. Great ramen. Perfect consistency and spicy without overpowering the other ingredients. Excellent service, though staff seem a little rushed or overwhelmed at times with the long lines. Definitely worth the wait.
