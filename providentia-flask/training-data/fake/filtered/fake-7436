We hit up Balthazar a couple times a year.  Most of the time we are venturing into NY for our monthly visit (wish we could get in more often) and if downtown and in the area we drop in.  Never with a reservation and usually we wait to sit by the bar (which is a unique system of letting the bartender know you want seats and then wait and worry - hoping he remembers who you were here before - they rarely mess up).    Balthazar lives up to its reputation.  The decor is wonderful and service is always top notch as is the food (brunch is great and the raw bar is amazing) and what I like about the bar is that it gets very social - so we normally meet others while enjoying a great meal and good red wine or prosecco.  Bartenders were generous on the pour and willing to let you try some drinks (even when you didn't ask :-)   Wait can be long without a reservation but has not disappointed yet.
