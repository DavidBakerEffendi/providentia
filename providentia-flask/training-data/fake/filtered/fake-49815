While driving along the NJ Turnpike last night, my husband and I decided to visit a local restaurant suggested by The Food Network's Diner, Drive-ins & Dives.  We pulled into the parking lot, a table of patrons looked out, and then the lights went off.  It was 8:40 pm on a Tuesday night.  A waiter looked out the window at us and paused - she was probably checking out our molars from our gaping wide open jaws.  I've never experienced anything like this before.  Who does this???? Certainly, this is not acceptable customer service.  We very much would have appreciated the waiter coming out to tell us that the restaurant was closed and they were waiting for the last table to finish up.   In hind sight, this was a good thing.  I'd never recommend patronizing this restaurant and glad Hightstown Diner didn't have the opportunity to get our business.  They don't deserve your business either!
