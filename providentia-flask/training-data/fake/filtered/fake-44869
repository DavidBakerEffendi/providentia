great find on our last night in NYC. Seated us without a reservation ( I don't think they take them?). Service was excellent, no rush but attentive, bringing more water etc. Salads were great as were mains - we had a pizza, a pasta and a fish. All were delicious. I will eat here again when I am in NYC. Prices were reasonable, portions good without being so large that you feel gluttonous. The waiter was great without being too chummy.
