We have been here before and loved it. BUT we came this evening and it was aweful. I could have cooked a better meal at home. I actually had to salt my food! I had the halibut special. It was a small piece of halibut, broccolini and cherry tomatoes. No seasoning, salt, nothing. Very bland! Unfortunately, we've loved this place before but won't go back. Back food and way OVER priced!
