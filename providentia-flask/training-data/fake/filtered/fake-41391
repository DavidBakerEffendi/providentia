Oyster House is slightly expensive but worth it.  Servers know a lot about the raw oysters and everything's always perfectly shucked.  The menu is impressively adventurous, though I wish there were a few more cocktails and a couple more entrees/apps. This would be a five-star rave review, except for one single problem that occurred on one visit out of four so far.  I have to take one star off because on a recent lunch visit I got a glass of white wine that tasted like it had been open too long.  Drank it (because I hate sending stuff back like a wanker).  Ordered a second, different glass.  I could be wrong, but this one did not taste the freshest either. The manager would probably say I should have said something... but the fact is, if a bottle of white wine has been open too long at 12:30 PM, it's been open since the previous night.  The bar staff should know better. Regardless: great place.  Will go back again and again.
