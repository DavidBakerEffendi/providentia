Our waitress dealt with food allergies by lying. My daughter is allergic to eggs, so I asked our waitress whether the pasta contained eggs.  I overheard her tell another waitress, "The chef's busy - I can't be bothered to ask him," just before she came to our table and said, "Yes, it has egg." Knowing that the waitress was lying and wouldn't communicate with the chef, I could not safely order any food for my daughter.  My daughter was distraught, and our visit with her 99-year-old great-grandfather was ruined.  I have written to the manager.  If he apologizes and plans to educate his staff about food allergies, we will change this negative review.
