We came early on a Wednesday night without reservations and were seated at a small table just at the door to the kitchen. It wasn't great, but it was ok. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I had the salmon on a bed of risoni with olive tapenade on top, and the waiter asked how I wanted it cooked. I said medium, and it was cooked to perfection. The olive tapenade was a bit too salty, but the size of the portion was just right after our big lunch earlier. My fiance picked the chicken and said it was nice but not as juicy as the honey-dipped one at Amy Ruth's :) The prices are a bit high, but the service is great.
