Hartness House gets a full 5 Stars from us. Me and my wife did the romantic weekend getaway package and loved every second of it. The food at the governers room restaraunt was excellent. The service was top notch and everyone there carried smiles from the moment we checked in till the time we left. We would recommend this hotel to anyone in the area. the room was beautiful and comfy. Not a noisy hotel and very professional staff. We enjoyed the observatory and visiting the underground museum as well. It was a convenient location for us as we were able to come and go to different attractions in the area and nothing was far away at all. All in all we loved it and would recommend Hartness House to everyone in the area...
