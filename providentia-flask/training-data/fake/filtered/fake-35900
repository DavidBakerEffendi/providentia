We went to Roberta's last Sunday, May 18.  It was our second time to Roberta's where we had one of the best pizzas we have ever eaten when we went there for the first time a few months ago.  We were eagerly waiting for the repeat visit ever since.  Alas, this did not happen this time.  We made a fatal mistake of visiting Roberta's rest rooms mainly to wash our hands after a lengthy subway ride from Manhattan. The lady''s room was so filthy and dirty, my wife refused to eat at Roberta's ever again and we had to walk out.  The place was packed with diners, the owners  must be making a fortune.  It is really a shame that establishment like this with unsanitary and filthy restroom can prosper in New York City, the premier city of the whole wide world.
