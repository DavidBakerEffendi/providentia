Great Service. Great Drinks. Worst food I've eaten in NY since I tried republic in Union square. I was offended to see a check of $250 for two for food that wasn't worthy of serving at pta brunch. The branzino was a portion size made for a 9 year old. I didn't think they made kids meals at luxury restaurants. Bottom line is, this was the worst food experience I've had in NY in 10 years. Beware of the good reviews. If you like nice scenery but don't care about the food, this place is for you. If not, skip it and eat at the 100's of NY restaurants that are better and cheaper.
