I pass the Great Jones Cafe almost daily during my lunch hour at work.  But a friend of mine suggested to try it out, today. My friend and I were in the mood for chilli, so we tried their Cajun Chicken Chilli.  All I could say is wow.  It was full of flavor, spicy and hot, especially on a cold day like today.  We requested to have cheddar cheese sprinkled on top of the chilli.  They use a white cheddar.  It was so delicious, I wanted more.  But, waited a few more minutes for my brain to catch up with my stomach, to let me know I was full. The prices are reasonable.  I will be returning soon, to try a different entree.
