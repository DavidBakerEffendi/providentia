I've been in several times now and absolutely love it! The pulled pork sandwich is to die for and now I've been back several times, what is it that??? I went one time and the bartender was pretty cool. Super nice guy that opened up his own business which is scary and admirable. I would love a pool table though and the back yard to be open. Other than that it seems cool and we need better bars around here so it's a good new addition.
