I had a reservation at Porcini on Saturday night for 8:15 and ended up leaving at 9 w/out having been seated. I felt completely disrespected by the owner who kept reassuring us that there were "tables for everyone." The waiting area is also ridiculous (about the size of a pool table) but they somehow managed to cram ten other guests into this tiny area. I spent 45 minutes dodging wait staff who were rushing past with hot plates. Never again!
