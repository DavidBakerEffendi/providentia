I've been finding myself at Pommes Frites a lot lately.  The fries are incredible and the employees have been consistently friendly despite the crowding I face every time.  Also, they're generous with the samples.  Best bet is to buy one side sauce and get one free (especial!), then seek outside seating on a curb or bench.  This place is pretty much the best ever.
