This probably one of my top 10 favorite restaurants! I order the ravioli and it was amazing! The marina sauce was the best, Homemade and delicious. Though I recommend coming in hungry because it fills you up and portion are kinda big. It was a like I was in Italy and the atmosphere is very laid back. Â  Definitely A must if your visiting New York!
