Dining out should not be this difficult.  Three of us walked into the restaurant without a reservation just moments after 6 PM when Feast opened for the evening.  That was more than they seemed to be able to handle.  There were about 15 staff members and only two sets of diners.  I was told that the rest of the tables were booked for 7:30 PM reservations.   I did not think that would be a problem, since it was just past 6, we were hungry and had no intention of lingering past 7 anyway.  They eventually accommodated us at the bar instead, not a problem, as I enjoy eating at the bar.  At 7:03 when our cheese plate finally came out (apparently it takes an hour to put 3 chunks of cheese on a plate, though it was probably the razor cutting of a single piece of bread into six translucent slices that took time), all the tables were still empty.  Seriously!  The food was good, but not that good.
