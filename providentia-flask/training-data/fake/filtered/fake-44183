This Stella rossa  dinning experience was a major mistake  first the service was Generic & slow then the food was terrible I ordered the gnocchi  and it was so mushy ! It tasted so bad I had too say something to the waiter about it And the sauce was like watery . it's clear they must have an inexperienced kitchen staff cause there is no talent coming out of this establishment at all and to top it off the bread that they serve is awful it's too hard and taste like its stale or been sitting around way too long I will not return and  I advise you to steer away from this disaster
