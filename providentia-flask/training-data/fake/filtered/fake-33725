i love to go here for tex-mex. my friends and i have been going here for a reeeeally long time now. i always have the french quarter chicken with cajun popcorn shrimp as an appetizer. the food is great and the atmosphere is awesome. its basically always busy, so prepare yourself for a 30minute to an hour wait, but dont worry its WORTH it
