This place has awesome food and good service. I find it unfair that people like MS B. decides it's nice to give bad reviews without stating the real facts. When I left her a comment asking him/her why she did this she replied: "Did you do poorly on your English comprehension exams in school?  Your comments make it clear that you're partisan for this restaurant given that you simply are ignoring the most important fact described.  Yes, there was a street festival, now explain why you think that makes it acceptable to [well - let me refer you to the comment for more details].  I'm not going to do that work for you, read it, you can disagree about many things, but, not about the behavior I've described." She blocked me, but here I go again...I am not telling you not to write your hateful review, but did you at any point mention the special situation that was going on at the moment of your visit??! That would explain why the scheduling was not being followed (your first complaint). Concerning your second complaint, the server's response, were you aware that he had probably been there all day long trying to get things moving for as many people there as possible? and probably being pressured by other staff members to hurry to open? I bet you don't really care, but I would have thought: gee, maybe tonight is not a good night to dine here, or at any of the other restaurants on this block due the the hundreds of people that are at this festival.  If He was rude or not, I do not know as you are obviously describing the whole situation in a way that serves you better. As for my English comprehension, I  would like to think that being English my fourth language learned, I am pretty on point.  On being partisan TO the restaurant, yes, I have dined here hundreds of times, and happen to be very good friends with the owners and their family... So excuse me for not liking your self centered and unfair review...
