I fell in love with Champs as soon as I saw the menu but then tasting the food just cemented it. The staff was also super nice and giving samples of some of their pastries..The oreo brownie cheesecake was out of this world. I wish Jersey had a Vegan diner like this but since they don't I'll have to make many visits to brooklyn and Champs =D
