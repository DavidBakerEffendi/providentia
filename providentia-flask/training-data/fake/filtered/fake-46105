If you're thinking about going to Ajihei, expect:  the freshest/best sushi and sashimi in NJ, expertly prepared by Japanese chef/owner Kitamura.  Outstanding dishes are Omakase (Chef's choice), Unagi Don (eel on a bed of rice), and Ikura Don (salmon roe on a bed of rice)  limited kitchen menu choices.  The quality is well above average, but not great.  that every ingredient, from the common sushi rice to the exotic sea-urchin, is treated with the utmost care and elegant presentation.  to get sticker shock, but realize that the price is very reasonable for the quality you get.  whimsical wall art, but a slightly grungy appearance.  small restaurant with no reservations allowed.  This means long wait  for seat and service when they are busy.    to be turned away for large groups of 5 or more people, because they believe it's not fair to the other patrons.  extremely polite and demure waitresses who are not fluent in English.  They are NOT rude at all, they are just not American.  that chef Kitamura can be gruff to customers who act rudely when they feel mistreated.  It's not personal.
