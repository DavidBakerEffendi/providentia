"One of the worst experiences in my trip to New York." An ultra crowded place full of all kind of italian food merchandise that is not organize in order to serve food or coffee or pastries that you can eat comfortably. On the contrary you have to wait long line and there are not enough seating place to enjoy the over expensive food you just bought them. The management was rude and not accomodating I think New York offer excellent italian restaurants, delis and markets that are not as expensive, you can eat and share comfortably with your companions good food serve without a long wait and in a nice table and chair. This place is completely overated. Will never visit it again. Visited July 2014
