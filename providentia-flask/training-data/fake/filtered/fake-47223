I read so many rave reviews I expected great food.  The bread is def great & the ambience takes you right to Italy.  I had the tilapia & shrimp scampi served over spinach & cavatelli.  The shrimp were good as was the spinach BUT the tilapia was "fishy", a huge no no!!!  I told the waiter when he asked why I had left all the tilapia & his response was a turned up  nose.  The chicken parm was ordered by 2 other friends & they said it was just OK.  Sorry to say, I had had much better.
