Visited Sorella during restaurant week and was extremely disappointed well as well as surprised with blatant bad service. Â Mediocre, small portioned food was just the beginning. For the extremely long wait for our food, we weren't offered bread or anything of the sort. Mislead to purchase a wine bottle which we didn't like and were offered another and not told the price which was $15 more than the one we thought we were going to get. And come time to pay, we were charged for the more expensive bottle on which the price were were never told, and the manager refused to make a price change. We were offered cheese for our pasta minutes after it had arrived and there was also lip smudge on my dessert glass. Yummy. The time between courses was enough to make you just want to leave versus wait for something definitely not worth waiting for. They are not out to make a great experience for their customers. And personally, I left thinking that I received bad service for reasons other than just being a busy night which I have never in my life experienced before. I would never step foot back in Sorella. And knowing they are a branch of Dish, I won't be dining there either. Seriously in need of a change in management.
