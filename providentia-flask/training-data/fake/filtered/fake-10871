It's just what NYC needs!! This quaint and cozy place is great if you're a big fan of crawfish! They offer a variety of seasonings to prepare your crawfish, shrimp, lobster, and even Dungenous crab!! My fave...cajun style seasoning!  And i can't stop thinking about how FRESH the raw oysters were!! Wait staff and the owners were really friendly and helpful!   Overall, food is amazing and prices were great! Yummy seafood at very fair prices! They definitely made me a fan! So if you've been craving for some southern creole food, then here's a small gem to add to your list!
