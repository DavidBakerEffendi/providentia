I found this place by accident.  Great Ambiance, Great Tasting Food,  Great Portions. First tried this place out with my cousins.  Took them out for their birthday.  I walked in was greeted by a nice staff.  This place had a warm feel to it, the ambiance and cozy feel get 5 stars.  All three of us had the chicarron de pollo, All I can say is that they were finger licking good.  Really how good can fried chicken taste?  REALLY GOOD!  So good came back 2 nights later with my wife. Rice and maduros were good too.  Must have their mojito sauce is really good!  Can't tell you about anything else on the menu.  Looking forward to going back and trying everything else on the menu.
