This is late in coming, but my (now-husband) and I stayed here for a night in December 2012. It was by far the BEST experience at an Inn that we've ever had. Richard and Marilee were absolutely fantastic hosts - they upgraded our room upon arrival (even before they knew we had just gotten engaged!), got us dinner reservations in the dining room, gave us directions to some nearby shops and even sent a bottle of wine over to our table at dinner. They really made us feel like old friends.   Dinner at the Inn was amazing (as was breakfast!) My husband has a gluten allergy and not only was the food fantastic at dinner and breakfast, the staff was super accommodating and knowledgable.   The rooms were charming, rustic, and very clean. No kitsch to be found. Totally recommend! Five stars!
