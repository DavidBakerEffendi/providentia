My family and I just came through  Philly and wanted to do our own "challenge", so we ordered 2 steaks from each Geno's and Pats, split them up, and noshed.  We felt Pat's was much better seasoned, where Geno's had the stronger "whiz" flavor.  If I had a salt and pepper shaker in front of me, Geno's would have needed it, but not Pats.  Genos is 50 cents cheaper, and I would eat at either place again, but if I have my choice, it's Pats.  I have read other reviews about Genos being cleaner, Pats was just as clean, Genos had lots of neon lights.
