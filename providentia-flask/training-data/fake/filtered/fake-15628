I really enjoy brunch here, for the food and the atmosphere. Exposed brick makes me feel cozy, for some reason. I'm glad there's no actual rabbit on the menu ... I'm not sure how I'd feel about that, because I used to have a pet rabbit as a child, but it would probably be very good. Â I should come here more often. It makes me want to get out of bed on a snowy Saturday morning.
