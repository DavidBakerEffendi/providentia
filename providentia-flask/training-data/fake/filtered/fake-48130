I have been two Morini four times now in the last two months.  Everything I put in my mouth was delicious.  The service is a little aloof, but clearly professional and competent; the room isn't very interesting but the crowd and the fare more than make up for that. Start with the meat plate and if you like Gnocchi, there's none better.
