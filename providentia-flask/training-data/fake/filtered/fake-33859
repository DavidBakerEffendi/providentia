Very Bad Experience. Chicken Biryani has hardly 1 or 2 pieces of chicken. They gave me so less white sauce for home delivery last time. I asked for extra sauce this time and paid $2 extra for the sauce and yet they gave me only 250 mg sauce for 3 platters and 3 rolls. Highly disgusting. I am very very Disappointed.
