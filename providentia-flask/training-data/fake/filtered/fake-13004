Extremely rude service and restaurant policy, our party was told to wait in a tiny space in the back of the restaurant by the restrooms while we waited for our whole party to arrive. the manager snatched away our menus after she seated us at a table for 6 ( even though we were still missing one person). After we were served water and looked at menus, the manager came by and grabbed away those menus, accusing us of trying to trick the system, by telling them we had less people in order to get seated sooner.  Without listening to our explanations (that we had told her 6 beforehand) she told us to get up.  I was really excited to try the restaurant out but after being treated terribly, we left. I've never experienced such terrible customer service and an unwillingness to listen to reason. HORRIBLE. for the sake of all that is good and yummy... don't go.
