What a great place! My wife and I just returned from what was easily the best meal we've had in some time. We've had dinner here several times and while we've been impressed each time, tonight's meal just blew us away. We enjoy innovative places like Charcoal. It's clear that the kitchen is as skilled as they are thoughtful as their dishes are often well balanced. I particularly appreciate their use of house pickled vegetables in several of their dishes as this seems to add the perfect amount of acidity. The scratch made pastas are always expertly prepared. Tonight I had a pasta take on chicken pot pie. The creamy sauce was flavorful without being too heavy, the chicken thigh was well seasoned and perfectly tender, and the pasta was cooked exactly right. The service was, as usual, casual and friendly but also professional. Each course is preceded by fresh silverware and our drinks were never empty. The seasonally inspired menu changes frequently enough that we've always found something exciting to try. Can't wait for our next visit!
