Wow!  The bagels and bialys were great but what about that matzo ball soup!?!?  It is incredible!  I always thought my Mom's was the best, and my wife has pretty much matched hers. Feldman's Bagels serves up the equal to those great experiences. What makes it even more special is that it is served in a restaurant.  I have never tasted anything that could even compete with Feldman's in any deli/restaurant experience in my life!  It was definitely worth the trip from Texas!
