The sushi here is great. It isn't the best sushi you will ever have but it is the best deal I have found on sushi. The rolls are reasonably priced between $3 and $6. Each roll comes with 6 to 8 pieces. The quality has varied from time to time but I would never say that it was bad. My favorite rolls are the eel and avocado, Ashiya special, and the emperor roll. The fact that they deliver is a plus. I would recommend this place for anyone who loves sushi but doesn't want to break the bank eating it.
