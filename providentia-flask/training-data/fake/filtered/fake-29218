An all-around delight.   As a long-time resident of Ridgewood, I am delighted to see new restaurants opening up in the area that reflect its changing demographics.  La Taqueria Kermes brings authentic Mexican food that is not designed to leave one feeling like an over-stuffed burrito.  The food is extremely fresh, has real flavor, and is presented well.  Try the Caesar Salad with its dressing that has layers of flavor (capers and fresh lemon come to mind), the shrimp tacos, and the veggie burrito.  The decor is bright and there is an inviting back patio.  Most of all, there is the warm, friendly staff who make you feel like you want to stay there all day.  Welcome to the neighborhood, La Taqueria Kermes; here's to many more great meals.
