Comparing this place to Farrells is pointless. Like churches and synagogues, same god[booze] only different style and means. I heard TVs are on their way which is huge, and one buyback during a 5 hour stay wouldn't have hurt, but these are the few shortcomings (buyback issue is a bit curious). The bartender was a nice guy. Eagerly awaiting menu and TVs. While Farrells has a better bargain if you fit in, this place has a nice ambiance and beer selection. If only I could get Captain Lawrence in a styrofoam container... [Update: received one buyback last night, however it is still fishy that it took me two visits, around 7 hours total, plenty of beers and proper tipping to have even one round on the house from a bar that is trying to make a first impression..]
