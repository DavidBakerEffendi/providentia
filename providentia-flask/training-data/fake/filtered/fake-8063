Just after getting married at the City Clerk's office, we asked our photographer for a nice spot to have a drink and he took us here - and we found a new favourite spot in NYC.  As soon as we were seated, our fabulous waiter, James, brought over a complimentary bottle of lovely champagne, which was a beautiful, unexpected touch.  We had the duck meatloaf sliders, which were AMAZING, then the apple and pecan tart with salted caramel and vanilla bean icecream.  The service was warm and attentive and happy to let us sit and linger for several hours.  For an impromptu post-wedding spot, this was a truly memorable and special experience.  Thanks so much to the lovely people at the Odeon!
