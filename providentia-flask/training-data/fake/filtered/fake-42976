Indian Hut is one of the best restaurants for Indian food around Plainsboro area. The food is great and service is good. I've had my daughter's birthday party held in this restaurant recently. Victor from restaurant is a good guy and very helpful. He helped out a lot during that party. Lot of people liked the food and service during that party.
