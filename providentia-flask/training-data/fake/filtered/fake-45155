The lomonaco family is dedicated to bringing the best Italian food to customers ever time they come into there restaurant. Family owned for nearly thirty years they've blessed the shoreline with the best Italian cuisine around. The tight knit, knowledgable staff, especially vinny always takes care of me when I'm there and couldn't be more attentive. Â Cheers to another 30 years of lomonacos!!
