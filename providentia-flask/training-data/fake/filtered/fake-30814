I'm a life long North Arlington resident and have been eating this pizza most of my life.  I remember Fred well and we would always ask him why don't you deliver.  He never did but the new owners do now.  Fred would have a large pile of dough in the corner.  He would chop off a hunk and press it into a well worn round pan.  On when the sauce and cheese and he would top the whole thing off with some olive oil from ancient oil can.  Baked half way and then removed from the pan for the second half. The cheese would be perfectly burnt on the edges.  The old days are gone and so is Fred, but the pizza is still the best I've ever tasted.
