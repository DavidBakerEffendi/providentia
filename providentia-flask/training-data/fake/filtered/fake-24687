I am visiting New Haven on business and have ordered from this restaurant numerous times. The macaroni and cheese was my favorite and I wanted to order it for my last time in Connecticut before going back home for the holidays. There had been only one prior snafu in my order but I didn't make a big deal since it was not the part of the order that was for me. Today fate decided to kick me in the face. I ordered at 11:27 am. I got a call that there were no drivers and they were finding a driver. Then I got a call that the wings I bought for my coworkers cannot be made with the flavor on the order made online. Then I had to call repeatedly to see where the order was, since I was so hungry I advised a coworker that my stomach was eating itself. After multiple calls back and forth, the driver called to let me know that he was on his way. Lo and behold he was, but missing one of the two ordered (and paid for) macaroni and cheese. The large size. Because my stomach was eating itself. So, I call and they said they will get the order back out. After waiting three hours with no call back, I was told the driver still hadn't returned to send out my purchased cheesy delight. I assume at this point that Wing Madness delivers wings to Buffalo, NY. When I called to cancel at 4:05 pm and get a refund for the mac and cheese, they asked that I come in. Not being a native of the area, I wasn't going to attempt a drive while disoriented with starvation. So I asked that my purchase be refunded. They advised that I should call back in 30 minutes. I now outright refused from hanger...when you are so hungry you are angered. I'm now awaiting a call from the same manager who was advised of my predicament and, as the young lady on the phone put it, "didn't say anything." Moral of the story: If you want to order macaroni and cheese, do so here. If you want macaroni and cheese, get Velveeta shells and cheese. It actually arrives!
