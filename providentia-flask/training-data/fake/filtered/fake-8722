Three of us went -- the prix fixe menu is a no brainer but you won't be disappointed for options. The portions are what you would expect -- this is no Old Country Buffet -- but the quality is excellent. Definitely BYOB! Some people mention noise but my group had the humming of a dozen conversations humming around us without any problem. Â It's not a library, but I enjoy the background noise of people enjoying themselves. Definitely a place for a date and friends, not a place for children! I'm looking forward to a return visit.
