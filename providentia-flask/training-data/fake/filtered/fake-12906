I got there around 8 30pm ..no more lobster's !! Not sure if that's a good thing or bad? I guess for them it's good, but for me if the name is Luke's Lobster I want lobster. I ordered a crab sandwich it was good but really wanted lobster. Is that the new trend like Federal donuts (have to run out so people come early). I hope they start to order more lobsters or they will have to change the the name to Luke's out of lobster.
