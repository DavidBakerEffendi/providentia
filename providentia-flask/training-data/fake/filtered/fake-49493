To the El Vez management: Thank you so much for hiring an amazing team of hostesses, especially Naomi. She made my tables whole night when she kept cracking jokes and made us feel very welcome. It was hectic in there but instead of having her just drop off the menu to us and leaving she actually happily stood there and talked to our table as if she were a good friend and gave us suggestions. Honestly when I come back me and my group of girlfriends hope that she's working again! Thank you so much Naomi for making our night! The food and atmosphere is good. We had the sea bass tacos and blood orange margaritas and the dessert were phenomenal! Definitely would recommend this place to friends
