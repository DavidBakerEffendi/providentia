Long trip from Brooklyn NY, to find out this place was more of a big media trap than a great tasty steak sandwich. The meat was dry I had to add ketchup to it. Usually a Philly cheese steak is juicy with peppers onions and cheese! This place is missing the basics. I can make a better one on my own! The cheese fries were good. I wish i read the reviews before I drove there. The best part of this place is that the service is fast, fast enough to taste my sad sandwich.
