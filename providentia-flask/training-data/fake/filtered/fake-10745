Stopped in to Tunxis Grill tonight and I must say I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. Started our meal with the fried sprouts all  I can say is AMAZING  the sauce was just as good as the sprouts, after that I had the shrimp special it had sun dried tomatoes and spinach in a garlic sauce and I ate the entire dish wanted to lick the plate. my wife had the jambalaya and said was best she ever had service was excellent for a new restaurant I thought we would have to wait forever for our food but everything seemed to come out in the perfect amount of time They really have things together there
