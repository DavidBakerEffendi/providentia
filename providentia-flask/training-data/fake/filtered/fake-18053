I just had a lunch date here with a friend, and before we could finish our meals we were planning our next visit!  GREAT food and food food choices and super friendly staff.  I have a gluten allergy so I was hesitant to visit a place heavy on BBQ with no specific gluten-free options.  But when I mentioned the allergy to my server he was very helpful to point out safe menu options that proved to be great choices.  I ate my entire meal with no adverse reaction.  My meal and my friend's meal was prepared perfectly and everything tasted very fresh.  Can't wait to go again!
