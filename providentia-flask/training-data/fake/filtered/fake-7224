There is plenty of Pho in Philly. This is my personal favorite. Like most places in Philly, the flavors aren't really authentic. They use too much cinnamon in the broth and the flavors are a bit to rougher than what I had when visiting Vietnam. There are others that are more famous, but this is the one that most chefs and food writers end up at.
