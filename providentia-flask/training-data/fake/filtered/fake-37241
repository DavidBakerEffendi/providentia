Great consistent place!  I really enjoy the relaxing, sophisticated atmosphere and the food never disappoints.   I get there for lunch often and the sandwiches and salads (especially the tuna salad!) are terriffic.  I have also made it there for dinner a few times and the ribs and steaks are phenominal.   The wait staff keeps it friendly and are well trained on the menu.  The place is always packed, but I've never waited long.  You should check it out.
