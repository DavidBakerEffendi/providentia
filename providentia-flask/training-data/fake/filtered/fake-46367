Today is Day 1 of the "soft opening" for Ippudo.  Thursday begins the full opening of the restaurant.  I've been to Japan maybe 11 times, and every time I go to Fukuoka, I eat at the local Ippudo.  So you can imagine how pleased I am to have an Ippudo a few blocks from the N/R train! The NYC location, during this pre-opening period, has a more limited menu than it will soon have.  But it's the real deal.  The basic soup recipes and noodle quality are dead-on.  The service was very friendly and very Japanese.  The only thing missing was the array of pickled condiments at the table, and the toasted sesame seed grinders.  But a friendly waiter actually came up and offered the latter to me, and I immediately breathed a sigh of relief.   Love those ground sesame seeds in my broth. LOVE them.   English skills varied widely amongst the staff, but one friendly guy asked me a lot of questions in English and claimed to have come directly from Fukuoka.   As I slurped and smiled with fatty pork pleasure, we chatted. At this point, the NY location doesn't offer the delicate and delicious gyoza dumplings so perfectly done in Japanese locations, but I encouraged them to do so, and they appeared to genuinely listen, even if that's only Japanese courtesy in action.  I subscribe to the "if you build it they will come" restaurant philosophy.   Though there are other things on the menu, I rarely have room for more after my bowl (and an extra helping of noodles added to the broth, and the missing gyoza).   But as a Japan vet, I'm VERY happy.   Spread the word and fill this place!
