I'm frustrated I have to give this restaurant even one star. Our drinks were bad, steaks overpriced, scallops dry, creamed spinach repulsive...but what really baffled me was when our food runner spilled an entire appetizer on my husbands shirt and broke glass all over him and we received no apology or comp on the bill from the manager.  We even had to ask for new drinks since we had glass in our current ones.  He had the audacity to say "are you sure?" I will certainly never go back there again.
