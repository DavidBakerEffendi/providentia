This review is long overdue. My husband and I love this place. Mostly because we love the escargot appetizer. They have other wonderful dishes as well like the seared filet mignon topped with foie gras and the seafood linguini. This restaurant is BYOB which is a also a plus. But I'm hearing that they have started their own wine menu recently. Only thing is that its very noisy inside and can be a bit crowded at times. Its also better to make a reservation.
