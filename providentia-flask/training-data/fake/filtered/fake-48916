While strolling down Broadway in search for a place to eat on a Tuesday evening, the glint of Almond's patio lighting ever so conveniently caught my eye, and boy am I happy that it did! The restaurant is roomy and inviting, with a generally warm ambiance and friendly wait staff.  The only negative thing I have to say about Almond was the tiny amount of bread they brought out....but they happily replenished our supply upon request. I ordered the sea bass, while my dad ordered the salmon.  We couldn't decide whose food we liked better because both were so delicious! Fortunately for us, they don't skimp on the portion sizes.  Then we shared the sticky toffee date cake with craime fraiche ice cream for dessert.  I remember watching Ina make it on Barefoot Contessa, and I was pleased to see that this place was serving it up.  The cake is very sweet and the craime fraiche ice cream gives it the perfect balance.   Even my pops walked out satisfied...and trust me, my dad is not an easy person to please.  If he walked out of there satisfied, then it means these people were doing something right. I will definitely be returning to Almond! I imagine that their patio seating  and cheese plate makes for a lovely summer evening :)
