Best Vietnamese food around BUT the service was AWFUL!!! Rude workers there. Takes forever to get a table and if your on the waiting list pay close attention because the staff doesn't work together and so people that just got there will be seated after you've been waiting if you don't pay attention. Not to mention once seated your waiting for another 20 to place the order and if you want to eat with the people you came with, forget about it. All the food comes out at different times. Also they don't bring your check. You have to get up and go to the register and then repeat what you ordered to get the bill. The kitchen people got it going in. They can cook their asses off and they make the best Vietnamese around but it loses something with all the other hurdles you have to jump to get it. Best to call in and pick it up and take it home to eat.
