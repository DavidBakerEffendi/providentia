The Churrasco grill is one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. My family and I look forward to our meals there. The small , cozy feel is just what I look for when spending time together with my family. The food is pure perfection. The South American taste and flavor shines in every dish. The "Shrimp Izza " appetizer is my favorite. The Churrasco skirt steak is perfectly wood fire grilled and juicy. The 40 minute ride is well worth it for us. And it's BYOB. Even better!
