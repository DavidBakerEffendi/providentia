These guys won't be here long. The food is average to below average. The chicken is dry and over cooked. The carnitas are also dry. Portions are small for what you pay. I had uncooked rice mixed in so I had to eat slowly to avoid hurting my teeth. This is the third time I tried them. I've not been impressed on any of my visits. This is the second burrito type joint in this location. I'll try it again when these guys fold up shop and the next guy gives it a shot. I'm not sure why so many folks don't get it. Really good food with decent portions for a fair price. Must be easier said than done. It's sad because Yardley could really use a great burrito joint.
