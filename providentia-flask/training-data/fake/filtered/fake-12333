Outstanding Experience! if you live in/happen to be in Philly and you are a lover of food that is unusual, exquisitely prepared, fresh, elegant, and enjoy sitting and watching the chefs prepare this amazement before your eyes - go to Serpico. Sitting at chef's counter is a must to complete the experience. Loved every moment and each bite!
