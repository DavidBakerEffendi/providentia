dollar pints of high life at all times? AMAZING! the best way to explain what kind of place is: there is a sign behind the bar that says OUR HOUSE WINE IS JAGERMEISTER.  the place is easily the best bar in princeton.  all the others are filled with typical pretentious princetonians, this place has real, down to earth people in it. the staff here is wicked friendly too..  sure its a "dive" bar, but why go to winberies, pay 5 bucks for a coors light and hang out with a bunch of inbred preppies? Go to Ivy Inn instead, it will change your life
