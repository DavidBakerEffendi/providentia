I love Vietnamese food and this place is great.  Seeing that 99% of the clientele are Vietnamese or of other Asian descent certainly confirmed my findings.  Great pho!  Very fresh ingredients in everything.  The mini-mall and the decor of the place definitely leave something to be desired aesthetically, but I didn't care because the food was so wonderful.  Go in jeans or sweats for a great meal.
