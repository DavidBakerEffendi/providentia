After reading all the great reviews on Yelp. I decided to try this restaurant with my best friend last week. This place is absolutely amazing and satisfying. You walk into the dining room and it is another world.  Time flows slowly and leisurely.  The glass of Bordeaux blanc recommended by the staff set the wonderful tone.  The bread was perfect.  I had Porcini Flan to start with.  The crab was so tender and the dashi broth went perfectly with the crab.  I could not have enough of it.  For entree I had the duck.  It was the most tender and soft duck I ever had.  The source was refined and I loved the hint of yuzu flavor.  After the entree was complimentary ricotta cheese sorbet in melon juice.  The combination of the cold and mild ricotta cheese and the room temperature melon juice was absolutely heavenly.  Everything about the meal was simply perfect. It was definitely one of the best dining experience.
