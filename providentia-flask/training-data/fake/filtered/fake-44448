I had a horrible experience with this restaurant.  They admittedly messed up my order but offered to fix it by bringing out the correct food and throwing in a free 2 liter of diet soda.  An hour later I was still sitting in front of now cold chicken waiting on the correction with a house full of guests.  At this point we contacted them to try to get them to make things right.  We had to feed the children at our home a completely different dinner since it was their stuff that was left behind and their solution of a free 1 dollar soda was just not cutting it.  The phone operator and manager were more concerned with the fact that they sent out a free bottle of soda then the fact that I had now waited 2 hours to get what I ordered in the first place.  There was no consideration made at all.   Thankfully I had ordered through Grubhub and they did everything possible to make the experience better from their end.  I will never order from Wings over New Haven again.  No matter how their food flies, their customer service crashed and burned.
