I used to like this place a whole lot and have sent many friends there.  It has definitely changed lately.  First of all, the food is not as good as it used to be.  I ordered the shrimp, lobster and grits and it was cold.  Who wants cold grits of any kind.  On another visit on a Thursday evening, I was with a friend who had on some stylish sweat pants and was told that we could not come in because he had athletic gear on and they do not allow people with athletic gear on to enter after 6pm.  OK, this is clearly not Le Cirque and they suddenly have a dress code which seems rather random.  I mean we are talking about Brooklyn here just a few blocks from all hell breaking loose.  I am done!  I would love to spend more time at Brooklyn establishments but these folks are nuts!
