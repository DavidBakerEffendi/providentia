Worst restaurant ever!! Too pricey for the quality of food they serve. Cold behari kebabs, hot lassi to go with the rude old lady behind the counter who seems to hate her job and taking her frustration out on the customers. They seriously need to fire her or else they will lose a lot more customers like me & will eventually close down. Paid more then $100 for that garbage food yet the lady had an attitude as if we were asking for free food. Highly not recommended!! You will regret it.
