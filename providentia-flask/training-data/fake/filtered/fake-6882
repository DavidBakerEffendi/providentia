All you can eat mac & cheese is so much better than wing night. I'm probably just sick of wings because I used to hit that up at bars when I was younger. But now I take my kids here once a month for the all you can eat mac N cheese on Tuesdays. They go crazy for it, and then they pass out because of the food comma that they're in. It's perfect! Â And it's nothing like that frozen stuff or Easy mac like at those chain restaurants. The atmosphere is definitely a welcoming one. Tommy, one of the managers, is the best with kids. You don't really get to see the owners of restaurants walking around with their staff or even welcoming guests at the door. It's a nice change. And for my sake they play decent music, not that "top 40 crap" you hear EVERYWHERE. Mostly rock you hear on typically rock stations but with a mix of things you don't hear every day. I'm very comfortable and my kids have a great time.
