The day after writing my review, I received a very thoughtful call from the restaurant owner who explained that the restaurant is pretty new and that they are working out the kinks involved in serving large parties (There were 8 of us).  He took my comments  seriously, invited me back, and provided an accomodation for the problems we encountered.  I have never received better customer service from a complaint.   Hopefully my situation was a one-time  glitch and that most people will have a better experience.   My customer service experience was 5 star.
