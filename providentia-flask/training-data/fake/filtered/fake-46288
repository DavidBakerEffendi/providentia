Came here on a Sunday hoping that maybe there would be less of a wait... WRONG!  We were told that there would be a TWO HOUR wait, so the guy who wrote us down took my friend's cell phone number and said he would call when our table was ready.  We walked around the neighborhood and actually it turned out that it was only like an hour and fifteen minutes.  Guess some other people on the list left because they couldn't wait that long!   We ordered pork buns and each ordered a different ramen on the menu so we all sample a little bit of everything.  It was so good!  My friend ordered the raw octopus, which was slimy and not really my thing.  He said it was good, though.   This place is HUUUUGE and you can tell that everything is made fresh.  I would love to go back, but maybe on a day when there isn't a two hour wait, if that even exists!
