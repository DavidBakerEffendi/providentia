Since Karma is in my neighborhood and since I had a DealOn coupon to go there, we went for dinner.  Nice place; decent food.  But a decent evening was ruined by the lies and rudeness of the management.  First, our waiter refused to take the DealOn coupon and told us a pretty blatant lie about why they wouldn't honor it.  Then, we spoke to the Manager who admitted that the waiter's story was wrong but still wouldn't honor the coupon.  Basically, the way these things work, they already got my coupon-money but still would not honor the coupon, pleading that a previous owner had made that deal.  Well, that should be a problem between the previous owner and the new owner......not me!  We will never go to this place again and that's too bad because we love Indian food and would have become regulars.
