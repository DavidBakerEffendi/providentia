Actually I am the Indian food lover. I ordered a noodle dish. The noodle dish (phad kee mao) was not good at all...really sour and extremely oily/greasy.  Usually I can finish the noodle dish but I ate about 1/3 of it and gave up because it just wasn't good.  About the service they are really horrible service provider. I can consider about the food but I cannot forgive them for what they did to me. It was late night and the restaurant was almost empty. A lady was serving us and she was so rude as if we owe her money. I don't know what her problem was. When I talked her about the food she answered it wasn't her problem. This is the mistake by the kitchen. Owner should take action against her promptly otherwise he will be loose his business. Really disappointed by their service. I will never be back to this place. oday I went to try some Thai food.
