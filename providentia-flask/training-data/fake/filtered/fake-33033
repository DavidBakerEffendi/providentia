Wow.  A large group of us had dinner at Enjay's so we got to try lots of dishes.  I'd order every single one again--and again.  Everything on the menu is made from scratch, including the delicious pizza dough, hoagie bread and pickles.  And the food tells the story.  We had mushroom pizza, tomato and cheese pizza, both home made sausage and meatball sliders (on delicious little buns), fried cauliflower hoagie with aoli, a delectable pasta with mushroom sauce, a big plate of home made fries topped with delicious fixingsand the chopped salad.  Everything comes with home made pickles, including pickled cauliflower and carrots.  We topped off the meal with home made doughnuts with ricotta and marsala sauce.  Mmmmmm.  To complement the meal, there are chef chosen beers and wines.  This place is casual and the prices are great, but the food is first class.  We plan on spending lots of time at this gem.  And we hear they're open for lunch now.  Yesssss.
