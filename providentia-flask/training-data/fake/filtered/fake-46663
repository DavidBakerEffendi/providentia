Went there last night. Main course took 45 minutes to come out. As 5 of us sat there chewing our knuckles for nourishment the server walked by several times without even so much as a glance in our direction. Would throwing us a piece of bread have been too much, bud. Thank God one of us Â had a granola bar we all fought over but decided to split. Mind you by this time the place was 3/4 empty. Food was OK, nothing worth the indifferent service. Our fault though,we were warned, decent food, bad service and not a manager in sight.
