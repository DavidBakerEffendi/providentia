I have to wonder what Max was thinking when he thought charging 15-18 bucks a plate for 5 bites of dessert was the right thing to do. I thought I'd give this place a try, after all it's chocolate and boy do I love chocolate. I was shocked at first by the prices of the dishes on the menu. Nothing under $10, except perhaps a $8 hot chocolate. ...Really? But, I figured, "wow if he's charging this much for some waffles with ice cream they must be amazing." I shelled out $18 that night for 2 sand dollar sized waffles, a tiny scoop of ice cream and mediocre toppings, that weren't event ON my dessert! I had to put them on! I was severely Â underwhelmed and disappointed with the level of quality (and quantity since I split this dessert with someone) that this overpriced dessert possessed. I don't think I will be returning, and would recommend anyone with chocolate withdrawals keep walking and go buy a Hershey's bar.
