This review only refers to the food, as we ordered in from Thai Chef last night (we live about 2 miles away).  I decided to indulge, and ordered the peking duck rolls, scallop pancakes (with scallions), and soft shell crab with garlic sauce.  I am not hung up on authenticity  -- though I have eaten much Thai food over the years -- but what we ordered was simply outstanding.  The vegetables accompanying the soft shell crab were delicious (and varied), the scallion pancake was greasy and crisp and chewy in exactly the right ways.  The soft shell crab was wonderful -- and the portions of all three dishes were quite generous.   While it wasn't cheap for takeout, it was a fantastic meal.  I have eaten Thai food from at least 5 places in the Montclair area (we're a fan of the cheap eats at Brookside Thai as well), but this was the best Thai meal, and one of the best meals period, I've had in Montclair.
