Han Dynasty is my favorite restaurant of all time. The food is always fresh and amazing and makes for really great left overs (which I'm usually totally weird about). Han himself is super cool and remembered who I was after the first time I went (it probably helped that when my brother lived here, he'd go there a few times a week! haha). The food is really authentic- he only employs chefs from the Szechuan Province and you can absolutely tell. My favorite thing on the menu is Dry Pot Fish at about a 6 spiciness (it's usually at a 10, but since I like to take home left overs, I tone down the spice b/c it'll get spicier overnight.) and I pair it with the Chinese pea leaves (which I dream about b/c they're so delicious!). As far as drinks go, if you have a hard time with spicy food, stop by Mulberry Market on Arch before heading to Han Dynasty to grab some coco-aloe juice (comes in a glass bottle with bright green label) to cool you down during the meal. Works like a charm!! Also, while you're there, pick up a six pack to bring along so you don't have to pay $35 for a mediocre sixer from Eulogy (I've definitely made that mistake before). Make sure you make reservations in advance b/c as the word spreads, Han Dynasty gets busier and busier. It's really fun for large groups b/c of their huge table with a lazy Susan in the middle to make sharing easier. Also, make sure you're really, really hungry b/c portions are big and the food is delicious- you're not going to want to stop eating!
