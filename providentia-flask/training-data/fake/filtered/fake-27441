Where else can you be served in one hour's time by: 3 illegal non-English speaking workers fresh from the Andes 1 mentally disabled dwarf who continually tries to take your food away and 3 kids of indeterminate age (probably all owner's family), all of whom could very well be under the legal age to work ??? The sicilian square pie still rocks and their food is tremendous. I would stab anyone with one of those plastic forks for trying to take my Spumoni away.....ahhhhh Rainbow Spumoni..... This used to be one of our favorite places to sit in and eat. The confused waiter rotation of Coney Island Freak show I do not need with my dinner. One waiter would have sufficed!   And then the hostess took the tip to dole out among all.  I give large $$$ tips and did not appreciate that, either. Not anymore....I'll order out and take home from now on.
