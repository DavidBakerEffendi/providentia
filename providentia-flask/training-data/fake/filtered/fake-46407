On my visit to NYC last month I went to IPPUDO on the behest of a friend.  I have to say that I was thoroughly impressed with the staff; they were the friendliest, and most energetic staff I've ever encountered. The joy and pride displayed every time a meal left the kitchen through chants and proclamations in Japanese was exciting, AND THE FOOD  WAS AMAZING!!!! The ramen noodles were PERFECTION, and the broths were INCREDIBLE, and don't get me started on the pork buns... The whole experiene was top notch and I have been telling all of my friends that are traveling to NYC that they have got to go... Thanks and I will back in August... Seems too far away...
