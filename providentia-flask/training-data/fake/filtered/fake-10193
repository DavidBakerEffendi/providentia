I can only vouch for Tuesday evenings when they have live Irish music. I haven't visited them other times. The beer and whiskey selection is excellent, the atmosphere is laid back and friendly, the service is courteous and prompt, and you will feel welcome here. I don't know much about their happy hours, but then again, I come for the music.
