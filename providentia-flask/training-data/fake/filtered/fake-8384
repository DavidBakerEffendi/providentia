The Lunchbox has been my number one spot since my freshman year of high school. A taylor ham egg and cheese before first period and a sub or some delicious penne vodka after school. The staff is so friendly and welcoming and the prices are fair and affordable. Not to mention, any flavor cheesecake you can think of that melts in your mouth and leaves a smile on your face and in your belly. I love the lunchbox and I will be a faithful customer forever..
