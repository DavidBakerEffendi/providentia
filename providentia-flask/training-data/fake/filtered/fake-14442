First off the place smelled of stale beer. There were four of us in our party and the place wasn't very crowded and it took a bit for the employees to finish their conversation before we were able to place our order. I had the spicy shrimp to start which the sauce was good but the shrimp were not fresh...tasted fishy. I then had a burger which was horrible. It was overcooked and riddled with grizzle. Stopped eating it after three bites. One of the members of our party was happy with their meal but the rest of us agreed on freshness/quality of food. Â Won't be returning here. Also when I complained about the quality when paying our bill a manager or owner came over and was not very pleasant. Always willing to give a place a second chance but with the attitude we received I won't be going back!
