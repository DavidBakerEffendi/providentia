I'm a New York City resident, but whenever I spend time with my boyfriend of 2 years who lives in the Bayonne area, I always get the taste to have spanish food. Cibao Invita is a very good takeout and sit in restaurant that really gives you what your money is worth and can really fill your belly!! The food here is amazing, and even though its hard to choose from the different varieties of food, all of them is very delicious and can absolutely leave you to wanting more to take out with you. I recomment the Â Beef, Teriyaki Chicken, Rice and Beans with Tostones...and a nice cool Malta / Jarrito with a good tres leches Dominican Cake for desert. The only reason I gave Cibao Invita 4 stars and not 5 is because of the Delivery. Whenever we just want to stay in and watch a movie or two, the deliveries can really take long and we had 3 cases of where the delivery guy got the wrong address based on the poor english a spanish woman stated to him. But he surely apologized for the confusion but still wish they would've called a little earlier instead of a hour and a half later when he really did get lost!
