This restaurant is located in the Westminster Hotel - although the rooms are decent, we come here mainly for the restaurant. After indulging to our hearts content on the porterhouse for two, mac & cheese, truffle creamed spinach, goose fat potatoes, as well as a number of bottles of wine & caramelized banana tart , it's nice to be able to make our way up to our room where we are guaranteed a very comfortable bed and clean accommodations. The morning greets us with a decent breakfast buffet and then the short ride home. The staff is always friendly and the room rates are always ridiculously low, although dinner is a bit pricey (but well worth it). We make it a point to stay here at least a few times each year and it's consistently perfect! Could you get a similar steak at any other overpriced steak house?  Definitely, but the strip house offers the romantic decor, fabulous sides, and attentive staff!   In addition, we were seated immediately all 4 times we ate there.  (all of which were on weekend evenings)
