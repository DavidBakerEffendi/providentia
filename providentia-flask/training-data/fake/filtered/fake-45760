Been at this place 23 times in 4 months. 1) It's BYOB and it's great. They will also give you a glass of wine, if they won't forget it. 2) Food is super tasty, fresh, from high quality ingredients. One of best places I been in Phila. 3) Desserts are amazing! Cannoli made in house fresh each day. WOW. 4) Prices are very modes - very good. 5) Service is unique: funny, dedicated, some time talking too much (one guy in particular... will tell you his vegetarian life story and some other BS...). Verdict: very, very recommended!
