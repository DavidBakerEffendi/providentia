I was introduced to this place when a friend had us meeting here for breakfast before we took in a matinee movie nearby. She lives in the neighborhood, so I guessed it was going to be good. I don't get into the city as much as I'd like, but places like this are a big part of why I love NYC. It's small and comfortable, and it serves great food because it has to in order to survive. The wait staff seemed oddly large to me in relation to the size of the restaurant. I wasn't sure who our waiter was or even if we had a designated waiter. After ordering our beverages, another waiter stopped by to take our beverage orders. I don't consider that a negative. I had a very nice iced latte and the Crepe d'Isis, which contained bacon, egg, cheddar and tomato. It was fantastic, as was the small side salad that came with it. I made the stupid mistake of leaving my card behind when I paid the bill, but I have to say that when I called and confirmed they had it, I was glad that I had a reason to go back into the city the next morning to retrieve it and have a repeat of the same great breakfast while I was there. I consider it a shame that I may never have reason to eat there again. If you get the chance, don't skip it.
