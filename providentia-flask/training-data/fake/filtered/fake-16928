Unfortunately, this restaurant gets no stars from me as the most essential issue here is food cleanliness and cleanliness habits of its workers. I ordered a breakfast food that comes with toast - As I was waiting for the food order to be ready I observed one of the people behind the counter who prepares food lift up the rubber floor mat with her bare hands ( the one that everyone stands on while cooking) and move it over to another spot on the floor. I continued to watch her carefully as she walked doen the aisle, picked up 2 pieces of bread with bare hands and then proceeded to place them in the toaster. She failed to wash her hands and wear gloves before touching the bread. I recognized that this was my toast and I brought  the whole issue and breach to the manager's attention - no apologies at all but someone else handled the toast properly - so if you would like bacteria and god knows what else on your food you are welcome to take a chance at Munchies -  good luck
