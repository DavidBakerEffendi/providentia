Just got back from our night out a the Front Street Bistro and I'll have to say that the dinner and the movie were not enjoyable. The service was great but everything else was not even as good as I could get at McDonalds. I ordered a cheeseburger, "how do you mess up a cheeseburger" and it was just about the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth. I ate one bite and I was done. My wife got the chicken blato sandwich and she wasn't overjoyed with that either but she's way to nice to ever complain about it. First and last time we will ever go there for food or a movie. Sirens going by outside disrupted the movie several times during the showing.The sound was so soft that all we heard for most of the was the crackling of people eating snacks and such. They did take my burger off the bill but that doesn't make up for the terrible food. The kitchen needs help putting out some decent food.
