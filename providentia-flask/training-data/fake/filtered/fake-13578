Love it.  Heavily rely on this pub in the hood.   The beer selection is - dare I say it - unmatched .  Constantly changes.  Creative.  Makes it always fresh and interesting. The food is very good and reasonably priced with large portions.  I'm suspicious of their claims for 'heirloom' and 'free range' meats - I don't think they are doing their homework on the meats.  Killer fries, though they've changed the recipe to skinny fries. Great seats by the windows that open, but no outdoor space (shame).   Convenient location. WAY too loud music.  Often packed, so get there early.  Loses its charm after 10.  Really good happy hour during the day until 7 - $4 pints. There's room for another pub.  We need another one in the hood.   Keep up the good work. CASH ONLY
