Attended a really wonderful baby shower brunch here on Saturday. The atmosphere was just lovely, food amazing, delicious and unique. I had a divine beet salad, salmon omelet with capers and poached pear for dessert.. really outstanding and super fresh! The waitstaff was also was very attentive and warm. Â We all had a very enjoyable afternoon celebrating our dear friend. Would highly recommend!
