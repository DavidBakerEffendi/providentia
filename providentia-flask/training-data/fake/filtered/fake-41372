City Tap House rescued my Friday Happy Hour. I had made the mistake of going to another bar around the corner, but after a round and horrible service I came running here. I was a little upset that my go to beer on tap was out but with such an extensive beer list I had no problem finding something else to drink. The service was wonderful and my flatbread pizza came out hot and fast. I will be coming back here more often.
