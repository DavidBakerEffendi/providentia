After living in Spain for an extended period of time, Small-plates and Tapas are my favorite way to indulge. After eating at the St. Austere, all I can say is WOW!... This cozy little place located in North Side Willy-B deserves universal recognition. They served up the BEST small plates I have ever had in my life! An absolute must!... not to mention...the price was right.
