The restaurant is great!  I had the sea bass milanessa.  Having a special place in my heart for Argentina, I love milanessa.  This was among the best that I have ever had.  The spinach was also fantastic.  This is one of those places that makes New Haven special.  It will be on the list when I have guests in town!
