I have been to the lunch buffet at Karma numerous times as well as catered with them for a special event.  I have been very pleased with Karma so far. Karma probably has the best Indian lunch buffet  in the Philadelphia area. The selection is very large and nice mix of North and South Indian cuisine. More recently, they had catered my son's baptism. It was an event for around 150 people. The food was great; many of guests actually came up to us afterwards and complimented on our selection. In addition, they set everything up and provided drinks and silverware. They were very professional and reasonable price-wise. We will definitely use them again to cater.
