I had a spectacular meal with a good friend on Nov. 1.  Our waiter "G" was extremely attentive and knowledgeable, as well as the entire staff.  On top of sharing a delectable bottle of Primitivo/Montepulciano/Nero d'avola, I casually mentioned that I wanted a glass of Pinot Grigio with my salmon entree. I happened to look over at the bartender (a few feet away) and he was already pouring my glass of wine! (Bionic ears - I guess.) I am from Washington, D.C., and didn't release how narrow the streets are in some parts of Philly and how limited the parking.  Luckily there is valet parking in the front (serving other restaurants, too, but nonetheless) making the entire experience very pleasurable.   By the way, I had Rock Shrimp Ceviche with cucumber, long hots, avocado puree, and gazpacho as an appetizer and organic salmon with roasted Japanese eggplant, bok choy, coconut, and green curry broth. All to die for. The pastry chef, Jessie Prawlucki, is amazing.  My friend and I split the  Pumpkin Layer Cake with butterscotch pudding, dulce de leche, and gingersnap crumbs AND Dark Chocolate Mousse with coconut white chocolate cremeux, flourless brownie, and cinnamon crème anglaise. Now it's back to the treadmill!
