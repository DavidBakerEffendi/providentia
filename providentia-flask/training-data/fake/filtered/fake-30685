I went here for the first time the other night after walking by this place numerous times. Well have I been missing something. First of all John the owner and bartender is sooo friendly and welcoming. It's a place that you just feel comfortable in. We hit happy hour here and when we went to pay the bill we utterly surprised that the drafts were only $2.50, even at reular price $5.00 is cheap. Then I actually went back a night later with other friends and ate there. Food is great, good pub food with an eclectic feel, and the bread to die for. This will be my new favorite place, and I will continue to bring more friends here.
