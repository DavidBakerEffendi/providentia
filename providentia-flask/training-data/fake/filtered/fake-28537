Stay away!!  I live in the area and I hate to give a bad review, but truth be told, the pizza is ok at best.  Service is the worst!!!  Ordered gluten free buffalo pizza and the chicken came breaded (no longer a gluten free pizza)   I ordered take out and did not know until I got home, so I called and the guy was a d**k!!!  He told me it was my problem and hung up the phone and said he did not have time for this.  I have never been treated by anybody in such a manner as this.  Any place that treats their customers in such a way should be avoided.  I will never step foot in the place ever again.
