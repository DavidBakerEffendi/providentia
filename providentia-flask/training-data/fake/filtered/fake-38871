Came to town for a weekend getaway.  My wife and I just happened upon this place on our walk down Church St and since I was in the mood for Italian, we checked out the menu.  Wanted to eat outside but the wait was long, but there was a table inside available.  We took that and dinner was great. The atmosphere was good; tables were not too close together and there was the Italian restaurant feel without anything cheesy. Food was good on all fronts (wife is a vegetarian) and the service was excellent.  Everyone working was attentive.  I was thinking about getting a glass of wine and asked my wife if she would get one too.  A waitress (not ours) who was just walking by asked if she could get me something (reading my mind I guess) and got us our wine. Multiple people were always refilling water, clearing plates, etc, but never made us feel rushed. Definitely would come back.
