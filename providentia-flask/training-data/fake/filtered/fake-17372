Stellar.  We are obnoxiously picky foodies... don't often go out for breakfast/lunch/brunch as we can usually do it better ourselves at home.  But this place is phenomenal - please try it.  It beats Sabrina's (which makes up for meh food with enormous quantities) to a pulp.  The servers are attentive and pleasant, and we enjoy the rehabbed-warehouse aesthetic.  Not enough bike parking, though.
