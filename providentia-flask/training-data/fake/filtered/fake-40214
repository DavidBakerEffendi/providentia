I have to laugh to myself every time I hear about Difara pizza. I started eating his pizza when I was a kid, long before all these people came along. There was never a line way back then, but the pizza was just as good as it is today. That said, I urge anyone that makes a trip out to Brooklyn for pizza to not overlook some of the other fine pizza Â joints that we have here. Whatever your pizza jones is, Brooklyn has a solution for you!
