Dag!!! This place is my new spot.   First of all, people complaining about price,  If $10 dollars for a meal is too expensive you need to stay home and eat some string cheese and PB&J until you have enough money to dine out like an adult... I think people take for granted the fact that Guac is free here.  It's $2 at shitpolte and don memo doesn't even have it at his truck.  No disrespect to the Don, his tacos are delicious without it.  But you get the point.   Anyway, I went there for the first time the other day and had the pork tacos.  God Damn.  $6 for two slow cooked pork tacos in a corn tortilla with guacamole and salsa.  Cheese was also an option but I abstained for digestive purposes. The two tacos were a perfect lunch snack.  Rather than being all full and lethargic I was full of good gluten free energy which allowed me to get up and go get some money--so I don't have to cry on yelp about how I can't afford things! Plus, one of the chefs hipped me to a soup he was playing with.  Sweet potato fennel soup, I think it was.  Either way, I don't think it's on their menu, but it was effing good and hope they add it to the roster.
