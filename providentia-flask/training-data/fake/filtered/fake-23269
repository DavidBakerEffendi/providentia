My friend and I went to Grants last night.  We were seated outside.  We received our first cocktail quite promptly.  We waited about 15 minutes for our server to take our order.  My chopped salad was great.  The vinaigrette was tasty.  My strip steak was horrible.  For a $30 steak, I thought it should have been better.  It was fatty, and chewy!  Very disappointed!  I could have gotten a better steak at Walmart for 7.99  per pound!
