I had lunch with friends there a couple times before, the food was OK. I liked the location and the decor so I decided to meet a friend there for lunch. I went early so I could have a coffee before my friend arrives.  However, the host simply refused to sit me and told me just stand outside and wait for my friend.  I have never been treated like this by any restaurant.  Very rude and arrogant.  I will never go again or recommend this place to anyone.
