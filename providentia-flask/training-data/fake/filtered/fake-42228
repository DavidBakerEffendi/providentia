What can I say? These guys do it rite! Tapas style small dishes that are one more incredible than the next. I've been here with some friends and we've had 95% of the menu on a few different occasions and I can't think of one dish I didn't LOVE ! Here's a few dishes I enjoyed most : crispy pork belly, cauliflower, peperoncini, romesco, parsley-garlic *roasted bone marrow, white anchovies, shiitake escabeche, garlic toast *baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, crostini *crispy-glazed confit chicken wings, hoisin, five-spice, sriracha *strawberry-cinnamon glazed baby back pork ribs *bbq, braised short rib sliders, sweet potato fries, smoked paprika aiol *seared foie, fingerlings, ham chips, sunny egg, maple, hot sauce *confit of moulard duck leg, beluga lentils, crab apple, red wine *** All to die for...... Also try the beer , my fav is a belgium ale called Piraat be careful this ale is 10% Â it. will get you loopy after 2 or 3 hahaha Enjoy this place as I have and will continue to do. Buon appetitto!
