My coworkers & I went to The Hummus and Pita Co yesterday after work. I am a vegetarian and am a very picky eater. I  had a fresh baked Laffa, Hummus and Spanish eggplant and it was absolutely delicious. I can't wait to go back and try more of their vegetarian menu. We stayed for some time as the music and atmosphere was  warm and cool. I was really happy with the cost of my dish ($8.95) plus everything was so fresh and right out of the oven.  I  was also very pleased that it was a environmentally friendly establishment  and I will definitely be back again!
