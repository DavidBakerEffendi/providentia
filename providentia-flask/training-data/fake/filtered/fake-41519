Superb service & great food! My only disappointment was that the waiter selected and insanely fantastic glass of wine for me & it was the last one! It was my husbands birthday & we went out quite late & they didn't rush us at all: ) & even sang happy birthday as we closed the place! Super! We will definitely go back! The escargot was delicious as was the filet mignon! Still craving another glass of that smooth amazing red wine...next time! Thank you for a lovely fun time! Xoxo
