Really delicious food and pretty good service. Considering the quality of food and neighborhood the price is reasonable. I went with three friends. We were told the wait was one hour on a Saturday but got seated outside within 20 minutes. The entrees are tasty and reasonable in size. Appetizers are truly appetizer side. Just enough to get you started but much that you are no longer hungry for the main course. The wine suggestion was also very good. Highly recommending it.
