I was quite excited to try this new burger place, as I have been known to enjoy a good burger, so I decided to give it a try today late this afternoon. I ordered my food and found a place to sit down, eventually. I was called for my food and went to the counter, they handed me the bag and went back to what they were doing. I patiently waited and finally was able to acquire the soda which came with my order. I sat down and began trying out the food.    The first bight of my burger was amazing! So I excitedly tried one of my fries; much to my dismay tey had a very very funny taste to them, as I had a few more I really began to have a bad taste in my mouth so I had a sip of my soda. I continued savoring my burger and quickly forgot about the fries, no big loss in bad fries right? So as I went to take a third sip from my soda I realized that although it felt heavy it was already void of any soda, I peeked inside only to find it almost filled to the brim with ice. I went up to the counter and asked for a refill on the $2 soda, I was told that it is their policy not to provide refills.    That was it after fries, that are now making me feel quite ill, and a soda that was filled to the brim with ice and would not be refilled I cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a meal. The only reason this place did not receive a single star is because their burger, the signature medium-rare 500 degree burger, was actually quite excellent.        If you're looking for JUST a burger give the place a try, just don't expect smiling service.
