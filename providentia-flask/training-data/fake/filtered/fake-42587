This is absolutely the best chinese food you can find. I have been ordering from them for 10 years and I simply can not go anywhere else now. If its not New Man Hing, its not worth it. I am not afraid to try something new off the menu because I am never disappointed. They do not make their food too greasy, and when I call they just need my phone # and it gives them my address as well as my ordering history (yes I have asked "what did I order last time, it was good") My delivery is reliably here in around 20 minutes, and the service is always friendly. Portions are good, and reasonably priced. Important plus when Â you are a feeding a family of 5! Just one warning though.... after eating here, you will never want to eat chinese food anywhere else. :) Enjoy!
