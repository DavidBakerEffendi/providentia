I've had both brunch and dinner here and each time I've left incredibly happy. The truffled egg crostini and marscapone clover honey crostini are both amazing for either brunch or dinner. The gorgonzola burger at brunch was great. The cavatappi entree is to die for. Try the "life changing" tiramisu. The servers and owner (I've only met the woman) are friendly and attentive - never an empty water glass. I know next to nothing about wine, but the servers are great at making recommendations. Great for a date or a catch-up dinner with a friend or two.
