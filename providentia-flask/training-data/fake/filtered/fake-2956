There is a lot of hype surrounding this place, not really sure why. I've eaten there twice in the past year and both times have left me disappointed. To start, the place is very crowded and the hostess' are simply rude. On the first occasion we were told an hour wait. It turned into 2 1/2 hours. The second occasion we had reservations and still waited close to an hour. This would all be made up for if the food was spectacular but it's far from that. Both times they ran out of pork. How does a Cuban restaurant run out of pork? That's like McDonalds running out of beef. Simply doesn't make sense. Â The waiters are nice, but overwhelmed and seemed to constantly forget parts of the orders. There is no bar or waiting area so the patrons waiting for a table intermingle throughout the restaurant; it feels like someone is hanging over your shoulder as your trying to eat. Truthfully, I think I would go out of the way to not eat at this place.
