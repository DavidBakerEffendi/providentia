Great food at perfect prices.  My dad always wants to go to this place when he comes in from out of town.  Good beer selection, too.  They have great entertainment, and nothing beats their anniversary parties (last Monday of every September).  Chocolate crepes are so good, and the schnitzel is great.  If you're hungry and on a budget, this should be your first stop.
