As of right now, I am having mixed reviews on this place. I've ordered many salads from pizzerias and so far, this is the place to get a real good garden salad. The lettuce is actually mixed greens, not just a head of iceberg lettuce cut up & the salad is put together nicely & its cold! other pizzerias salads are warm and its not really appealing. Although i may like there salads, i'm not too keen on the customer service. I work in the hospitality industry & we hand out their menus for our in house guests to order take out if they request it. We ordered lunch and it took nearly 2 hours for it to be delivered after we were told approx 35 minutes. I get that places get busy, especially around lunch time - but i'm curious to know if our guests have to wait 2 hours for a meal?? we called to follow up to find out where the food was & i was taken back at how rude the guy was. saying that it hasnt been 2 hours... thats right sir, in 15 minutes it will be 2 hours. he kept arguing with me. i sincerely hope this doesnt keep happening, because we might just have to look for another pizzeria to refer to our guests. i'm a bit disappointed.
