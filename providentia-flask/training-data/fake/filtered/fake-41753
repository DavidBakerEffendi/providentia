The new chef and management at this place has been a great improvement! Quality and attention to detail seems second to none, and the people are so friendly and accommodating! I don't usually eat sushi either, but when I came here with friends, I saw the chef working (since it's an open kitchen) and how he works so carefully and diligently to plate the dishes so elegantly. He also has an awesome history of cooking! No doubt, a new hang out place for me!
