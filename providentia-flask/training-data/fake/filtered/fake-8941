I've been going to Employees Only for a while, but not anymore. I used to go, have something to eat and schmooze with the managers. The service used to be good, they had a diversified menu. Now since they've become so popular, there is always a line and it's difficult to get in after 10. Their menus went from having cheap/medium/expensive appetizers and entrees, to 24$-39$ entrees. They closed the back. I went at 9:30. Our tab was around 60$..the waitress came by every two seconds asking if we wanted something more. I asked for a cappuccino after dinner, and she got snotty..and after 30 minutes, they decided a 60$ tab was too much, and kicked us out.
