Best soup dumplings I have ever had. Yes you have to eat with strangers but it is oddly not that awkward and not an environment where conversation is forced. I suggest not ordering an entree if you are going to order the dumplings as they are very filling and it makes for a cheap meal. The portion sizes are very large and you get a very good deal. Biggest downside is the only alcohol they serve is imported Chinese beer and rice wine.
