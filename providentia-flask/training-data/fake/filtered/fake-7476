Oh Balthazar.  I love you.  I love you for dinner at a booth on the line.  I love you for lunch, solo, at the bar.  I love you tucked into a corner for breakfast with my man.  I just love the way you smell, the the bustling, your all-business servers, your omelets and frittes, your bread and butter, your steak, chicken or fish, your onion tarte and oh,  your expresso.  Honestly I adore desert, but the experience I have with you is always so sweet and satisfying, I've never longed for or tasted your dessert Balthazar But I will be back. xo
