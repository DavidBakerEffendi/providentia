They have good coffee but that's not the main reason I'm giving cafe twelve 4 stars.  it sticks out because of the seating.  It's easily one of the most comfortable cafes ive even been to. there are long couches flanked by puffy armchairs.  but it's not just one of those lazy cafe's there are great tables to work out and to collaborate with people.  when i have a client i often choose to meet them at cafe 12 due to its subdued and focused ambiance.
