We enjoyed our food , after fire works, we visited this restaurant for the meal, since we just recently moved in lyndhurst, after checking all reviews we tried it, it was not just the worth to try but so good, everything what we had starting from samosa palak paneer chicken tikka masala and how can I forget those delicious gulab jamun. Loved every bite of it! You won our heart and you will see us more often! Kudos!!!
