I'm not sure if I love this place because the people that cook and bartend are some of the nicest humans ever or if the food is actually as delectable as I remember. Their brisket is OUT OF CONTROL and the craft beer selection was a huge plus. ALSO. goat necks. don't forget about the goat neck. A definite must!! Love this place!!
