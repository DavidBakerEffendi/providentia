The Groupon is not worth the trip there first of all. It is not stated on Groupon, that Â oxtails, short ribs or the shrimp is not part of the Groupon. You pay $27.00 for value of $53.90. Now all the other items are less than $12.00. It is on the web site your choice of four sides, well this is not true, you are only allowed two sides. Please make the correction. I ordered the fish and one piece was served with my sides. My girlfriend ordered chicken breast and received a leg with the breast, leg is not the white meat. She was told they were out of wings. OK, let the customer know before you decided to make a choice for her. I did not enjoy the food at all and the service was poor. Waiting 15 minutes for your check is too long for a customer. People are entitled to their opinion about what they enjoy eating. I limited my comments on Yelp, from the original comments that was put on Face book and they were removed.
