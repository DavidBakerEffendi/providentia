I believe P&M is the best market on Orange street because it is not just about the great people they have working there and their environment inside the store. It is also  the wide variety of items that they have in the store, their well prepared food,  the way they are organized, and the little of Italy that they have in every corner of the store. Their is never one day that I go and see people leave the store without a smile on their face.
