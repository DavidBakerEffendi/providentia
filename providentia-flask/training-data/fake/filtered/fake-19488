Just got back from Std Tap ... We had a great experience eating and dinning until we went downstairs.   We went to the bar and grab 4 beers and my wife and brother's wife grab a seat at on open table.   The waiter physically pushed me twice and than kicked the girls off the table.   I asked the waiter to discuss with his boss.   BTW,  the room was full of open tables at the time. Martin the manager came over  and said we were combative .  Really ?  I was being pushed by his waiter.   I'm a 53 yr old engineer with my brothers and wives.   They wanted us away from the tables such that the girls could not sit down.  We left.   I will try to reach out to the owners to discuss.
