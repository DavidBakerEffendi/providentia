I haven't has ramen in a while and was craving for some authentic Japanese ramen. This was perfect. My friends and I loved it. I got the miso pork broth ramen. Highly recommend it. The only downside is that the restaurant is very small. We had to wait for a bit, but the hostess was very nice about it and seated us as soon as a table opened up.
