We are vegetarian and made it clear to the host (even called up before hand to make sure that the seven course meal Â had a vegetarian alternative as well and we were assured that the restaurant indeed had a vegetarian menu). Yet, our second course had egg and something that tasted like fish. We sent it back and never received a replacement course. The third course had such sour spinach filling that it was inedible and again had to be sent back. No apology nor a replacement was offered. The forth course was the best and I asked them to give us a bit extra to make up for the earlier two courses. They didn't get us the extra helping and when I inquired after 15 mins, simply said they don't have it. Overall, a bad experience and a quite shady one on top of everything. We were charged a 18% gratuity automatically and our son was charged full price when it should have been less for kids under 12.
