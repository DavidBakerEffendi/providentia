Horrible hostesses! I was told that the wait would be an hour and told i would be seated earlier if possible. After an hour and 15 minutes wait we were still not seated, when we inquired why it was taking so long we were told we had misunderstood the wait time and that we were pestering the wait staff. I have never been treated so rudely and with such disrespect at a restaurant. Their unhelpful and negative attitude unnecessarily put a damper on our evening and for that fact I would never go back to Locanda Verde. The owners of this establishment need to train their staff to learn what it means to be in the service industry because the people standing at the front if that restaurant have no clue.
