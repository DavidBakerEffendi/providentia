Fantastic, fresh custom home made food with that old world flavor. Good service, wine selection. Owners are friendly and accomodated our dietary needs. The pasta and fish dishes are amazing but be prepared to blow your diet on their home made desserts. The Â Apple Tiramisu is one of a kind. Very reasonably priced. The best value in Mercer county.
