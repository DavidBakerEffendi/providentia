This place has changed beyond recognition. I've lived in the neighborhood for 6 years and Bubbys has slipped from a place I ordered from 3 times a week to never. What happened guys? What happened to the burger? Used to be a nicely seasoned, not overly fat burger to a big hunk of unseasoned mince meat. It's big, sure, but it's greasy and tasteless and not worth 14 bucks. Also, whilst I'm on the burger, what happened to the potato bun? Now it's a cheap burger bun you bought at the deli across the street. Okay. The chicken caesar salad. Used to be tasty, seasoned grilled chicken, plenty of it. Crisp romaine and shavings of Parmesan and delicious croutons. Now it's a semi grilled, semi boiled piece of chicken that's overcooked and just tasteless. The romaine is old and the cheese and croutons tasted stale. Here's the kicker: it's 18 dollars. You should be ashamed. Bubbys is known for comfort food. It's also known for being a little pricey but that's okay, it used to be worth it. Not any more. Bubbys have forgotten what they did well. I suspect the decision to stay open all night has taken its toll on the quality because this place used to great. Now it's barely average, at best.
