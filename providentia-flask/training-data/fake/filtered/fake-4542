I want to like you Green Eggs Cafe, I really do.  But each time I  visit, things seems to go further down hill.  I like your convenience (a few blocks away).  I like your design and atmosphere (lots of room, bright, outdoor seating). But, the kinks i What I don't like is the poor service (our weekend visit had one person at our table waiting an extra 20 minutes for their entree, constantly tracking down servers for sugar, salt and pepper, ketchup, etc.). What I don't like is the inconsistent food ( a cold biscuit on top of my kitchen sink, multiple chicken bones in the chicken salad sandwich, under-cooked fries, over-cooked eggs and bread that was green and not in a good way). Green Eggs, please get some more competent servers, more consistency with what is coming out of the kitchen and how about breaking down and putting some sugar, salt and pepper, ketchup, and hot sauce on the table so I don't have to spend 15 minutes tracking down a server to get a small spoonful. I promise I won't steal it.   And come on....no one charges for ice tea refills, unless you are at a bar.  As summer approaches how about keeping a pitcher of ice tea ready for those free refills.  Can you really be saving/making that much money on these items?   I sure hope things start to improve soon instead of continuing to slide.
