My husband and went to Santucci's last Sunday.  We shared a Farmer's Salad (really good), each had the spaghetti and meatballs, and finished the meal off by sharing the creme brulee for dessert (only $3!).  I enjoyed the experience so much that I chose Santucci's for my birthday dinner last night.  Unfortunately, this turned out to be a bad idea.  We got the Farmer's Salad again, but the quality of the lettuce wasn't so good this time.  My husband got a small order of Buffalo Chicken wings.  He said that the quality of the chicken was good, but that the wings tasted like fried chicken rather than Buffalo Chicken.  We both got the spaghetti and meatballs again, and those dishes were fine. What really soured me on the whole experience, though, was a service issue.  I ordered a creme brulee for dessert.  A couple who were sitting two tables away overheard me and later asked their waitress (a different one from ours) "Do you really have creme brulee?"  When their waitress told them yes, they said that they were in a hurry and asked if they could have a creme brulee to go.  Their waitress told them that, unfortunately, the creme brulee could not be made to go.  Well, my creme brulee was ready and I saw it sitting on the serving counter.  The other couple's waitress picked it up and said "Well, we just happen to have a creme brulee ready if you want it now," and she served my dessert to the other couple.   I didn't make a scene because it wasn't the other couple's fault, but I did question my waitress about what happened, and she just blew it off.  She kept telling me that my creme brulee was just about ready, but I ended up waiting 20 minutes for it -- way too long even if they hadn't hijacked my dessert to give to someone else. I'm always very patient when it comes to restaurant service, but I can't tolerate it when they serve people out of order.  This is the very definition of what I call bad service.
