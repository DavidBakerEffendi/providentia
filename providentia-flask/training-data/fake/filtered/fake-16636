This place is seriously great. That's all I have to say! No, but really, they have excellent lunch specials, and the rolls are much better than most sushi I've had in Philadelphia. They do a pleasant, quick lunch. The atmosphere leaves something to be desired, but for a solitary lunch, or a quick bite with a friend, it's fine. Wouldn't take a date here. Also, you can always get takeout if you're picky.
