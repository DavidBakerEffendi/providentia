Holy Vomit in my mouth. Im not from the area so I wasnt sure what I was getting myself into. Everything is on par with an applebees that has been open for quite some time. I even realized when I was speaking to my server that locals dont come and eat here due to the fact that the food is so bad. Tourists are the only people that feed the bank accounts of the greedy owner. That is what I was told by an employee. Apparently there has been alot of turnover in the restaurant in the past few weeks and it was obviously seen from just viewing the flow of dinning here. Its too bad the place doesnt take advantage of having a great location. Probably wont be returning on my next visit, I heard there is a place right around the corner called FarmHouse that I should try. I can say that I enjoyed the beer called Switchback, maybe I will come back for one of those unless I can find another place around Burlington that carries it..... Again the food was nothing spectacular that a gas station deli couldnt mock and there was a middle aged manager with a receding hair line that came over and said a very generic statement..."hey yall how are you"...and immediately left but had plenty of time to stick his tongue out a few times...
