I've been to "The Pig" several times with friends. This time, I took my wife for a lunch/brunch on a lovely November Saturday afternoon. We arrived just around noon and had to wait about 1/2 hour. No problem, plenty of seats around the bar downstairs (usually I go upstairs), ordered a couple of cocktails and a couple of orders of the dee-lish deviled eggs. We were seated by the delightful host, and were quickly brought water. We then ordered the Dutch Baby (a mix between a pancake and a crepe) with bacon and syrup, poached eggs with suckling pig hash and an order of string fries. Everything was so good and made even better with a small slice of pecan pie and bourbon sauce. Like always, even with a pretty good crowd waiting, we were never rushed and treated so well. Really nice job to the whole staff.
