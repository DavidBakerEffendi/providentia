I have been here over a half-dozen times, and it has never been short of amazing. I have only ever ordered the pizza, because it is absolutely phenomenal and at an unheard of price. You can buy a large pizza to split for under twenty dollars. For the quality of the ingredients and preparation, the location, and the service, this really is a price you cannot beat.
