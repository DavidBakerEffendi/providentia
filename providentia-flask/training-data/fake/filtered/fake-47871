Barbara's Hungarian Restaurant is one of my favorite places. When I eat there, I feel like I'm sitting at my Grandmother's kitchen table - and my family's not even Hungarian! Everything I've had has been delicious - and the helpings are generous. My favorites are the homemade chicken noodle soup, the cucumber salad, and the goulash. The owners could not be more delightful and welcoming. They even taught me a few words in Hungarian! I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal in a cozy environment.
