Great home made lasagna. Every meal comes with free garlic bread, good size salad and home made hot bread made daily. Real veal not the frozen, cardboard patties in most Jersey pizzeria's. A variety of selections along with daily specials and in this economy the prices are great. Under new ownership since late last year.  A real family place  like the old days.
