My small group was seated immediately with an hour time limit, which we agreed to, because of a reservation for another party. The waitress promptly informed us when that party canceled, which was awesome as we were able to relax a bit more. The asparagus, octopus salad, duck and pork chops were all deliciously seasoned. The pork chops were a bit dry around the edges, but the tender and juicy middle more than made up for that. We've always walked by this place ogling the food, and we'll continue to ogle because the food was that good. The deduction was for the 20 minute wait between having our plates cleared and getting the check. Prior to that, the service was great.
