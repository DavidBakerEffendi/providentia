We were on our way to a brewery that got a good review in Connecticut magazine, when we walked past this little restaurant.  We did a double take, read the menu in the window, and quickly changed plans. What ambiance.  We were transported to Turkey for the evening. The heavy gold brocade, rugs on the walls, lighting fixtures- gorgeous.  My husband loved the dim lighting.  The humus is different from what we are used to, and we really loved it.    We ordered the red lentil soup, the cucumber salad, all really nice.  Can't wait to go back for the belly dancing.
