I come here for every birthday. The food is simply amazing, with variety for every pallet. If you don't find what you like, just ask for it. This family business is always happy to accommodate your needs. It is small and intimate but that is part of the charm... like sitting down with your large family for an amazing 'home-cooked' meal.
