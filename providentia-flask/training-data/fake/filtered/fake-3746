My husband and I were both very disappointed with Hapgoods.  The interior is very charming, but also very loud because there is nothing to absorb the sound.  So our hopes of having a nice, quiet breakfast were gone because not only is the restaurant loud but we were seated next to a table that had a very loud baby. It took a very long time to get our drinks (coffee and iced tea) following by a long wait for the breakfast which was at best mediocre.  I don't know how this restaurant got 4 stars and higher.  We will not be coming back.
