This place is awesome. Even when the rest of Montclair is dead for lunch, this place has a wait! And for good reason! We stumbled on this place the other day and were surprised at how great the food and service were even though there were only 2 waiters for the whole restaurant. I will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend it.
