I hosted a reception at Jadis on the night of my wedding day.  Working with Edit could not have been more pleasant.  We reserved the entire restaurant for about 60 guests, and the space was perfect - it could also have comfortably fit more people.  With zero fuss and stress, Edit helped me to plan a menu of wines and hors d'oeuvres.  The food was great and plentiful, the wine was fantastic, and the staff were as lovely as could be.  Edit in particular treated me like royalty.  My guests all had a wonderful time, and I received many comments on what a pleasant, comfortable and attractive space it was.  I would highly recommend hosting your event here. Mine could not have gone better.  And of course, I'd also recommend going just for a glass of wine or for a meal.  I plan to, many many times in future.  Thanks Edit, and the rest of your incredible staff!
