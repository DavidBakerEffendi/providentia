My go-to Indian restaurant in Princeton. A little bit cheaper than Masala Grill, and they deliver. I like the chicken biryani and malai kofta. I've certainly had better lunch buffets, but Tandoori Bite's is only $9 for students and in Princeton. Service (including delivery) is always quick and courteous.
