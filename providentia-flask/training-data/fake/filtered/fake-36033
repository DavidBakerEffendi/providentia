Possibly the best wood-fired pizza in Brooklyn. Here's the run down: The pies themselves are smaller than at most places, but the prices reflect that, and plus, this way you can try more than one without feeling like a total fatty. The pies are deceptively simple. A few key ingredients like amazingly soft and fresh mozarella, thinly sliced speck or prosciutto and a few basil leaves, plus a sweet tomato sauce that tastes like pure love on a crust that is at once crunchy and perfectly charred on the bottom but light and fluffy when you bite down. Add to that a great, warm and cozy feeling interior space and it's a perfect dinner experience. Paulie Gee, I think I love you.
