I read the other reviews before starting on this one; I must go to Wildflowers at a different time than these other folks or I have different standards. Whether we're with a group ordering 3 pies and a pitcher or alone ordering a water and salad, our service is always friendly and quick enough for a bar. The wait never seems interminable, except for when I'm dying for a Romi burger, Wildflowers' version of the pizza burger, and that I want RIGHT NOW! Char-grill taste on the meat, great pickles (I have a friend who always asks for extra pickles right up front, they're that good), perfect fries. My son had that tonight. I grew up near New York, so know good pizza and Wildflowers pie is the best in the area. I had the small antipasto tonight and my husband had a side salad with his dinner, the greens in the salads were exceptional. We've been going to Wildflowers since before it was Wildflowers, for me since 1975 when I moved up to this area. Many groups I work/play with go to 'flowers, and not just sports teams, even church committees go to 'flowers for a celebration. Wildflowers is also a good neighbor supporting local groups. The fried broccoli is an addictive appetizer, pizza and burgers very good, French onion soup, good and cheesy, I don't think we've ever been disappointed.
