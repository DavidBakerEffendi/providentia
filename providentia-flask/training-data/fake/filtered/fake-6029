The simplistic food served here is a joy. Changing everyday I've had everything from the (r.i.p) hot sticky mess( I'll pay in dish washing if you bring this back!) The daily sandwich, recently had 2 thick slices of perfectly juicy heirloom tomato, this way too good chili mustarda(something), a fresh lemon aioli, and dandelion plus kale. It was on a newer wheat bread that is made with the leftover juice pulp ( they serve delicious juice and tonic) also tons of grains and stuff, so it's like a damn heathly ridiculously tasty package in your mouth. What else. The grits are perfect, they have like 5 toppings you can put on, like an organic soft egg, spicy sauce, love juice and this bacon that's like an inch thick, each for a buck.   This place is amazing, oh, and bread? It's beautiful and my only problem is that they have so many breads they cant do them all everyday so you don't really know what they have on any day specifically. It's always amazing, just nice to know. Thanks for Being so good SCRATCHbread, you have made living here a pleasure.  You were my first love in bed study 2 years ago .now I want babies with you. PS..I ALMOST FORGOT!!!!!  The Baba Spread is the best in the city. I want to sleep inside it. Yummmmmmmmmmmm. Another cook(not a fan of yelp)
