I like Market Table. The calamari was fine. The bed of guacamole was tasty- very fresh and Cali approved. The mussels were also good. I'm not sure if they were going for the mussel taste only, but they would've been 5-star if seasoned. For my entree I had the lamb. I've had lamb in many places and this is up there with the best of them- tender and unadulterated. The Gouda Au gratin was nice and cut through the gamey lamb (is fat supposed to cut through fat?). The greens were SO buttery- in a good way. I had the apple pie for desert and while the pie was on par the ice cream was slap your momma good. The thing about Market Table that stood out was the service. I know the service has been knocked before, but maybe rent was coming up. Our server was the perfect blend of accommodating and attentive, yet unobtrusive. I would go back just for her. She was sincere and the timing was perfect. I would go back for sure.
