It is hard to give this place even 1 star... The service was horrible, one of the many issues was.. when we requested another bottle of wine, the inexperienced, frazzled waiter brought the wrong wine.  The WORST part was when we presented four credit cards and some cash, telling the waiter how much money should be put on each card, which would have given the less than adequate waiter a 23% tip. The manager told the two that waited behind because the play was starting....it was not possible to bill the cards equally .... They would be "off a dollar or two".   Long story short, the waiter got a 30%+ tip.  There are many fine places to dine in New Haven without getting ripped off!  Don't go here.
