Yuk. Every roll we ordered had the consistency of red bean paste (sweet, gooey, and discolored), combined ingredients more to shock than meld, and served at room temperature as if they had been sitting out all day.  The service was slow and maintained an air of skepticism, which was hard not to return by the end of the evening.  In fact, at the end of the night, we couldn't finish the fried ice cream because our stomachs were upset and the ice cream was worse than Blue Bunny.  Upon seeing this, the table next to us intercepted the waitress as she was clearing our ice cream and, together, they ridiculed us for not finishing.  Last time I checked, such a practice would not be well received by a food inspector.  Out of principle, I still left a 20% tip, but the server didn't deserve it after that. Rewinding, we should have left after we learned that they take reservations but don't honor them.  We showed up on time for our reservation, and when we arrived there were three groups ahead of us (none of whom had a reservation).  All of them were seated before us.  Meanwhile, a group of 6 came in after us and were seated before us despite that they didn't have a reservation. It should advertise as a vegetarian restaurant, because that's their drive.  It's not sushi and it's certainly not Japanese.  It would still be disgusting, but at least one wouldn't have felt deceived.
