I dined at Casa Mano about 8 years ago and was less than impressed particularly with the services and how they rushed us through our dinner to flip the table (typical Mario Batali) and it was overpriced. Thought I would give it another try 8 years later and nothing has changed. Â Bad service and an obnoxious hostess.
