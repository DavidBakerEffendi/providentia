High hopes not realized---but we're pulling for them to succeed in Yardley. So my wife and I, along with another couple, went last night on recommendations of a friend.  Overall food is OK, but need to describe some major shortcomings: 1.  Wife ordered "rock shrimp risotto" to share with me.  First off, these folks don't even know what "rock shrimp" are (Gulf of Mexico delicacy).  Just call it what it is --little frozen shrimp.  Characterizing a dish as containing rock shrimp, when it does not, is fraudulent and shows culinary ignorance.  Second, this was the worst interpretation of risotto I have ever experienced: it was saturated in olive oil--which was all you could taste.  The texture was closer to oatmeal than our cherished comfort food staple. This was insulting and unforgivable. 2. Had to ask for water several times. 3. Appetizers came very quickly.  Entrees took over an hour after the apps. Our entrees were pretty tasty:  Branzino, Porchetta, Rib Eye, Chicken all met expectations for flavor and ingredients.  However, we thought that an hour wait after apps was way too long.  They need to get the overall pace of the meal consistent.  The scene there on a Saturday night is fairly chaotic---such so that we might have been passed over for our table had my wife not noticed the mousy maitre'd sheepishly trying to find us among the crowd waiting to be seated.  Too many young, inexperienced help for such a bustling place.   Bottom line:  Get your service ironed out and and review your menu--do it well or don't do it.
