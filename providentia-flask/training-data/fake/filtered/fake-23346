Okay so we stumbled across this. Stalled before going in to see a menu (from outside looked rundown). Was impressed with seeing inside. A lot bigger than first thought. Clean and tidy with a dated look. Was offered warm rolls to begin with from a basket. Food was amazing. We had burgers, pasta and chicken pie. We all cleared our plates. We also had deserts, wine and soda. The bill for 4 of us was only about Â£60! Bargain :)
