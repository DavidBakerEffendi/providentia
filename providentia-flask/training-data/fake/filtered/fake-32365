Why does this place exist? Only cynically, to appeal to those of us who have been in the neighborhood long enough to know that there have been no good restaurants here forever? To drag people from other neighborhoods up to "Brooklyn" proper where overpriced mediocre food can be had in a "woody" and "handcrafted" context where the harsh light of day reveals how new and desperate for authenticity it actually is? The decor is proper to the intended audience.....people who work behind computers but spend $300 on "genuine American" work shirts from Japan or selvedge denim pants that never see grease or sawdust. Food is merely okay. Absolutely nothing warrants any comment for the price but for two things: they only offer one type of oyster with one type of garnish; the house drinks are made by someone with a sweet tooth. The only good thing about this place is that it isn't called "Brooklyn Alameda" or "Bklyn Alameda".
