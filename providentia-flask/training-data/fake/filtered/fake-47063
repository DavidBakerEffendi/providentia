this place was amazing! we started with the stuffed artichoke and it was delish! also we had the mini rice balls with marscapone chesse and prochiutto they were the best i ever had i thought they would be dry because they were small but they were not at all they were creamy and salty and yummy! then we had the classic pizza with sweet sausage and roasted peppers which is what we get at every brick oven pizza place and by far this was the best! It came to the table cook just right with a slightly burnt edge but not over done, pizza made like this has to be welldone or its soup!( At eataly it was just that! and last time we went to grimaldi's it was undone because they always rush you even when we ask for well done! Lucali in carroll gardens is still the best!) we had a great montipuciano and ice cold morati's and our waiter was so friendly and attentive! we would of had dessert but we saw the little cupcake bake shop around the block and decided to go there! Amazing bakery! we went early mid-week so there was no wait I heard the weekend are insane! worth a trip for sure!! we will be back!
