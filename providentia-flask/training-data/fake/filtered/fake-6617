This restaurant has good ambiance and the atmosphere is relatively modern.  There seems to be a high turnover of waitstaff, but they have all generally been friendly.  The food doesn't disappoint in taste, but it is expensive for the portion size.  When in the area, I consistently stop here for lunch.
