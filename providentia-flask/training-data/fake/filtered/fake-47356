The quality and presentation of the food is superb.  The filet Mignon, which may not be on the menu, is the best. Ask the waiter if they have it.  The pan seared scallops are great.  The lentil soup is wonderful. Atmosphere is great, service is very good. The prices are a little higher than most BYO, but worth it.  Highly recommend.
