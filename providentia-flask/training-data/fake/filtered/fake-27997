We've been there six times since the first of the year....food and service is inconsistent.  Management seems disconnected and unconcerned with customer satisfaction.  Meals lack seasoning and attention.  Had a Shepherd's pie yesterday that was essentially chop meat and potatoes. They can do better but are not motivated.
