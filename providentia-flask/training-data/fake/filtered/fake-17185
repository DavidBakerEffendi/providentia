This place is simply the best. The mexican samosa are great and so is the chinese samosa. Â The india chinese fusion food is amazing we only found 1 items to be subpar but the rest was great. Also the chaats and sandwiches are amazing. the junglee jumbo is the best but 1 person can't finish it need altleat 4.
