First-timer and let me tell you . . . DELISH!!! I wanted to order everything on the menu, but settled for the cheese pie, falafel and rice pudding. Everthing was incredibly fresh and delicious.  The falafel was not heavy, was light, filled with great flavor.  The rice pudding was out of this world. Wonderful to see a family-run restaurant.  Ambience was perfect; cleanliness top notch. Not to mention the rockbottom prices. I would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.  Go there, you'll love it, too.
