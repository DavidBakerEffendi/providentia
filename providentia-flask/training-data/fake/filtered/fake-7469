I always feel as if I've been whisked away to some fab bistro in Paris - that is how I have felt every time I have come to Balthazar.  It's one of my all time favorite places to eat when I go to the Big Apple.   As as been mentioned before, there isn't a huge amount of choice for a vegetarian,  but the overall experience is fantastic.  The service is truly excellent, old school and professional and you never feel rushed.   Wish I could visit more often!
