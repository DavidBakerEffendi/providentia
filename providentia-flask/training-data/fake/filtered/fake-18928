It was pretty good. I have to admit that I have only tried the house slice. It did taste good, but it was good in the sort of way that reminded me or spinach artichoke dip just slopped on some pizza with extra cheese melted on top. Not in the sort of gourmet way one could expect. Next time I am going to try the Margherita slice and see how that works out. I tell you it did look delish. I will update my review accordingly after I try it. But for now I have to give it a 3, good but not great.
