Went for pizza because it was recommended to me by another person who has Celiac disease.  It means I have to eat Gluten Free.  Happened to be watching how they made it and discovered they REALLY DO NOT understand what G/F means.  They used the same sauce and ladle as for all their pizzas.  When I brought this to their attention, I was told, "this is how we always do it."  They were perplexed as to what to do when the owner asked what the problem was.  I explained and he ordered another pie with a clean ladle and sauce.  So I watched from a distance and the pie was prepped by the same person making all the other pies, with his hands from the regular dough.  This is cross-contamination!  I did eat that pizza and am paying the price today.  My advice if you have Celiac disease, don't eat where they think it's a fad.  Ask if they understand what the fuss is all about. On another note, my companion thought the regular pizza was good and the place was clean. D.C. Pompton Plains
