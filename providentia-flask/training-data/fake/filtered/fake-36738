I am here to challenge some of the unreasonable reviews I've read about PYT, as a devoted regular. Of the negative reviews I've read, almost all seem to be from people in the wrong place to find what they were looking for. If you are looking for a quick, quiet place for a sit-down bite during peak times, this is not the bar you're looking for. If you want a standardized server who checks on you regularly scheduled intervals, there are franchises for that. Plenty of them. If you have some friends and you want to meet them for some food, some drinks and a good time, come to PYT. Hands down the most fun dining experiences I've had in Philadelphia were there, and I get around. The music is great. The food is excellent and original. The prices are more than reasonable. The servers are more than friendly. They're fun, interesting and downright personable. If you want something, ask them, they'll help you out. They're great. Caroline, in particular, has been my server several times and has truly gone above and beyond. And PYT has continued to surprise and delight me as a bar, restaurant and party hotspot.
