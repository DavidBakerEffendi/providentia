I don't get these reviews?? They don't appear to fake to me, but I question their knowledge of Thai food. The restaurant is small, so it was easy to see it was packed, and everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves like this place is the "place to be". But I have to be honest...the worst Tom Kha Gai and Pad Thai I have ever had (I stuck with easy, standard Thai dishes). The Pad Thai had way too much shrimp sauce and given such, was overly sweet. Noodles were oily. There was BARELY any chicken in it except for some very thin sliced strips scattered here and there. The Tom Kha Gai was overly lemony because they used lemon juice instead of the authentic lemongrass. Very thin, bland and weak broth. Again, hardly any chicken in it at all. And our appetizers (tofu and chicken skewers in peanut sauce) could not be more bland if they tried. Â And the worst part was the bill. I have had WAY better Thai food for a fraction of the price. I guess it gets by on it chicness?
