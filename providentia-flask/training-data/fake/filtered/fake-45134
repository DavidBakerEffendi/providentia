Really delicious! I live and work closeby, so I'm so happy for this place to be open. They have a variety of sandwiches and were able to satisfy both my vegan sister and my carnivorous self! A tad on the slow side, even though there were 3 guys on the counter, but hopefully that works itself out once they're open longer. All in all, definitely worth a visit.
