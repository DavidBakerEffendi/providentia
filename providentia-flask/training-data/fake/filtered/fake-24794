I love tapas! I was here a few weeks ago with a few friends for a birthday dinner on a Sunday. The atmosphere was laid back, not-as crowded on a Sunday, but there were still plenty of people crowding the doorway as we left. The tables were small, and we practically had to pile food on top of each other to squeeze in about 10 plates or so, plus wine glasses and wine bottles. But we had the most delicious wine, and ordered a bunch of plates to share. We all LOVED the food; everything was amazingly delicious!!! We had a beautiful evening. My favorite dishes: pumpkin and goat cheese croquettes -- sooo yummy! Perfect blend of pumpkin and goat cheese razor clams -- very fresh, with a light drizzle of sauce sweetbreads foie gras -- omg, to DIE for... so rich and delicious. Too bad there's only a small piece of it, we had to order a second one. lamb chops -- very tasty, perfectly cooked. skirt steak -- a nice medium rare texture, delicious, nicely marinated fried calamari -- light, fresh, not greasy at all. and not coated with thick batter!
