First of all, I have never been compelled to write a review on Yelp, but after my experience with House of Chao, I need to vent... They just lost a formerly loyal customer tonight... I have NEVER been treated so rudely by restaurant staff (especially since I spent the first part of my life as a waitress, so I always try to be super nice.)  When I called to place and order for pick up and was responded to with such hostility and rudeness, I decided to cancel my order. When I told the staff member, "You know, you really shouldn't talk to your customers this way", she actually hung up on me! Slowness has always been an issue in this place- expect to wait at least an hour for food, even if the place is empty (and even if they tell you that it will take less time... expect to be sitting in the restuarant waiting for you food); but, I have always looked over that problem because I like the food.  Well, no more... someone needs to tell the staff that they aren't doing us a favor when we eat there. From now on, I will happily give my money to an establishment that appreciates my business.
