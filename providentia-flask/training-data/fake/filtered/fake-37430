WOW! There aren't too many other words to explain the experience at 15 Fox Place.  From the warm greeting, to the cozy atmosphere, and then there is the out of this world food, you can NOT go wrong here.  Great place to eat.  Well worth the price and a hidden gem in Jersey City.  You could walk past this house and never know the feast your tastebuds are missing out on.  Glad to have been put on to this place and to be able to pass on the good word.  Michelle was a sweetheart and made the meal all that much better.   Mangia!
