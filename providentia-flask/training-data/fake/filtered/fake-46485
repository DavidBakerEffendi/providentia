My daughter brought me here and this was such a winner that we went the next night as well! Where to start? Love the ambiance, service (the first night we had a great woman, 2nd night the guy was awful!) And the food!!!! BBQ Pork buns - a must Tofu and Nasu agedashi - the eggplant (nasu) was delicious! Could do a whole side of only that. Gindara Saikyo Yaki - delicious, but way too small a portion for the price $16!!! I can't even remember which ramen we had..... the first night we each had something different and the 2nd night we tried a different ramen (just one) and did the Kae-dama where you get an extra serving of noodles for $2. This was perfect! And a generous size of extra noodles. We also added extras, which ups the price, but well worth it - can always go for an extra braised pork! They don't take reservations except for the same day.... AND you have to go in.... nothing over the phone! So stop by during lunch and make your evening reservations. Crowded waiting area. But so worth the wait. If you have room for dessert.... walk over to Rice to Riches! :)
