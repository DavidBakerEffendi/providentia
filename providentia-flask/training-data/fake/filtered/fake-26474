Follow yours nose and you will find Thai Dishes! In the summer or winter months, this resturant is definitely a destination. We had a wait (  good sign) however, we never felt uncomfortable because host directed us right to the bar which had some great local beers on tap. The turn over was wicked fast. Within a few minutes we had water, new beers, and placed our order for appetizers.  That point on, the service and food were great! We did a family style meal ( everyone at the table ordered one thing and we shared) which worked out perfectly. Im not usually an all veggie kind of person, but I could have the veggie Pad Pet as my solo meal. At the end of the meal the owner stopped by to make sure everything was on point, which made us feel like part of the community. Such a good experience! Happy we finally have a Thai place in the heart of Burlington! Well done!
