I went to this restautant because my favorite place in princeton had closed, bye Underground Cafe. Â We ordered some tapas, meatballs and dates, the dates were great the meatballs were clearly out of the bag frozen, even worse the price. Then entrees I have never seen so much oil on ravoli which was not in a garlic and oil sauce just saturated, and my pork shank was so dissapointing. It was slow and I ended up throwing more han half of my entree out. The server said nothing and the manager never came by the table, i would think if some one lets u take the plate and over half the entree is left that might be cause for concern. With the prices I would have expected a ton more.
