My recent dinner was very disappointing.  I ordered filet mignon and it was under cooked (medium rare) the waitress returned it to the kitchen.  When my steak returned it  was overcooked to the point of being extra well done. After several cuts into my steak I noticed a large piece of tough gristle and ar that point I had enough and ask waitress to take my plate. She offered to talk to the manager and all that was offered was $5 off my meal... The manager probably thought that was a bargain but my thoughts are when you pay for something you should get what you pay for and not an over cooked filet with gristle. The moral of the story here is dont bother ordering the filet because it most likely is not a filet and the manager does not care about its patrons. In all my years of eating a filet mignon I never had a piece tough gristle in my steak which leads me to believe it was not a filet at all. Only giving 2 stars due to the excellent service the waitress gave otherwise it would be only one star. PS Don't waste your time eating at this restaurant... Save your money...
