i had a dinner there friday night and was pleasantly surprised ... we shared couple of things and everything was great we started with the Mezetto Trio ( try the hummus ), the bourekas were great my favorite mini zaatar flat bread.. absolutely delicious we also shared the lamb sliders ( very interesting Â ) ... and the burger ( best i had so far)
