Been here twice and the food was a huge disappointment. Chicken liver toast was OK, nothing special and passable as an easily forgettable hors'deurve at a cocktail party. The burger was terrible - way too salty and oily. The quality of the meat itself was good, but roquefort just overpowered any sense of that with its brininess. It was nearly inedible. BTW, I love blue and cheese and I love hamburgers but this burger clearly missed the mark. Also, the fries were ice cold (problem with very thin shoe string fries in general) and way too salty as well. Corner Bistro for 1/3 price any day of the week and you won't be disappointed.
