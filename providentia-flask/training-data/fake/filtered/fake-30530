bottom line; expensive, lousy service, slightly above-par food, decent atmosphere, not well managed (what did you expect from philly). I signed up for yelp just to comment on this place.  the waitress was not all that polite and seemed very superficial. she made us wait a long time for everything, they weren't even understaffed, they had 3-4 waitresses for 7-10 tables.  They gave complementary beverages to everyone in the joint except us. I will never go to this place, again and I will actually discourage everyone I know from going there.  I left still hungry, angry and my wallet lighter (except most of the tip I did not give to one of the worst waitresses I have ever had).  I know all you waiters/waitresses think that isn't right but if you treat a customer like trash and they give you a 50 cent tip, they are basically saying you were a dick (not that they are bad tippers).  awful experience, needs new management and better wait staff, food could be better too for how much you pay.
