The most consistently excellent restaurant that I have ever experienced. I have always had a lovely meal and dining experience here. They work magic with everything, but their salads are particularly stunning. When out-of-towners ask "What's the best restaurant in New York?", I never hesitate to point them in the direction of Diner.
