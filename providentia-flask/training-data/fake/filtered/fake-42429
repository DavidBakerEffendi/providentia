Authentic Mexican Food! Just had a phenomenal dinner at this hidden gem! The guacamole was fantastic, followed by the enchiladas mole poblano. The sauce from the enchiladas was really smooth and tasty with premium chicken quality. For desert: the Tres leches is a MUST!! Our waiter manage the hard task of being extremely attentive, friendly and efficient without intruding on our space! Definitely going back!
