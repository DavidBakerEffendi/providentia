I love this restaurant!  The Calamar Pavillion is awesome with the spicy peppers!  All their apps are great!  My fav dish is the Shrimp Provencial.  Service is good, they don't rush you out of there.  Staff is attentive.  Warm decor and their food is about quality not quantity.  Who needs 10 lbs of garlic shrimp if it's not good. I often get take out and it's great too! They have a party room too.  Def check it out!
