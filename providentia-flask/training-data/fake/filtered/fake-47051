Pizza is the best in New York.  Consistently excellent, thin crust and delicious.  I highly recommend the honey pie -- ordered it for a hoot and got hooked.   I don't eat pizza much, but it seems this is the only pizza I eat anymore.   You have to try this place and see for yourself. I highly recommend.
