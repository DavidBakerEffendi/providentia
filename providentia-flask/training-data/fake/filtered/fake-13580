Although he isn't strictly gluten-free, my husband avoids wheat and dairy, which makes the typical Italian restaurant challenging, to say the least. Looking for a place for dinner near the Cutting Room, I noticed that Bistango has plentiful gluten-free options, so we made a reservation through Open Table, since the website said reservations are recommended. It's not just an alternate pasta choice -- all the filled pastas like ravioli and tortellini are also GF. We really enjoyed our meal, every dish was delicious, from appetizers through dessert. Service was attentive and the decor is attractive, and although the space is pretty tightly packed, it wasn't noisy. We had grilled artichokes and a side of butternut squash for appetizers, dairy-free, GF ravioli with spicy marinara and tortellini with sweet potato and butternut squash, and sorbets and flourless chocolate cake for dessert. It was all very good.
