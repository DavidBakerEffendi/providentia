I'm new in Philadelphia and one of my first  restaurant experiences was Bridgid's. I'm still IN SHOCK! The place: Horrible and dirty. The barman: He was nice, actually! The clients: Were very, very weird & very intoxicated (it was a weekday) The Food: Disgusting, I order a veggie lasagna and it tasted like it had been sitting in the freezer for at least a year.  My husband's dish was the daily special but was still frozen and burned. The price: So expensive, I could not believed it! My surprise was finding Bridgid's well reviewed in Zagat's!  They recommended it for a first date... If a guy took me there on a first date... I would run and never look back!
