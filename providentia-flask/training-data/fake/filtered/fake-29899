I've been here about a half dozen times and really liked it at first, but now I'm down on it. The same thing happened to me there twice. The first time my girl and I went and everything was going fine until the entrees came. The waitress (not ours, but one we hadn't seen) showed up and plopped the plate in front of me, and turned and went away without saying anything. OK, so her plate's coming right up, right? Nope. We sit and sit and not plate for her. It takes a while for me to get her attention and when I ask her she says it'll be soon. "Do you want me to keep yours warm?" Duh yea! Just last week it happens again. This time there are 5 of us. Two plates come out. OK so far. She goes back and comes back with one more. Two plates still are here. "They're coming out one at a time." I say. "The gnocci"s going to take a few minutes." She says. So I have to say how about you keep these warm until they all come out. So she takes back two of the plates, but never comes back for the third. So We're sitting there waiting. On person has his food...getting cold and she's no where to be seen. Finally all four come out. That's just not right. Any plates ready before the others should be kept warm in the kitchen and they should all be served at the same time. They teach that in Restarurant Management 101. The food there is good. My girl likes the bologense. It's the best around. I like the polenta with mushroom appetizer. It's going to be awhile before we go back.
