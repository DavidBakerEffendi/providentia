I have always been a fan of local sourcing and I have been a fan of White Dog even longer, so I was prepared for a good meal at White Dog. I was recently a guest at a friend's post opening dinner and I was taken both by the bar service, the wait service and the food. The bartender was exceptionally gracious and capable -- four complicated bar requests -- and the dinner service in the private dining room - was both gracious and competent.   The principal server could not have been more gracious, well informed, or efficient. The specials were presented thoughtfully and were sold well.  The product, a catfish with just a little chorizo, which more than 60% of us ordered was delicious -- fresh, exceptionally well prepared and presented. The dessert I ordered, a meyer lemon cheesecake with a blood orange gelee, was delicious but not quite as memorable. I will be back.
