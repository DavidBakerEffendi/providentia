Hands down the best ramen I've eaten since I've been in Sapporo, Japan. It's really incredible. It's run by Japanese people who clearly know their way around noodles. The pork is deliciously savory charred tenderly with a blow-torch. The vegetables are crisp and fresh and the noodles were the perfect firmness. I had the miso-ramen and the broth was incredibly juicy and flavorful. I would definitely come here again. The only reason it's not 5 stars is because it was midsummer when I went and the restaurant is TINY (there was a huge line out the door) and we were seated at the counter. There is no air conditioning so it was hot outside and about the same inside. Also there was a rather large cockroach scurrying around the walls. I wasn't terribly off-put because I know it's NYC and the staff did a great job trying to capture it.
