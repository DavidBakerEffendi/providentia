Great place for breakfast, lunch, or dinner (or brunch)! Best thing here has to be the chicken plate - huge portion of chicken plus two servings of vegetables can hold you over for two meals (my boyfriend does this at least once or twice a week). And it's cheap too. Underrated is the quality of their milkshakes. I had a $5 "free-drink" voucher from grubhub so I figured I would try it out...better than Ben and Jerry's only a couple of doors down. This is all not to mention the fact that they serve your food to you and clean up after you. Super fast, full service!
