Still not as good as Pepe's in New Haven, but very good for Hartford. Pricey though. Be prepared to pay through the nose. Pizza is filling too. Never had room for dessert here but I hear that the apple pie pizza is something else. Service is warm and friendly. Lots of good beer to choose from. Wine is a little stale, though.
