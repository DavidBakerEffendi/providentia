I've been going to Tortuga's for a couple of years only because its one of the only decent "mexican" restaurants in the area. The food and service can be extremely hit or miss. The enchiladas are pretty decent, the guacamole is simple but expensive, the burritos are way too americanized to bother with and some of the other platters can be pretty good. The last time I went i had ordered the carne asada which was cooked fine, the beans on the side were pretty good same with the tortillas. On the other hand my girlfriend ordered the Chipotle Shrimp (normally are good), but tonight were undercooked with almost raw vegetables on the side. The restaurant is way too pricey for the average faux mexican food it serves and the wait staff seem to be uninterested.
