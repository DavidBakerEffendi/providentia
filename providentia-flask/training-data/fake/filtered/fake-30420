Kitchen table uses local sustainable Â ingredients. we very much enjoyed everything. I had the skirt steak- marinated and delicious. My daughter had the chicken - juicy, tender and well seasoned. Atmosphere was quaint and chic- my daughter loved the sound track- Nice music. Wine list could use a little improvement- but is not void of anything in particular. Planning on coming back for her 16th birthday party
