If you enjoy a leisurely dining experience with a great wait staff and superb food, then Verjus is the place for you. The owners are friendly and very solicitous. The food was as anticipated...great, and the wine selection was also good. The wait staff was friendly and courteous. There is a private parking lot adjacent to the restaurant. I would most definitely go back.
