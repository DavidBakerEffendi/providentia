My husband and I go here for special occasions. We really love the atmosphere they provide. It is situated on the Grounds for Sculpture, which is basically an outdoor art gallery mixed with exquisite landscaping and situated behind the restaurant. It is quite unique in this respect and the restaurant itself is lovely in its decor as well. The menu is always excellent. Our one qualm is pricing, it's a little expensive. It's hard to stay under $100 for two, however, between the food, atmosphere, and Grounds for Sculpture, it's always worth it.
