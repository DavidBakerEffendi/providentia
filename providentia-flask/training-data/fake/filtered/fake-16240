Best tiny little hole in the wall place EVER. There's only counter space and an order counter but you can see into the back and see the grills and the delicious smells waft through there and fill the place up. When I brought my mom here we got a bunch of dumplings and a few sesame pancakes and took a walk to a small little park/playground down the street. We had a perfect and filling lunch on a perfect day. It's super inexpensive and delicious!! There wasn't a long line when we went either. It's soo worth it. Definitely head down and try it.
