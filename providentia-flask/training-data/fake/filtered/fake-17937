The food is the best I've ever eaten.   The appetizers, entrees and desserts were out of this world ..delicious, plentiful and served at the right temperature.   The moules and pommes frittes were outrageously good and the pot au feu was spectacular.  Save room for desserts because they are all breathtakingly delicious.
