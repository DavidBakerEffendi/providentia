Yes more fake mexican food. Guess they think no one on the whole westside of manhattan had ever been to Mexico. Well Mexican food is not burritos and crap covered with cheese like Fridays. Real Mexican Food is Hermanos on Starr street in Brooklyn where they make blue corn tortillas, where you eat pork in a nice soft tortillas and have it with a Mexican beer! The food in Mexico is so varied depending on the area Veracruzan food is seafood and Real Mole is a wonderful chocholate sauce covering chicken............... Why cant any of these place serve Mexican food? I dont want Tex Mex. Mexican food is much better. I dont want to join the herd and eat the crap at Chipolte and Burrito Box. I guess we have lots of clueless new yorkers. Â maybe they should take their head out of their ..........es and learn what real food tastes like!
