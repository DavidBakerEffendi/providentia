Me and my friend went to bar pizza on a Saturday. We went because of the lively dance scene in back. While my friend was in the bathroom, I leaned against a counter. When he exited the bathroom; we started for the back of the place for the dance floor. A manager stopped us with one person in front of us and one person behind us. Looked like bouncers t me. They said that I had been served in another establishment and wasn't welcome there. I found this behavior from management completely out of the blue and unprofessional.
