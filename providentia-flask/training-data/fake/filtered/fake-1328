I had the capri sadwich.  Mozzarella, tomato, and basil.  For a little over $9 including tax, it wasn't worth it. In Philly, you can get a lot of great sandwiches for $9, and this wasn't one of them. The portion was small. three slices of tomato, three slices of mozz, and three basil leaves.  At the height of the basil and tomato season, this is unacceptable.  And, everything was too cold.  This sandwich is a room temperature sandwich, not a cold sandwich.  Finally, the roast pepper spread overwhelmed the tomato, basil, and mozzarella. Very disappointed.   I saw folks getting a meat based sandwiches, piled high with meat and, as a vegetarian, I can't justify paying the same price for a sandwich, if I am getting half of the food. Oh well, I will not return.
