We have ordered from here over 20 times. In the very beginning it was good. Then they started getting our order wrong, everytime.  So as my family ate there dinner i had to wait for mine to come back. Not 20mins but over an hour later, and i only live 2 miles away. The last two times the food wasnt even warm.   If your picking up, go to Ernies down the road. Pizza is amazing.
