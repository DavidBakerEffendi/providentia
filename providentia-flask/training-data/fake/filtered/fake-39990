This is our favorite Mexican place!!! It's become our go to spot. We love Mexican and felt a void after many restaurants in Montclair had closed. We go at least twice a month and have turned our friends onto it too. The food is excellent! Everything we have gotten is great. We have brought large parties as well and everyone was happy. The salsa and guac is a MUST! My boyfriend loves The Maria (gets it every time). I love the skirt steak and burrito. It's BYOB which always helps. They will make you pitchers of margaritas (if you bring the booze). I read other reviews about the staff but we've never had that problem. They are always friendly and accommodating.
