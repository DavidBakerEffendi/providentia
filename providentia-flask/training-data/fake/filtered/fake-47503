I've been here many times in the past. Honestly nothing great about it except the brick oven and location. There are several more copy cats on the same block. Four of us ordered two large pies. One plain and one with jalape√±o. Each were $18 and the came to be $47. Why taxes 20% and tip 25%. I was upset about that even though I gave $50. There is a spot in midtown called Bella located on 58 street between 7th and 8th Ave. better pizza, service and you won't get jacked.
