The food was mediocre at best and the price did not reflect its quality. Saigon Shack is a very small restaurant so seating is greatly limited. It also implies that you will have a long wait until you will be seated and you will be rushed out as soon as possible. The waitresses came by, attempting to snatch our plates before we were even half finished with our meals several times just within the first 10 minutes after being served (they also forgot one of the beverages Â we ordered). After being harassed with "are you finished yet?" questions with their hands literally attached to our unfinished plates, we just gave up and let them snatch away our food. In the rush they were in to kick out their customers for the next to enter, liquid was spilled onto the shirt of our friend. The waitress ignored it and pretended like it never happened. Service was terrible, food was mediocre, and the price was relatively expensive for the quality. If you're looking for true Vietnamese food of great quality, this is not the place.
