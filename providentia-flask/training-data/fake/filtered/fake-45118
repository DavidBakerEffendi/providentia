Delicious (I mean DELICIOUS )food and quality ingredients, but the prices are a bit too steep. All of their pizzas are fantastic; try the square Margarita Pizza. At least 3 pies of it go through my household of 6 per week. Unfortunately a $18-25 pies every week are making us all feel more like poor college students than the the young professionals that we are. Â Staff of this place is friendly and the owner is often there. It shows that they take pride in this business!
