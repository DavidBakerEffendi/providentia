What would I do without East Front Cafe?  I've been going there twice a week since I started working in Trenton a year ago.  Sometimes I know what I want in advance, sometimes I don't; always I end up happy.  Credit good food, good service and great people. Everything's good, so it's hard to recommend particular dishes.  But my favorites are the quesadillas, and the burritos are filling.  The chicken in their salads is always tasty; the strawberry spinich is my favorite.  They make a great breakfast wrap (and they know I like just a little bit of hot sauce).  There's comfortable indoor seating, and a peaceful table outside. Most importantly, if you visit often, and are nice, the staff there will become your friends, maybe even your family.  (Figuratively).   Also, to the reviewer who ordered a scoop of tuna: Really?  You gave one star because you were disappointed with something that wasn't on the menu or otherwise advertised?  Who goes to East Front and orders tuna?  Go to a boring deli for that.  East Front is for interesting, fun food, and interesting, fun people.
