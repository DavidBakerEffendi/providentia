Old Fashioned. $10. Light to the tongue, not to the stomach. Square iceberg cools with grace. Sharp classic. Well did. Additionally, odd male waiters. A comment, did not influence rating. Also, the food was below value expectations, but on par with Wburg expectations. This did in some way influence the complex rating system above.
