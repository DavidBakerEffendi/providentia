This is my third visit to Princeton soup and sandwich. I can now call myself a regular customer! WOW!!!!! I've never wrote a review on yelp before, but after the third time going I've figured it was time to give these guys there "kudos". The first couple times I came the food was awesome! Since I'm a vegetarian I decided to have the humus and avocado, I spoke to one of the employees and they said they make the hummus from scratch! Today I tried the soup combo with gazpacho sandwich and ten vegetable soup and there not kidding when they say ten vegetables. It's hard for me to find vegetarian food around here and it's really awesome to see a place like this actually have vegetarian options that are so delicious!!! The place is tiny and can get a little crazy at lunch, if your lucky enough you might just get a seat..maybe outside or at the counter. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Thank you Princeton soup and sandwich.
