My husband, three year daughter and I celebrated our wedding anniversRy there last night. At first, the waiter tried to seat us in the back. Something I'm used to when you enter a beautiful restaurant with a child. Trusting my daughter to sit attentively, I asked to be moved and they obliged willing. The waiter, Marco was more then polite, attentive and friendly. At one point even began playing with our daughter with her princess dolls! Another waitress, Antoniette, gladly took a picture of us and was happy to show my husband the party room. I had attended two showers there recently and wanted him to see how classy the room was. I ordered Chilean sea bass. It was prepared with diced tomatoes and a lite cream sauce on top of a bed of sauteed spinach with mashed potatoes. It was the best sea bass I'd ever eaten!! It was perfectly cooked, seasoned and presented. The potatoes tasted homemade and the portion was large. The pomegranate martini was tasty and so good I could have had several! My husband had chicken scarpiello....he thought it was one of the tasty dishes he's eaten. That's his favorite dish. He orders it everywhere we go.  Even my daughter approved of the tortellini soup as she never refused a spoonful in between retelling snow white with her figurines.  For dessert we got cappuccinos and a tartufo. Marco added extra whipped for my daughter and gave it to us complimentary for our anniversary!! That was more than nice. Overall it was a great dining experience. Would return as soon as possible.
