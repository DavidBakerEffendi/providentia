My first taste of bliss via the Gumbo Bros came at Mad Sq Eats. I saw their sign and was immediately filled with bliss: Gumbo in the city. A bowl of Nanny's twangs nostalgia of my own MeeMaw creating a pot of deliciousness and brings me back south. Hearty and delicious. They have since moved to Broadway Bites. Check them out before they split again. With autumn finally here, a hearty bowl of warm gumbo is sure to fill any void spaces you may have.
