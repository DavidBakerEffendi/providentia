Oh my, I can not believe all the positive reviews on this place.  Yes, the decor is lovely but there are SO many other city restaurants with better food.  We had a salad, spicy potatoes, waygu beef, chorizio, shrimp flatbread.  The only thing that was good was the salad & the free tuna appetizer (although salty).  Everything else was SO salty, even for a restaurant & just didn't taste fresh & good.  The waitress saw that we didn't eat the chorizio & took it off our bill.  When we told her why we didn't eat it, she didn't say anything in it's defense, just looked like she understood.  Who knows, maybe we hit a bad night, but with all the great food in the city, we won't be back!
