Decided to try this restaurant during Restaurant Week. I thought it would be a perfect time to try their menu ata great price. Unfortunately, the service was so slow, that we never received our food. We waited almost an hour for the appetizer - it never appeared. With lunch time ticking away, we asked for our food to go. We waited another 10 minutes, we never received our food to go. We asked to speak to the manager-waited another 10 minutes, she never came to speak with us. Sadly, we left the restaurant hungy and very disappointed!
