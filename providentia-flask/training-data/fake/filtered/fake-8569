The reason I'm giving Chuko only three stars has nothing to do with the food. The menu, while small, is delicious. I live in the area and have been 4 times in the few months it is open. They have a veggie option too, which is awesome. ANYWAY-the reason it only gets three stars is because one waiter there is a HUGE JERK. I went in with some friends last night, and he called my friend ignorant because he asked a joking question about the menu. Interestingly enough, my roommate ate there today and he was equally rude to her and her friend. That said, if you go (and you still probably should) sit at the bar. The two girls that work the bar are super chill. Just avoid the dude with the glasses and the dreads.
