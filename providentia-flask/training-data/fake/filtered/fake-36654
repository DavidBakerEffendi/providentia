Worst service ever ... we asked to return a order of onion rings because they didn't taste good ...The waitress was rude and condescending ... When we called the manager his attitude was even worst, Â he told us that himself and two other employees tasted them and they taste fine ... I never ate in a restaurant with such rude staff.
