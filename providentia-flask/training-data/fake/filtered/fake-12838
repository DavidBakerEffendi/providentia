Found about them today, saw great pics on IG and was convinced! Sent my boyfriend to pick us up a few things since he works in the area (he was less than convinced to say the least... Lol! it is a truck after all)..... He had a little trouble finding it because he went down Chestnut instead of Market but said the guy on the truck was really cool and said they could also make any dish over rice as opposed to a taco. He calls me 5 mins after getting our food (2 fish burritos and one veggie burger) and says please get online right now and write a review saying this is the best fish taco I have ever had in my life... He meant burrito but was obviously have a foodgasm.... Now I am praying mine makes it back and looking forward to writing another glowing review when I have had a chance to taste... PS. I was shocked by his enthusiasm because he is not easy to please when it comes to trying new places!! This was a total success!!
