First time here and its not crowded like many have said. Lucky me. We were also lucky to be seated when our whole party wasn't together. What I don't like is that they give you a dirty look if you don't have your whole party with you and they won't let you order unless the whole party is at the table. Looking at the other reviews I'm not expecting much of their food but I'm all about good service at a restaurant and making your customers feel welcomed, not neglected and stupid for not knowing you had to have your whole party with you at all times.
