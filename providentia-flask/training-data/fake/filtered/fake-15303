We love this place! We have been returning often since each dish we've tried so far has been amazing. The interior is cozy and designed with taste. This is also true for the beautiful presentation of the dishes. Oh so neat and tasty and for so little money. We just went to Pinto for lunch and couldn't believe the lunch menu is only $8!!! In this little restaurant with very nice people you get so much more than what you pay for!
