I love Sushi Yasuda. As everyone will tell you, the sushi is the absolute best in New York. And up until yesterday it would have kept the five stars it had in my heart were it not for their arrogance and sloppiness. First, the arrogance. Sushi Yasuda has always been a bit *particular* about reservations, ordering, time alloted to eat, etc. I was happy to play along because it was a bit like the "Soup Nazi" from Seinfeld and the food was worth it. But when I arrived yesterday they changed my reservation from the bar to a table and insisted that I had told them to do so (I didn't). After trying to discuss it with them, they basically said you can take the table or leave. If i didn't already know how good the food was, I probably would have left, but I took the table. Although it was their fault, they refused to admit their mistake and absolutely refused to offer any kind of accommodation. Sushi Yasuda is good and they know it, but it's made them so arrogant that they do not care how their customers are treated. Second, the sloppiness. The rice is still worthy of the Yasuda name, but the rolls I ordered were not prepared properly: misshapen and falling apart. This would not have been acceptable if Yasuda-san were still in charge and combined with my complaint above it seems obvious that the restaurant has lost its touch. I hope they get back to the level of quality and precision (both in taking reservations and preparing the food) that made the place exceptional when Yasuda-san was still behind the bar.
