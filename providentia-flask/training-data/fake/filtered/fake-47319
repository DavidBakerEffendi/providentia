Ordered from this place today for delivery.  Everything looked great until we sat down. We ordered two pizzas one a regular pizza (with a special request) and a pan pizza.  Both looked amazing until my mom bit into the pan pizza and realized the pan pizza was seriously burnt at the bottom - inedible.  We decided to call the place back and let them know that the pizza was burnt.  My father made the phone call and told them the pizza was burned. The guy that answered the phone started fighting with him that the pizza is supposed to be like that because there is oil at bottom.  HELLO??  Its burnt not crispy - he tried to pass it off as one in the same.  I took the phone from my father because I could hear the guy yelling at my dad.  When  I grabbed the phone - I was in shock - the guy on the phone was screaming ... There was no reasoning with the maniac on the other line.  After going back and forth there was no resolve- big surprise- there is no resolve with crazy!!  There are many great pizza places in South Brunswick - go there.    Read the reviews - this guy here was unhinged and needs classes in customer service and anger management.
