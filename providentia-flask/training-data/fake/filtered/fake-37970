This is my first posting on Yelp.  Had such a fun time here the other night, wanted to share it here on Yelp.  If you're looking for a fun, sophisticated night out, go to Cask Republic.  The rich wood paneling and high-end beer cooler make it a warm and inviting place.  The bar is huge, with the same rich wood around it, and the beer selection can't be beat.  My friends and I tried a variety of beers from around the world and there was more than something for everyone.  We stayed to eat and the food was great and the service was perfect.  There is something about the ambiance of this place - it just kinda makes you want to come in and stay - which we did, all night.
