My mum and I came through Newark Airport on our way overseas. She stopped by here to look at the menu. She saw they had veggie wraps and was excited to stop there when we came back through Newark on our way back. The customer service was nonexistent.  The staff were rude and could care less if we were there. We asked one employee if she could cut the wrap because we were taking it on the plane. She proceeded to say that wasn't her job.  The attitudes were terrible and neither of us would recommend this place.
