So I am really spoiled - for the last 15 years when I wanted chinese takeout I would call Butterfly and walk 5 minutes to pick it up.  Now I call Black Bamboo and walk 4 minutes.....    The food at Black Bamboo is better by far - better flavor, better value.  Generous portions on the lunch and dinner combos as well as the entrees.  I have my few favorites but have ventured from my comfort zone and tried some new items as well after reading the reviews in local papers.  I was not dissapointed.... In the early months the timing on pick up orders was down right maddening.  I experienced it and watched others suffer through it.   There were kinks to be worked out and the owner Sonny did a nice job addressing them.  I think part of issue was the cheapo West Hartford people taking atvantage of low $10 minimum for free delivery mixed with large volume call in orders for pick up.  If it were me the minimum would have been $25+ for free delivery.   There are 12 or so stools/tables  and I've eaten there a couple times, but mostly do take out. After 25+ visits I have only had one mediocre meal, and it was just over veggies..... Having this place so close is great, the owner Sonny is a gem and the food rocks!
