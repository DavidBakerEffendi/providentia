There is an awful lot to like about this place. I've eaten here a couple of dozen times, and most of the time they knock it out of the park. It's good wholesome fresh food at diner prices. The challah-bread french toast is the best around, and they have real, pure maple syrup. (You'll pay a little extra, but who else even has it?) The burgers are fresh and far better than any diner you will find -- my friends agree it's the best burger around, and these are guys who seek out the best burgers. And let's not forget about the real slow-cooked grits, or the fresh-squeezed orange juice and great coffee. If you really want to see the general quality, order a side salad and compare it to every other basic salad you've ever had. It's clearly made with love and attention, and all the elements are fresh and tasty and it's filled with baby greens. A salad is a simple thing, yet most places give you a throw-away bowl of stale iceberg. It's this attention to little details that separates this place from the others. They make their own corned beef from scratch in house, and it has beautiful texture and wonderful flavor. One of the owners is an ex-Navy man, and is passionate about serving the best corned beef hash ever. Not too salty, great texture, and delicious with poached eggs, on their Little Devil grilled cheese, or in the Dubliner omelet. Â  I have experienced some spotty service especially on the evenings they are open, and with notable exceptions some the staff has suddenly become less than friendly. I have also seen times, again at night, when the food looked carelessly thrown on the plate. I've never had a problem when Spiro is in the house, but when he's not there things can slip. I'm a very fussy foodie, and I'm giving them 5 stars because I can't give 4.5.
