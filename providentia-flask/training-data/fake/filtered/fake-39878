To all those who say the service is *slow* - perhaps its because you've frequented too many fast food establishments and forgot what it takes to create a home cooked meal!  This place is like "going home".  Grab some appetizers while you wait for "dad" to cook your dinner.  Everything is fresh.  The food is outstanding and if you don't see what you want on the menu - ASK they will make it!  We've had the veal, pasta, seafood, desserts and it's always been the BEST!  The wait staff takes a personal interest in their patrons and treat everyone like they've just come home for a home cooked meal. This place is just a gem!
