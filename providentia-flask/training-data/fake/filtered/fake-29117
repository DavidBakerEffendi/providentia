Check out the great salads and sandwiches for dependably delicious lunches either in or to go. There is an awesome veggie sandwich which changes from time to time, a great curry chicken salad, and the specials are good. I always get a dessert to go, too, since everything is fresh baked. Sometimes it makes it home, and a lot of times it doesn't. Sometimes service can be slow at the lunch rush, but that's just because everything is made fresh. Sometimes there is a lack of seating, but I always take that as a good sign. Who wants to eat at an empty restaurant?
