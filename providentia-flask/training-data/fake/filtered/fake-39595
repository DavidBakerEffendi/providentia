Came with friends Sunday night. Waited 20 minute to be seated. Amazed by the huge menu selection and order tons of food. The papaya salad was refreshing. Enjoyed it. The Chinese watercress was very tasty. So tasty that we placed another order! Surprised by the delicious coconut rice. Overall a very good experience. Will definitely go back again!
