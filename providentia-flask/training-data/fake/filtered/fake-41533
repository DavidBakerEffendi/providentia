I went to Amelie on a total whim and craving for delicious wine.  I had just come back from Paris so anything remotely close to that experience was exactly what i was looking for.  I certainly found it here!  The wine list is impressive, they have delicious snacks to eat, and the staff is charming and oh so... French!  The decor is fun and inviting and the atmosphere was very lively.  If you're on a date or looking for a place to catch up with friends, this is the place!
