I must say Hoagie Haven was severely disappointing. I know it is a princeton landmark, but this place cannot seriously call itself a sandwich shop. First off, they don't slice any of the meat fresh. It's all sitting there like cold cuts from the supermarket. The chicken salad had more celery in it then chicken. Their cheese selection consisted of american, provolone, cheddar....seriously? For toppings don't expect much beyond lettuce, tomato, onions. No hot peppers, no sweet peppers, etc... I didn't try the hot food so I cannot comment on that. The only thing this place has going for them is a cool t-shirt and very good prices.
