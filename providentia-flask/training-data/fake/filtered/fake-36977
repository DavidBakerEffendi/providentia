Like pizza? This tour will make you love it. Scott is the most energetic tour guide I have ever met. Note: I didn't specify pizza tour guide; Scot is the best anywhere. His enthusiasm for pizza is infectious, and before you know it, you will be comparing cheese-to-sauce ratios and crust thickness with strangers from around the world. He really knows his stuff, but doesn't overwhelm you with information (unless you want it.) And the pizza, of course, is delicious. HIGHLY recommend.
