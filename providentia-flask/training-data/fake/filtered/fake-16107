I have been eating at Cafeteria for more than a decade. I live in the neighborhood and frequently have dinner there with my wife and child. Not anymore. Upon my last visit, i was told they would not let us sit at a table for 3 outdoors during prime dinner time because my child wasn't a person.  Bear in mind this was a sunday night, on labor day weekend, when all NY restaurants have plenty of tables. I was then told by the manager we could sit inside near the kitchen but  they don't have booster or child seats "because we're not exactly a family friendly restaurant" So be it Cafeteria. you've just lost me and my family as a customer.
