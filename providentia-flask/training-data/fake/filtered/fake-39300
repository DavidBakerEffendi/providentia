Wow! Wow! Wow! is what comes out of my mouth every time I eat here. Jessie, the chef and owner is not only cute, sweet, friendly and cool, he's got a gift for making tacos so tasty. I don't know what he puts in those sauces but they are incredible! Everything I've ever eaten there has blown me away. I'm constantly searching for the best fish taco, and his wins by far. My only complaint is that he doesn't have a "real" restaurant where you can sit and eat for hours. Hopefully soon!
