This place is one of my favorites, not just because of the great food and constantly different beers they have, but because of the staff. I'll be honest I'm totally smitten with one of the servers/bartenders that I have seen here. He waited on me again last night, and seems to be one of the sweetest men I have ever met.  I'm not sure what his name is, but he has a cute beard and is almost always wearing some kind of phillies hat.  Up untill recently he has always had some witty homemade phillies shirt as well but he has recently retired them for a little bit more of a preppier look with these great thick rimmed glasses,, especially when he is hanging around there but not working.  What a serious cutie pie, I wish I had the guts to ask him what his deal is. Although I know  susposed to talk about the bar here, I just think that he needs a little credit for doing an excellent job. On numerous occasions he has paitently knelt next to my table while explaining each and every one of their beers on tap to my friends, who aren't much for crazy beers. He has always gotten everyone great beers, and now that he knows me, will just recommend beers that he thinks I will like.  I want to steal him and take him home and hide him from the rest of the world! Ill be honest, I'm a little sad when I go in and don't get him as my server. Everyone there is nice, it's just not the same. It is really refreshing to see someone who seems to LOVE the place that they work at, and seems to be having fun with his co workers and his customers. Seriously try this place you won't be dissapointed!
