I have to admit that I was VERY disappointed.  I live in the area so I have went to DelRossi's before and the pizza was terrible.  The sauce was disgusting and the cheese was gross...the pizza tasted like cardboard.  I am not crazy about Plaza Pizza which is next door but after having Delrossi's I have learned to appreciate a half decent pizza.  I went to Chuck e Cheese recently with my kids and that pizza was even better than Delrossi's.   I figured I would go in and give them a second chance by trying their cheese steaks.  I had to try it out because they bragged about how it's the best in the city...best in the city...I don't think so...It has to be the worst steak I have ever had.  It's like buying a cheese steak in California.  Like some of the reviews the meat was chewy.  The roll was stale and the meat was full of fat.  The meat tasted like dog food.  I am not sure why they think their steaks are the best in the city...it's comical. One more note...the one owner was very rude who didn't appreciate when I mentioned that the roll was stale.  Doesn't he know that the customer is always right?   The owner is a fraud who states he is Italian and his last name is Delrossi which is totally a lie.  I found out that his last name is Frank and he is not italian, greek or even close...you figure it out.  He also went on Mystery Diner and lied.  Everything on the show was staged just to get free advertising.   I heard alot of shady stuff about this guy including his business so I would not recommend it as the food is gross and its a waste of money.  I can get a better meal at a dog cart.   MG
