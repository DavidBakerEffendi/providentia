I would have given Dragonfly a 2 star review, but Ive only been there once to be fair. The restaurant looks nice (interior and exterior) and even have a nice little 'outside' area where you can have a lush view of... Route 1&9, Applebees, or the parking lot... Yeah...better off staying inside. The menu didn't impress me too much at all. The selections seemed pretty bare and a touch overpriced. However, the food itself was pretty good and did not disappoint as much. I hope to go back and prove myself wrong, but as of right now, Im not exactly scrambling to get there anytime soon.
