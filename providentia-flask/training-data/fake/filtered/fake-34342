Enjoyed a birthday dinner with a party of 6. Waitstaff was polite but made a few minor mistakes. (Brought appetizers to wrong places at table, forgot or misplaced dessert order and had to come back about 10 min later to retake it.)  Portions were OK but nothing to write home about. All the food was excellent.  Views of NYC skyline are excellent as well.
