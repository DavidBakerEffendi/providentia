I am Portuguese born and raised but live in Dallas,TX. My family and I had to travel to New Jersey to renew our Portuguese pasports and ended up most of our trip walking around Ferry st, and eating in the different coffee shops and restaurants. So far Seabra Marisqueira was the best! It was the first restaurant we ate in and came back each night for dinner of our trip. First night we ate at the bar, talked to the locals and the servers. Other nights we sat at a table in the front room where the bar was but that's because we don't mind the noise and like to talk to our Portuguese table neighbors. The servers are seriously great, they are the typical Portuguese servers, talk a bit to each tables, really take care of the customers and I feel that by the end of our trip our servers knew me as if I had been going there for years. My dad wanted to eat sardines which wasn't offered in the menu, after asking our server he managed to get a nice plate of sardines for my dad! Before ordering, know that these plates are massively huge! My mother and I shared a plate each night and there was always left over. Carne de Porco a Alentejana was definitely one of my favorites, as well as the bitoque! Parking is really great across the street, they give you a slip of paper and you have it signed by your server and the park becomes free which is amazing around those parts, so it is definitely a plus! The prices of the food and drinks keeping in mind how big the plates are, are extremely well priced! Â I will be back to Seabras Marisqueira and I will recomend it to any one! All in all, GREAT FOOD, GREAT GREAT SERVERS, GREAT ATMOSPHERE, GREAT TIME! Loved our experience at Seabras Marisqueira!
