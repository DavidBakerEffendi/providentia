Greek Taverna is an exceptional restaurant, we love it there. The food is outstanding. My wife had the lamb chops, they were terrific. I tried an appetizer, Katsikisio, baked cheese with apricots and almonds, very rich and wonderful. Almost a dessert. Portions are huge. The Horiatiki salad are big enough for four. Service was very friendly and helpful. The server seemed sincere. The restaurant is roomy. And they have a parking adjacent to the restaurant. We know that Montclair offers many choices for good dining but it would be hard to beat what the Taverna has to offer. Definitely a great choice for your next visit.
