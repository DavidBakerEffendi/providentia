I needed a local place to meet a friend, & my daughter recommended Positivitea.  I went in & had a delicious Vanilla tea & relaxed at a table near the windows.  My friend and I had vegan truffles that were delicious (mango!).  We talked with the owner who gave us a dessert to try (key lime tart --yummy!) and he even gave my friend a sandwich for her kids to try.  Apparently ant the end/beginning of the month, they use customers to taste-test/review potential menu offerings for the next month's menu.  How cool is that? I am not a raw vegan ( I really was there for the tea & sympathy), but it's great food that's great for you.  The decor reminds me of the artsy places that I used to find in the 1970's (check out the ceiling tiles!).  The juice smoothies are recommended, and, of course, the tea!
