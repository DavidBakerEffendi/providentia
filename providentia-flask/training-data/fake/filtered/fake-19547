BEST BLT EVER! I have not had the opportunity to sample all of the offerings on Angelo's diverse menu, but one of the things I've had many times, and must RAVE about, is his signature BLT. I consider myself a connoisseur of BLTs - having ordered them up and down the east coast in search of one that could top Mom's... Never happened .... until Angelo's. Thick bread - lightly toasted to perfect crispiness on the outside, yet soft and a speck chewy on the inside. Very ample, perfectly done, thick and incredibly tasty bacon - accented with crisp lettuce, delicately sliced vine ripe tomatoes and topped with just the right amount of mayo!. Um Um! Nice service, great atmosphere (fun in the tavern) and reasonably priced. Convenient location, free parking, and a beautiful venue. Oh - and did I mention - GREAT BLTs?
