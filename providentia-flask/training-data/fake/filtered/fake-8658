I have been a customer for Bonnie's grill for a while now, They do have good burgers, the buns are not that great. The owner is very mean , and he treats his customers very bad, so he knows we are repeat customers, we come in and ask for a table, he responds Â meanly, and suggests that we order to go. So we went ahead and did that. My Boyfriend couldn't wait and got mad for this horrible treatment, so we said we will go ahead and cancel the order, the owner responds"THATS GOOD, AND BETTER" imagine an owner of a restaurant business that responds this way, he definitely DOESNT appreciate customers. If you are the owner and you are reading this, you will pay for your HORRIBLE customer service if not now, but down the road. You will lose a customer after another if you keep your customer service this way, specially that you are in the food service business.Always in this business CUSTOMER SERVICE and GOOD FOOD GO HAND IN HAND, ONE WITHOUT THE OTHER WILL LEAD TO FAILURE.
