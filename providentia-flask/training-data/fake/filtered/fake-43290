Everything that I have tried off of their menu has been nothing but top notch! I am not from the area, but do drive well over 45 minutes out of my way to get my Poor Henry's fix. I completely understand the charm and quality of this place that locals have known for years. I love how they have a constantly changing beer and food specials menu. I still dream about the sliced steak sandwich with garlic butter on a brioche bun they had as a special a few months back! All in all, I highly recommend Poor Henry's!!
