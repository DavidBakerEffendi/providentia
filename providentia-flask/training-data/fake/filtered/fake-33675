After finishing our lovely meal, we we're told that we could not order anymore food but continue to order drinks. The waitress stated that she was not allowed to place an order if she knew the order was to go, I asked why and was told that's the rule, she suggested I speak with the manager. The manager came over right away, with an attitude and stated that was the rule and that was it. We discussed this issue with the manager for several minutes. The more questions we asked, the more rude he became, and after addressing his customer service skills he pretty much walked away from us leaving the situation unresolved. Needless to say we will not be back anytime in the foreseeable future.
