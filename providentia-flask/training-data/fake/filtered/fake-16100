cute place! cute food! really cute waiters. not so cute fruit flies. Was about to enjoy Friday happy hour with my "sex and the city girls" when I looked up from my overpriced and syrupy cocktail, to see the walls filled with fruit flies. Had to keep myself from vomiting into said cocktail the rest of my dinner. thanks
