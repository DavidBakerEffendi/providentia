I'm sad. I hoped for better, especially after a few visits this spring.  Attentive staff, good beer (heavy on heavy, especially in cold weather), quirky food then.  It was beginning to make WPhilly look like a real place to eat and drink.  Prices are up there a bit, and this review is based upon an establishment that is charging max dollars and should be expected to be providing very good, if not excellent, service and product. After the last visit, we're done.  They no longer have the truly capable, beer guru bartenders during the day.  I guess she's just a warm body to fill space.  I understand just starting a shift, but when the only folks at the bar have to pointedly ask for another beer, there's a problem.   Their selection of beers is fascinating.  However, unusual product needs explanation.  Since many of the beers available were not on the descriptive menu, and the bartender was (see above), a couple of our selections weren't on target.  At prices up to $56 per gallon, it's expected that the beer comes with good advice, some helpful hints, a little taste to help with choosing, something.  Current reality:  *sound of crickets* I'm not thrilled with the menu change...there's a total lack of inspiration...but I didn't eat.  Maybe their falafel is garbonzo nirvana.  We used to like to eat here ,but the current selections won't bring us back to try it out. So, unless you don't have trolley fare, there's no reason to pay Center City prices to get W Philly treatment.  I hope that they'll pick up the dropped ball soon and straighten this out.  If not, I bet Jack Gillespie would love a Mill Creek North.
