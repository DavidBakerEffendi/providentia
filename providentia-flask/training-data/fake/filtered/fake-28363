Order the Greek Salad... Order the Grilled Octopus.... Order the whole Branzini... If you still don't think this is the best (or one of the best) Greek Seafood restaurants in Astoria, then something is WRONG WITH YOU. Everything is affordably priced, everything is FRESH, everything is delicious, you get way more for your money then any other Greek Taverna in the neighborhood, and it's CONSISTENT. Only downfall....you might have to wait a long time to be seated....So if your starving out of your mind, don't have any patience, or pressed for time and in a hurry...this is NOT the place to go. Too me, if the place is packed and has a long wait because of it, and people are willing to wait over an hour to get a table, it must be good! Also, good business, means good product turnover, which means all the food is FRESH all the time. If you don't want to wait, you can eat at the empty Greek restaurant across the street.....I'm sure its amazing, being that nobody is ever eating there...
