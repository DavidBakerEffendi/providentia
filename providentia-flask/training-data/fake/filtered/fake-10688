Had dinner on a Friday night. Clean place. Wide variety on menu. I appreciated all of the vegetables. Good pricing. Food was pretty good... ("caramelized onions" were only saut√©ed). Service was friendly but not professional. She coughed into her hands while speaking to the table (absolutely not acceptable anywhere in a restaurant, but even worse to do at the table). Despite the cons, I'd like to return.
