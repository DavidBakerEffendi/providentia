i was forced in giving this place one star don't expect it to be around long. imagine if you will, the enormous amount of "power" you give the staff of a resturant, when that staff can say any time, to any one, "we have no manager, no one's in charge" and that very same person, "who's not in charge"  orders and oversees the raw food and sees that it gets cooked within state guidlines and then brought to your table and goes into your mouth - who is that again? the waitress who starded off great, and would not give me her name eather - lets call her sylble, had great energy great everthing - until we were first served the main course followed buy the salad and then followed by the appetizer. all could have been saved, with a how do i make this right attitude. that would have been impressive that would have earned syllable a hefty tip (im not canadian) i don't know what happened to are great waitress but godzilla returned - and might i say won, at least for me, an academy award performance. i then went inside and asked to speak to the chef, they did not have one of those ether. then it dawned on me this is a freaking bar, with ambiance the  of a uhaul rental lot with the manners and ethic's and culinary skill that goes with it. masquerading as a outdoor church street cafe they would not let me take the check (tax people pay attention) the waitress would not give me her name although there were 7 people inside, with kens-tshirts all with there arms folded, no one would admit to being in charge there was no manager. so should you go there? just remember you put it in your mouth. and have a great day oh then i was thinking i had one of my provence town ma. t shirts on.  maybe that was it.
