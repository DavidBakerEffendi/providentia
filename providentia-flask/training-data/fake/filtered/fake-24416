Came here on a first date and sat at the bar.   Nice atmosphere, cool crowd.  Off to a great start.  Ordered cocktails and apps.  Waited patiently but were really getting hungry.  After 45 min we checked in with bartender -- "oh sorry I forgot to put in your order".  Wtf.  His follow up was "well there's nothing I can do."  Wow.  Been in NYC over ten years and never heard anything as dumb as that.  Great way to start/end an evening.  Gato:  needs work.
