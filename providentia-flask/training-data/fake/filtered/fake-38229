I've been to Rooftop twice and I was less than impressed each time. While the bar itself is nice the service was horrible. The waitress Â lost my credit card and when the manager came to look around our table for it- obviously we had already done that- he was clearly drunk and made no attempt to rectify the situation. He wrote my name down and said he would call me the next day but he never even apologized for the lost card and even told me I should wait to cancel the card until the next day. Brilliant idea sir- let someone find the card and use it all night before I shut it off. THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH IT.
