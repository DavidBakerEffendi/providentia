I have lived in the Lawrenceville area for many years and have been a regular customer of Amalfi's for about two years. I have watched this place undergo many changes and for the most part, it's present venue seems to be working pretty well. The food is about average, nothing to rave about. I will admit the Brooklyn pizza is very good. Prices are high though. I have read other reviews about the service and I can only comment about the service at the bar. I have always found the bartenders (past and present) to be very cordial and professional. It is unfortunate that employees seem to come and go at a very rapid pace. Sometimes the food can take a little longer to arrive but the bartenders are always on top of it and aim to please. Judging from what I have personally witnessed this is not an easy place to work. The employees work very hard, and at times it's obvious their efforts are not appreciated. I, myself, have witnessed employees being mistreated by management, and truth be told, it's very unprofessional and very disturbing. The customers who "claim" that they have or had a problem with one of these employees are exactly the ones who get "special" treatment and run back to the owners with their snibbling nasty comments. For the most part I enjoy going to Amalfi's but I would truly like to see a change in management's treatment of their hard-working employees.
