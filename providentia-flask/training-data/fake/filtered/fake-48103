What a disappoinment. Where to begin? Though the restaurant had only one table of five seated, the first table we were offered was right next to waiter station. Finally seated but no waiter, no menus, not even a drink order. After waiting another 10 minutes for the waiter to serve our wine I had to speak directly to manager who then personally attended to us for the rest of lunch. Food was ok but certainly not worth the $100+ tab. At these prices I was expecting smooth, professional service and excellent food. Save your money.
