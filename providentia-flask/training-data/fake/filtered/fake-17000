WORST RESTAURANT ON CHURCH ST.   This place is severely overpriced and the food is just subpar for Church St. I mean how often is one disappointed with a simple slice of pizza? Not often, but you will be EVERY time at Kens. If by some act of god they make a decent slice, its still going to be outrageously expensive.   First off, it comes to $3.05 for one simple slice of CHEESE pizza. The owners are delusional if they think they are making slices of culinary gold, because they most definitely are not - its just regular damn pizza.   Secondly, they have absolutely NO CLUE how to grill up a legitimate philly cheesesteak - never in my long life of eating phillys have I ever been so disappointed - I had to throw mine away after two bites. They bake their sandwich roast beef in the oven instead of grilling up a legit cheese steak...blasphemy if you ask me.   Third, and maybe most important, is that both the employees and the owner are very rude. I've only had one experience at Kens and I promise I will never return. I witnessed the owner's fowl mouth, the staffs general rudeness, and the cooks disregard for overall cleanliness.  Also for some reason they have crammed an absurd amount of tables into their small outside eating area so you cant even comfortably enjoy a meal without feeling like you're sharing it with 10 other people.
