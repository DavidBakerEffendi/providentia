My Husband and I went with another couple with a reservation of 8pm. The place was absolutely packed and seemed extremely loud from first look. We were seated about 35mins later and had brought 4 bottles of wine with us. Ordered apps and got our wine and..surprise! What a delightful mix of great service, great atmosphere and FABULOUS food! I was able to order off menu - yes, I'm high maintenance - We all tasted each others food and savored each bite and while the place was loud, it was full of conversations like ours, full of energy, (the acoustics are just bad) The server was great, he was friendly, knowledgeable and quick. We didn't wait long for anything and had our night end with a lovely meeting with the owner telling us about the decor. Definitely will return!!
