my friends and I are in college and thought this place looked really good on TV...wrong. it was just downright disgusting and we were actually laughing at how ridiculous our experience was. when we were in line for the buffet, we each had to pick up at least 3 "clean" plates to find one that didn't have leftover food on it. The employee brought a pile of new plates and all those were filthy too, along with the silverware! Then came the awful food. The soup was straight up grease, the salad was just lettuce from a bag, and the pizza is tasteless. I had no appetite to even eat after seeing how dirty the place was, I don't even want to know what it's like in the kitchen. we each paid $7.50 total and I know people say Â "you get what you pay for", but we could have gone to Panera Bread and had delicious soup and sandwiches for the same exact price! If you don't want to feel like you're eating in complete trash, DO NOT eat here.
