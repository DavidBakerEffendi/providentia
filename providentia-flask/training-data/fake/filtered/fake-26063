Sunday morning walking around in a dull, fog and saw something called Quiche Italiano for brunch. A good strong cup of joe, a slice of quiche, some Motown tunes, a couple of chocolate-dipped Madeleines and Cafe Lore made Sunday look a lot better. Great service in a familiar, relaxed atmosphere. No rush and a little fuss, but these guys have the fuss down to a science and make you feel at home. Almost took my shoes off during my cappuccino. A really enjoyable experience. The menu is simple but covers some great comfort foods, from french toast for breakfast to eggplant rollotini for lunch to mushroom ravioli for dinner to pineapple cheesecake for dessert. In the middle of Sunset Park, Brooklyn grows a really cool restaurant that is a breathe of fresh air.
