If this was just for the ramen then 4/5 stars but the management here is not good. A group of my friends waited over an hour for a booth. Just as soon as we were getting seated we had an additional person join our party. It was a cold winter night and all we really wanted was a bowl of ramen with good company. The hostess gave us an attitude and said she couldn't honor that request b/c it ruins their ramen flow. We didn't even sit down or ordered and they said it messes up their ramen order. Clearly there was plenty of space at our booth and did I say we didn't even order yet?! I even spoke to the manager b/c it seemed a little unreal and sadly he kept saying these were their rules. He told us we would all have to wait an additional hour in order to get a booth with our new party #. I'm not going to argue with "their rules" but I definitely don't think this place deserves my business since they aren't honoring their customers. Just a thought!
