A pizza place is a pizza place.......until you stop at Alfonso's!  Honestly, I only have the pizza on occasion because their food is SO GOOD & so affordably priced you must treat yourself. It's BYOB too!  Have a seat and Kim (owner) or Martha (fixture of waitress) gets you FRESH, warm bread..... w/ fresh marinara sauce! Yumm! It could be a meal by itself!   A Sandwich, oh you MUST have the grilled chicken, roasted red peppers, arugula and balsamic on fresh, homemade bread.....I always eat half, take half home ....for like $6! Want a full dinner, the chicken parm is outstanding......and you are crazy to get it just for one, split it, or take 1/2 home. I always look at it as 2 meals for $16, where can you get that! I just tried one of their specials, a ravioli combo with crab and shrimp in pink sauce, kind out of my norm, but it was sooo good! Oh, I may be biased, I have been going for years, the restaurant has been updated, well kept, friendly owners and staff, and yes it can be noisy on friday nights, but you cannot find better food and it is BYOB. You can be in and out quick if you want, or you can sit and talk.   Many a meal for the 2 of us is under $20 with quality food! Oh, and the pizza is good too! Reviews are not my thing, but felt I had get one out regarding Alfonso's!
