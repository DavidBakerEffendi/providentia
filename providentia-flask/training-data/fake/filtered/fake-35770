I enjoyed lunch with friends here yesterday.  I ordered the Cuban Sandwich..... because if there's a Cuban on the menu, it must be tasted.  I would rate the sandwich alone 5 out of 5 stars.  Pulled pork was juicy, tender, and delicious.  The fries on the side were also a tasty treat. Everyone was more than satisfied with their meals.  It was also a friends Bday, and he enjoyed some delicious chocolate cake and ice cream!
