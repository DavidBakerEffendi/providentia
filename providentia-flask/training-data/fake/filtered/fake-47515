The pizza was the best I've ever had, but the service was horrible and the staff was not friendly in the slightest bit. They cram your party into a small table so everyone is on top of one another. The wait was very long, and there was even a wait outside to be able to wait in their upstairs room. Overall, the service left much to be desired but the pizza was outstanding.
