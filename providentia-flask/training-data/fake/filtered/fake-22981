This low key ambiance is the place you want to go to to unwind after work during the week but is lots of fun on the weekends too! Keith bartends on Mondays and makes AMAZING lychee martinis! He remembers you by name and the hostess Natasha is a sweetheart too! Definitely a must if you're in the LES area!
