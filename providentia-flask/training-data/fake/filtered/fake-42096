And old Italian boyfriend introduced me to this place; Â he knew the owner and we would go there with all his friends. That's probably why I will always be good friends with that ex- he put Luzzo's in my life! Yes sounds simple but aren't the most pleasurable things always that way?? The thin crust pizza with the best toppings is to die for and always provides comfort.
