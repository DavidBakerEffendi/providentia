We went to Portofinos' on a Saturday night last minute essentially because the other heavy hitter Italian restaurants nearby were booked. We expected a compromise experience and compromise meal and were actually very delighted at the quality of the food. We consider ourselves fairly experienced Italian diners and were pleasantly surprised by the Mussels appetizer, ceasar salad, fettucini in with claim in a red crab sauce and the veal marsala. These all had super sauces to dip the crusty bread into. Portions are fairly good size, certainly not smallish. The atmosphere is very classy although just a bit sterile, it could use an infusion of color and they could possibly lower the lighting to advance the romantic mood a bit more. When a table of six on our right and a table of eight on our left came along to dine next to us, the sound level went far too high and we felt a bit overwhelmed. Strange to see parents lugging their young teenagers into a fine dining place on a Saturday night without proper attire (sweats and T-shirts!) coming maybe straight from the tennis club (they were carrying a huge tennis bag which was parked next to our table). We would definitely like to get back to Portofino again and try some other menu items as I'm sure they do other Italian dishes very well there.
