Given the big reviews an rep of this place i was really disapointed, with the sushi. I found the fish a big soft/warm in texture and the rice a bit "grainy" if that makes sense. One the other hand, the flash fried eel is amazing, the grilled cod was nice as was the softshell crab. The services was excellent.
