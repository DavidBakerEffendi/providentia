The food is good but it's very expensive for what you're getting. We came in an hour before closing and it was very clear that our options were limited because the staff made us aware as soon as we walked in the door. We felt a little bit like we were inconveniencing people. The staff was friendly enough but really didn't give us much attention. The other day we were also there for the first time and the experience was very different much nicer much faster and very very busy we will try again.
