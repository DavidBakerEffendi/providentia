We keep going back to Bamboo for the consistently excellent food. More and more local people have caught on to this little gem. It is very busy on weekends. It seems like we always meet other "regulars" there that say the same thing: we just keep coming back for more. Â  We have friends that visit from our of town, and they often ask to go back when visiting. The owner is hands on, and always there to make sure everything is good. It's smaller than Pistachio's next door, but always seems to be busier. Valuable tip: The lunch specials are as good as the dinners, and very reasonably priced. Lunch is not as busy either. It's more of a family style atmosphere than high end, but the food is always well done. They have Sushi, Chinese, and Thai dishes, all with an "Asian American Fusion" style. Ray A. must of had a bad night, because we always find the host, (Owner), to be welcoming and personable.
