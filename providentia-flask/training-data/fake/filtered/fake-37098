EXTREMELY DISSAPOINTED in the service at The Stone Terrace. I had an event there and would not recommend it. I had guests saying that the bartenders and event coordinator were rude to them and short with them. The entire staff acts like they are doing you a favor by performing the services you paid for. Our event seemed rushed and many details were over looked. They started our event too early so that when it was time for cocktails and appetizers, they refused to open the bar early. Â We ended up having to pay $700 for an extra half hour of the bar being open, it was ridiculous. They also charge $75 per hour for their upstairs suite if you are using it for an event, which I did. they got there 30 mins late and acted like I was a crazy because I was upset. Needless to say they did not refund me the money I paid for those 30 mins of standing outside. An event there is not cheap, at least $120 pp. I feel like I way overpaid for the type of service I received, and when my event was over they rudely told everyone to "get out". A very unsatisfied customer.
