Catered Affair is the go-to spot in Hillsborough for anything from breakfast to sandwiches, to paninis to homemade soups and more.  They have an extensive menu, generous portions, delicious, fresh food, and a friendly staff.  They also offer a great "healthy" menu.  (This place is not just "subs") My favorite, by far, is the Fitness Club -  it's a healthy version of a club sandwich with avocado and turkey bacon. YUM! And my kids, of course, love the Letter "R" whenever they're in town. I've also had Catered Affair do barbecues for me - they did my daughter's high school graduation party, and they just catered an 80th birthday party for my parents.  They do an incredible job from set up, to service, to clean up.  Our guests raved about the food! We couldn't have asked for an easier experience.  Karen is a pleasure to work with; she listened to everything that we wanted, and gave us great suggestions.  For my parents' party, we chose to have a server;  it was the best decision we made.  Julie was terrific;  she arrived early, set up, continually walked around to make sure everything was running smoothly, and she left the house and yard spotless.  Unfortunately, it rained the day of the party, but Pete took care of everything - he brought extra pop-up tents so that our guests could walk from the seating tent to the food tent without getting wet.  The food was phenomenal (I highly recommend the cheese pierogies wrapped with bacon and jalapeno pepper for an appetizer!)  Mike and Sue did a great job at the grill;  our guests were served hot, delicious food right off the grill. We also had an ice cream sundae bar which was the hit of the party.  Catered brought everything from the freezer, to the ice cream, to an array of toppings.  I'll definitely be using them for my next party.  I highly recommend them:  they make having a party enjoyable for the hostess!
