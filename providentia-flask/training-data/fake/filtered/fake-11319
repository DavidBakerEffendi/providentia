My sister and I took a cooking class at Eataly's La Scuola and it was really great.  The food was excellent and we enjoyed ourselves immensely!  We went back the next day to Eataly for lunch and had the most delicious relaxing lunch at Manzo because trying to get into the other eateries took way too long and the open areas are too crowded to relax.  We were glad we went into Manzo though because the service and food and wine were just wonderful!  I had the most delicious Angnolotti (sic) and my sister had a scallop pasta even though Manzo is more meat based.  We would go back in a heartbeat!!  Loved it!
