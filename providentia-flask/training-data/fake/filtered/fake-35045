Lunitas is a great family-owned cafe around the corner from my apartment. Diego, the owner and barista, is always up for a quick Spanish lesson while ordering, They have AMAZING empanadas and the atmosphere is really agreeable. It is much more laid back and relaxing than the cafe across the street. It is Â very family-oriented and has sing-a-longs for kids, which is pretty cute.
