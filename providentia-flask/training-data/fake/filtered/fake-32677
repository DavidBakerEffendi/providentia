The food was pretty good! The only horrible thing was the waiter. He was too obnoxious and when I finished my food, he came by and literally yelled: "WHOA you look like you attacked that plate like a tiger to his prey" I was so embarrassed that I am never going there again, not because of the bad food, but because of my horrible experience there.
