AWFUL.  Let me start by saying the food is bland, the service is slow with an attitude, the beer selection is boring and small, and our glasses were dirty.  (Can I get my water WITHOUT hair in it? Thanks...)   However, what really pushed it over the top for a 1 star review (because no stars is not a yelp option) was that the day I went I was "served" by the owner of Birra (and now Barra) Gordon who, after talking to him, admittedly doesn't know a thing about beer (...so why open a bar called Birra?).  Know that if you go here, your dining experience may very well be ruined when the bar owner, Gordon, takes it upon himself to serve you drinks.   Usually, bar owners try NOT to get visibly drunk at their own bars and then crudely hit on their female customers (in front of their husbands/boyfriends, no less) under the guise of serving food.  Usually, but that's par for the course for Gordon at Birra.   The group I was with might have actually been upset enough to do something about it at the time, if the owner (Gordon) wasn't so pathetically laughable with his attempts.  So, we just laughed about it for the rest of the night.   People should know what they are subjecting themselves (or their girlfriends/partners/wives) to, as well as supporting, if going here!
