Is it wrong to have a well done burger and taste good? I dont think so. Anyway I came here friday and was not impressed with what i got except for the chocolate shake it was delicious! For the $13.00 I paid for this order the burger had no flavor and the fries if that is what  you want to call them that were ok.  I just the shake from there and just stick with either 5 guys or Sketch for my burgers.
