My wife and I both eat very healthy, and are very good cooks.  Most times that causes a problem with going out to eat; our food is usually much better than the restaurant's food.     When we eat at Gabrielle's Restaurant, we have ALWAYS been more than satisfied with our meals.  The chef never has a problem making our meals the way we like them; some restaurants frown on "special orders".  The servers are all very attentive, and friendly. If you like Italian food, Gabrielles is better than the "Wooster Street" restaurants, and they also make a great pizza.  Let's not forget the large portions!!!!  Gabrielles is our favorite restaurant Chuck Heifetz Orange, CT
