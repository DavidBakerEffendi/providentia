Botttom line:  good, OK, not amazing.  Certainly does not qualify for its food rating of 27 on Zagats (at least not by Manhattan standards).  This is no Il Mulino (a restaurant surely deserving its 27 food rating).  Would not again make the trip over the bridge.  We found the secret service like earpieces on the waite staff odd and the decor was kind of cheesey.  The risotto was excellent, as close to perfect as it gets.  Nothing else was special or memorable.
