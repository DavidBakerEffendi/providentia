I was excited to have Dimitri back after Table 8 closed.  The menu and service was really lovely tonight.  We shared the dates appetizer and had hanger steak entree which was perfect and Black and white sesame crusted tuna..also perferct.  The fudge brownie flight to share really topped it off!             Welcome to Upper Montclair..we will be back many times!
