I have to say, I'm a fan of Chipotle. That being said, whenever I'm in New York I never even think of going there over Dos Toros. I found this place a few years ago when I was in school and it's stuck with me. You walk into the tiny hole-in-the-wall shop and suddenly you're in a sea of people calling out orders, music playing, cash registers dinging, and people unwrapping their mouth-watering food. You can get a Chipotle sized burrito that tastes twice as good for about the same price. It also doesn't feel so "Chain Restaurant" as Chipotle. The guac is amazing, and for people who love a little kick, their spiciest sauce will bowl you over. If you're in the city and get a hankering for a burrito, this is the place to go. It's an amazing burrito that you won't regret.
