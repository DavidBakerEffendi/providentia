If you are a New Yorker or just visiting you MUST do this tour! I have lived in NYC 13 years and never looked at pizza like this or enjoyed a tour so much. Scott is a pizza enthusiast and made this tour interesting and so much fun, not to mention taking us to the best pizza spots in the city. Especially is you are visiting NYC, this tour is a MUST DO on your visit to the city.
