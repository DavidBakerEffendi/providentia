Jose's is always a great stop if you don't mind the hour wait. I usually get the Chicken Guadalahara. Very good always My wife gets the Chicken El Puelbo. Again alway very good. What has changed is the frozen strawberry margarita. Use to be the best Margarita's in the area. They have changed to a lime mix which they add strawberries to. Sent the first one back thought they made a mistake. I was wrong second one was just as bad. Won't be ordering them anymore. What a shame. Why mess with perfection. Probably to save a buck.
