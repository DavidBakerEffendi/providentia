Soooooo I'm quite sure all have had their share of good/bad and the ugly of Chinese food. My family and I have been going to this one for about 20 plus years always friendly, when we call they pretty much know what we are gonna order (we don't change from the staple and no its not pork fried rice & chicken wings..lol). Its been less than a handful of times our order was a bit mixed up, called them up, told them the issue, they made new item, no problem, no attitude, just give me 10 minutes, my friend...
