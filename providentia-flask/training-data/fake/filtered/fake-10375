I met a few friends on Friday night at 8:30PM, and I was thrilled to find parking on the street.  The host found a table right away, and the waitress was friendly too.  My friends had dinner and I went straight for dessert.  The chocolate crepe with whipped cream was awesome!  Sliced strawberries and biscotti were nice touches.  Everyone's food had great presentation.  I enjoyed my drink too...nonalcoholic sour cherry spritzer (a shot of syrup in a glass of seltzer).  Nice atmosphere...we could pick out which music was playing but it wasn't too loud.  Even though I'm not too knowledgeable driving in Brooklyn, I would venture there again.
