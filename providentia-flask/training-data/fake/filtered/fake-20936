One of the better Vietnamese sandwich shops in the area. The line moves fast, the sandwiches are made quickly, and the shop is generous with their bread and vegetables (albeit less generous with the meat). There is a jewelry counter at the front of the store, so if you like to shop for some fine rings or necklaces while picking up a $5 sandwich, this place is perfect.
