Solid, above-average Italian food in a gorgeous, distinctly Village-y space. I just went the other night with family, and everyone had a good time. We made a reservation 2 days before and our table was ready when we arrived. We were offered a table inside, but opted to sit in the garden -- despite it being late December, it was quite comfortable due to several heat lamps. Everything we ordered was well thought out and well executed. Pretty traditional Italian food done well. Best dishes of the night: - Arancini - Bacalao (special) - Fettuccine ai funghi The pappardelle with lamb was fine, but not quite as hearty as I would've liked. I didn't taste my parents' mains (branzino and pollo alla milanese), but they looked great (if simple) and were both enjoyed. Negatives: - Menus were poorly printed (they seem to have run out of ink?) making it hard to read. - Prices are about 15% higher than they should be, but that's the neighborhood. - Portions are a little small, so you'll want at least two courses per person. - The 3 people sitting next to us. They were by FAR the drunkest people I've ever seen at a decent restaurant, and they were having a nasty, loud fight. It's not Palma's fault, though, and our waiter apologized profusely after they finally left. Overall, though, I really liked the place and would definitely go back.
