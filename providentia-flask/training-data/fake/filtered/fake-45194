Dropped by this interesting place last night. It's kind of American style sushi. Everything is for your own selection. I love their idea of making the Japanese sushi into a fast food, however, It doesn't taste as good as the authentic sushi. Their rolls taste just like salad with some rice. I am a sushi fan, I don't want to be mean about the taste of their sushi rolls, their rolls actually taste good, simply not taste like sushi.
