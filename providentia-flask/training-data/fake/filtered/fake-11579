What a dissapointment. Octopus was over salted, swimming in olive oil and flavorless.Confusing as this is in direct contrast to the Osteria version which is delicately charred with a bright hint of lemon and peppery arugala. eight dollars for three small decently flavored meatballs is ridiculous! Polenta in brown butter was creamy goodness but had way too much of the butter pooling up the sides and over top of the polenta. Smoke mozzarella was bland and can't touch Radicchio's.Tuna with fennel was average (Meme's blows it outta the water).Gnocci with oxtail ragu was the best thing at the table. Even the cocktails before dinner were annoyingly served half full in these, trying too hard to be cool, martini glasses. Oh the deserts were really nice. Olive oil torta was perfect as was the chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo .SO AVERAGE and IMHO there are way better alternatives at this price point that deliver.
