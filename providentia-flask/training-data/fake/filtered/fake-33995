Good, all you haters can go eat a greasy, doughy mess-of-a-pizza at Pepe's, a pile-of-mush-pizza at Modern, or a bland cracker-pizza at BAR. Yes, please go there, so I will have a little shorter wait to enter true pizza heaven! If you are not one of these people who see a line, willfully stand in it, and then complain about waiting too long in it, if you appreciate interesting history on the walls Â to look at while you wait (yes, if you haven't heard...you will wait), if you can see the charm in Bobby C.'s spaced-out table waiting style, and you want to eat the best. pizza. ever. ....then go to Sally's. I suggest a plain and a potato.
