I travel a long way to get to McLadden's and it is well worth the hour+ drive.  I walked around to probably every restaurant in the area and found that this pub was by far the best.  I've gone several times now and have yet to be disappointed in the slightest.   Their beer selection is crazy!  The first time I went, my boyfriend and I ordered an app, 1 mixed drink, around 6 beers, and our two entrees.  The bill was much less than we expected. . .  Maybe $65. Not bad for all of that!  And they didn't sacrifice the quality of the beer, food or service.   The only downfall is if you aren't close to the front you can't see the TV with the complete list of beers.  They have some kind of scanning way so that you can get the menu on your phone.  But the waitress and no one at my table could get it to work.  So that was a little disappointing.   However, that same night the manager came over to our table and was very nice and welcoming.  He was extremely open and went and got shots for us himself.  It was impressive to see a manager so involved with the costumers and helping out his staff since it was a very busy night.  So I feel that we can look over the beer menu situation! If you go to the area, don't waste your time walking around trying to find the best place.  Eat, drink and be merry and McLadden's and you won't regret it!  I promise!!
