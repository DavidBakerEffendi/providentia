This was the worst Latin food I have ever had.  The menu was totally different from what was on-line.  The service was lousy.  And we had to witnessed two lesbians rubbing up on one another, sitting on each other's lap, etc.  I'm very liberal but I think this behavior is inappropriate for a restuarant -- even on a Sunday evening.  I would never visit this establishment again, nor would I recommend to anyone else!  What a waste of some hard earned cash.
