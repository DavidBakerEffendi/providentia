My first time there and the only word to describe it was AMAZING!!! It was all it lived up to and more! I am a huge FOODIE and this place did not dissapoint. My date and I started at LeVerdure for an appetizer of Frito Misto and a glass of Spumante (Delish). We then went on to LaPiazza for plate of Antipasti and another glass of Spumante (Yummo). We ended with next going to LaPizza&LaPasta for the Arugala w/Tomato pizza (dissapointing). However, the pasta dish more then made up for it Pasta w/beef ragu (Incredible). This all in addition to the many "sights" and "aromas" made for a very memorable evening.
