This place is great to go whether with family or with girlfriends. The separate dining room and bar area help create to different atmosphere in one restaurant. I typically like to eat at the tables around the bar and I enjoy the environment. The food is very good. Never had a dish come out wrong, undercooked ect. They are very well known for their ribs. My husband gets them every time we go so they must be good. My Favorite is their Chicken parm sandwich which comes with a Cesar salad (helps the the conscience.) The service is standard. The orders are correct, drinks are filled however, the staff is not very personable. All in all I would recommend this place!
