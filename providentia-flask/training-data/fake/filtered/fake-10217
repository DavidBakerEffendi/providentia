I've been going to BAR since childhood, and I have never had their mashed potato pizza. I pride myself on this fact because there is so much more to BAR than just it's famous crazy topping. One of my favorite things is the house salad. It's filled with chopped pears, candied nuts, and arugula, and topped with a wonderfully biting citrus vinaigrette. Yum. The ambiance of the space is another point to commend. I love the distilling vats that line the perimeter of the establishment and the upper balcony above the dining area. There's only one table up there, but if you ever get the chance to sit there it is really enjoyable -- you get to see your pizza being made from a bird's-eye view. The waitresses are very professional. Caveat: there's usually a 20-30 minute wait on popular nights (friday and saturday)
