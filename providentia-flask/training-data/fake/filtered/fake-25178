We were lucky enough to find this little gem open for reservations for Christmas night and we were delighted with the whole experience.  Don't let the tiny space fool you - big flavor and high quality comes out of this cozy corner kitchen.  The mushroom appetizer was reminicsent of the same I had years ago in Paris at Joel Robuchon -  THAT good!   Bring your own wine and enjoy an intimate tasty meal that you will remember and long to return.  (If possible, request the tiny two top in the window)
