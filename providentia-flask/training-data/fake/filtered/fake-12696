I came to this restaurant thinking on real northern Italian food and a cozy atmosphere. The food is good, but it seems that the restaurant focus more on giving a nice scene than anything else. Italian culture is known as how welcoming they are with people, this place doesn't represent that at all. It is tight and commercial. Small menu with good choices but way to small portions for the price they charge. You can find better and real Italian restaurants in the village worth the price.
