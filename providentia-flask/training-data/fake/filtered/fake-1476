Today was the first time I'd been to the White Dog since the new management and menus arrived.  I will not be going back. I ate at the bar, and had two appetizers with friends: the hummus ($7) and the grilled portobello salad with parmesan shavings ($13).  The hummus which I'd had under the old management was yummy and rich--- this hummus was so incredibly bland that if you'd given it to me blindfolded I'd have absolutely no clue what it was. I had to salt it to get anything out of it.  And, to make matters worse, the portion was smaller than it used to be.  The salad, while tasty enough, was so incredibly chincy: Maybe half a grilled mushroom cap, very little parmesan (and not very good parmesan), and very light on the greens.  I remember how I used to get a caesar salad for $7 and find it very filling--- now, for double the price, I had half as much food.  And I have to say, I find the new bar food menu bizarre-- half of it is hot dogs, which is just the cheapest, weirdest idea ever.  I am so disappointed, and will not ever return.
