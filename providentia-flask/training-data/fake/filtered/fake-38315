Great food and sitting outside made it even better. We live in the neighborhood and decided to give it a try and were quite happy we did. Tried and Pimm's and ginger ale and found my new favorite summer drink. Salads were outstanding and the PoBoys were a little on the spicy side but excellent. Also they have the world's best bread pudding with banana forester in town. I will go back there again and again.
