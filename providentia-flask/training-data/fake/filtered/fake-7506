I have been a Balthazar customer for many, many years and keep going back for more.  Go on a Thursday - Saturday night and experience one of the best vibes in NYC.  Beautiful room, fantastic food (try the filet).  After dinner, you will find yourself in a great area with tons of bars and other options for fun. On the flip side, my Wife says it's a tourist trap and prefers Union Square Cafe (although completely different) for good food, ambience and location.
