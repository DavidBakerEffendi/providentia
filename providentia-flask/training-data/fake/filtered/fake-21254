Decided to try this place based on the reviews and they were all correct. It is a very nice place to meet with friends for a relaxing afternoon tea. The service is excellent and very attentive, wide selection of teas, and Â "afternoon tea" complete with little sandwiches, scones, and desert is delicious and very filling.
