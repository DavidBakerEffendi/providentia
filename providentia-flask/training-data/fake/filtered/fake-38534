I order from here on a fairly regular basis and was satisfied with the service and food I would receive. Tonight I placed my order for pick up, when I arrived to pick up my food the order was wrong. Instead of trying to make it right, the host literally waved me off when I asked for my order to be remade correctly. Needless to say, I will not be returning. The food here may be pretty decent but with such poor customer service and blatant disrespect of a paying customer, it's not worth the three minute drive from my house.
