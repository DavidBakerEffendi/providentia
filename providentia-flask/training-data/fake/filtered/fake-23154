Have you ever gone to a restaurant where the food was bad, the service worse and the restaurant is always pretty crowded and you wonder is it me?   That's been my experience at Alexus.  The food is a step above fast food, otherwise I would give it no stars.   The food is not just bad and tasteless, it's weird - salmon in tomato sauce????  Could it be because the Manager is Chinese?   The doors to the restrooms are sticky - gross!, one of our plates also had a sticky substance on the underside of the rim  and in general, the restaurant has an old, musty odor.  Maybe it's all those TV's that keep the customers coming back.  This is one customer who won't be coming back.
