Pretty cool place.....wouldnt have even known it was there if it werent for our flight being way out in terminal C....my son and I were going to l.a. and he saw the place and figured we could get a milkshake there.....so we did.....well, I got a beer there too, they had some good ones on tap....my son got the chocolate shake and I got the strawberry......the food was awesome, fast and they were showing some good sports in there....even though they were showing a game in which the Lakers were losing....boo...but i could handle it....Anyhow, genuinely friendly people there and like i said, good food....but its down somewhere in the 80's of the C terminal so...good luck....but its worth it.
