Absolutely disgusting!!! I ordered a simple chicken caeser salad there, and every single piece of lettuce was ROTTEN, brown and soggy, my pet rabbit wouldn't even eat that. I was so disgusted I called the health department. Don't be fooled by the pretty interior. Check the pictures section for the proof!!
