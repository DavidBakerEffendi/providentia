I moved to the area a few years back and have been trying all the different local places in the area and happened to stop in with friends at Poor Henry's.  The food is absolutely flavorful and delicious.  The prime rib and crab cakes are amazing, and drinks are always good.  I am not a beer drinker, but I know they have a great selection.   When you walk in it has a nice feel and is very comfortable.  We now try to visit at least once a month.  If you like Irish pubs or just a comfy  feel I definitely would recommend Poor Henry's.      I believe anybody who has wrote a negative review is someone searching for a "Ruth's Chris" or "Capital Grille" type of restaurant with "Dennys" pricing.  Everything I have ever got is without a doubt made from scratch in the kitchen and can't think of one thing I wouldn't reorder.  I recommend anyone for food and drinks here.  If you are looking for the five star look and seating I suggest going to pay the money for it, and not giving a classic restaurant undeserved bad reviews.
