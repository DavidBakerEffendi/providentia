Have been here before and have had great Cheese Steaks. Went today and was given a roll with a slab of meat between it. Not chopped and just folded over. When I asked when they stopped chopping the steak, I was told "I don't know what he does. He does it different everyday." I told her I could make this at home with Steak-ums. Out $7.75 and will never return.
