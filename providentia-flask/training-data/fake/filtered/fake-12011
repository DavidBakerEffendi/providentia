Rutt's Hutt has been around since before I was born and it hasn't changed in all those many years. When you walk in you get the feeling that it's a sleazy, greasy, old pine hot dog and beer joint.  The walls are so old that they were probably a light colored pine 50 years ago but now they are a deep brown.   There are two "dining" areas.  One outside for takeout and the indoor one.  When you walk in you are immediately drawn to the bar area.  Don't expect great hospitality here.  Just walk yourself passed the guys sitting at the bar and go into the dining area and have a seat. This is a no frills place but you'll love it.  Although the place is a "dump," it's always clean.  The hot dogs are out of this world and so are the french fried potatoes.  Mustard in glass jars are on the table for you to help yourself.  If you want chilli or sauerkraut on your dogs, you'll have to order it on the side.  However, they are generous with it and their sauerkraut is delicious.  Not so generous with the soft drinks.  If you order a coke, you'll get it in a small glass with mostly ice. Don't expect gracious, humble service here.  It is what it is.  No one is going to ask you how your day was so don't bother engaging in any friendly conversation.  These are rough and tumble gals but you're not going to mind in the least.  It's part of the atmosphere. I've never had a disappointing meal here.  My cousin Larry makes sure this is the first place he stops at when he visits us from Pennsylvania.  When I come here with my friends, they always want to share my french fries.  What are you crazy?  Get your own.  I'm not sharing my Rutt's Hutt fries with anyone. This place should be on the National Historic Register for food joints.  So maybe you won't want to invite your hoity toity future in-laws here but if you're looking for a great hot dog, by all means, stop at Rutt's Hutt.
