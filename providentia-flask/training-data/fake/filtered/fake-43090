Not being familiar with Princeton, we asked a local business owner for an Indian restaurant recommendation.  She suggested Mehek and we went in for the Sunday lunch buffet.  While the offerings were typical of a standard Indian buffet (and, there was a good selection of vegetarian options) the quality was poor.  Although the chafing dishes were lit, when we took our first bites, we realized that the food was all luke warm - cold.  I refrained from eating much of the chicken items for fear of getting sick.  The vegetable pakora was cold and rubbery and the curry sauces were thin.  The naan was warm when it was delivered and much of my meal consisted of this. Sevice was not great.  Even when it was clear that we had finished, our waiter remained seated at a table behind us, doing side work.  We wound up calculating our own tab and leaving the money on the table. Seems like this place has received mixed reviews.  Maybe it's better during the week, but I would personally not go back.
