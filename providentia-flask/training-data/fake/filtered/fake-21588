Very disappointing experience.Went there for Hibachi. My server was nice and the Hibachi chef was very entertaining but my lobster hibachi dinner was pretty much tasteless and mediocre at best. I can't put my finger on it but there is just something cheesy about this place. It can't compare to Imperial 46.
