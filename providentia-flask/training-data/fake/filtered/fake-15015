Having been burned by veggie restaurants in the past, I had really high hopes for this place. All of them were fulfilled!! Most veggie places that aren't Mediterranean tend to be very greasy, and Veggie Heaven is *not*.  I went there with my meat-loving boyfriend before catching a show at the Welmont. It was a fantastic decision. The service was prompt and friendly. There were a few minor confusions due to the language barrier, but everything was cleared up before our order was put in. We got appetizers, entrees AND dessert (something we don't usually do) and had lots of leftovers. The shui mai appetizer (steamed) was amazing. We both got fresh juices...the green one had a fantastic celery base with sweet components, which I know may not be everyone's taste, but I loved that savory flavor in a juice! The watermelon juice was also quite good, though on the sweet side. My entree was  veggie shrimp, and I was amazed. The only meat I've craved since becoming a vegetarian 8 years ago was shrimp...and this satisfied that craving perfectly. It was hard to not devour the whole thing, but I wanted to save room for dessert. Why? GREEN TEA CAKE. Even if you do not like fake meats/aren't veggie...GO GET THE GREEN TEA CAKE. It blew my mind.  Oh man, I want some right now just writing about it. SO GOOD!!! Seriously, Go there.
