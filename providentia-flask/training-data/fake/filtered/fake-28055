I went here on a date with my fianc√© and we loved everything about Amada. The tapas were delicious and there was a great ambience that makes you feel like you aren't in Philadelphia. I'd highly recommend the lamb meatballs and the goat cheese with strawberry balsamic. We will definitely come back!
