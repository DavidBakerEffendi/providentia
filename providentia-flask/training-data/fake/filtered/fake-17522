I've been here twice and both times loved it, except... the last time, I asked for a side dish of kim chee (it's on the menu, in a dish that blends it with sashimi, to... dare I say it? Hide the taste of elderly fish) and the waitress told me that it was not available as a side. Two of us had spent $300 on food & sake at this point, and I was less than impressed. So she got a lousy tip. Mean? Perhaps. But it seemed like such a small request.
