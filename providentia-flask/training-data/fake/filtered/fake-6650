We were intrigued by the widely varying reviews, especially by those that said the chef was rude. Definitely not the case!  The chef hardly looked up from his work while we were there.  He was in the zone, not critiquing his customers.  Our two waitresses were polite and attentive, and our sushi was fresh and beautifully prepared.  It is a tiny place and we were taken aback by the quirky list of rules by the front door, but we can understand that it wouldn't be nice to: 1) bring strollers inside 2) stay long after you have eaten when there are people waiting and 3) bring in hard liquor or several bottles of wine.  We really enjoyed our meal and would return.
