Went for takeout on Memorial Day.  The man at the front acted bothered to see me walk in.  He was silent for several seconds before finally looking up and saying "pickup?".  Hello to you too.  He gruffly pointed to takeout menus hanging on the wall when I asked to see a menu. After looking over their extensive menu, I asked for one of the lunch specials and was told I couldn't order it, maybe no lunch specials on holidays? I was disappointed, but wouldn't be so presumptuous to tell someone how to run their business.  The man suggested another dish by its number, saying it was the entree version of the lunch special I had ordered, and cost about $4 more.  He handed me a menu and I told him I would take his recommendation.  He then snatched the menu out of my hand like a poorly mannered child.  I was still feeling optimistic about my dish, so I paid the rude little man and left to pick something up from one of the neighboring stores. I came back about ten minutes later, and my food was bagged and ready, and SITTING ON THE FLOOR!  I expressed my disappointment at that, but was STILL feeling optimistic about my dish, so I took it and left.  Smelled good too! Got where I needed to be and unpacked my food.  WTH?? The dish I ordered had mixed veggies and tofu with broad noodles and spicy chili sauce.  The dish I was given was mixed veggies and tofu in a weird, oily, and definitely not spicy broth with rice.  Going back was not an option.  I gagged down three forkfuls, then decided to go hungry.   On a positive note, the waitresses I saw in action seemed friendly and attentive.  But the gross dish and rude treatment from the angry little man have guaranteed that I'll never return.
