I'll be tactful:  they really shouldn't be open yet, because they're still working on the space and on their recipes.  It's probably best to give them more time. On the other hand, they should be able to recognize burnt cookies when they see them.  Plus, they overcharged me.  Counterpeople shouldn't do math in their heads.
