I love this place.  I have now been there 4 times and every time I get the crab cake bahn mi.  I truly enjoy this sandwich because of the the various textures and flavors that are in it.  You have the soft crab cake with slightly crispy exterior, you get the crunch from the veggies as well as the crust of the bread and the sauce is perfect. This place is fast, cheap and delicious.  One of these days I will try the pho which seems to have great ratings from the other reviews here. Make sure to bring cash, because they don't except cards.
