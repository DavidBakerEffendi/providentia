I have been eating at Bella's Cafe since they opened. I eat there three to four times a week. Â The food is always good and I never left there hungry. The portions are very large. I probably have eaten every dish on the breakfast and lunch menu. I have never had to send anything back to the kitchen. The cafe is extremely clean at all times. My favorite there is the french toast with sliced strawberries which is plated very nicely as all dishes are. The staff is very friendly and efficient. The owner demands her staff be nothing but the best. It is a very busy place so sometimes you have to wait for a table but if you sit at the counter it usually goes quickly. Believe me if I was not satisfied with everything I would not be eating there all these years. Noreen D.
