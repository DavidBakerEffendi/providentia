Don't insult San Francisco...This is not a San Francisco style burrito place. To start, the rice is cooked with chicken stock, leaving out the option for a true veggie burrito. In Ca burritos/tacos/etc, you have the option to add in lettuce, jalapenos, cilantro, onion, multiple hot sauces, vegetables...NOT HERE. They throw on a slab of bland white cheese, not mexican-style. Even in the Mission, there are always available options. Toto..go back to kansas.
