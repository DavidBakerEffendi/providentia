DIRTY!! Filthy!! People don't understand English! We have $25.00 worth of disgusting subs in our refrigerator which was their mistake. We order capacola and provolone with lettuce, tomato, vinegar peppers. We get: THICK slices of ham, some kind of smushy salami, capacola (slime-y), cheese, and about 1/2 cup of mayo on each piece of bread. They stopped answering their phone 30 minutes before they close so there was no way to tell them about the mistake. Call the next day and the owner starts screaming then hangs up!!! You want a sub? Go to someplace else. Pizza And is open later but you have to be hard pressed to eat there.
