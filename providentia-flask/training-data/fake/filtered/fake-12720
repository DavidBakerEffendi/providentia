Best shabu shabu place ever!  I'm so glad that I discovered this hidden gem!  I took my parents, who are out of towners, to multiple restaurants in NYC, including some pretty pricey gourmet places, and they loved this place the best.  I always get the shabu shabu.  Personally, I can't tell whether the slightly more expensive version is that much better.  And also, a word of advice.  Get the red bean ice cream.  It's better than the green tea ice cream.
