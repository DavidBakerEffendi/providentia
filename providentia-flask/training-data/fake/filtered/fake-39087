it was just for the lunch special (and that happened quite often, the experience each time being amazing).  It was a true test last night because the place was a lot busier than it usually is during the lunch hour and the crowd was also much more sophisticated. The food was amazing, the service was attentive, with my friends who were with us have never been to Basso before and they were all in awe, I felt so happy that they all were as crazy about this place as I was.  We have tried wine, there are some very good choices,  I think this probably makes Basso my favorite Italian restaurant in the entire city.  I don't think I will ever get tired of the food and the service.  It does get a bit pricey during the evening as compared to lunch, but in terms of comparing it to other high-level Italian places.
