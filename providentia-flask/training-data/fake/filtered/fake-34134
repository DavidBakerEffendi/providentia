What can I say about the Bistro?? We have been patrons since it opened and have eaten there as a couple or with friends about 25 times....Food is outstanding!!! We have never had a meal that was less than spectacular...Our first choice is always the specials and the tapas in particular...Saturday night it was the grilled fresh sardines over broccoli rapini, the fresh figs stuffed with blue cheese and wrapped with serano ham and grilled and for dinner the hake which was phenonmenal!!! Â Paella is outstanding as are the pastas, the lamb ravioli in particular....Salads are diverse, not just greens....soups are a treat especially summer ones like grape and cucumber....If you like food that is diverse and full of flavor, this is the place for you...The owners are on the spot and service has improved vastly in the year ...and finally, prices are reasonable.....treat yourself to a great dining experience....Sandy
