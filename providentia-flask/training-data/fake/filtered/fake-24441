I am vegetarian and have tried quite a few Vegan/Veg Only restaurants in the Chinatown/Center city area. I have to say that Su Xing is the best of the lot. I have been here multiple times and have always walked out satisfied. The place is neat and clean and the staff is friendly. Menu - They have an extensive menu with a variety of option to suit most palates. What I really like the fact that the menu has pictures of some of their popular dished and it takes the guess work out of the equation. Food - Has always been top notch. Personal favorites are the Mashed Tofu on the Nori w. Bar-B-Q Sauce and Crispy Soy Bean Protein Steak.
