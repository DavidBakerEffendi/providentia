I met up with a few friends at the Standard Tap for dinner this past Monday night - and have never seen such bad service in Philly.   This is not the first time we've had a really bad experience at the Standard Tap due solely to the rudeness of our server. A few of us were seated at the bar while waiting for our friends to arrive - we had paid for our drinks at the bar, and when we sat down with them at our table, the server came over and said not hello but "Where did you get those beers."   Our table was large, but not difficult to get around - and so I found it rude that the server said "could someone pass me those glasses" instead of simply reaching over and picking up the empty glasses herself.   Same with plates later on. When my friend said "I'd like a salad", the server did not respond nicely - she could have said, "We have [this salad], [that salad], and [this salad]," but instead she quickly and sharply said:  "Which salad. I mean, come on, help me out a little here."  This wasn't funny nor was it meant to be - it was callous and rude. She forgot who ordered what, only came by to check on us after we had all finished eating, and immediately gave us the check without anyone asking for it.  Adding injury to insult, an 18.5% service charge was added to the bill automatically - which further grated on my nerves because normally when this is a restaurant's policy they state it somewhere on the menu... not the case here as the only menus are poorly lit chalkboards! This is not the first time I've seen such bad service at the Standard Tap - it says a lot about the management that they employ such rude, poorly trained staff.  And it's frankly insulting to customers.
