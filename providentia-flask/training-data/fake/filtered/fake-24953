Great place for either steak or pasta. I have eaten Â here many of times and always had the steak. They cook it exactly the way I asked. The sides are pretty incredible too. I just went with some friends from work and we did not order steak. We were not disappointed. We shared a few different dishes and I truly enjoyed them .We ordered the homemade Gnocchi, The chicken beast with articoke hearts and olives in a really good tomatoe sause and they did a nice job on my favorite brocolli rabe with sausage.
