Everything on Sweetwaters' menu can be found at a lower cost and higher quality somewhere else nearby. I honestly think the only reason they are open is because of location. The plates come to the table looking thrown together and sloppy, the drinks take too long and the decor is tired. Furthermore the environment is frantic and I leave feeling anxious rather than satisfied and relaxed. Stay away!
