To be honest, all BBQ joints in the Ironbound taste exactly the same.  These spots are absolutely amazing though.  They churn out decent BBQ and they all come with Rice and Fries.  They fed 7 of us for a grand total of $60.  Now that's chizzeeap!!  Now, what sets them apart from the other Ironbound favorite, Ferry Street BBQ, is the chicken.  The chicken here, most of the time, is very moist.  You don't expect that because everybody else's chicken in the Ironbound comes out the same, dry.
