My friend and I recently went to Terre à Terre for the first time and we loved it! From the food to the service- everything is top notch. I had the artichoke hearts as an appetizer and they were delicious. As an entrée, I had the sea bass which was also very good. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a high quality farm-to-table type restaurant.
