I went to Smokin' Betty's for dinner and drinks with a coworker last night. I've been before and must say I became addicted to the dry rub grilled spicy wings. However, all the while I was eye balling the lamb burger. We added feta cheese to the burger. That was a piece of LOVELINESS!! Not to mention the mint cucumber sauce was something I would possible want to bathe in. Then I took home some of the ribs for my Dude. The meat was falling off the bone! He really enjoyed it sooooo much! I tasted them and found the ribs tasty as well. In all the things I tasted that was a piece of God's grace shining down on me the corn muffins need some work. They were dry. Almost like ummmmm sand dust. All in all, I want to take everyone there. The food was good and the service was just as good and pleasant! Shout out to Derry!! :)
