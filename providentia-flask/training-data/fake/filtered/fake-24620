Hands down... only Chinese food spot i will eat in!!!   Soup Dumplings are slamming... Crispy Beef off the charts!!!   The flat noodles (even though they are round) have the best texture and taste!!!   You will leave there FULL and ready for a nap  its 100% worth the crazy wait anytime of the day if you are in the mood for the best chinese food this side of the pound ;)
