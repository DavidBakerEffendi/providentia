This is a nice place to chill out in a sunny day sitting outdoors. Except for the fact that you have a Sunoco gas station in front of it I would say the street has a nice vibe. The service outdoors isn't that fast, though nothing to be worried about. I really enjoyed their home brewed beers, would recommend going for them if you like to try new beers. I had a hamburger, it was really tasty though hard to handle, kept falling apart. As for the rest of my group, everybody loved their meals.
