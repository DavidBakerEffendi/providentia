Visiting from Austin TX.   Loved the irony of Texas toast.   From start to finish, this was one of my favorite meals ever.   Bloody Mary was substantial - practically a smoothie.   Well-garnished, spicy and thick    Brunch started with warm cheesy biscuits drizzled with honey and served with herb butter    I had lobster with chili butter sauce, eggs and Texas toast.   My daughter had eggs "Benny* with garlic home fries.  " Amazing" doesn't do this justice    Service was great, from the hostess to the bartender to our waiter.   I will be back - this alone is worth the trip from Texas!
