We came here on a weeknight. First off, the host - sweet as pie. Service was even better - like pistachio whipped cream on top. We ordered the braised beef short ribs, stuffed porgy & roasted beets w/ rice. As we waited for our food, we took time to embrace the handsome decor. The beef short ribs were succulent & tender, stuffed porgy was great down to the bones & the roasted beets were silky smooth - even better with a bit of raspberry balsamic vinaigrette. I'll definitely come back and bring my parents.
