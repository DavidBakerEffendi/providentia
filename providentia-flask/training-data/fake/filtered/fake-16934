I have been a fan of Cafe Gitane for 5 years, both eating in and ordering delivery.  However, the last two times I have ordered delivery, my food arrived and something was missing.  First the hummus did not arrive with my couscous.  Last night I ordered a salad that was delivered without any vinaigrette.  The girl on the phone was very friendly, but completely unconcerned, and the delivery guy never showed up to correct the mistake.  My order seemed to have been hastily and carelessly put together -- it makes me wonder what else they do hastily and carelessly. No one at the restaurant was concerned with fixing the mistake.  I will never order delivery from them again and would not recommend it to anyone in the neighborhood.
