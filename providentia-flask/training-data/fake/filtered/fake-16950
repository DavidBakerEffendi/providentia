Seriously people, if you think its stupid to order the toast then just don't order the toast. I personally prefer the cucumber/hummus/yogurt if you're looking for something to start with. Good, if unspectacular, food. Great decor, better people watching. In 6+ years of coming here the experience is remarkably consistent. One of my go-to spots.
