My boyfriend and I are big fans of Pho Ha. We went to Pho Saigon because we had never there before and wanted to see how their food was in comparison. He was quite satisfied with his soup, as I was satisfied with my vermicelli bowl. We ordered two orders of (2)fried rolls. He ate half of his first roll and upon returning for the second half, he pulled out from the roll, what appeared to be, a Post-It sized piece of Suran Wrap. Obviously disgusted, he spoke with the cashier, who did NOT offer for the meal to be on the house, but merely deducted the cost of the (1)"tainted" roll. We left shortly after, my vermicelli unfinished, 2 fried rolls untouched. The food was good, but as a result of their problem solving in this particular circumstance, I considered the customer service abhorrent. He and I will never go back.
