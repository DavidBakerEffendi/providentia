Terrible experience. Don't expect to get in if you are a group of 5 or more, this is one of those places that gets by purely on hype. We were told at 7PM tonight to expect a 1 hour wait. 2 1/2 hours later we gave up, the fact we had 3 kids and said we didn't mind splitting our group made no difference. Rude is an understatement. I wouldn't give these guys the pleasure again, no pizza is worth the treatment we had tonight.
