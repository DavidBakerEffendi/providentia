I LOVE the idea of bringing some healthy food options to Downtown Newark.. we NEED places like Better Bites!  Everything I've had is good (although in my opinion the bread makes the burgers a little dry, so go for a wrap), but expect to wait a little longer since everything things are freshly made to order.  Good vegetarian options (even the brown rice is good), and the place is super clean.  Like the selection of Honest Teas and snacks.  Also, it's always a plus in my book when you've got mashed sweet potatoes and a good vegetable medly as a sides option. Although you may feel good about eating lunch here, you really feel it in your pockets! TOO EXPENSIVE...$11 for a wrap and drink, sorry but I'm still hungry.  Can you look to include a piece of fruit or include some homemade baked tortilla chips?  If you add two sides to your wrap, it's an extra $3.99, so that would be almost $15 dollars? In Newark? Kind of crazy!! Wish I could eat here more often.
