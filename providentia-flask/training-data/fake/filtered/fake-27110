I had beef teriyaki for dinner last week.The quality of their beef was excellent. They also had many kinds of side dishes (fish cakes etc) which were very delicious. My husband had beef bulgogi and they were the best I've had so far. They have some popular korean dishes and many kinds of special rolls. The place is modern and clean and people are very nice. Definately would like to recommend this place.
