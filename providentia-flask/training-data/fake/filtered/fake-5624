The place is DEFINITELY just adorable! Decor is awesome, the music sets you back into the old days in a candy shop. My friend and I stopped buy on a Wednesday at about 5:30 pm. It was just starting to get busy. I am basing this review on only the food and service. The service was very pleasant. However, the food seemed like it took forever to make and my "appetizer" and entree came out at the same time! That is a no-no in my book. The entree, however, was just amazing! I had the Max's Sunday Mood Pasta. It was just lovely. Be careful with the amount of cheese. It can be quite overwhelming. My friend ordered the Pasta La Mancha. It was AWESOME. It tasted healthy but so flavorful. The pastas were also cooked just right. Unfortunately, we were stuffed by the end of our meal that we did not get to order any chocolate desserts. I will definitely go back to try it and update my review.
