I was searching for good nepali restaurants as I was craving for the food so badly after coming back from a trip there.I saw Himalayan Yak having good reviews and decided to give a try. And I am so glad I did that. It was amazing, both food and the dinning environment. They serve Tibetan and Nepali food. Their decor is very classic and unique. Oh well, at least they are very unique to me since I am not Nepalese or Tibetan. We ordered beef Thali (traditional Nepali combination platter), Shpata (beef chilly), and some other spicy beef dish that I forgot about the name. Honestly, I am not sure how authentic the food is as I am not native. But they definitely taste good. I will say they taste almost as good as those I had in Nepal and Tibet. Beef Thali is very tasty and I like how they give you the great combo of meat, veggie and carbs in one order. The other two dishes are relatively spicy but also very delicious. We went on a weeknight. But I heard there will be band performing on Friday nights. So people who like their traditional music should go check it out at Friday night. I will definitely go back for more yummy tasty food :)
