I tried using a Google offers deal here (pay $25 for $50 of food) and was told they would not accept the display on my phone because they "did not have a scanner." The waitress suggested I go to the Staples to print it out; she gave the oh-so-helpful directions that it was maybe 5 blocks and 1 or 2 avenues away. The deal very clearly said one could either display the offer on a mobile device OR print it out, but they would not honor this. The only food we actually consumed were a glass of sangria (good) and a mango milkshake (lukewarm and tasteless).
