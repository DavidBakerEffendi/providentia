Peaches has been recommended to me a few times, and though it's not strictly a BBQ joint (it's mostly known for it's Nashville style friend chicken) it's owned by the same guys at Â the Smoke Joint, and it's a ten minute walk from my apartment, so I figured it was worth a shot. I went for the hand pulled pork sandwich to get the most unhindered flavor of the meat, but other options like the Smoke Pork Hash (pulled pork, red potatoes, sweet onions, sunny side eggs) and North Carolina Egg Scramble (with pulled pork, pickled onions, and scallions) are sure to appeal to the Brooklynite who loves BBQ and Brunch alike. The pork had a good flavor, and texture, and a good deal of smokiness. There was already sauce on the sandwich but it wasn't drenched and the flavor shined through. I ended up adding a heavy splashing of their homemade hot sauce, which proved to be pretty addictive. The fries that came with it were light and crispy. I think there was also an option of sweet potato fries, but sadly I didn't hear the bartender if he mentioned that to me. The roasted marinated tomato on the side was a welcomed change from the usual cole slaw. The bun was big but light and crispy, so it didn't seem too "bread-y" Will definitely be back next time I'm craving pulled pork and don't want to leave my 'hood.
