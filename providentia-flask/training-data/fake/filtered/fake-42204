Fried chicken and gravy on a biscuit! Chick-fil-a meets Mario Batali. Walked in on a whim for a slightly hungover brunch last weekend, which turned out to be their first day ever open for brunch. The service was polite (and lookin' fine in the face: bonus!) and the setting was very zen garden-y in a good way. I had the lobster scrambled eggs, which were super soft and were not short on the lobster. The big winner at the table was the fried chicken. Everything was served with a high end cuisine style (drizzles of sauce, relatively small portions, artful presentation etc) and all the drinks seemed to be the requisite old-school-with-a-twist speakeasy bespoke style. Was tempted by everything and ended up tossing down more than $30 for my share of brunch. Will definitely come back next time I'm in the mood for more indulgence.
