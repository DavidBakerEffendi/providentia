Not impressed. Had high expectations after waiting an hour and a half on a Sunday for brunch. We sat at the bar and waited for our table while we downed $10 dollar mimosas. Service was very suspect when actually seated. The waiter provided little help on the menu. I had the lamb sandwich which was a mistake. Most of the food looked good and the atmosphere is chic but overall I felt ripped off. We also had the shrimp salad which was good and the french onion soup which was good but a ripoff at $10 bucks. Nice place, good place to impress a girl I guess but I'm not running back. Rather go to Monk's Cafe for the money.
