got back from one of the worst dining experiences i've ever had at a japanese restaurant.  the soda was flat in all respects and warm.  my friend and i asked for water instead - it came back with floaters.  the fun doesn't stop there.  ordered the katsudon (which was piping hot, score??).  there was no taste to it unless you added soy sauce and then it just tasted like soy sauce - blech!  i will never go back there; let alone recommend it to anyone else.  i've had better japanese food at a strip mall than at this stand alone.  needless to say, don't waste your money here unless you like fruit flies lingering and poor food/drink offerings.
