I like most everything about this place. For starters, they carry Coronado Idiot IPA--which you must try. The service is great and the food was delicious. We ordered the duck jambalaya and the My Burger. The jambalaya was good and spicy but the leg of duck stole the dish; it was seasoned and tender and there was enough of it to share. The My Burger (cooked medium) would hold a torch in any "Best of Philly" burger competition. It has goat cheese and a fried green tomato on it. There are lots of sides on the menu that I am excited to come back and try. I'm not going to order the cajun fries again, though.
