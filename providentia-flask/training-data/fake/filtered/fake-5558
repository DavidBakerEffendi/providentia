Did not meet expectations. Service was poor to say the least. We wanted dessert and a glass of wine. Since we did not have reservations, we were told the wait was 35-45 minutes despite the fact that there were many open and clean tables. We ended up sitting at the bar where the service was very slow. Menu items are overpriced. Chocolate was "ok" but overall experience definitely did not meet expectations.
