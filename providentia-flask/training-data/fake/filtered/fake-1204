Situated in East Village, ssam is considerably different than noodle bar and milk bar.  At ssam they have decent drinks and a menu that seems fairly top-chef like.  Don't come here if you're hungry because you pay $18 for 4 bites of quail.  Very good tasting food.  Not enough for a real meal...if you know what I mean.  Seating can be crazy on nights but not as bad as noodle bar.  Milk is next door.
