This is the best Mexican cuisine in this area... HOWEVER You must be willing to wait at least two hours for a table. You may not wait that long on a Tuesday or Wednesday, but count on it on the weekends... The food really is delicious, but by the time you're seated, who knows what you would think taste good... They do not take reservations and I can't understand why for the life of me. It would be run so much smoother. I guess it's because people are willing to wait... You get your food really quick once you are seated, but dependent on the server, you may only be seen by him twice... I still love to eat here! $
