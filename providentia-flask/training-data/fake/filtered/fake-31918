The food is very good, and at these reasonable prices an excellent deal. The drink specials, from unlimited Sangria brunch to Mojito Madness Mondays ($5 Mojitos), make this a great destination for fun gatherings. Above all, the service is stellar! Twice I've been here with challenging parties (one, a group of 16 all drinking for brunch, and the other a party of 12 where 6 canceled only a few minutes before the reservation time) and both times experienced gracious, friendly service from waiters who really made the whole experience. I really like the food. I really like the drinks. I really like the prices. I LOVE the service and the big group-friendly set up. Highly recommend, especially for large groups.
