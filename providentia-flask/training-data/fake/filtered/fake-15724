Suzy's may have been a hit joint serving delicious and customer appreciative food when it just first opened, but it looks as though the quality of the restaurant as a whole had diminished. I remember coming here with my girlfriend 2 years ago and the place hot our plates and our pallets right on the spot! ...2 years later, we receive terrible service, specifically a careless waitress with a bad attitude, almost as if she was waiting for my table to leave. I was with my girlfriend, and our two little siblings, and we ordered curly fries with a rack of ribs. The ribs were chewy and the fries were not seasoned not cooked properly. And looking through other Yelp reviews , there is either a great inconsistency with the food not being bad on some days?... Or either being VERY consistent with serving awful food on most days. Only time will tell if this restaurant has what it takes to pull itself up again. Bad service. Awful food. One star. Bottom Line.
