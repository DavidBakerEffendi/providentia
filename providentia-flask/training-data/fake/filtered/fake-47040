Casual, relaxed environment, but the food!      Good Italian food - pizza, mozz sticks, egg and chick parm - all fresh and light.  Highlight was the homemade pasta sauce.   Brick chicken was huge but pretty fresh and juicy.  That block has a trifecta of Italian foodie spots - but do duck in and try Rubirosa.   And have a little cannoli or Italian cookie to top it off!
