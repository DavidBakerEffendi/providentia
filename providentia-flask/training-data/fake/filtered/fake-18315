Took a leisurely walk up to Nassau Street to, what used to be "my go to place" for lunch until today.  Bought half of a chicken salad wrap - was charged $5.35.  I know eating out is expensive in Princeton, but that was a rip off. I'm sorry to say that I no longer rate this place as "my go to spot"....sorry but you lost me with those charges.  One would expect to get a whole wrap for that price. Also, the nice Farmer's Market decor is not there anymore....the charming atmosphere has disappeared....
