I like the spinach and artichoke. One slice is usually plenty, unless I walked 40 blocks or haven't eaten that day. Good deal too. I have not been able to appreciate the crab though. I like all the other slices they got, but the artichoke is my favorite I also wish they served good beer, I don't think it would be to much to ask to sell a styrofoam cup full of good draft with good pizza. The budweiser was cute at first, but for $3 more I would have paid for the real stuff.
