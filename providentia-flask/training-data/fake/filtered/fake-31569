Besides the long wait even with a reservation-- I must say, everything was exquisite ! The food the ambience the service was just amazing.... Felicia even gave us a complimentary dessert for our birthday celebration ! The chocolate cake literally melts in your mouth !! I recommend the nachos and the Mac n cheeses ! (Both chorizo and lobster are delish) Â and the salmon burger and red snapper are just as great and zesty! This place is beyond a 5 star I can't wait to come back for my birthday ! :)
