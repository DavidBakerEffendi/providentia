Price:      $$$ Food:      *** Service:  *** Delivery: ***** Been eating here for years (minus a stretch after an uncooked calzone). The pizza here is not the best, but the sicilian pies and calzones (when they are cooked) are very good. Food usually delivered ahead of schedule and NO delivery charge, which seems to be a very rare thing now days.
