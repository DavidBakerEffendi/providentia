Food is very mediocre, the seating is so close together it feels like your eating on top of a complete stranger sitting next to you. Â  The staff is very weird and seem to lack customer service skills. The price of the food is ok compared to other breakfast places. I guess you get what you pay for. Oh and DO NOT!!! Use a credit card or debit card at this restaurant one of the waiters took it upon themselves to write in a tip on the restaurant copy of my receipt, and when I confronted the management about it days later after I reviewed my bank statement, they tried to cover it up as a error in their system. I am very disappointed because I go out of my way to patronize black owned businesses and I feel like I was robbed. Even though they offered to give me the tip amount back in cash I wouldn't even waste my time traveling all the way there burning more gas than what the tip was worth. I will never spend my money at this place again and I will tell my friends and family do not go there. They have criminals working for them apparently, and you might be the next victim. Smh. Horrible !
