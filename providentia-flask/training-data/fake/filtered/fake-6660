Wow the food was delicious. I went there with my friend as a tryout before I host a dinner with the rest of my friends and I was pleasantly surprised. My first reaction was the it's really small but after a few delicious and tasty sangria's, I realized that the place is intimate and perfect to host a little get together with close friends. I can't wait to go again!!!!
