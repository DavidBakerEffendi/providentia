Heard they made a decent pizza. Called an order in and was told 20 minutes. Showed up in 25 and was told to come back in 5. Came back in 10 and was told I had to go to the back of the line of people ordering, at least 10 people. Bad business. They were busy so I thought I'd give a shot at delivery. They delivered a pesto pizza without any pesto. Not happy. Thought I'd give them one last shot and was told at 9:10 on a Friday night I was too late for delivery and that they didn't care that there was no pesto on their pesto pizza. I support Montclair businesses, I don't need to support such a surly owner. 3 strikes, we're done.
