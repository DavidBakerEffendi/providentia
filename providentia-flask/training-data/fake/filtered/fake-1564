Born and raised in Brooklyn, I was excited to come back home and find this restaurant. I ordered online the first time and the chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosas, and naan were great. The chicken tikki masala is amazing!!! It has just the right amount of spice and has a unique kick to it. I decided to go to the restaurant for the lunch special and the service was superior. In addition to the great food, the owners were so attentive and their charm and humor made for a overall wonderful experience. I highly recommend this restaurant with absolutely no reservations! Enjoy!
