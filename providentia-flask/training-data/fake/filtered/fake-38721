One word. Overrated. Maybe one star is a little harsh. The food is not terrible, just extremely underwhelming for what you pay. This review is about the total dining experience. (Brunch is downright insulting though. With so many chic, charming cafes dying to serve you delicious and creative brunch for half as much--why throw money down the drain at Fork?) Admittedly, I don't write many reviews, but after my second visit to Fork I felt compelled to contribute to the community of reviewers that I consult so often. If you have money to burn, by all means, go. The food is good. Some things are very good! But the service is entirely hit or miss, seeming to waver between a mix of rude/haughty/overbearing and rude/haughty/non-existent. The servers at Fork act like they're doing you a favor. Get over yourself guys, you're not saving the world, you're waiting tables. Part of the reason the customer dines out is to have a special experience...if you're too cool for your job then get a new one. The desserts leave much to be desired and most of the restaurant is too cramped for comfort. It's obvious from the moment you take your last bite that they can't wait for you to leave so they can turn the table. Needless to say, I won't be going back. I mean, even if you do have money to burn this city is filled...FILLED with amazing restaurants.
