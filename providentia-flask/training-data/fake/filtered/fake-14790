Had a chance to finally try KC Prime after all of these years.  The wine menu selection is very appealing and has incredible choices.  Very fairly priced as well.  Ordered the special bone in filet.  Great steak and very flavorful.  My husband had the strip, not as good as mine but very good.  For dessert don't pass up on the brownie.  Scrumptious! Highly recommend.
