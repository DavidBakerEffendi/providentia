Had friends come in from Long Island and they just HAD to come here. I don't really write reviews or care enough to bother but.... Wow. The oyster list alone was worth the wait. Friendly staff, great food, smallish space, (one bathroom) but for a party of 5 we spent $150 total and super good value. The fish aficionado's Â I was with could not stop talking about the meal. So, good job guys and ohh get that phone working because I was not able to talk to anyone about reservations. Makes big party planning difficult.
