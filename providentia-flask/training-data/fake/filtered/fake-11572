I really thought the third time would be the charm with this place...we went for brunch. If you want to pay $8.00 for a single pancake, then this is your joint.  The menu listed "chocolate chip pancakeS" (emphasis on the "S") for $8.00.  The waiter told us there were at least two pancakes in the order.  But we got one pancake and were still charged $8.00.  When I raised the issue with the waiter, management came out and made some lame excuse about how the meal only includes one pancake that is "larger" than in most places.   The pancake was the same size as in ANY OTHER brunch place.  And if you're only going to give one pancake, don't print up a menu (and a bill) that refers to multiple pancakes in the meal.  They ultimately took it off of our bill, but acted like they were doing us a favor -- even though we offered to pay the price for a single pancake. There were also little issues like waiting 15 minutes for coffee despite being some of the only people in the dining room, and having our waiter spill milk all over our table. Save your money.  Frankly, you can get better (and more) brunch food for a better price at IHOP.
