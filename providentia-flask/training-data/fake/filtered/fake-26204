Go. What a great addition to the Montclair restaurant scene. Great food...huge portions...a staff who really cares...good energy. It might be a cliche regarding authenticity, Â but I was glad to see several tables of Colombian people there...enjoying the food and the restaurant. It's BYOB...and they provide an ice bucket at the table (simple things like that matter). The menu is large - with choices for everyone. I'll definitely go back.
