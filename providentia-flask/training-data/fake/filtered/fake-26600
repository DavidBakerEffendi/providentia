What a great place with great clean eating options. Falafel is the best in NY!! you can get it in a Pita or Platter, I particularly love Quinoa salad and the beets with mine, my wife loves the lightly grilled vegetables and the fresh salad. very tasty!! we also love the juices, they are phenomenal. we visit this place regularly and the staff are extremely friendly and always full of smiles. the manager has a well organized team and is very much involved in the quality of service. Recommend this highly to anyone who loves the mediterranean food. also have great options for Vegans and Vegetarians, as well as anyone who likes meat. Trust me the Falafels I dream about!!! they are awesome!!! Â  There are great options for drinks, food is great and staff are very welcoming and a pleasure to deal with.
