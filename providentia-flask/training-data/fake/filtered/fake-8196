Yuca Bar was a recommendation from some local barman, we were a group of 8 and we were seated easily enough.  The service was excellent, we all had so much fun with the server, she was super friendly and had a very good humor, always smiling, which we loved!  Also the manager was super nice checking us out, and making sure that we had everything we wanted! We also loved the decor...we were talking about the place and the FOOD all night long... the food, OMG!!!! Is so delicious! We ate almost all tapas, and it was hard to choose the best one,  but I would say I loved the mussels and the arepa vegetariana the most....wait and the ceviche tasting!!! VERY good! THE DRINKS!!!!  LOL!!!!!! Super well done!!!! Was just perfect!!! All my friends wasn't planing to drink a lot...but we simplify couldn't cause the drinks were so good! I had met the "caipirinha" in Brazil and I loved, but at yuca was BETTER than Brazil!!! Most of my friends din't know it,  and they also loved! Drinks are very good prices, the caipirinha was made with a good quality cachaça (Leblon) and  was a huge drink comparing to any other caipirinha that I had before...   but the real reason that I'm giving it 5 stars is.... EVERYTHING  :) At the end we were super happy and satisfied, and our server recommended the desert TRES LECHES, which was INCREDIBLE delicious! LOL!!! I can't wait  to go back! They also said that they have a Brazilian night every thursdays with brazilian music, food and drinks.....I really want to check that out! Sounds great! :)
