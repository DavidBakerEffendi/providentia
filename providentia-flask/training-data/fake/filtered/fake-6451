This restaurant is simply one of the best Italian restaurants in northern NJ! The atmosphere is casual, cozy and comfortable and service is always friendly and attentive. The new menu offers good variety, great value and the portions are large. The food is always cooked to perfection and the veal, chicken, seafood and steak dishes, all of which I have enjoyed over the years, are consistently well-presented and well-above average. Don't miss the appetizers! The spiedini is second to none and worth the trip by itself.  Desserts are good but selection is limited. By the time you get thru dinner, you'll be full anyway.  This place is great for parties too! The new lighting system enhances the elegance of the ballrooms and dealing with the owner personally to plan and throw parties has always been easy and pleasurable.  Discover this hidden gem and you'll keep coming back without a doubt!
