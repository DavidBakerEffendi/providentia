I came here with my husband and pre-teen boys after hearing wonderful reviews from neighbors.  The pizza was delicious!  Unfortunately, I can't give more than three stars because I found the wait staff to be weak and their handling of guests to be seated to be inefficient.  They should have 1 person assigned to greeting customers and keeping a wait list.  My waiter took our pizza order (2 different pies with 2 toppings on each) without writing it down and inevitably, it came back incorrect.  When we told him about the mistake, he first disagreed that he got the order wrong. He left us to get our drinks, which should have been brought out at least 5 minutes before the pizza arrived, and when he returned, apologized for the mix up and offered to bring the correct toppings to the table so we can put them on the pizza ourselves.  We plan on going back again in the hopes we just caught them on a bad night.  My recommendation is to go there during the day for lunch or on a weeknight for dinner. Stay away from this place on a Friday or Saturday night.
