First, the food. The food was pretty good. The pan seared gnocchi were delicious and the cheese board was really good as well. Everyone else in my party liked their dishes and it was presented very nicely. The portions were pretty small, however. I am usually for small portions, but the prices weren't small to go along with it. $30 for a main, something you'd pay less than $15 for at a place like Barbuzzo for something equal in size. Second, the atmosphere. I came here for a special occasion dinner after making reservations two weeks in advance, requesting that we sit out in the garden. We arrived on time and were told that we'd have to wait two hours if we wanted a garden seat and were placed by the bar inside instead. This was really disappointing as it was such a beautiful night. If I would have known I would have made reservations someplace else that would have been more accomodating. The inside was nice, but loud (we had to shout across the table). I probably won't go back.
