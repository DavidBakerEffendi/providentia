I tried ordering food from this establishment on two different occasions,I will not attempt a third time.The first time i ordered delivery and they took over an hour an a half.I canceled.The second time I ordered ,I notified them that I would pick it up.They told me 15 minutes.I arrived 25 minutes later due to traffic,and they said it would be right out.I waited 15 minutes,and still no food.I walked out.
