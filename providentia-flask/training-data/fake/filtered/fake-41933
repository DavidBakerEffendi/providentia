On Friday night, I went with 5 friends to Xochitl for dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday, and 4 of the 6 of us ended up with the worst case of food poisoning ever! Â The nausea, vomiting, chills, & fever were nasty... And we were all out of comission for about 3 days. All of us had the "special" entree of the night -- the bronzino fish. It tasted great going down, but boy did we all regret it by Saturday night. I'm sorry to say we won't be back to Xochitl again...
