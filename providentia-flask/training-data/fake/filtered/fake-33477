This place is great! The open windows make it feel so open and airy. Unlike some of the other reviews on here that say the staff is rude and not very friendly. I had a completely different experience...the bartender that was helping me (she helped me on two different occasions) is extremely knowledgeable and friendly. I was in on a Friday afternoon, I was looking on the menu for a beer that I had once before there, I couldn't remember the name of it for the life of me. This bartender gave different samples of the pilsners they offer to jog my memory and none of them were the one I wanted. Then she told me that I was looking for Jever and they were out of it that weekend. So, I settled for one of the other pilsners they have. The following Friday I Â came in, had the same bartender. I was again looking at the menu and she said to me 'You were looking for Jever last Friday, right? We have it on draft now if you want one!' To me, that is the definition of customer service, I was blown away that she remembered what I was drinking and it was only the second time I saw her. I can't speak about the rest of the bartenders, but you can be assured that from now on when I go in to Spritzenhaus I will be looking for the girl bartender with glasses, she is incredibly friendly and has an impressive memory!
