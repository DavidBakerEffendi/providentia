I had the half bacon burger and I love coming here.  The atmosphere is welcoming and intimate.  I always have a great time. This time our server was Jason and he provided service that was exceptional. He made us very aware of all of the specials and new menu changes. He was also very personable and made me want to come back every week. If you're looking for a burger place definitely come to prime 16 in orange/milford :)
