The specialty pizzas are quite delicious; Here I was also introduced to Calamari New York Syle which everyone should try at least once. Â They are an awesome place, it seems like they switched owners or cooks or something in the last year, because all of the sauces for the pasta dishes it has very good different taste, Plus, they deliver. I've had almost all of their pasta dishes, the subs are great, the salads are amazing, and their pizza is pretty good actually. Lots of choices and great veggie options.
