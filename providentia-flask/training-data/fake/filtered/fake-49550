Disappointing.  Based on the yelp reviews, my business partner and I decided to try ZJC for lunch.  While he found the fatboy rolls to be tasty, the rest of the meal was not good.  The vegetable tempura was hard, glossy and oily.  What this means is that not only was it clear that the tempura batter was not prepared the right way but it was fried in very old oil.  The sushi rice did not have the nice blend of vinegar, etc.   The way the fish was cut for the sushi was odd and unappetizing.  The service was... well, non-existent.  At one point, when we could actually get a waitress, she came over with her mouth full, asking us what we needed.  We had to get up twice to ask for various things.  I read the reviews;  "best quality sushi... around the Livingston Area"  and "best sushi in town."  Well, that may be, but I would recommend busting out of the Livingston area then if this is the option.  Montclair's Daikichi has far better quality food and the prices are comparable.
