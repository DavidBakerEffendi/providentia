Overpriced and underwhelming. 25 years ago this was wonderful--perhaps the first authentic Parisian brasserie in New York.  Dropped in on a rainy Friday night.  Amazingly there were seats available (uh-oh!).  Very nicely greeted--uniformly friendly front of house staff (except for the bussers, who have the mien of escaped convicts, which perhaps they are).  The second star is for the FOH.  Still a lovely space, though the tables are very close, the volume is very loud, and the conversation from the two overprivileged young men at the next table so intrusive, vapid and foul-mouthed it made one long for Quentin Tarantino. The food is at best pedestrian--I'm being charitable.  Utterly unconvincing Frisee Salad, with limp lardons. Special fish (fluke) of the day, tiny, overcooked with two sauces vying for most uninteresting.  Steak tartare, dreadful, tasteless--the entire effort of the kitchen seemed to have been deployed in bringing what tasted like frozen hamburger meat  to room temperature and plopping it on a plate without exhausting themselves by adding, for example, salt or pepper..  And all shockingly overpriced. My local corner bistro in Brooklyn does all of this twice as well at half the price.  Another reason for moving to Brooklyn!
