If you are hungry, go someplace else.  The small plates are just that, small plates and the large plates are just that, large plates.  Where is the food?  The cost of dinner for two could have easily paid for dinner for four elsewhere.  Where, oh where, in Philly can you get great seafood on full plates a great price?
