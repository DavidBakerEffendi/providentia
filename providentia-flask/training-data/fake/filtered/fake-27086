Wonderful. Affordable, very large portions. Always had the tomato pie at the Italian American festival at mercer county park every year. Just love the flavor and crispy crust. Â  Tonight we had the pie of coarse, app of calamari and a couple pasta entrees ( vodka rig and tort Alfredo) and a meatball sandwich. All were fantastic and packed with flavor! Our waitress was awesome. Attentive, kind and always smiling! Bringing so much food home it's crazy. Be back next week, no doubt.
