There is a fairly wide variety of international places to eat in the New Haven area.  Many choices, lots of competition.  All this is good. We have eaten Turkish food in other international cities (e.g. NYC).  We have some basis for comparison. 1. Pleasant staff and service 2. Mostly authentic setting - environs and music 3. A complete dinner fixed price is available in addition to ala carte 4. Easy on and off the freeway. 5. Food is tasty Just a bit pricey on the a la carte orders. Not inexpensive. Otherwise, worth the stop.  We recommend it. Just our opinion, no better or more correct than anyone else opinion. Visit and form your own.
