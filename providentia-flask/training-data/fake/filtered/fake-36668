I specifically signed up for yelp just to review this place because of how awful the customer service is.  I am re-reviewing it , because I've been there a couple more times, and not only is the customer service as bad as its always been, but now they add an automatic 20% gratuity to EVERYBODY's bill.  The staff is rude, thinks they're better than anybody that walks in there, and makes any patron feel like crap.  The staff doesn't even deserve a dime, let alone a 20% tip.   Sad thing is, based on food alone, they'd get a 5, but their horrible excuse of customer service gives them the obligatory one star (yeah, i wanted to give zero stars, but that wasn't an option). Advice for the owner, if u want to keep ur business, keep ur staff in line
