I live a couple blocks away and ordered once about a year ago.  Bad decision.  Taste like Ellios frozen pizza.  Undercooked, no flavor in the sauce, cheese looks like it may not even be real, just like Ellios.  I read reviews about the place in the Star Ledger that claimed it was good but they must have been bribed because it is really not good, at all.  Makes one think chain pizza is good after trying Pizzaland.
