Manjares, it is an ok place. I guess I was more dissappointed when me and my husband found a hair in our dish. I did not say anything because I went with other people and did not want to ruin their night. Â The tapa seafood they served us was not that good and the smell was very strong which it is a sign right there that the fish is not fresh at all. The service is ok. The dishes are not spanish from Spain as she claims, the owner is from some place in the Caribbean and have a little or not knowledge of spanish dishes. There is a place in New Haven, Ct to go if you want to get real spanish food and the owner is originally from Galicia, Spain. He owns two restaurans and he really knows what he is doing.
