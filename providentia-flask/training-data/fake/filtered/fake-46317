I hate the fact that they don't take any reservation. However, the taste of ramen here is great. Also, any food I ordered was really good. I even liked very simple cucumber dish. (that is over priced in my opinion but maybe they use authentic cucumber which is more expensive here.) Â I really hope they take a reservation or open 2nd restaurant) but still, I like this place, and go back to this place.
