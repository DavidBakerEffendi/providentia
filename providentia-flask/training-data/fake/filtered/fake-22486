Maggie's is a great place. It is cozy and clean. Every time we go there we have a delicious meal. You can tell the food is fresh and quality, we had the burgers last time and they were the best we ever had. Â We go there mostly on weekends and it is busy. The service is great and try their thin crust pizza it is the best around. It is good to see a family owned business in our area that does well and makes you feel at home.
