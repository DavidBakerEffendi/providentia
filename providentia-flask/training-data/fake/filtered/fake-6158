We've been there a number of times.  This review is not based on one visit. The food is only average.  Nothing to brag about.  It is not authentic Italian, but a contrived variation.  No alcohol served.  No liquor license.  It is located on the first floor, and only the first floor, in a very tiny converted row home on a poorly lit, crime ridden corner in South Philly.  The tables are much too close which will cause you to feel as if you are in a sardine can.  It is very claustrophopic.  It gets hot and noisey.  There is only one fire exit on the side street.  The staff is nice, however they tend to rush you out so they can get the next customer seated since this place is so tiny.  Considering that you may leave after dinner and find an expensive parking ticket on your car, or some rude drivers double parked next to you (an/or in front of you, and/or behind your vehicle) while you are in L'Angolo, and as a result you can't leave South Philly for hours because your vehicle is unable to exit the street parking until the person(s) who double-parked next to you may (or may not) come out and move their vehicle, it is just not worth it.  It's disgusting when you come out of the restaurant and see roaches and rodents crawling around under your feet.  Overall - nightmarish.  You have been advised.
