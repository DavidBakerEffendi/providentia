I Â  didn't like the place at all. I found the food to be very greasy. I ordered the coconut shrimp in lime sauce.. What I received was what appeared to be broiled shrimp on a bed of greens (very greasy) and this very small white liquid to dip my shrimp in..when I said I had ordered coconut shrimp they told me ,yes that's coconut shrimp,but where is the coconut I asked? With this very odd look I was told the coconut is in with the lime sauce (the dipping liquid) which was about 1 tablespoon of what tasted like warm condensed milk.. That's not coconut shrimp with lime sauce,that's broiled shrimp with coconut and lime sauce..
