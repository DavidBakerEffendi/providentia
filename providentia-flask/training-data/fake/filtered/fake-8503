The first time I came here to spend the night, had about 20 drinks... NOT A SINGLE BUY BACK... The bill came to about $160, and they DID NOT even give us ONE BEER for free... Stupid me decided to give it another chance. This time we sat at the bar instead of a table... NO DIFFERENCE... 7 drinks and 2 meals later, and not a single buy back.. I do not ask to be given anything... but I'd rather spend the night at Applebees where I know I would get better service and respect! SO if you want to spend every dime you have.. give it a shot!
