Hands down the best pancakes I have had so far. I had the spanish egg dish and my friend got the buttermilk sandwich. Both were very tasty, my favorite is the buttermilk sandwich though.. just delicious! Service is great as well. We were told it would take them 1.5hr to seat us but we received a text to notify that they had a table ready for us from the restaurant under 50 minutes. Awesome place!
