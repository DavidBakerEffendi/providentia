Went there for dinner and....AMAZING! First off the olives they give you with the bread basket are definitely the best olives I've ever had. I had the roasted half chicken which was again AMAZING. Very crisp, tender and full of flavor. During the meal a bus boy accidentally knocked a glass of water over and they were so apologetic the whole time (even though it wasn't a big deal), and at the end of the meal they gave us a complimentary dessert because of it. So the service with that and the whole meal was great! FYI it's cash only, but they have ATM's inside.
