- The food is very good here...not fingerlickin' can I have some more please...but mixed with the cultural atmosphere it all combines comfortable for a nice time - Live latin jazz is quite enjoyable -Even if you're not a cigar smoker the live cigar rolling is a nice touch -The place is small, but welcome to NYC, if you're not comfortable with small, you won't be able to enjoy your experience here - I hear there is a back dining room but haven't had the chance to see that yet - Don't plan on bringing a large group of friends here but it is perfect for a small group of four and ideal dining for two
