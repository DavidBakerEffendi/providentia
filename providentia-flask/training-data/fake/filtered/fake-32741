Worst place I have ever been to. Not only was it over priced for what we got but it wasn't that good. Two waitresses waiting on 3 tables and we have to wait at least 15 minutes for a drink. Some of the butter that came with the bread was used and we were charged for 3 dinners instead of 2. We were there on a Wednesday evening about 5pm and the cook wasn't ready with the specials yet he was still working on the dinner menu. We ordered the steak and ribs which was tasteless. Horrible, horrible place!
