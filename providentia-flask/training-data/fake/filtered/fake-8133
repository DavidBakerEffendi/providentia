These guys really need to work on their customer service.  I was recommended this place by one of my coworkers and went with a friend last Friday evening 03.08.13. Everything was going well within the first hour or so of our visit.  I thought that the shrimp Quesadilla was great and the Sangria was good also.  After paying over $120 for food and drinks, the Manager on duty told us that someone had a 9:30 reservation and that we have to move to the bar.  We kindly removed ourselves from our table and proceeded to the bar.  While my friend and I sat there, we became very disappointed with the way we were treated.  This was our first experience  here and we had spent a decent amount of money.  The Manager did not even offer us anything for the inconvenience.  I spoke with him about it and he denied admitting that he told us to move to the bar.  He quickly disregarded us and went back to performing his "managerial" duties. I will never go back.  I work for Marriott and my job is to recommend customers various restaurants and attractions.  This place will definitely not be on my list.
