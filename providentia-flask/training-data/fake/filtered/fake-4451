I'm an absolute fanatic when it comes to this type of cuisine. If you want something authentic, then you should definitely go here. The meats are so tender and delicate. The lemonade tastes homemade and fresh. My waitress was very friendly, so that's always a plus. It's a lot of food so if you're the type of person who loves to indulge, go here ;) The falafel is heavenly :D The Sahara Fries are also a necessary treat to have. The only thing that I dislike about this place is that damn door...it's so heavy and kinda hard to open! Other than that, this place is wonderful.
