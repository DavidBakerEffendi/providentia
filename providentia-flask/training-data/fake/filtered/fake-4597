Food was awesome but service esp. Tge hostess sucked! After having sent $$$ on a group party, the hostess was very rude and asked us to leave our table. There were no people waiting, many other tables were vacant and we had barely finished our meal. We got up and left and they were extremely unprofessional. Food was amazing but will not recommend the place!
