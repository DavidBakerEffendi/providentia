After reading many of these reviews I decided to take my husband here for his birthday tonight.   We both did the pre fixe, which is generally a good deal.  I made the mistake of getting a special app., which was brioche with barrata cheese and caviare.  It was ok, but I would be being generous to say it was the size of a quarter.  I could have eaten it easily in one bite.  My husband got the foi gras, which I thought was good.  He felt it was too sweet.  For our pasta dish I got the squid ink pasta based on other reviews.  It didn't disappoint. Very good and my favorite dish of the night.  My husband got the risotto, which was undercooked.  I expected way more.  We ended up sharing my dish and let the staff take away the risotto essentially untouched.  We got the veal and halibut as entrees.  Both were good.  I thought the portion sizes were generous, especially the veal.  The ambiance was nice.  Although most of what we ordered was good, I wasn't blown away by anything.  Not sure I would go back.
