Have been waiting with a grumbling stomach for the past year for Juliana's to open.  I went last night for opening night and have to say that the pizza was great.  The crust was light, fluffy and salty with just the right amount of char.  The sauce was bright and sweet and the cheese was melted to perfection and didn't fall off the pizza in chunks like Grimaldi's does.  As someone who lives in DUMBO and has waited out the line at Grimaldi's only to be disappointed by the soggy burnt pizza and rude staff, I couldn't be more excited to have Patsy back in the neighborhood in front of the oven where he belongs!
