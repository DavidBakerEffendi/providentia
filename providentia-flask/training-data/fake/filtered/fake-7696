I was pleasantly surprised with the friendly service and terrific food at a reasonable price.  I found this local favorite through Yelp and can say that all of the reviews are accurate.   My server suggested that I pick the The Joey and I was very satisfied and found the unique flavors to be outstanding.  Great job Zavino.  I topped off the pizza with a Lancaster PA local beer.
