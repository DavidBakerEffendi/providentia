I have been eating at Joses for at least 15 years and have hade very little to complain about until today. Went for lunch - entrees were dumped on the table before we had even finish our appetizer. Burger and fries were cold by the time we finished the apps and BTW the burger was over cooked and I forgot to mention that there was a dead bug in the soda. When I spoke to the manager he sort of dismiised me and took the soda off the check. I don't thiink he understood it wasn't about the 2 bucks for the soda
