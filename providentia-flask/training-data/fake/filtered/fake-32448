Recently remodelled and a new chef. They call the new concept "polished Casual" and it is. Very very tasty food. Onion soup to die for. Great burgers and beers. I had a Mahi Mahi special. Scrumptuous. Best dining and value in Hanover. Reserve a table or expect to wait on weekends for more than 30-45 mins. Smooth operating place with friendly but not pushy staff.
