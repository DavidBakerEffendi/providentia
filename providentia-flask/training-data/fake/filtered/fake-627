This restaurant is tarnishing the name of jamaican jerk chicken restaurants and its about time someone speaks about it. my wife brought me a plate and th food tastes like brown carribean suger, what happened to the jamaican jerk spice? are the cooks really from jamaica or from china cuz from what i know chinese put alot of sugar in their food. if i needed a sugery food i would have ate cereals at home. ya need to do ya home work and give the people their moneys wealth. a word to a wise is enough.
