The pizza was not good at all. It was just about burnt and had no real flavor to it. Plus the waitress was rude. Acutally told me at one point that "I am just to busy" when I asked her for change when I handed her my money. And do not ever ask for a receipt you will be waiting FOREVER!!! I finally went to ask the manager/owner (whoever she was) and received an attitude. Needless to say I got back late to my seminar today. Then they even included the tip in the bill. I was a waitress once and we never did that, unless it was a large party. I thought it was just tasteless.
