Corrections to original review: Szechuan not Zechuan. Also, owners name is Huang not Yuan. All else in first review remains the same. It stands out as a bright beacon as one of the cleanest, friendliest and by far the best Asian restaurant I have ever dined in from Maine to California and in my many travels worldwide. Once again: be sure to say hi to my friends Sally and Huang, Shu Chinese Szechuan Â Restaurant owners and tell them GG sent you. With Love, George Gerard Egan - GG
