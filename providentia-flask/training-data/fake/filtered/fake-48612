I went there for dinner and wanted to order Chicken parm. They wanted $20 dollars for the dinner! I ordered a sandwich instead because it was the only reasonably priced thing on the menu. It was ok, but it felt like the waitress was giving me the bum's rush for ordering something cheap. Did not enjoy myself at all.
