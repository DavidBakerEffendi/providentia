The decor and service were excellent. So the abysmal food was doubly disappointing.  I actually do not think I have ever had such a bad meal. The bread was tough, the butters too hard. The gnocchi were flavorless, mushy, and hard on one side, with no sauce.  The risotto was crunchy.  The ribs were actually inedible.  The best thing on my plate were the plain fingerling potatoes. The creme brulee was about 1/4" deep--the brulee was thicker than the creme.  And all of that cost me $29.   Literally, a McDonald's dinner would have tasted better and I don't eat at Mickey Dee's.
