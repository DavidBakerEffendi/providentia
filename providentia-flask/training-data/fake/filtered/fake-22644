Went here for Easter Sunday Brunch. Service was terrible. They were out of coffee. There was a huge wait for the orders of 2 of the 3 people at the table. We were ready to leave before the food arrived. The waitress, seeing that we were anxious (after waiting roughly 40 minutes for a mozzarella sandwich and an omelette) asked if we were in a hurry. And by the way, the place wasn't even that crowded when we were there. Only after we left did we realize they didn't even bring us some of the things we orders and they charged us for them. Not a good experience.
