Really like this place. Came here with a big group around 7:30 and they were super accommodating in giving us a place to sit as we waited for rest of group to arrive. Service was wonderful. Food was good- better than bar food but nothing special. Music was fun- like fist pumping dance music at happy hour but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Overall, very clean fun place for big group. Great service and atmosphere.
