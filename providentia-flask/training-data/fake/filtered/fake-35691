Took my parents out for treat.  Went to  the restaurant because I drive by on way to a school but never stopped in.  The food was great and the portions were big.  My Dad who is not into Mexican food, he ate everything and would like to go again.  Tasty meals and  good price, looking forward to spring and the outdoor deck.
