Really good, more of a local place then the tourist traps like Pat's n Geno's. i was in Philly for 3 months and had a hard time getting to this place when it was open. finally for lunch during the work week i found them open. I had heard so much about it i had to try and it didn't disappoint. the roast pork was awesome. cheese steaks weren't bad either. seating is outside.
