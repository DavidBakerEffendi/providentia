Meal just opened up near our home, so we thought we'd swing by one night and check it out.   We are so glad we did!  We had AMAZING steaks, other-worldly mashed potatoes, delicious truffle chips (and I don't even like mushrooms!) and heavenly creme brûlée.  They do familiar dishes wonderfully, and they have come up with some unusual but delicious flavor combinations too.  The ambiance is great - sophisticated and modern, yet relaxed.  Everyone was friendly, and the food was excellent.  I will definitely be going there again.
