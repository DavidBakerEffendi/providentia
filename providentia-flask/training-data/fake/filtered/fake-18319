Pretty bad experience here. The place is packed and noisy. Service is incredibly slow taking around 10-15 minutes to get a drink. There are no dedicated servers that check in on the orders. For anyone who actually has sprang more than $25 on a steak ... THE MEAT IS HORRIFIC. You are offered bad tenderloin, chuck steak, trnderloin, short ribs and a skirt steak. All except the skirt came out medium-well to plain dry. Also, when patrons are spending $550 a table (8 people) its in poor taste to charge $6.99 for a bowl of pudding for a birthday. Oh and don't forget that you are CONSTANTLY harassed by people trying to sell you flowers, and homeless pan handlers oustide. I've been to at least 6 rodezios including living in Brazil. Horrible. Bathrooms also unclean- doesn't help patrons are vomitting post meal.
