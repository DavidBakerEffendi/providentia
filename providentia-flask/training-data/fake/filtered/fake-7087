margon is the place to grab lunch if you're really hungry and feel like being a fatty ... i've tried just about everything and nothing really disappoints or stands out but it's really good. the entree selection is overwhelming (even though it's all right in front of your face) and even after you pick one, the choice of two sides is just as daunting. if you get the plantains or rice & beans, you will have enough food to sustain a large family. the sandwiches also hit the spot. tina's is better but come to margon if you're feeling rustic.
