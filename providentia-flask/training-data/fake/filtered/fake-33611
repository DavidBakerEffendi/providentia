I must say, the food was okay for me but the guys/gals were very courteous and welcoming. I love the environment. The music was extremely loud though. We ordered the special 'momo' and the 'thali'. They were ok. The lollipop chicken tasted awesome. Hope they tone down the music. I'd love to go back again. I found it a bit expensive than the other Tibetan/Nepal,i restaurant in New York City. I give 4 stars.
