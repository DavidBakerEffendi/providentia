I looked all over and do not see my previous review anywhere. I went to Tashan Friday with 2 friends and we again had an amazing time. I had, a new dish, the red snapper, which was very nicely prepared and not overly salty. We sat with Mia at the bar, we did not have a reservation and it was packed! My friends ordered the butter chicken, which seems to have gain some spice and flavor since my last visit. Only complaint is that I could not hear the music, but that was only due to the roar of the restaurant.
