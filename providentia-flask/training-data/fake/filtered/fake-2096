Had two of the best lunches I've had in months at this place.  The first time I had the potato/mushroom sandwich with the Kale salad and the second time I had the calamari salad.  Everything was delicious and I am now a convert to raw kale and I don't usually love mushrooms but that sandwich is amazing.  Not only is everyone there super nice but I really love the fact that their market is so supportive of local producers and that I was able to leave there with some awesome honeycomb chocolate candies. Can't wait til they start serving brunch!
