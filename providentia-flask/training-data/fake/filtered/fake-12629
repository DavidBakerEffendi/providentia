My husband and I tried this place out last night. Our server was very sweet and helpful. We ordered the octopus which was good but a tiny portion. I got the NY Strip and it was delicious. He ordered the butchers cut and it was good but very tough. Our side was charred cauliflower. It was very bad, greasy and chunks of charcoal in it. We took a bite each and didn't bother eating any more of  it. We told our server and she was very apologetic about it and took it away. We were surprised when the bill arrived that they charged us for the cauliflower.  After pointing out to our server that we were charged for something we did not like or eat she sent over the manager. Not only was he unbelievably rude, he argued with my husband. He insisted, we were wrong, that is the way it is supposed to be served and we clearly did not know what charred meant. We are not new to eating charred food. I understand something being charred and charred does not mean serving chunks of charcoal with the greasy food. Regardless of the charcoal pieces the flavors were just awful. So if serving  a crappy side dish is how it is supposed to be, then yes he is right and we were wrong. The food isn't good enough to treat customers like it is a privilege to dine there. We will not be going back because of this rude little manager.
