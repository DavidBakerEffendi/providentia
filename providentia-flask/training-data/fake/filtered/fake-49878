I've been coming down here since I was a kid with my mom, who used to go down with her dad who worked down on the docks back in the day. Â Thank God that nothing has changed. If you make the trip (which you absolutely should, and as soon as you can), there's only one sandwich you should bother yourself with: the potato and egg. It's pretty much the only one I ever order, and it is without question a pilgrimage-worthy sandwich. Ask for it with just a bit of ketchup for sweetness.
