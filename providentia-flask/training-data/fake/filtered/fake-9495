I have to agree with Autumn E. Green Line = fantastic coffee, best cinnamon raisin bagel I've ever had, and adorable local charm. But, embarrassing and unpleasant service, at least on the part of one particular barista, who I fear is the same person Autumn E. complained of. My husband and I live close by to this Green Line PV, and we visit the one on Baltimore Ave in West Philly often. However, our numerous experiences with Miss Unpleasant at Green Line PV now start conversations about whether to head over for some coffee and reading - "I wonder if SHE'LL be working." What a sad day for our favorite cafe. We've taken to drinking our coffee at home these days. We've had a few recent mishaps with Miss Thing, including her slamming the tip jar furiously when my husband went to pour cream in his coffee before tipping her on our, gasp, $3.50 purchase and complaining loudly that "she's got to eat." This past week, she became irritated with me when I showed up when the cafe opened to pick up some treats for guests who were in for the marathon. Green Line PV, you're missed. Such a shame...
