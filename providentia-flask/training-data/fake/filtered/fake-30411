I would really like to be able to review the food at The Kitchen Table, but, unfortunately, I am not. This is because the day of my reservation with them, I was called by The Kitchen Table and told that they had conveniently "forgot" that they had a party of 60 coming in that night and thus I would not be able to eat there that night. Being a Saturday night, finding alternate reservation at other restaurants within a few hours was not an easy task. No compensation was offered for ruining my evening plans. The apology was not heartfelt. And it seemed unlikely that the restaurant could just have forgotten that it would be completely closed on a Saturday night. If this reflects how the restaurant ordinarily treats its customers, better go somewhere else.
