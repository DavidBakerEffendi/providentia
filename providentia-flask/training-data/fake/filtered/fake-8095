Having started my drive looking for a good place to eat with my husband.  We drove down Silas Deane Hwy and found this place.  After walking through the door I was surprise how nice the decor was.  After pursing the menu, I went with the green curry.  The flavor had so much depth beyond just "spicy". My husband got the Pad Se Ew and was literally scraping his plate.   The space is very pretty and nice.  You don't get that "wow, we're stepping into a total dive" feeling.   Honestly, we weren't expecting much from this restaurant, as it has recently opened no more then 3 months ago.  But it far exceeded our expectations.  We only wanted and expected decent, standard Thai, but this was exceptionally delicious Thai, better than most of the other places we've been to around town.   All in all, this is a winner!!
