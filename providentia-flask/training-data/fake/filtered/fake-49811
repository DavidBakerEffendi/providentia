I used to think shabu shabu could only be done right on the west coast. Turns out I was wrong! Shabu Tatsu was every bit as good as the shabu shabu I had in LA. It is a small place, but my friend and I went on a Sunday evening and did not have to wait. Maybe we just got lucky? The premium rib eye is amazing!!! Since shabu shabu is REALLY expensive where I live (plus it requires a reservation at least 24 hours in advance), I found the prices to be very reasonable, especially considering that veggies, sauce, noodles, rice, post-meal tea, and ice cream were inclusive. Maybe the portions did not seem small because there were only two of us, but we both left totally full and satisfied. We took our time and ate slowly. We compared how wondrously relaxed we were to getting a massage, haha! We never felt rushed by the staff, but again, it may have been an atypically slow night. I wouldn't call it (or any shabu shabu restaurant) kid friendly, what with a huge pot of boiling water in the middle of the table. Accident waiting to happen, if you ask me! If and when I am in New York again, I will be craving Shabu Tatsu, that's for sure.
