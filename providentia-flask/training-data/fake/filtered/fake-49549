The service is atrocious.  The wait staff is barely comprehensible and it took more than 20 minutes at 5:00 pm on a Saturday evening to get just a shumai appetizer and salad.   I had to practically beg to get the rest of our order.  As you peek behind and to the left of the sushi bar, you see a shelf where the plates with filled sushi orders rest until the wait staff gets around to delivering the food to your table.  I ordered a ginger ale and the glass was 3/4 filled.  When I asked why I could not get a filled glass, the server looked at me strangely, not quite understanding what I was saying.  It was easier to forget it than try to explain.  I also asked for some extra spicy mayo and was stunned to find a $.25 extra charge on a $60 check for two.   Although the sushi is above average and they have an interesting selection of specialty rolls, the prices are generally high.  With that said, don't get me started on the cleanliness of the place.  Suffice to say, we won't be going back.
