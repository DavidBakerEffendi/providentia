I looked up here, and have so many expectations for this "Brand new genuine Hong Kong noodle shop" . When I walked in the shop, I feel like I came back HK (since i am from HK) and the noodle soup I ordered was fish ball with beef stew two combination, both were great, soup is great, but the noodle itself, it is just ok. The egg noodle I had has strong smell which I need to use some spicy hot sauce to cover it, btw, thier spicy hot sauce is the best in Chinatown!!! Smell so good, and after you got the bill, you will pretty make your home sick back to NYC beacuse it cost me 8 dollars for that which I can get like 3 bowls in HK!! Overall is worth to try!
