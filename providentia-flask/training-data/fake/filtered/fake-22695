This a review for brunch: First, I love bourbon, and I've been here numerous times to drink some scotch/bourbon in the beautiful bar, but I've only eaten the brunch menu. Second, the bar truly is beautiful.  There is a nice big window looking out/in to the street, and the bar looks extremely inviting from the outside and is nice and cozy from the inside. The brunch is a knock you on your butt sort of meal.  I love the eggs benedict on the southern biscuit with the bacon gravy.  Add a side of bacon, some bacon grits, and a bourbon bloody mary or two and your will likely sleep the rest of the afternoon. I look forward to trying the dinner menu here. The staff is wonderfully friendly and knowledgable about the menu.
