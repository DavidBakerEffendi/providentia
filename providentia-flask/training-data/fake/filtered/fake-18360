My sister and I each drove about 50 minutes to come and try the macarons here. Why 50 minutes you ask? Well, we're both huge Francophiles and there aren't many French bakeries near us...so why not? We weren't disappointed. Great food (both Vegetarian and Montagnard paninis were excellent) and the desserts were even better (we bought the 12-pack of macarons and hot chocolate--all mouth wateringly delightful). Also, the sweet lady there was very patient with us when we had trouble deciding what to eat--even throwing in two delicious chocolate croissants for free at closing. Go, go, go!
