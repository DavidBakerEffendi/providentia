Bizzarre! My husband and I were the ONLY people there on a Saturday night in September, right when Yale and the other schools were getting started. We made (useless) 8:30pm reservations and were shocked that we were the only customers. We heard continual noise from the kitchen, like everyone was cleaning up to go home. They do have a wine list, but no drink menu. There was no visible bar, but they did have the capacity to make mixed drinks. I suspect they share a liquor license/bar with Gotham nightclub. The breads were OK, with interesting butter accompanying them. We started with the black garlic and crostini. be forewarned- black garlic doesn't taste like garlic! It has a sweet taste to it, so it didn't satisfy our garlic tooth. The crostini arrived burned! being that we were the only people there, how could they burn the bread for our first ordered item? I had the grilled chicken with lemon garlic sauce and spinach. The vegetables and roasted were good, but had no lemon or garlic flavor! My husband had the skirt steak, which came with the same vegetables that I had. Nothing to write home about, and a bit oily. One last thing, at about 9pm, Techno music from Gotham started. It didn't make for a good eating atmosphere a all. Even worse was when employees opened some side door, the music got really loud, enough to pause our conversations. What a bizarre experience! What a weird location for a restaurant! Why does Gotham blare techno starting so early if they know their attached restaurant is open? We may never know!
