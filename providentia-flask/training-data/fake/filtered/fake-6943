I tried this new Franklin Steakhouse for the second time last weekend. The first time it was ok, but I chalked the issues up to it being new. This weekend we sat at the bar for a quick dinner. I ordered what I thought was a BBQ chicken salad, it came with no chicken and no BBQ sauce. When I told the bartender (after waiting for a good 10 minutes for her to pay attention to us) she said sorry and said she would get the chicken. It came out plain (no BBQ) and cold, so gross. I didn't eat the salad. Then at the end was charged for the extra chicken that I didn't eat! We sat AT THE BAR with empty glasses for a good half hour, how can you not get a drink at the bar? A lot of kinks to work out, which none of the "managers" walking around seemed to care about. I won't be back anytime soon!
