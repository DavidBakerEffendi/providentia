Among the never-ending coffee shops and cafes in NYC, Alt sticks out in every way as the best. The coffee is delicious and worth every penny, the baristas are friendly and remember your name and preferences, the deserts are unique and there are a variety of gluten-free options, and the ambiance is what you dream a unique, artsy, boutique cafe would provide. This is hands down my favorite spot in NYC for coffee, and a gem worth making a daily trip for. For out-of-towners, buy the beans - I ship them to my parents regularly as they are now hooked and spoiled by it.
