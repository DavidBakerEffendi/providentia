This place looks amazing when you walk in.  We came in without a reservation and they said it would likely be around 30 minutes.  After an hour (At 10:30 PM) we asked if a table would be ready anytime soon.  3 managers or hosts stood around saying they would "discuss" if they could get a table for us.  There were 4-5 booths available, and when we asked them about them they said that they wanted to make sure the kitchen could handle an additional table.  What??  They asked us to wait more and they would get back to us.  The tall manager with curly grey hair stood there with his hands in his pockets for 10 minutes making no move to seat us.  After asking him 3 times if they were going to seat us at one of the 4 tables they were staring at they again just said they were "working it out."  Unreal.  They just refused to seat us when they clearly knew we were waiting and there were tables available.  Is this really a Bobby Flay restaurant?  Is it really a NY restaurant?  This guy (The manager) is not qualified to run a professional establishment.  I am sure the place is great, but they have no idea what they are doing in terms of service...
