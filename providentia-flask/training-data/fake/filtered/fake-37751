Extremely disappointed.  Chicken tandoori was nothing more than broiled chicken with a commercial tandoori sauce basted on at the end.  Not authentic - not even tasty.  Saag lamb consisted of either frozen or canned cream spinach and a few tiny chunks of tough lamb.  Ugh.  Also overpriced for what they give you.  Will not be back.
