I can't comment on the food or the space as I have found it virtually impossible to make a reservation. I called in January and was informed by a disdainful young person that I should try back in a few months. I called again today, April 1st, and once again reached a thouroughly indifferent person that suggested I should probably place my reservation online. I attempted to do this, requesting a reservation for a date two weeks from now, including, in a businesslike manner, all the pertinent information. I promptly received a reply requesting all the information I had just proffered.I re-sent the information and received the same stock response. Ditto twice. Given the hard economic times I guess I'm pleased that these folks are doing so well that common courtesy and even the most basic level of respect for prospective customers can be abandondened. Luckily, we live in a city with thousands of venues offering fine food at less than bargain prices with a charming ambiance. I would rather get a dirty water dog from my amiable, hard working guy on my corner than beg fpr a reservation with these narcissiscistic asses.
