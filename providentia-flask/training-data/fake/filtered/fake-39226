Our experience here was mixed. We came with our family for a special celebration. They have valet parking. Our 1st let down. The attendant stood and looked at my daughter and I and never moved to open or close a car door. The same happened as we were leaving. He stood and looked at us until we opened our own doors. Some of the food was inspired and fabulous. some was very good. Some was misleading. 'Scallops' meant 1 scallop. 'Heirloom tomatoes' meant 1/3 heirloom and 2/3s Jersey tomatoes. The service, for us was a bit too leisurely.
