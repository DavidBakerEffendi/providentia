I go to Jose Tejas at least once or twice a month with my husband and two daughters. They serve great food at great prices. They start you off with a big basket of chips and fresh salsa. I love the pastelitos which is a small patty stuffed with chicken and the mojito sauce is just delicious. Try a frozen sangria, it's really yummy. You also have to try the blacken catfish, it's a nice tender fish with a side of pico de gallo and jambalaya. Warning, this dish is spicy... Warning, if you go Friday or Saturday night expect to wait 1hour or more. People keep coming back because it's great for family and the food is delicioso.
