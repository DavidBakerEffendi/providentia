I've always loved Jamaican food, especially jerk chicken. But ever since taking a trip to Jamaica last year and tasting some of the best jerk chicken I've had in my life (3 Dives in Negril & Scotchies in Ocho Rios) , I've had a bit of an obsession with finding something that compares here in NY. This place definitely comes close, but not quite. It might just be the particular way they grill the chicken in Jamaica-- which is over a charcoal grill and using pimento wood, and lots of smoke! Not sure if they use gas since I didn't see how they cooked the food. Def, a hole in the wall. They didn't have the any shrimp or lamb dishes, so we ordered the curried vegetables and jerk chicken. Chicken was very tender, the seasoning and spiciness was just right but was too moist for me. Curried vegetables were delicious. Would like to go back and try a shrimp or fish dish. Better to take out and just eat in the park on a nice day.
