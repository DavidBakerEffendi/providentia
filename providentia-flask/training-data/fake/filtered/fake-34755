I was so disappointed in this restaurant. First of the food was subpar the start was a salad of chopped up iceberg lettuce, the apps were ok the main course some were ok others poor. This was my grandsons Baptism the cake we had brought to the restaurant was not brought out until after coffee was served. The cake was placed on the bar instead of a table to be displayed. Most people would like a chance to take pictures before the cake was cut not the case. The quote per person was $35.00 we were charged $55.00 per person the bar was suppose to be cash bar and we would play for the wine. I received a bill for the bar of $1200.00 plus gratuity the bar tender was fired because he was pocketing the money people were paying at the bar so management but the drinks on my bar bill. I asked to speak with the owner and was told that the waiter who was serving us would speak to me then telling me he was the only one at the bar taking money. Not only am I writing this review I will be contacting the better business bureau and disputing the charges with the credit card company. I am very sorry this restaurant put a damper on an otherwise beautiful day. And just so you know this is the first time a have ever felt the need to write a review.
