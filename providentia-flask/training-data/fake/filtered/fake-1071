If you want arrogant waiters and slow service, this is the perfect restaurant. I took my out-of-town boyfriend here with a good friend, after the place was recommended by my cousin.  We didn't make reservations, but put in our name around 10 o'clock PM and were told the wait would be an hour, which was fine.  Luckily, our buzzer went off after a half hour and were seated promptly thereafter.  Seeing as it was 10 PM and had already eaten, we simply went to the restaurant for dessert and drinks.  Upon introducing herself and explaining the tapas concept - how all the dishes are small and meant to be shared with the whole table - we explained to the waitress that we just wanted dessert.  She retorted that the booth in which we were sitting was "just for dinner."  At 10 PM? This was never made known to us beforehand, and my boyfriend unhappily ordered one dish off the dinner menu - lobster mac and cheese - which was disappointing and something I could probably find in the frozen section of a grocery store.  I should add here that the portions are very small.  Though the owner intends for everyone to share, the tapas themselves are not large.  So, if someone drags you here...you might want to eat before you go. Anyhow, we eventually got around to ordering dessert, which was only okay, and, yet again, not large enough to be shared with an entire table. Moral of this restaurant experience, don't come here just for dessert and don't come here expecting to leave full. Philly has much better restaurants to offer; don't take out-of-towners here. It doesn't leave lasting impressions, aside from the retro decor.
