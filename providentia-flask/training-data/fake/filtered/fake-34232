I had an opportunity to try Yusada's A La Carte sushi experience. As an avid sushi/sashimi lover, I ordered items that I had never tried before since the menu had some exotic stuff. Blue fin fatty tuna and shimaaji yellow tail were my fav sashimi's. Octopus and other sashimi that I can't remember the names of right now - were also delicious and almost melted in your mouth. Fish was super fresh and of the highest quality. Cons are it is a bit pricey but you def get what you pay for. Waiters were a bit snobby and not too friendly when you asked them what some of the fish names are. Overall, if you are sushi connoisseur... come experience Yasuda. If you only like California or cucumber rolls, don't come here..
