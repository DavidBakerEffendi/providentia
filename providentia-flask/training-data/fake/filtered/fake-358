After eating the traditional whiz and onion cheesesteak for a couple days around Philly, my friends and I wanted to get something slightly different so we headed to Tommy DiNic's. It was 1pm on a Monday and there was a decently long line but we got through it really fast. The girl taking orders and getting sodas was hustling for sure. I ordered the roasted pork with provalone and hot peppers. This might have been the best sandwich I found in Philadelphia. The meat was unbelievable, it went really well with provalone, and the peppers were blistering hot. Its really nice to order hot peppers at a sandwich shop and get an actual HOT pepper instead of cherry peppers. The rest of the market was really cool too but it would be hard for me to try anything else when I know I can get that sandwich again.
