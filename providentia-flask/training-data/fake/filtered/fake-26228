I've lived in this neighborhood for four years and have been praying for a spot like this. The food is delicious and moderately priced, the service was friendly and prompt, and the menu is simple yet inviting. The only thing I have to complain about, and I stress that it is the only drawback, is the lighting.       The design of the place was clearly done by someone who knows how to put together a restaurant. The tables are long gorgeous single cut wood and the walls are beautifully painted a textural blue/white. But the lighting is just bizarre. A sort of half dimmed florescent light that neither is dim enough to suggest romance or bright enough to enjoy the visual appeal of the food.  I sincerely hope that they fix the lighting problem as I do intend on returning to Momo.
