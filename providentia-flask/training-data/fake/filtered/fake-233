In short - Total Waste of Time. Over priced, overrated, embarrassing South Philadelphia clown show. $9 sandwich is a total ripoff, is really about a $4 sandwich. Don't waste your time, Tony Luke's or Jim's is much better. I noticed the signs requiring you order in English, interesting considering the people who took my order behaved illiterate and had a weak command of the English language themselves.
