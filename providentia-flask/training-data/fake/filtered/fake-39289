There are many dumpling-specialzed shops in Chinatown. They sell steamed, fried and frozen, I decided to take fried dumplings. I pay $4 for a half dozen. It is savory and bursting more with juice. Importantly, these dumplings crisp, It's crust is golden brown. yummm.......... I love it's seasoned filling.
