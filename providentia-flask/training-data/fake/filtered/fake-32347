ORDER THE LITTLE OMAR! This is the best dish Freddy, the King, makes, and it's not on the menu!! Shawarma, chicken, a mixture of sauces, chopped pita bread, tomatoes, onions, and sometimes even a crushed falafel.  (If he's in a good mood, you might get some kefta, too.)  It's everything but the kitchen sink, and the most important ingredient is Freddy love!  Everything I get there is amazing- definitely worth the wait. Mucho love for my habibi, The King of Falafel and Shawarma!
