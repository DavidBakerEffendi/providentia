My wife and I got married at Bubby's Brooklyn and we loved to have brunch there every so often.  Since Bubby's Brooklyn closed so unexpectedly and without any warning, my wife and I decided to take our grief to TriBeCa. We were completely disappointed.  The food was not quite up to par with Brooklyn and my eggs were poached way too hard and the portions were smaller.  We were thrown off by the lack of character with the staff and everyone seemed to very on edge.  Not a single person smiled to us when we entered, dined, used the bathroom, payed, and left.  I think five people came and tried to take my wife's plate away while we were trying to enjoy our meal.  Everyone looked very displeased to be working there.  It just wasn't like the Brooklyn location which had a very personable and engaging staff. I'm sure this Bubby's is great  in its own right since it is clearly successful and busy.  I just feel this location robbed us of where my wife and I got married.... and our favorite bruch spot. So I guess I'm trying to say farewell Bubby's, and thanks for the years we enjoyed at Brooklyn!
