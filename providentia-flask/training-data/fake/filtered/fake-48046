I used to love this place and order delivery for dinner. The food was good and they always give a lot of bread which is a big plus. Recently they have been rude on the phone and they take forever to get my food. The last two times it has taken over an hour and both times when the food finally arrived, kind of cold, the dishes came with the wrong sides. If i order salmon for $19 and give a four dollar tip for delivery, I expect that i will at least get my string beans and mushrooms instead of a terrible salad. Last time i called and was told, "I'll see what i can do" before a woman hung up on me, without even taking my address or phone number. I never heard anything. All i got for my $23 was a 3 inch piece of cold salmon and a salad i didnt eat.
