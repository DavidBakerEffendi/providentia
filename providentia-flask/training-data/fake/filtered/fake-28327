After 200 reviews, the majority of which are 5 stars, I don't suppose another sparkling review really makes much of a difference; but I wanted to just share my experience for what it's worth. After passing by Kyclades and it's perpetual line so many times, my wife and I decided to finally Â brave the wait and see what the fuss was about. As it turned out we only had to wait about an hour, which went quickly perusing the dollar store up the block. Once seated we had a fried calamari app, which was delightfully tender and fresh (no old oil in this establishment) and so big the two of us could not finish it; and then we went for the Kyclades special: stuffed clams, stuffed shrimp, scallops, fish and lobster. It was undeniably delicious and again WAY too much food for us to finish. The only thing we managed to polish off was a carafe of house red which was also surprisingly good. All in all - a superb culinary experience, great value and a wonderful time. Bonus points granted for the super nice staff. WELL worth the wait.
