I was really impressed at their relief efforts during the Hurricane. It made me proud. Also love the staff at Iris, very real and very kind. Gourmet Bodega has some real steals, greens and the best kind of tahini. Makes for a nice bike ride to Brooklyn Heights. Brunch at the cafe is very charming. From the pastries to the chicken to the homemade soups, I give Iris a big thumbs up!!
