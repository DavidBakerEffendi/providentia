I'm sort of surprised, because everyone's reviews are excellent.  Maybe we went on an off night?  The sommelier was strangely rude (she brought a bottle of wine in place of the one we ordered, allowed us to try it, and when we said we didn't care for it, she walked away), and the service was really slow.  The bread was great, the starters were good, but my main, the scallops were not so great (I didn't love the tomato sauce, but the fennel was good).  Beyond the funky service issues, I just felt like the tastes weren't really satisfying.  I felt like there was something missing from our meal.  The bread pudding was good, though.  As were the deviled eggs.  Sad!  I wish it had been better!
