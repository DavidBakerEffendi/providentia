Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet is one of my favorite buffets! The food is so great. There is an incredible variety, and the menu changes around too, so that there are new things depending on what day you go. I really like that there is an option for take-out. The price goes by the amount your food weighs, which is an incredible deal. Pick what you want, and pay a very reasonable amount for it. Depending on what you buy, it's so much cheaper to get food here than from at a regular Chinese restaurant! The food is great, and the staff is incredibly accommodating. If something isn't as it should be, they always rush out to get it fixed right away. Another great thing is that there are multiple discounts, like a student discount, which is really convenient for me. Hibachi Grill is a nice place, go and taste the yummy food. :)
