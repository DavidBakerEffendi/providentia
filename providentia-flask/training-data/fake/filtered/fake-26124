Online ordering for take-out was convenient, since the phone was always a busy signal, although the online menu layout itself was not very clear. When I arrived, my order was printed and the food was ready. The small shop was very cute and clean, with a communal table that seats about 6, and the staff was friendly. Pick up their paper menu on your way out! FOOD: I was curious about the 5 Star Mushroom Salad and based on another positive Yelp review I decided to try it. It was okay, spicy as I requested, but had too much dressing. I also ordered the Mango with Coconut Sticky Rice, and was also somewhat disappointed. The mango was fresh and ripe, but the "sticky rice" was just a patty of mushed riced. Also, on the online menu, it came up under "Popular Items" so I did not realize it was a dessert. This was my first experience with Jeera Thai and I was just unlucky that the dishes turned out to be different than I expected, I wouldn't say the quality was poor. I will definitely give Jeera Thai another try. Especially since the rest of the Thai options in New Haven range from mediocre to not good.
