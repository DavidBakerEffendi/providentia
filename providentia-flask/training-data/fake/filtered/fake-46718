i have never written any review for any establishments but i felt compelled to write a review for this one. i have eaten at numerous restaurants from high end to low end but i have never felt the need to write even when the food were bad because the service were at least decent. filipino people are known for their hospitality but somehow jeepney's staff failed basic hospitality 101 miserably. i love filipino dish and someone tried to impress me by taking me to manhattan to eat at jeepneys but this place was a big disappointment and not even a contender. the place wouldn't let us in when we arrived at 4:53pm saying they didn't open until 5:00pm despite of the rain and my cousin asking if we could just stand in the corner to wait the male host didn't want to seat us for our 5:00pm reservation because one person in our party was missing but on her way to the restaurant. he stated that we will be seated once the entire party was present? once seated the waitress spilled the water on the table to which she wiped and my cousin asked for a mop because the water dripped between the tables and wetting our pants and shoes to which she said someone will mop it but we never saw casper arrived with his mop. i guess the waitress assumed that since we were already wet from standing in the rain waiting for them to let us in at 5:00pm that the water dripping under the tables and onto our clothes shouldn't have bothered us. the food was pricey and the taste was lacking. i have been to several fine dining establishments and if this place is comparing themselves to a fine dining it should at the very least improve their standard of operation to start with and gradually move towards improving the taste for the price they charge. i enjoyed manhattan but jeepney's isn't one of them. i would suggest going to jersey city instead if someone really wants to taste some good filipino dish.
