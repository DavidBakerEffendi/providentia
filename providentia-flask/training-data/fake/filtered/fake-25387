Cafe Habana is wonderful TINY gem tucked away in Nolita.  Try going during off hours and with only 1 or 2 friends.  No joke, this is a whole in the wall and I don't believe they take reservations so you will basically be standing on top of people while you're waiting for a table but it's all totally worth it. I'm a big fan of the enchiladas but the corn is the show stopper.  It's delicious and comes on a handy little stick.  I believe they grill the corn, smother it in butter, sprinkle it with paprika or chili powder and then roll it in cojita cheese.  You will break any healthy eating habits you have for this corn!
