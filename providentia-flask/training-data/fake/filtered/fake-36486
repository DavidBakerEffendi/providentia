Let me start by saying that I absolutely love going out for Tappas - not only does sharing small plates enable me to try a variety of different things but the communal feel of a shared meal with friends can't be beat. My boyfriend took me to Casa Mono on Friday night after a cold stroll through the Union Sq. Christmas Market.  We sat at the bar and I warmed up real quick! We split a bottle of a jammy, juicy, full bodied red - wish I could remember the name - it was fabulous and exactly what I needed.  We ordered 5 plates which was perfect - duck in a wonderful blackberry sauce, jamon, manchego green salad, butternut squash and pumpkin goat cheese croquettas (my favorite!). For dessert we split vanilla creme broulee with bay leaves coated in a delicious sugary puff. I must disclose that I don't eat red meat or pork so the jamon wasn't for me, but I was told it's delicious. The service was a 3, which is the only reason I didn't give this place a 5. Definitely a place I'll return!
