Stylish and beautifully decorated, but disappointing otherwise. Food was acceptable, not memorable. We had dal mahkani, paneer tikha mahani, vegetable samosas, naan, and chicken tikha massala (which was overcooked). The food was overpriced for the quality. Hands-down, the worst part of our experience was the body odor of our server who smelled like he had not bathed for days.
