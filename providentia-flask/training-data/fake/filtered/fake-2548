Amazing! I have been trying to get reservations here for a long time. So.. Saturday night st. patricks day, 630, was in the area, and thought it would be a good, empty time to go. We were seated right away in the back- the ambience was not as cute next to the pizza makers- but it was an open space. The house wine was delicious. Baked clams for the appetizer- this was good, not sure if I would get it again though. We split a pizza- half eggplant special / half vodka- it was out of this world!! BEST PIZZA IN NYC. GO!
