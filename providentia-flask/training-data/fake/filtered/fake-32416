The Oreo malt & ice tea were good, but the rest wasn't. The fries were dry and stale, the turkey club was sawdusty, and it was very expensive for diner food. I tried the hickory burger, which had too much lettuce & was bland. For 1$ extra, I got the 'Cajun' fries, which are their usual shoestring fries with a dusting of Cajun salt.
