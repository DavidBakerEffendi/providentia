As a local, I have come to love the Sidecar.. Some things that stand out are: 1.) Outdoor Seating- always great to enjoy a refreshing COLD BEER in the nice weather. 2.) Brunch- took my sister and friends here when they were visiting and the food was enjoyed by all. I also like the little cookie that comes with  the coffee. 3.) Grilled Asparagus, salads, carnitas, rhubarb pie, margherita pizza, reuben.. are some of my favorites!!!! 4.)  Beer- good selection of bottles and draft beers, and the staff is good at directing me to a beer that I will like.. At this point, they know what my tastes are. 5.) Atmosphere- the inside has just the right lighting to make it have a comfortable and relaxing appeal. If I'm stressed from the workday, coming here just makes me relax. 6.) People- I've met a lot of nice people since I moved here a year ago, and mostly due to the Sidecar. It's a good place to meet your neighbors. 7.) And last but not least, the staff make it a great, welcoming place to visit. Yay, Sidecar!!!!
