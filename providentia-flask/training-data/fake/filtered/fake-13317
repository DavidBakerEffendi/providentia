I normally don't do reviews, but as most places I go to normally don't change, Rug's and Riffy's has become better over the years. First off - $1 Taco Tuesday night is awesome, you get a bang for your buck! The following week I went back on Wednesday for the $1 deep-fried hotdogs and some drinks, and you can't go wrong with deep-fried anything - delicious! I started coming here for the food once in a while with my older siblings 4 years ago when I was 18, and with time, the place has really changed for the better so I'm a pretty frequent visitor now. I've noticed that there's a friendlier atmosphere ever since those territorial regulars were taken care of - you walk in now and feel welcomed and ready to have a good time ;) Best of all, 14 beers on tap! I love my beer, and Rug's will have something on tap for everyone.
