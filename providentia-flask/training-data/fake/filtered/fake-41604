The food is good and reasonably priced. I give this place two stars for terrible service. We had 7:30 reservations and every time we asked the greeter about our table we were told, "just have a seat at the bar and we'll get you when your table is ready." We wound up ordering and eating at the bar and left at 9:30. The greeter never approached us to offer an update or explanation.
