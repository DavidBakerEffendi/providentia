Last week I went to the Hinge Café for the first time hoping for a great meal. My boyfriend's mom had eaten there once and enjoyed the food so we all decided to try the place for a special birthday dinner. From the very start the experience was terrible! First came the flat soda, followed my more flat soda when we sent it back. After settling on water, the cold tomato basil soup came. Not only was it cold, it contained weird chewy pieces that reminded me of the texture of animal fat. Next came the veggie burgers...Disgusting and I mean gross! I could have had a morning star burger at home that would have tasted better! Not only was it flavorless but it was so poorly constructed that I found myself chewing on bits of salt (a true sign that the burger was a mess)! All four of us felt sick and uneasy for 2 hours after eating at the Hinge Café. Do yourself a favor and skip this mess of a café! I have never written a restaurant review, especially not one so mean but it was a scary experience and I hope to warn people before they get sick too!
