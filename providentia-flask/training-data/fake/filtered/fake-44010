The food is NASTY! It tasted like it was all frozen or boxed. When the owner asked how the food was we told him. He got rude and acted like the bad food was our fault. there was 4 people in our party. Â 2 people threw up from the turkey. I remember when I was growing up that place was always busy. no wonder there was only 2 people in there. it is really sad. really really sad.
