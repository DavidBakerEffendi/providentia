I think that if you are more accustomed to eating fast food or even expecting the service of a pizza shop this place is not for you! I can't get enough of the food. My favorite to date is the flat bread sampler; one with pears, gorgonzola and raspberry-based sauce-yum! The cafe seats a lot and with what looks like only one chef, I think that the service timing is considerable. Â I saw not-so-good reviews for breakfast I'm completely suprised--I did get the traditional scrambled eggs, hash browns and bacon and I have yet to see it be recreated the way this place does it. Many of the others' ratings state that it's always packed and the service is slow....well I suppose that's better than dead and quick. I rate Fedoras for mature audiences only.
