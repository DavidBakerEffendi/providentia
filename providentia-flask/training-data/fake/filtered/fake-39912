My mom heard this was a good place to go so we went while in town for a conference. It was terrific. Other crepe places I have been to have smaller crepes and don't quite fill you up for a meal, but these crepes were definitely big enough for a meal, especially with the side salad. We went for dinner. The staff was friendly and we enjoyed the live music. If I am ever in the area again I will be returning!
