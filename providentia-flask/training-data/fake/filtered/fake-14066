Ever since the first day I had a slice from this place, I've been in love. Their ingredients are different from your average brooklyn pizza place. You might have to wait for seats, but generally the wait for the pizza hasn't been too long in my several visits, and it's always been tasty and filling. They also offer desserts, although I've never tried them. A large pie with cream soda always hits the spot
