I moved to Philly 3 months ago. I have had 4 cheese steaks since moving here - Pats , Geno's , Macie, and now Carmen's. Carmen's is the best- in addition to superior meat, and taste- their service and friendliest is just the best - so best Carmen's - worst Pats - Pats was full of grizzle - i took 2 bites and threw it out- Ca men's was just great- highly recommend Carmen's
