When I was actually still eating meats, I had to say that the Honey Glazed fried chicken was the best I have had thus far from any Soul Food Restaurant. Mac & Cheese was also on point. Yams and Collards could have been better, but I am comparing them to my Grandmother's. So in most cases everyone else will loose! (Yea I Know, I'm Bias) ;-) The ambiance is not exactley what you may be used to; if you like eating at some of the Fort Green / Clinton Hill, Brooklyn spots...but if you are just into some good ole' southern style food, that just makes you think of they way things used to be, then this spot is for you.
