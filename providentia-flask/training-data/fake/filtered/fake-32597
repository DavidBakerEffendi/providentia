Been wanting to try this for a while. We weren't disappointed. About the only thing we found lacj=king was our Pinot Noir, nothing to write home about. But the mussels were as good as they get. One portion serves two adults as an appetizer easily. We both had steak; the hangar steak my wife had was grilled to perfection, and the frites, hot, fresh, perfectly salted, and delicious. The strip steak (me) was great, the string beans superb, although the potato grating I expected was more of a potato kugel, and while I like kugel, this was bland. Besides, there was more than enough frites for me to snitch from my wife. Definitely go back again, and for brunch too, which we read is great. Bon apetit!
