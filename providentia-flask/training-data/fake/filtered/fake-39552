I'm really surprised that there are so many good reviews. I guess the food is good, if I did get to try them. unfortunately, I had to walk out right after the food came out cause there was a roach crawling out from my pad thai??!!!! I called waitress pointing at the roach by that time the roach was crawling all over my pad thai. waitress apologized and took the dish away and five minutes later came out with a pad thai, which clearly was the same pad thai that had roach in it, its just this time there was no roach!!! I was with my brother and had a thai iced tea so we just paid for our drink and left. My brother and I were so disgusted that we couldn't sit in this restaurant for another second!! Â what got me more upset was the attitude of our waitress and the manager as if its not much of a big deal!! the couple who sat next to our table saw the roach and left immediately without ordering. for me,no matter how good the food is, bad customer service and dirty sanitation can not be justified!!
