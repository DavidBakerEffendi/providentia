This should technically be zero stars.  I went there with my lady, and she asked how long was the wait.  The nice waiter told her 10 minutes.  40 minutes later we were still not seated.  They sat three couples who clearly arrived after us before us (you know who you are!). We were hungry and pissed so left without ever trying food.  It looks like a great neighborhood place and we live in the neighborhood, so would one of our kind neighbors (except the skinny 20 year olds who blatantly cut us) tell us the secret handshake to get a table.
