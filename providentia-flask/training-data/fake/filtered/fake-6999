Mysore Woodlands is the best Southern Indian restaurant I've dined at. They not only serve great dosas, they have introduced me to dishes I have never eaten elsewhere or since. The poryal -whether it's with okra, spinach,or cabbage - is always a revelation. The key to this and other dishes you can't get elsewhere, is the freshness of the spices they use. I invariably wave the owner to my table to ask about the ingredients in a particular offering on the buffet - and he has let me know that Mysore never uses spices already ground, but do the grinding themselves. I think that's a critical difference that I'm tasting in the food, not to mention the "street food" that adds such diversity and color to the mix. I would also say, the owner's patience, delight, and detail in describing how the dishes are prepared communicates the passion these people have for the food they serve. He loves to relate anecdotes of growing up in a Southern Indian kitchen and how food preparation has evolved, and clearly cherishes the retention of some of the more traditional ways. If you go on Chat Night - Tuesday or Friday - the variety of dishes is almost overwhelming - we nearly always are tasting yet another we've never been exposed to, and we are gourmands that travel far and wide for good ethnic food. The other aspect of dining at Mysore is the lack of greasiness and salt in the food. It also goes down very sattvic, I always feel uplifted by eating here and by the calm, unpretentious soulfulness of the place, with its floor to ceiling windows that expose tall pines, and its peaceful, smiling staff. The price is also ridiculous, considering you feel as though some very loving person has just prepared and cooked a banquet, just for you!
