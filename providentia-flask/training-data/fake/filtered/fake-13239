So this is definitely a regular spot for my girlfriend and I. And by regular I mean at least twice a week. We found Raymond's originally on yelp and decided to give it a try. We went for breakfast and got the french toast as most of the reviews insist. The food came and we were greatly disappointed. It wasn't fully cooked so the inside was practically mush. A plus though is that they have great coffee and that their Belgian hot chocolate with homemade marshmallows is delicious. Â For those two reasons we decided to try Raymond's again, and we have loved it ever since. The french toast is a good as everyone says, I suppose we just came on an off day for the chef. I also REALLY recommend the eggs Benedict; it's is amazing every time. Pretty good lunch as well. (Avocado cheeseburger)
