This warm friendly gem on the LES has delicious food, great wines and unusual original cocktails. Also a great assortment of schnapps. which come in delicate little glasses. I am partial to the great salads, & the homemade liverwurst w/red onion jam. Can't wait for the greenmarket tomatoes to get ripe so the heirloom tomoto salad will be back on the menu. When Â you go to Cafe Katja, make sure you notice the beautiful pottery made by Andrew, who will also help you with suggestions (and tastes) of the excellent wines and beers on tap. The wait staff is friendly, and you'll probably make friends with the people at the next table.
