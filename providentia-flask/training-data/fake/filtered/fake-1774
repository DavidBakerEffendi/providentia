Pio Pio has a small entrance that is difficult to find but don't be deceived. Â This restaurant is actually quite large and it kind of looks like a birds nest. The food was delicious. The ceviche that we had for an appetizer was by far the best seafood that I have ever eaten. The matador combo that I had included one of the best pieces of chicken that i have ever eaten. My only complaint was that the music was kind of loud and therefore to hear other people you had to shout almost. But the food was worth the shouting.
