What more can I say that others have not already said about how wonderful this place is? 1.  My best falafel eating experience happened here. (I had the Harissa, mainly because I'd never had a harissa but also because I wanted to say harissa.) 2.  My favorite -- i.e., most garlicky & creamy -- hummus is made here. 3.  The wheat pitas were heated, moist, yummy, and moreish. (Moreish: makes you want more, because they're that addictive) Go here for lunch, and buy some hummus to go!
