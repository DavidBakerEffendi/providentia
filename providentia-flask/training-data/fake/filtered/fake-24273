I came to Ngam restaurant the other night with a friend and had high hopes after reading several reviews online. Unfortunately we were not pleased with what we had ordered. To start, we had the spring rolls and fries as appetizers. Both had nice flavors, but we couldn't get past all the grease that was left on our hands and in our mouths. For entrees, I had the pad thai with mussels, quite a unique combination so I was intrigued! However, most of the mussels did not open and the pad thai was quite sweet for my liking. My friend had the pork belly, which he also said was jarringly sweet. Our sever was great but my pad thai came and I was almost done before the pork belly even got to the table. Won't be coming back.
