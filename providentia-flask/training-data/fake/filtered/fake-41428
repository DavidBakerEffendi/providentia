I'm staying at the Westin, and one would think a Starwood property would invest a little more time and attention in its property restaurant.  I waited at the host stand of the deserted restaurant for 5 minutes before finally asking the concierge if it was open.  A room service waiter eventually showed me to my seat.  I waited another 5 minutes to order, and 15 minutes on my drink.  Please bear in mind I am the ONE AND ONLY person in this restaurant, and there were at least three waitstaff around that I spoke to.  When I asked about the wait on the drink (a martini) they explained that specialty drinks have to be made in the bar across the lobby and take longer.  Considering I ordered a burger, which also appears on the bar menu, I regret having decided to eat in the restaurant proper.  The service couldn't have been worse at the bar.  The drink and burger were passable but not exceptional.  Given the quality, the bar or even room service would have been preferable.
