This place is amazing for a local tavern. I'm glad I live right down the street from it. They serve the best burger I've ever had and have an A+ beer selection. You have to try their con tav fries! Just like the crab fries from Chickie and Pete's! The only draw back is the mostly baby boomer and married people bar crowd.
