When we're in the mood for Mexican, it's pretty difficult for us to pick any place that isn't De Mole. When the Michelin guide recommended place in your neighborhood has the same price as the hole in the wall restaurant, these decisions make themselves. De Mole's enormous burritos are $7. They offer great brunch plates for just over $5. When it comes to Mexican food, I'd be surprised if there's a better price to quality ratio anywhere in the greater NYC area. I originally had doubts about this place - I like my food spicier than their average dish. If you're like me, just ask for their red/green sauces and that problem gets solved pretty quickly. Â  My biggest problem with De Mole is actually not De Mole's fault - when walking their, crossing 48th avenue can be quite dangerous. We need more stoplights and crosswalks in the area. (This is a problem throughout Sunnyside.) Still, this place is more than worth your time, even if you live in Manhattan or a more distance part of Queens.
