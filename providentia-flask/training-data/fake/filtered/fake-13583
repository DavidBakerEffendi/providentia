While there are plenty of great restaurant options on Cortelyou Road, Castello Plan is by far my favorite! I live in the neighborhood and frequent this cozy little wine bar. Their wine selection is top of the line, and the wait staff is highly knowledgeable and able to make great recommendations. The food, which is miraculously prepared entirely behind the bar, is incredible!!! I've never been let down by an entr√©e from their seasonal menu. My only complaint is that when the menu changes I can no longer order my favorites (particularly the yam crostini, which is to die for). One nice down time to go which you might not think of is brunch on the weekends. The crowd is light and the coffee is excellent, complete with a personal beaker of warm milk. My words just can't say enough, you really must try it for yourself!
