First I want to say..the place is SO cute.  They have indoor/outdoor seating, the inside is really nice and comfortable.  I had high hopes.  We went for Mother's Day, the host was very pleasant, and handed me a rose.  Nice.  There's the one star for that. We sit down and it takes a REALLY long time for anyone to come over to take our drink order.  By the time the waiter does, we are ready to order our meals.  As soon as we are done ordering, a waitress comes over and ask us if we are ready to order.  Disorganized, but, I can look past that.  I will say again, I REALLY wanted to like this place. Our food comes.  My husband gets a french toast burger, which was a little pricey, not much to it, and he said it was just okay.  I get the french toast which was pretty yummy...and I ordered my 2 year old daughter pancakes.  As I begin to cut her pancakes, I flip one over and notice a hair in the pancakes.  Sigh.  I tell the waiter, who says, "oh yes I see that..." and takes the plate away.  My daughter proceeds to cry....which was not fun for a mommy on Mother's Day.  Hey, she wanted her pancakes! Anyway, it takes a good 10 minutes or so for a new plate to be made.  They are pancakes, come on! And when the waitress returns, she says to us, "well it wasn't my hair!"  We did not receive an apology from anyone.  And we were also charged for the pancakes...I think since it was their mistake, and they upset my daughter, they could have done SOMETHING for us.  Or at least an apology. Will not be returning :-(
