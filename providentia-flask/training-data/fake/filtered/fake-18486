I went here on a Monday night for dinner by myself (single female!).  It was great!  The location is nice, the people were very nice, and the food was AMAZING.  I got the crab mac & cheese, and only stopped eating because I simply couldn't eat another bite.  The decor was great, and it was clean and neat.  The other guests were nice, and I never felt uncomfortable.  You could even feel the subway trains running, which added to the ambiance.  I would go back in a heart beat!
