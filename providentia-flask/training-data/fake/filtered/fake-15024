Great food, great service, nice amenities... but way too loud with a full house.   We couldn't hear ourselves at a small table of four and the noise just gets louder and louder as each table has to shout to be heard.   It was awful and unfortunate, because the food was fantastic.   Don't see us returning back here at dinner time.
