Have you ever found a thousand dollar bill in your jeans pocket? Have you ever seen a shooting star from the window of a spaceship during a full solar eclipse? Have you ever thought it was raining but really you were just under a waterfall making love to supermodels? Â Have you ever let a cat lick the bottom of your tired feet? Have you ever thought you lost your car keys only to remember that your chauffeured, stretch-hummer limo was waiting right outside the door? Have you ever won six CashWord Doubler scratch-off lotto tickets in a row? Boubouki's spinach pie.
