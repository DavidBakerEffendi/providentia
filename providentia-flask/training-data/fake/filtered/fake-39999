THE FOOD AND ATMOSPHERE IS ABSOLUTELY WEST VILLAGE WONDERFUL. I have to say, the chef is quite obnoxious and rude, she refused to serve mashed potatoes on the side or give us more gravy. Also, she will not make substitutions, so if you want veggies you have to call the president to get approval. I understand this is her craft, but pleeease be kind to your costumers they are not asking for much!
