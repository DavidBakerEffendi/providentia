When I first went to Bayou, I had really high hopes. To start off, their drink the "Coleman" will get you smashed, so drink slowly. I believe the food to be hit or miss. There seems to be andouille sausage in everything. The food isn't bad, it's just okay. Desserts are great, though! The place is worth a try, just don't expect it to be the best food you've ever had. But I guess it would be nice to eat something other than penne vodka once in a while, right?
