i just absolutely love this place! like spanish food?  like good, strong drinks?  like a casual/ sexy atmosphere?  how about a nice, attentive staff?  or a place for you and the girls (or guys, i guess?) to have a drink and/ or a nice dinner after, say a night at the movies...???  Calle Ocho is the spot! first off!!!  THEY HAVE THE BEST MOJITO'S IN TOWN!!!  if someone begs to differ, whatever...i say come prove it, lol!  start off at the bar downing some of their wonderfully, perfectly mixed mixed-drinks until you're seated (the first time i went, it kinda took a while to be seated, but the only reason i noticed was because i was too young to partake in the consumption of the alcohol...no one else seemed to mind.  every other time i've been, and i've been a few times, it was average, to no wait time).  i love Cuban food, so i try to go for the taster appetizer thingy, lol!  i absolutely LOVE their yuca fries!!!!  they come with this great garlicy dipping sauce, and i could seriously eat those all night (i tried making them myself after having them, but the chef's recipe is just perfect!  he should sell it!).  i ate fish the first time, i think?  some kind of halibut that was so crispy on the outside & melt-in-your-mouth-good on the inside, i wanted to cry!  it was seasoned just so perfectly, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  another time, i had some other kind of fish...not sure what, but it had this sweet potato puree or something with sweet-potato (again, the drinks!  MOJITOS!!!)...anyways, it was just marvelous! im trying to think of what else i've tried there...which is a lot more, but im drawing a blank...MOJITOS!!!  hey, if you're into anything i've mentioned thus far, please consider Calle Ocho...that about does it...OH!!!  biiiiiiiggggg PLUSS for me that it's on the upper west side!!!
