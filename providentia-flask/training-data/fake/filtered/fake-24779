We went to New York city to visit and stop at Bianca's for good italian food and we were really happy about it! The host was super sweet, tried to talk a little in french with us (we're french canadians) and told us to go get a drink at the bar next door, he'd get us when our table was ready, which was kinda cool! Food was delicious and our server was very nice! Definitely going back there next time we're in town!!
