The worst delivery experience ever. Waited for an hour and half. I live 3 blocks away. I was repeatedly called from their charming delivery man who was yelling at me... I then proceeded to call Zutto. I spoke with some Host who said " I will take care of it. Then he hung up. I couldn't believe it. He never asked who I was or where I lived. I had been waiting for 1hr and 45 minutes for 3 rolls. I mean really? I called back and asked them to cancel my order. I will never ever order from this place again. It's just too bad that Takahachi was closed on Sunday. I rest my case. takahachi.net
