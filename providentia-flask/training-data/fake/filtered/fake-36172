We hosted a repass brunch at Lassoni today - it was so delicious I had to take time to write a review.  Service and food was out of this world.  There was barely a morsel left on plates.  The price of each meal was a bargain. the Penne Vodka was the best I've ever tasted.  It is located on the site of the former Jade for those familiar with the area.
