Just reading some of the reviews... for those only commenting about the 3 Days to Open show..... get a life! - Or just go there and try it yourself, but stop being a hater and give the kid some credit! You don't have to like Paul... but the fingers are amazing. I have been to Sticky's 3 times (delivery once) and each time I'm there, everyone is super nice, and super friendly. Sticky's has a certain vibe, and those not feeling the vibe are corny. If you're a real New Yorker you'll know what I mean! Go for the Wasabi finger or the Fiesta finger. They make the order fresh, so sometimes it takes a bit, so if you're gonna take out, just call a few minutes before u get there. Will be back (if I haven't already been there since writing this)
