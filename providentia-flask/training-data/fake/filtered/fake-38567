this place is awful.  im sick of places charging way to much for food because its local and organic, but forgetting that execution is the most important part of professional cooking.  the black beans tasted as if scooped right out of a can.  no seasoning, no flavor.  the polenta was stiff, dry, and lacked any sort of flavor.  even too much salt would have been a good thing, but im not sure they used any at all.  the only saving grace was multiple choices of hot sauce.  after using half a bottle, the food had taste.  my portion of the meal (including a lack luster mimosa and coffee) cost 25 bucks, and ive had better 7 dollar meals at diners.  someone needs to remind these chefs that flavor, not source, should come first.
