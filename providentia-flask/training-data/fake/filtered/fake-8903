they dont have sushi anymore, which i think is great. now that they can focus on the chinese cuisine. what had i tried before? the lobster was great. what's better than the taste is the price cut down from 21.99 to 10.99. i tried three different style, and each one stimulates different taste buds. the first one is a ginger and scallion type. was a bit salty, but express the best scent sensation out of the 3 styles. the second type i tried have a more spicy favor, which is my favorite type of them all. the third type was the cantonese style which is more like a lobster in a shrimp and lobster sauce. cantonese style brings out the best visual attraction out of the types i tried. none of them is fried, which makes it healthy and yummy yummy. i am thinking of ordering another one soon with a different style. the boneless spare rib was so good that i almost always order a small to go every time i went. different from other chinese places, their boneless spare rib has a honey taste to it. gotta love the rib. i also tried their chicken teriyaki. not the best i had, but tender enough to be one of the top choice to order when you visit. their buffet was great, different food selection with all you can eat stipulation that cost only 3.99
