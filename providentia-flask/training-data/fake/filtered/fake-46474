This is my favorite place of all time. I've been coming here for about 6years and I'll never stop. Upon one of my solo-outings a rare misfortune saw to it that my card was dropped behind the POS during checkout. They were so nice that they accommodated and comped a lot off my bill with a date from work (don't judge me!). I was expecting just an app comp but no, so much more! We were astounded, and my date couldn't even believe. No legitimately, she didn't wanna leave at first cause she felt like we didn't pay enough. I love this place to death and I will never stop coming. They are perfect~
