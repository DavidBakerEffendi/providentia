First things first their pancakes are out of control. The best I've had in NYC. I think that's part of the problem. I've been here numerous times over the years and while the quality of brunch food remains great (I still love their pancakes more than life itself) I just think Clinton St has suffered the effects of their popularity. Brunch waits are several hours and the waitstaff has ranged from harried to kind of rude. The experience has been less than stellar because of the feeling we were being rushed the entire time. I understand that's part of the problem with such a critically acclaimed Â restaurant and it takes foolishness or just a try pancake fiend to wait 3 hours anyway, but I'm a sucker for good service and they're slipping. Not only that my boyfriends food was really cold when it came out. So while their specialty remains a winner in my heart I think they should re-evaluate the insanity and the service. No one wants to feel like they're being forced out especially after waiting for so long.
