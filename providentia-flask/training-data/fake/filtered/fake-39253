I was in NYC last week and found this place walking by it.  I loved the atmosphere as soon as walked in.  I ordered the pasta bolognese and it was great.  My friends ordered the vodka pasta and that was delicious too.  Our server was so friendly and gave us great advice of places to see.  He servered us two glasses of wine on the house.  My friends and I loved this place so much we came again for dinner on our last night.  I ordered the milanese sandwich and it was fantastic.  We had a different server and he was just as friendly and we told him we loved the restaurant he gave us a free dessert as a thank you for returning.  This is the first time I have ever written a review on Yelp but I really enjoyed the people who work here, the atmospher and more importantly the food was so tasty.  I will definitly return here when I come back to NYC.
