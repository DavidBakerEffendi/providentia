DELICIOUS!!!  My friends came from out of town and we came here for dinner, but they were packed and the wait time was at least 45 minutes.  We had switched restaurants so we didn't have any reservations.  We decided we were too hungry to wait so we went to another restaurant nearby.   Well, after we finished eating at the other restaurant, we decided to grab a second dinner!  Yes, immediately after our first dinner!  Needless to say, we felt like we were going to explode afterwards.   With that in mind, we still thought it was worth it to stop by.  We of course had the pork buns, which were delicious as always.  The slightly sweet and soft white bun with the perfect combination of lettuce and mouthwatering pork!  Their broth for their ramen has an incredible depth of flavor. The service has been good every time I came here.  I just love this place!
