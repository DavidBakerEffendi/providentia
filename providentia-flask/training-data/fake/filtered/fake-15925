This is a very nice place to eat in Little Iitaly, I was looking for some authentic italian pizza for lunch you know, and I was pretty satisfied! The pizzas were delicious, the dough is really great. I especially enjoyed the desert which was a tiramisu, so delightful. The service was satisfying too.
