The pancakes here are pretty damn good, but I'm not so sure these pancakes are worth the the long wait, good. I had to order the blueberry pancakes, since everyone had nothing but marvelous things to say about them. And yes I would have to agree-they're a must, if you do choose to endure the absurd wait. Maybe if there staff were a little more attentive to the guests, the line wouldn't be out the door. If I return I will have to head the advice of others and either come first thing in the morning OR try them out on a weekday.
