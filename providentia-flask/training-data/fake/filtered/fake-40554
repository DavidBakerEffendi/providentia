i love this place! it is very relaxed and chill, good lighting and space. PLUS good music! the hostess was superrrr nice and friendly, warm and lovely!!! she went to great pains to accomodate us even though it was super crowded. the hostess is always very important to me bc its the face of the place, so being greeted by someone enjoying her job and with a nice smile is fab. our waiter was very smart and we had perfect service. the food was delish. ceviche and veggie burger yum. my friend loved the burger and the fries are RIDIC. prolly great for a hangover;-) excellent wine and beer. overall a solid neighborhood spot--- id highly recommend!!
