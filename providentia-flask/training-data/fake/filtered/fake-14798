The food was awful. My food was cold and the chicken hardly cooked. Talk about almost getting food poisoning!!!! Than the waitress got my order wrong. So I sat there eating my fries, while eating my fries I asked my waitress if I could get a hot coffee. Well, just say the hot coffee turned out to be a cold coffee. The waitress was awful too. She was slow and she didn't know what she was doing. It's a shame I had to rate this place because it doesn't deserve a star!!!! To everyone out there please save your money and DO NOT GO RHO!!!! The name for the restaurant should be R.I.P, because if you eat there you might die of awful food. To put this in simple terms!! THIS PLACE SUCKS!!!
