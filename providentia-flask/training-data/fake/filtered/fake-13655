Really enjoyed our meal at Cuba.  We had reservations and arrived on time and did not have to wait. We were seated in a small back room right behind the band, but it wasn't too loud so that we couldn't chat. The atmosphere and decor is lovely. The sangria was great and my two friends who are Cuban food experts truly raved about the meal. Was  my friend's birthday so they did add a candle to our dessert that we ordered, but it was not comped.
