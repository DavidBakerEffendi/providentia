We loved Tinto as a place to celebrate our anniversary last year. So much so that we did it again this year. The head waitperson was a model server, helping us make our sherry decisions. We had the Chef's Tasting again. Every tapas was a wonderful surprise, each a truly unique treat for the palate. The pace was a little rushed at times, but the coordination of the waitstaff was truly amazing and we wound up spending a couple of thoroughly enjoyable hours there. We've traveled to Spain several times, and were happy again to find the delights of the culture so splendidly reproduced right here in Philly.
