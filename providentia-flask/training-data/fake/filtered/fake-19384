Comparing to Sushi Palace in Kingston NJ (near by Japanese restaurant), this one is better in one thing and worse in the other. First of all, this so called all you can eat buffet is not the type you can go around and pick what you like. You have to order through the waiter/waitress, that is fine if you know what you order, how much you can eat, because you may end up having lots left over because of greed, and you may have to pay for it (take out for extra charge) Second, Sushi King is new and the place a little bigger than Sushi Palace which is a plus, you feel comfortable eating there. However, the food you order is very small in pieces including sashmi, Sushi. It is like half of the size of what the regular piece is. (good thing it is all you can eat, I ordered more) Third thing, We all know sushi has rice in it. Their rolls are messy, whoever the chef is don't do good jobs, the rolls are not just small but messy. Also, After the entree, they serve all sushi first before sashmi (raw fish), in other words, they want you to stuff yourself full first, then if you can finish, you will end up taking out all the raw fish later. That is their business tactic. If you like eating environment rather than the food, pick one that you can actually walk around, but if you prefer to sit down and be waited, this place may be better than sushi palace. However, if you want the food to be better served, don't eat in this one. This place basically is okay if you can't find other Japanese restaurant, but to me, I probably won't go back again. (Besides, it is grand opening, they offer no coupons or any promotion, I was a bit surprised because the price is about the same as Sushi Palace.)
