We've been there three times so far. Honestly, the worst reviews seem to be when Sanford's is PACKED and we haven't been there when it's been slammed. The food has been superlative all three times. Last time we went I had one of their organic burgers which was delicious and a much better value than the nearby Bareburger. High quality and fresh ingredients. The decor is nice, but if it were up to me, I'd have them take down the music a couple of notches, or this would be a five star review
