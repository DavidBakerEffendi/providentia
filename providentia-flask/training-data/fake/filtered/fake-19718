I am a sucker for this place.  I have lived in a food-centric city, New Orleans, for 18 years and have been heavily involved in the 'food' industry. First, the service is friendly, relaxed and aware.  Top notch for a neighborhood place.  I was pleasantly surprised the first time I came here to visit so other nola people who were staying in the neighborhood and had brunch here.  I was later than everyone else and the server was prompt and picked up on my name making me feel right at home.  This is really important.  A positive experience starts way before the food gets to you. With that the place is sunny and has lots of light and eclectic artwork.  The music was off and on but during Sunday brunch everyone who works there was working quickly and whatever.  I tasted the shrimp and grits with  amazing mushrooms and I had the fried shrimp po-boy which was crispy with firm shrimp, fresh baguette and perfect breaded fries.  Great French press coffee, Sumatran.  Good drinks, rum punch, slightly expensive for brunch but tasty.  This is Southern / New Orleans food done well. I like this place so much I brought my 5 friends there for my birthday.  I am looking forward to dinner there in the future.
