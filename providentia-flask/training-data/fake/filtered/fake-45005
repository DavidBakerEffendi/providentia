It's become quite apparent that someone at Le Grand Comptoir seriously doesn't appreciate my negative review, as this is the 3rd time it's been erased from Yelp, and you know what? Too bad. It was well deserved. (I didn't know anyone had the power to erase a negative review, what's up with that?) I'm a chef and restaurant owner, my cousin is one of the top food/wine and restaurant critics in the country, and I came in a month ago to try out this gorgeous place and sat at the the bar for 15-minutes while the three bartenders patently ignored me. No "Hi, be with you in a minute," no "Hey, we're slammed (they weren't) hang in there for a few minutes," nothing. I know how to get a bartender's attentiion, I played their little waiting game, there were only 15-seats at the bar, how long can a person sit there waiting for nothing to happen? Finally, I got up and left. They're lucky they weren't working for me, or they'd have all ended up back at the unemployment line. The chances of me ever, ever going back there are ZERO, and it's too bad, because it's a great concept.
