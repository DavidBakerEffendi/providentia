NY has many places where you can get a really good pizza.  There is only one place that stands above them all... Lombardi's is that place.  The atmosphere is dope, the history is undeniable, and the pizza...the pizza is epic.  What's even better is that it lies in Manhattan, it doesn't get any better than that.  When in NY this is definitely a stop you need to make before catching a Yankee game.
