oh my holy land, this place is freaking delicious. we've been ordering in mass quantities for our late nights at the office (yes, there are offices in chelsea), and now, we can all qualitatively agree that this may be the best (and only?) reason to stay at work until 9 p.m. on a wednesday night.  please don't tell my boss that, but it's true. seriously. probably some of the best quality/bang for the buck as far as middle eastern food goes in manhattan. tonight i had the red pepper hummus platter w/falafel, baba ghanoush, stuffed grape leaves, and tons of fresh vegetables (which are free!  and so is the feta cheese!  it's amazing!).  we got lots of fresh, fabulous and fluffy pita with our meal (see what i did there?  everybody loves alliteration), and some exceptionally good rugelach and baklava for dessert. the baba is all smoky and like "hey girl, give me a try", the hummus super smooth and inviting, and the falafels were tender and delicious.  a great aside to the golf-ball like nightmares they sell at Wrapido.  forrealsies.  i may have cracked a tooth on those once. some peoples seem to have gotten upset about the ordering process.  waddup with that?  just take a deep breath.  then order.  or do it on seamless.  or pop a xanax if ordering an $8 lunch is seriously giving you that much performance anxiety.  trust. oh, and the delivery guy was super nice and extremely helpful.  give him a raise, dear owner, if you are reading this. ok, i've never yelped, but this place was so good, we all felt compelled.  myself especially, in case you didn't get that by now.
