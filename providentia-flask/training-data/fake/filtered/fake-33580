Hands-down the best asian-inspired food in Glastonbury.  We recently moved from Boston and had been to other asian restaurants  in town based on recommendations.  We stumbled on to this place after they re-opened (same place as Bangkok Spice, not sure if new ownership).  I've been there 6-8 times and have enjoyed everything I've ordered.  Curries are great and the Traditional Thai chicken is very good as well - impressive plating when eating in!. I would also highly recommend the beef salad - delicious!  Although we usually get takeout, when we eat in the service is always accommodating.
