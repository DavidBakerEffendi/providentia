Would someone please explain how the bar works at Maialino?  I arrived ten minutes early for my dinner reservation this evening and thought I would wait at the bar.  Isn't that what everyone does?  When I waited at the bar to place an order, the bartender informed me that I could not sit at the bar, as there was a waiting list for the bar stool.  What?  I can't sit at the bar?  It was a most confusing exchange and it left me feeling very unwelcome at a restaurant I had been waiting to enjoy.  It was also very contrary to the welcoming reputation which Danny Meyer enjoys at all of his restuarants.  So, I think the story is that if you want to sit at the bar, you put your name on a list.  If you are waiting to eat in the restaurant, I guess you have to stand at the bar (not sit).  Personally, I found this to be very discouraging.  Is this a new trend in the city?  Reserved bar stools?  I hope not.  I think that they need to revisit this policy.  Whoever heard of not being able to wait (sit) at the bar before their dinner. Our dinner was lovely but the experience was overshadowed by the poor welcome we recieved when we arrived.
