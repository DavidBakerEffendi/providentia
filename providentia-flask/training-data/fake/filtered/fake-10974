DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE! The restaurant management was HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! We had 6 people for lunch but we were asked to be seated in a 4 people table, ffs, everyone knows how small the tables are in Japanese restaurant, 6 people in a small table? and in a very crowded corner? No way! Â So we asked if we could be seated in two tables, one with 4 people and the other with 2. There were many empty tables and the tables were not reserved, but the restaurant said no, the female store manager said "we don't want people to walk in the restaurant and talk to each other". WTF was that?????!!!!!! We walked for 15 mints from our office to this place for lunch and that was what we got? I have been living in New York for 3 years and this is the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever been to! There are so many good Japanese restaurants on Manhattan, how can this one got 4 star on yelp? How much did the restaurant pay to buy the ratings?
