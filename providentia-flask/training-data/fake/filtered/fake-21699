The Best Chinese Food  ever! Our family have been a customer for ever it seems.We love not only the food but the staff is friendly  and fast.We have tried almost every dish and cant pick a favorite since they are all very good.You are missing out if you have not  ordered from Luen Hop.Fresh food,hot food,spicy food if you wont great prices,good portions and many choices.My only complaint is that they "DO NOT" Deliver.
