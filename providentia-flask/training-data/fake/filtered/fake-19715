i am a fan of peaches because they do bring to the neighborhood a pleasant place to gather, eat, drink, and work online.  the food is consistently good, if limited, the ambience is cozy and cheery, and the people, both staff and patrons, are always diverse, pleasant, and lively. BUT!!  in the year that i have been patronizing the place, they have not grown one inch in waiter etiquette or food service protocol.  cannot honestly say which has the least knowledge of (or care for) restaurant etiquette, the serving staff or the supervisors that manage them. i do believe however that the former is a reflection of the latter.
