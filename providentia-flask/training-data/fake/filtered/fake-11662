IM ONLY GIVING 1 STAR BECAUSE THERE IS NOTHING LOWER !!!! Horrible experience despite the fact that I waited 45 minutes for my meal to be prepared but the food was flavorless I wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy but the disgusting part came when I was eager to pay the bill and leave so I went to the small employe lounge to pay since there was no waitress out on the main floor and I was encountered by the waitress recycling my left over sauces to the table across from where I was seated never again I left regretting my entire meal hopefully the FDA catches on to this place.
