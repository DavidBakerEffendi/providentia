Here's a beautiful place! Shehrezads cafe...we ordered some falafel, chicken kabob and the delicious lamb kabob... Which was served with tabouli, hummus and pita bread taste was awesome. The place was beautifully done well maintained by George the owner. Very neat and hospitable place to visit. Can't wait to go back again:)
