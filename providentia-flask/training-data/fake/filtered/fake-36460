I should have run the other way once I set foot inside the door, but I had 4 family members with me for an impromptu lunch, and it was freezing outside!  Although the place was 1/2 empty, we were greeted by sour-faced hostess who made it clear we were imposing on her rigorous schedule of standing around and chatting with the waitress. The food was OK, mostly unmemorable.  (You can find better tapas in the city.)  Dishes came out VERY slowly, and we had a tough time flagging down a waitress to complain, because she was so busy catching up on gossip.  It's alarming that we couldn't gain anyone's attention, given that the restaurant is roughly the size of a shoebox! Poor service and a lack of attention to basic needs (like water, or utensils for example) really bothers me when you are paying for a meal.  So I stepped to the back of the room and asked to speak with the hostess/acting manager.  I explained that I was disappointed with our long wait for food and the inattentive waitstaff.  She stared blankly at me...and had almost no response or reaction.  It was maddeningly unhelpful, and we all walked out of there commenting about what a bad dining experience it had been.   I would definitely not return, and would not recommend this place to friends.
