We were very excited when Barboncino opened in our neighborhood.  It was great at first- as good as Pauli Gs in Greenpoint and better than Toby's in south slope.  It has now fallen far behind both.  We've been consistently disappointed the last several times we've eaten there.  The crust is now flat at best, and the pies are often charred.  I don't know what happened, it's really too bad.
