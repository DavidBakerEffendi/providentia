We decided to have a family dinner at this lovely restaurant and were pleasantly surprised. Upon arrival we were brought to our table and the waiter explained to us the options concerning the tasting and prix fixe three course dinners.  We all had to be on the same page and we chose the seasonal tasting.  WOW what great offerings and the staff were both stealthy, and knowledgeable.  There were no rushed arrivals and the pause after the beef was timed perfectly. Just when you think you have had enough, the dessert offerings started to arrive.  The final dessert offering was excellent.  Even though it seems like a marathon, one does not leave feeling bloated.  This was one of our greatest dining experiences and would certainly try again.
