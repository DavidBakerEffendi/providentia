I stumbled upon this place and absolutely fell head over heels in love this is the best restaurant I and my family have ever eaten at. We had a slice of pizza for lunch a magnificent! So after an afternoon of strolling we decided to have another for dinner. Well we were talked into a complete dinner with opera singers fantastic service and truly the most delicious meal ever!!!
