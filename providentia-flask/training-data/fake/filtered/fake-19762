LIARS HERE.  BE SURE TO GET YOUR RECEIPT AND COUNT YOUR CHANGE!!!  I ordered one of the combo lunches and a bottle of soda, which the girl said was exactly 10 bucks.  This seemed a little fishy to me, so I asked for the receipt, which showed $9.57 as the total.  So, I said "You lied to me."  Her reply, "only a little."  Obviously she does not realize that lying is an either/or thing, like being pregnant.  Either you did or you didn't.  Then to top it off, she gave me the wrong change.
