I couldn't disagree more with some posters about this place:  my 13 year old daughter and I ate here on Sunday night while visiting NYC.   We are decidedly not hipsterish in any manner :) and we were warmly welcomed and treated very well. The host was even willing to take my number and call me on my out of state cell phone to let us know when our table was ready. The wait staff was very nice and helpfully explained some of the dishes for us.  We had a wonderful meal:  my daughter had the gnudi and I had the sausage (yes, the faggot with mashed potatoes). And we split an order of the incredible rosemary-tinged shoestrings as an app.   Even though the place was crowded, we weren't rushed and we had an incredible experience. The host said goodbye to us by name as we left. I am definitely returning to the Spotted Pig next time I am in NYC.
