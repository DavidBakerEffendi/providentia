I haven't been to every pizza place in the area but I've been to a few of them and so far A1 is the best.  They're open until 3AM, and though I've never taken advantage of their services quite that late, it's nice to know that you're probably not pissing someone off by placing a delivery order at 10pm or a pick up order even at midnight.  Secondly, every worker there seems to always been in a good mood.  Thirdly, they're consistent.  There's nothing mind-blowing about their food, standard pizzeria fare, but it's always EXACTLY the same each and every time I order from there.  I've never once been disappointed by a soggy pie or a thinly loaded sandwich.
