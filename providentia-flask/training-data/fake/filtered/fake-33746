Always packed, so plan to spend about an hour waiting. The price and quality of the food is superb, the staff is very friendly. Downsides: always packed, so few laps around to find a parking spot, very loud inside, a lot of people around you, no tap beer, only bottled imports. Upsides: no dishes above 15$ (maybe one or two), large portions, delicious.
