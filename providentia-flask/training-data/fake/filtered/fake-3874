Great food horrible service!! The bartender Tom had a nasty attitude from the moment he walked to our table. Our entire time there we were not checked on. However the manager Butch sat and watched as we clearly needed service. Apon leaving we had to pay a tip which clearly was not earned. When requesting the GM contact info was given a fake number. Just horrible experience.
