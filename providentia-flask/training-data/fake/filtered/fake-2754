I have never been so disgusted when it comes to customer service. The thing that upsets me most about this situation is that it happened while we were trying to pay. What was even more upsetting is that it was a place that I thoroughly enjoyed. Yesterday evening after having a wonderful day we decided to go to #cubanpetes in Montclair. We were met with a level of unprofessionalism that can not be explained in a few words. The staffs behaviors were very reflective of their manager. Not only was she disrespectful but she allowed her employees to be the same way. It's clear that they weren't schooled on how customer service works. After being met with an abundance of name calling, hand clapping and head rolling we were followed to our car and further harassed for a receipt that we did not have. This by far was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my 23 years of living after trying to give my hard earned money to these disgusting people. Thankfully I have Jesus in my heart and my mother on my mind in situations like this, cause I definitely know better than to mess up someone's situation because you dont know everyone's story. I certainly will not dish any more money out to their terrible souls and I pray that they learn what it means to be humble. They should be re trained and the staff involved should be penalized. Customer service is the first thing you learn in that business so if you didn't wanna bring me my drinks or food or collect my money you should have applied for a position that you were willing to do. I am utterly disappointed and disgusting.
