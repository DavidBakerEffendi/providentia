my friend recomended for going there to eat something special.we went to tops dinner to enjoy our diner of saturday night .AveraThe dishes seem to be hit or misge food at reasonable prices with big portions  The quesadilla had bland cheese that dripped with oil, but the salad was fresh and had some good dressing.  However, my friendordered a swordfish steak, which was tender and subtly flavored with a mix of herbsThe ambiance of the diner along with the cordial, attentive service deserve special  and spices that complemented the flavor of the fish well.mention, and make Tops Diner a standout option if you're in the area and looking fgreat place to visit.
