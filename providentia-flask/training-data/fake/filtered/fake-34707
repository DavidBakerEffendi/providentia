My fiancee and I went to Sanfords on 10/13 for lunch. We arrived about 2:30 so it wasn't too crowded, but most tables were taken. The hostess was quick to seat us and the server was over to our table soon thereafter. My girl got a pannini and I got a burger. The music was relaxing, lighting was good and atmosphere was outstanding. The only change I would have made was the chipotle aioli. It was basically red mayo. The flavor was out of character for the experience and I was a little disappointed with that. Overall.....I'll be back.
