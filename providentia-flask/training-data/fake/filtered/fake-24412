I have now moved out the area, but I still make my way to Totowa for Jimmy's Pizza...he remembers his customers and always has a great big smile upon his face.  The pizza is excellent and the salads are amazing...you get alot for the price.  For pizza Jimmy's will always be the only place me and my family go to.
