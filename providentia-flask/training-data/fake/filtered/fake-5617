I'm giving this 4 stars for food but 1 star for service. I was recently visiting my daughter and we ate dinner here. I had the steak quesadilla and she had a veggie burger. Both of which were very good (the quesadillas were very tasty!). We had the Tiramisu for dessert which was FANTASTIC!!!   I asked Michelle, our waitress, for coffee. I liked her style, dreds, laid back, but she acted if it was a real problem to be working. She came back once and I had to ask for my coffee again and my daughter asked for ketchup. She brought the coffee be never brought the ketchup. She never asked if I wanted a second cup. We also noticed that she was pissed when the hostess sat more people in her section. She made her displeasure noticeable.  So, I was pleased with my food , liked the restaurant, but would ask to be seated somewhere else if Michelle were my waitress.
