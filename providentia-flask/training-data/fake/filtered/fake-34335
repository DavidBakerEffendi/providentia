Went to the Highland Pavilion tonight with my wife and I really don't understand the hype.  The supposed view is of a very far away New York City covered by a lot of Jersey City.  Although I made a reservation and was called twice to confirm, when I arrived at the restaurant they did not have my reservation on file.  I had to show them the email I was sent and then told that they would try to find us a spot (which was in an awful little corner). At first I thought it was a bad start so I tried to stay positive.  Then the seafood appetizer arrived with an assortment of frozen, not fresh, seafood.  Honestly, I've tasted better seafood from Walmart.  The entree was the only saving grace.  The diver scallops were great.   Lastly, do not waste your time on the raspberry "napoleon."  Someone needs to explain to the chef what a Napoleon is because that's not what I had.  This is a lazy wafer and cream dessert with no thought put into it.   Overall, completely overpriced and a waste of time.  I was really looking forward to a nice dinner, unfortunately this wasn't the place to go!
