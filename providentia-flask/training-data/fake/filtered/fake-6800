A.M.A.Z.I.N.G. ! HANDS DOWN THE BEST MARRAKESH FOOD EVER ! I love the privacy and misterious way of going into this restaurant. Â You really feel like you just took a trip to Morroco to have a great taste of 5-6 different fixed traditional plates ... it's an experience you won't regret! prepare to go on an empty stomach !
