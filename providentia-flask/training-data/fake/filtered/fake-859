I LOVE THIS PLACE! I've been coming here for years. At one point I used to come like twice a week. The food is great and it's just a great place to eat and hang out, especially in the summer. There's the latest brazilian music playing and flat screen TV's which usually have the soccer games on so your entertained while you eat. All the waitresses and barmaids are very pretty and make you feel very much at home. THE FOOD IS GREAT! I almost always order the Rodizio which is Â seasoned and cooked to perfection every time and if you specify, they will cook it how you want it. The menu selection is great especially the Paella. If I had to find SOMETHING wrong it would be that the buffet/salad bar could be a little better on certain days, but that's just me nitpicking to be honest because with the menu selection they have, who is really going there for the buffet. Long story short, The food is great, girls are pretty, and the ambiance is perfect. This is the first place I bring my out of town friends. oh by the way if your American you may want to brush up on a little basic Portuguese because some of the waitresses don't speak English or know very little.
