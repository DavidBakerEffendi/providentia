I love this place!  Every time I go to NY, I have to make a stop here for some great food!  Lots of variety and every single thing I've ordered was good.  The cuban is my favorite, but like I mentioned, everything is good here.  Be sure to stop by and get yourself a snack.  There are lots of other great restaurants in the same neighborhood so it's a good place to familiarize yourself with.
