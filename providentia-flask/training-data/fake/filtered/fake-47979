Went here last night and ordered the burger for takeout. It was delicious on the way down, but NOT SO MUCH ON THE WAY BACK UP. I ate this burger at 7:00pm yesterday and I am still puking and shitting it out at 11:28am the next day. In fact, I took a break from vomiting to write this review. There are plenty of places in the area that won't give you acute food poisoning, so please AVOID!
