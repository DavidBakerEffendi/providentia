We went to Prime 16 for the first time last Thursday and it was a good experience.  Our waiter Jason was very upbeat and gave good service.  The food was good but, a couple of the beers we had ordered was unavailable which was a little disappointing.  It is one of the reasons you go to that type of restaurant.  Overall, it was a good and I'm sure we'll be going back.
