Came here last Friday night and the food was great. This place really is one of the best kept secrets on SI. We started out with calamari which was cooked to perfection and the zuppe di mussels were fabulous too!  For entrees we had their signature dishes- stuffed pork chops and seafood fra diavlo. Both were excellent!  Service was great and friendly. Can't wait to go back and try the steak. We saw one at another table and it looked amazing.
