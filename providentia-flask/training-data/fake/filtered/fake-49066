Absolutely the most genuinely kind and humble woman I have ever met. It's amazing that the place doesn't get more patronage. The store is tucked away on a busy block so it may easily get missed. The desserts my girlfriend and I have tried are excellent. We will continue to stop by whenever we walk by to support the establishment. It's a quiet and clean cafe with interesting artwork. What more could you ask for? Stop by!
