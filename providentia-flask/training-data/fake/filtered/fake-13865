OMG this place is amazing. Just left there, for the fact that it is a friday night in the city,  assumed that we would have to wait a few mins to be seated, however we were seated right away. The atmosphere is nice was a bit crowded but I completely see why. The macaroni and cheese is amazing!! and very filling. I ordered the mac and cheese as an appetizer, along with the turkey burger and fries for the main course. After eating the macaroni I was actually kind of full. The turkey burger was great as well. Price wise I think its very reasonable. My date had oysters as an appetizer with the 3 sampler mac and cheese dish for a main. Added to what I had and 2 alcoholic drinks our bill came up to 75 dollars which isn't bad at all.  I would definitely come again.
