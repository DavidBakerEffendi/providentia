As soon as we walked through the door we received a great welcoming from staff. We ordered all three courses and all of them were beyond our expectations. We started with the watermelon Sangria then went on to have the salad roll, and galaxy roll, followed by entrees, Sweet Potato Enchiladas, Pad Thai Noodles, and the Laksa Noodle Pot, and to end our already amazing meal we ordered the coconut creme pie (top 5 pies of my life!). None of us were vegetarians and we all completely enjoyed our meals even without meat! We will all be back multiple times and can't wait to share the excitement with more of our friends! For being a new restaurant in Burlington there wasn't a minute that we thought they had just opened. Everything went so smooth. We give this place 5 stars from start to finish... food, drinks, service and ambiance. This place is one of the best new restaurants in Burlington!!
