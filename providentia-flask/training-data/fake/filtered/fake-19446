Famous Hot Dogs??  Seriously???  I can't believe they have the nerve to call themselves that!   This place is awful.  If you are hoping for something resembling the old "Tony Goes" or "Casino", forgetaboutit!!  My first clue should've been when I walked in and didn't smell even a hint of food cooking!   $4.25 for a plain, ordinary hot dog (tastes like a cheap grocery store brand) with two tasteless steamed pieces of mushy green pepper and 2 unseasoned potato wedges?!   Then, the kicker, $7.75 for what they advertise as a "Rib Eye Steak with the works", when in reality it's a disgusting stack of grey Steak-Um style pressed mystery meat!!   NEVER AGAIN!
