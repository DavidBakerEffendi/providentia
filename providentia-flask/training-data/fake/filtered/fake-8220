I usually go to Yuca for dinner and I always enjoyed the great food and the nice atmosphere, and not to forget the unbelievable Latin drinks they have there. A week ago I decided to go to Yuca for lunch and I ordered the Americano (Brazilian Sandwich) and my friend Dana ordered the chicken sandwich. We both loved it, of course we took advantage of the great happy hour and ordered a pitcher of Sangria. I will definitely put Yuca on the top of my list for lunch.
