Terrible customer service. Will never come here again. Mustafa, the owner, is a straight jerk. He thinks he's always right, even when he's wrong as wrong can be. He consistently disrespects customers, as I've seen and have also been a victim. I don't even know how this place still exists. I've never, ever in my entire life seen someone who has no respect for the people who keep him in business. I hope and wish that someone who has authority over him will treat him with the same disrespect that he bestowed upon me, along with other customers.
