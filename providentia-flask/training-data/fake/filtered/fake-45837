Not only is the sushi here exceptional, but the location (right on washington square) and environment (very modern, Morimoto-esque) are just right. It's not overpriced either, for the quality of the food. The sashimi is some of the freshest tasting I've ever had, and the hand rolls are perfectly done. Magical.
