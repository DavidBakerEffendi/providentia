I'd been hearing about this place FOREVER, so I decided to finally drop in and see what the fuss was all about. Let me tell you, I'm glad I did. This spot is the BEES KNEES,YO. I ordered the noodles with mashed sesame sauce. WHOA, NELLY. If you've ever wanted to know what a full service shiatsu massage to your taste buds feels like, you have to try the mashed sesame sauce. You know why McGruff took a bite out of crime? Because it was smothered in that life changing condiment of wonder. BUT WAIT. You won't believe this, but the best part of my day happened AFTER I exited this establishment of fine dining. I had an appointment with the peeps at TinderHeadshots.com. I wanted to get some grade A, professional photos for my Tinder profile, because the one I have now where I'm petting my orange tabby, Mr. Snugglesworth, gives off an evil genius, I plan to take over the world vibe. When I got there, I had that delicious, delicious mashed sesame sauce dripping down my face. You know what these cats at Tinder Headshots did? They wiped it off my chin. They made me look like a presentable human being. Crazy, right? Did I mention the tasteful cardigan I had on was DRENCHED in that awe inspiring mashed sesame sauce? I wanted to keep it on during the photo shoot and just suck on the collar between set ups. THEY WERE HAVING NONE OF THAT. These dudes helped me into some new threads, and had me looking like a Don Juan at senior prom. Once I score a hot date on Tinder using these photos, I'm bringing my new lady friend to Prosperity Dumpling!
