Really nice bar for a date, quiet and inviting environment. I like the theme, and the bartenders are friendly and know what they are doing Only thing I didnt like was their selection on certain liquors, like gin. I wasnt crazy about the gin martini i got, not because they made it bad, but because i got a new gin i never had and it was mediocre. Nice beer selection and owner or manager was very friendly They also have a mini grocery section which is pretty cool
