Fuji Mountain did an outstanding job hosting a party this past weekend for my wife's 40th birthday.  We'd booked a few months in advance and a short meeting with the manager Sean set us up for success.  Sean hit all the right notes on menu selection and attention to our group.  The karaoke room was exactly the right size for our group of 40, with great lighting and a dedicated bar -- and terrific bartenders! For the fixed price we negotiated for the party, Sean absolutely buried us in food -- two enormous sushi boats, negimaki, teriyaki, tempura, gyoza, you name it, we had it  -- and was ready with delicious vegetarian options too if we needed them.  (Although another reviewer didn't like the calamari rings, I actually really loved them, but as with everything, it's a matter of preference.) I will definitely recommend Fuji Mountain to anyone looking to host a karaoke party.  We'd looked at another restaurant (rhymes with Hockey Story Boy) which quoted us prices literally double Fuji Mountain's, and are very happy with the experience. Thanks to the FM staff for a terrific night!
