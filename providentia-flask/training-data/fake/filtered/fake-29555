i am annoyed...ordered the catfish sandwich and rec'd one half of a piece of fish. YES..one half of a piece of fish. we all know that catfish isn't that expensive...why would they insult their customers and themselves by putting one half of a fish on a plate?!?!? this isn't the first time this happened...this is their standard serving for a catfish sandwich. i would rather they charge more for the sandwich than put a half of a piece of fish on the plate. i am not a pork eater. my catfish sandwich tasted like pork. i think the sandwich was prepared on the same grill or the same oil as the bacon...just awful. oh and by the way, if you are thirsty, don't look to get anything good there, the arnold palmer tastes awful. i am also not comfortable with the way that the water for the table is stored...it is stored in an old plastic bucket and the water (yes WATER) tastes bad.
