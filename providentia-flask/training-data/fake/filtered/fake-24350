Great food, service, decor and affordable. My sister and I got the pork and chicken tacos and they were delicious. Our check was less than $20, the waitress was attentive and the food was very fresh. Guacamole is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood and we can't wait to go back to try the other items on the menu.
