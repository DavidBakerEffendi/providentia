The food is really good: very fresh ingredients and the proteins (the chicken in particular) are so beautifully seasoned and tender. My problem is with the quality of service. I usually use one of the food apps to place my pick-up and delivery orders from them. They consistently get parts of my order incorrect. I even tried calling them after I order using the app to make sure they don't forget certain items. When I call I always get brusque, bordering on rude responses to my reminders. Even after calling, my order isn't correct. It's not a language barrier problem; it's a care for the customer problem. At this point, I no longer eat here. I'll make the trip to Beijing on Spruce or to Han Dynasty for my chinese cuisine needs. Such a shame because Chilli Szechuan is much closer to where I live and I like supporting businesses in close proximity to my 'hood'.
