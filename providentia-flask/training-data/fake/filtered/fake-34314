I really hate sushi for some odd reason, but on my company trip to Sushi Yasuda, they made me change my opinion towards raw fish! Now I love it after the first time eating it here. The taste of it was fresh combined with the wasabi. Food was definitely tasty and the service was fast. I would come back most definitely.
