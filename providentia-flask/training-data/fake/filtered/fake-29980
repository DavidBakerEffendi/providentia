THIS PLACE IS AMAZING. Chris our server was so great, funny and totally on point with recommendations. The clam linguini is my favorite and of course all the east coast oysters MMmmmmmm.... I could eat 2 dozen! This is such a great place for a date or small group. We started with oysters and worked our way down the entire menu SUCH A BLAST and totally worth spending money on GREAT FOOD. PS try their special HOTT SAUCE yummy!
