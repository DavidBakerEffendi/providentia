After reading some poor reviews I was hesitant to go here but thought I'd give it a try anyway.  My wife loves hibachi.  Went Friday night.  Started off at lounge area for a drink.  My wife had a specialty drink recommended by our bartender Amanda and wife raved about it.  The overall experience was fun and food quiet good.  I have learned not to give too much stock in poor reviews and glad I chose to dine here!  We will definitely be coming back in the future.
