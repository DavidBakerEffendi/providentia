This is my hands down favorite place in NYC for pizza.   My boyfriend and I split an "Old Fashioned ($20)" with pepperoni (+$3) and Kalamta Olives ($3) with a side of Meatballs ($10).  I literally was stuffed by the end of it, it was AMAZING! (And we have leftovers) The pizza was perfectly made and the meatballs were so great! Oh and when you are seated inside (which was more quiet than outside on Stone Street) they gave us each a piece of bread and oil+Balsamic which was also perfect.   I am bringing everyone I know here.  I am in love!
