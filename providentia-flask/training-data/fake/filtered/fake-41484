Oh man, try the Train Wreck Po' Boy...it'll change your life.  Eat at the counter if you can.  Breakfast, the chicory coffee (don't add any sugar or milk til after you try it; it's a coffee drinker's coffee) and the egg po boy with andouille.  The andouile will be undoing.  In a way I hate living right near this because I'm tempted to eat here 3 meals a day.  And very friendly people to boot!
