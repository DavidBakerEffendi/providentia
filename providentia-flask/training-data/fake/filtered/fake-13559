I went to Distilled with a friend on 9/6. Upon entering the restaurant your senses are immediately filled, but not overwhelmed. The bar seemed lively, the music was good and at a volume that allowed for conversation at a normal speaking tone. We were warmly welcomed by the hostess and waitstaff. It is evident that service is the focus of this establishment. I like that the waitstaff were not  wearing all black. They are a young energetic group who wear tasteful colorful clothing reflecting this. As a professional in the industry I appreciated the open kitchen.  It was busy and  run as a welled oiled machine. It takes a high level of confidence to be that transparent. We ordered the wings, a burger, the kale and carrot salad with the onion rings. Most of the sauces are served on the side, I think this is brilliant for 2 reasons. First, the standard sauces like Bearnaise when done well is very good as it is here at Distilled. Second, when you serve on the side without asking you tell your customers how important what they want is. I prefer wine over cocktails but the offering of the cocktails seemed enticing. The wine list was representative of varied tastes, the Argentine Malbec was sublime. Dessert left me speechless. We ordered three, the dessert special, bread pudding, lemon sorbet, and the smores.  I was fascinated by how the sorbet was already refreshing and was elevated to a new height  by the addition of a prosaic jello and compressed watermelon.  Sm-ores, burnt marshmallow painted on the side of the bowl with dark chocolate mousse next to crunchy graham cracker. Amazing!  Bread pudding, I love when old standards are just gosh darn done well! To summarize, it's rare to find an establishment that combines great food and excellent service. So what are you waiting for, get down to Distilled.
