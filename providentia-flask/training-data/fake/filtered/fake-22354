My daughter is 15 years old and has a gluten allergy.  East West says that they will make things gluten free.  Tonight we had take out from there, one dinner was supposed to be gluten free, nothing was marked.  I called to see which one was, and they told me they had made one gluten free, then there was discussion and a female came back on the phone and she said the kitchen confused the order and made one without onions.  This is a big deal!  Onions or gluten. Big difference!  If someone askes for gluten free, there is an obvious reason for it.  The staff took this very lightly and it is not something to be taken lightly. We used to love this place, not any more!!!
