Was just here on Sun 06/01/2014 and it was delicious - I ordered the Spanish omelet and pineapple upside down pancakes....with cream cheese frosting (short stack) OMG so yummy and the omelet has chorizio which gives it such a authentic flavor...Service is always pleasant and upbeat... This is Ewing's best kept secret in my book. Always a good experience!
