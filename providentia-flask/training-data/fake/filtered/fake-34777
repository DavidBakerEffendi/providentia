I was given the job of making a reservation and it needed to be in the area of. Barn Joo sound good and had the right price range. I did not expect the great experience we had. For one the ambiance is great. It is modern, stylish, clean and hip but not overwhelming. They have signature drinks using traditional Korean spirits Then the food started coming and it was a wonderful "nouveau" take on traditional Korean food. Even a Korean native who was with us enjoyed it thoroughly. And the service was very attentive and quick. Barn Joo is now on my list and also to use as a recommendation for other people.
