BEWARE! Lui Lui has a menu which appears to make them a gluten intolerant friendly restaurant. Many of their items are indicated as being able to be made gluten free, including pasta dishes that can be prepared with gluten free pasta. Yet, they are careless in preparation! Today I ordered a gluten free pasta dish and ate several bites. After ten years with celiac disease I have a good feel for the texture of gluten free items, I had my doubts about this dish from the being. Of course, my entree was NOT made gluten free. The restaurant was then basically indifferent about my plight offering me a free dessert to make up for their mistake (great, since I'm already sick!). They then proceeded to charge me for the meal! Of course, they had brought me a replacement "gluten free" meal that had crunchy and undercooked pasta . In summary, if you are gluten intolerant DO NOT trust the kitchen at Lui Lui.
