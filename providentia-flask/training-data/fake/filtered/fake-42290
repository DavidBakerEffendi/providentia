If I had to choose one word that describes how I feel about Room Service, it would be DISAPPOINTED. Don't get me wrong, the ambiance can definitely fool you when you walk into the restaurant: chandeliers, perfectly matched gray hues that mesh into the floors, furniture and bar... You think you're going to be wow'ed. A friend of mine who works for the same company as I chose this in hopes to be able to plan a departamental function. So, what better way to try it out than on our lunch break with a friend new to the area. I wish I could write, the service was great, or that the food was amazing. I CAN write about how I walked in when there were no other tables filled, saw the restaurant get packed and die down again WITHOUT A MOUTHFUL OF FOOD. I CAN write that I asked for a manager 4 times and all that was getting told to me was "oh you're food's coming" with nothing to show for it. And I can CERTAINLY write about how we were flat out denied an audience of a manager from a waiter. I can also say I had to order from another Thai place and eat at my desk after using my hour lunch break waiting for them. As you can probably guess, there will be no company function being held there. So I advise all who are fooled by the good price and pretty light fixtures, DON'T DO IT!
