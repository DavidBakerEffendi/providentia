I will never return to Pates Et Traditions. I was a regular there and I was soo ashamed by the treatment I received by the owners. I usually go there alot and never had any  real big issues until tonight... Yes the food is great but the service and treatment is awful. I always tip well and its not like im cheap or rude. I went there with my mother and family from out of state and I raved about this place to them so when we got there we put our name and they knew who we were. We waited in the cold for about 30 minutes the sister/owner of the place comes out and calls us, that our table is ready. We sit down get our water, we then ask the waiter for the dessert menu, about 10 minutes later the owner comes to us and says that shes sorry but she has to ask us to leave because they don't serve just dessert on Friday or Saturday night . LIKE REALLY??? WE WERE SITTING IN OUR SEATS ALREADY!!! THIS IS 2013 not the 1860's I never thought racism and/or discrimination I should say,  still existed. I'm a Hispanic/Black large woman. Maybe they didn't want overweight Hispanic and Black people to ruin the atmosphere I think that's horrible customer service especially if you are already at your table. Ive lived in NYC my whole life, I'm a local and Ive never encountered that...WHO DOES THAT??? THE OWNERS OF PATES Et TRADITIONS SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES!!!! AND THE TREATMENT OF REGULAR CUSTOMERS!! THIS IS NOT PARIS FRANCE TO TREAT REAL NEW YORKERS BORN AND RAISED LIKE THAT!!! NEXT TIME HAVE A SIGN THAT SAYS WE DO NOT SERVE JUST DESSERT ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT!!! for those reading this??!! the crepes are good but this place is over rated there's plenty of places in Williamsburg  that are even better. DON'T PATRONIZE A DISCRIMINATIVE PLACE LIKE THIS....NO ONE DESERVES THAT TYPE OF TREATMENT!!! IF THEY CAN DO IT TO A REGULAR CUSTOMER THEY CAN DO IT TO YOU!!!! I WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!! THEY JUST LOST A GOOD AND FAITHFUL CUSTOMER :( "Comment from Laurent D. of Pates Et Traditions 1/8/2013   God bless you For your info  Owner  she s black , Waiter also , an others waiter are from marocco, belgium , and about me French backround( sicilian, Malte , and English...) Just : stupidity do not hâve colour !" In response to  Laurent D of Pates Et Traditions comment: Well at least you admit they are stupid... no worries I will never return to your establishment. Who wants to be treated that way? She asked us to leave after we already sat down at our table.  I felt singled out  and discriminated against. Racism has no color either!!!! you can be black, from Malte, from France, from italy and still be racist or discriminate against people. If it wasnt my race then your establishment was being financially discriminative because I wasnt spending enough money as if my money wasnt good enough cause I came with a few people for desserts only. well what was it then?? If that is your policy during the weekend?!?! have a sign up on the wall, put it on your website and tell them to be smart enough to tell customers before they sit down and get embarrassed . Communicate with your customers the proper way. Let them enjoy your establishment. Don't make them feel like they are in the way, not proper enough or rush them out. You had a good and loyal customer and I told every one about how great your establishment was and now its ruined. By you making that statement proves to everyone that your rude and have awful customer service. Like I said NO WORRIES THIS SO CALLED STUPID CUSTOMER WILL NEVER RETURN TO YOUR ESTABLISHMENT AGAIN. God Bless you also... you need it..
