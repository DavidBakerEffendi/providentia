The atmosphere is very eccentric and our waiter Alex was very nice and patient. That's y I gave three stars. My mardi gras drink was not strong and my friends drink ( I forget what it's called) had a weird after taste. I did not want to be cliche and order the infamous buttermilk waffles and chicken so I ordered the lobster shrimp and grits. Didn't like my dish too much--it lacked flavor. My friend ordered the chicken and waffles and we ended up switching plates. The waffles were good but the chicken lacked flavor as well. Maybe because my west Indian taste buds are used to seasoning. I would give this place another try though
