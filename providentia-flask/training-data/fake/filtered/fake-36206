I'm 100 % Peruvian and I always on the look for the restaurant that can provide a great taste of my country so I went to this place and I ordered the Ceviche and Lomo saltado.  I was very disappointed my Ceviche was not as good the calamari tasted funny and the squid horrible.  The lomo saltado the stake tasted overcooked.  The service was great but for the price is no as good quality food you will expect..
