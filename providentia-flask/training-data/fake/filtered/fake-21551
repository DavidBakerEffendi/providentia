Claire had a visa payment sticker on the door, however, when I tried purchasing a drink for $5 with visa, I was denied service because there must be a $10 minimum on card payment. It is not true because it applies to credit cards only and I wanted to pay debit. I was denied the service, the owner did not offer any other alternative than making me purchase a gift card and then she said she does not like fees associated with visa. Absolutely disappointing place, I am never going there again. Smaller businesses in this case always offer at least an apology or try to work out an alternative.
