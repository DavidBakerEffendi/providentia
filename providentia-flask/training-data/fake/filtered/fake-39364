The only reason Moto doesn't get a fifth star is because of its cramped layout and discomfort on crowded evenings, but it's truly a marvelous joint.  Stepping into Moto is stepping into a bygone era, and amidst the standard-issue trendy bistros of Williamsburg, it rises above.  The magic in this restaurant lies in the caliber of the food and the live entertainment.  The interior glows on a cold winter night, and the "date cake" is so exquisitely delectable, it brings tears to your eyes.  Seriously.  The date cake sauce is so savoury and buttery that you'll want to lick the plate.
