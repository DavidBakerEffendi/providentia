Best pizza I have ever had! This pizza really is dreamy. Even thinking about it makes me want to make another nyc trip asap! We just get the plain pizza which is $14. Everything tastes so fresh and makes you wish you ordered a pizza just for yourself. The crust and sauce are sweet with the creamy mozzarella, which makes it marvelous. I would probably wait in line even if it was 3 hours but we only waited around 20 min! It is a bit hectic inside but it is so worth!
