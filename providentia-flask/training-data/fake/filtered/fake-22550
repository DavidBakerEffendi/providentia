I love this place. The food is always fresh and tastes good. It's always clean and my order is made quickly. The only problem with coming here is that I can never decide what to order. Today I went with the pesto burger and onion rings. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a quick meal that is good quality and priced right. I can easily go home full for less than $10.
