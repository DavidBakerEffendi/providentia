I eat here often.  Food is ok.  Staff are attentive.  The recent visit was dinner for 4.  Ordered appetizers,  corned beef spring rolls and fritters.  Ok big mistake, corned beef and corned beef has are not the same.  We alerted the waitress we were no pleased and the manager, Matt doronty?  Came by and inquired, he the shared that we ordered two of the worst appetizers they have,  he explained they are experimenting with some new ones and brought us a nice cheese platter and potatoes pancakes on the house. Dinner came and Matt stopped by, everything was very good? Some logistical errors, food to go was tossed by accident and a new order was provided. Drink glass was cracked, he the corrected that. Needles to say, there are always minor incidents when eating out, it is inevitable.   The proof is in how it is handled.   These minor blips were handled professionally and I will be back to see the other new items.
