Now I see why it's so hard to get a table... The food is amazing. We were 3 people & we got 6 dishes + dessert. The chilaquiles was the standout!  I wish we had room to try more things. We missed out on the fried chicken tacos that the table next to us had.  Don't make that mistake. Also, the cucumber margarita is really good for a refreshing cocktail.  Service was friendly and attentive, too.  Can't wait to go back!
