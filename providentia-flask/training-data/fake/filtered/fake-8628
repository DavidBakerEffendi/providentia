I came to Philadelphia on a business trip. One of my coworkers heard that High Note Cafe was a great place so we decided to check it out. When the taxi driver dropped us off, I was surprised that it was in a regular neighborhood - not on a main street. As we walked in, there was a counter for ordering pizza to go. The server met us and brought us to a small dining room. There were about 10 or 11 tables and most of them were full. My coworker ordered fried calamari for all of us - four of us. The fried calamari was terrible! It was overcooked, very chewy, but the marinara sauce was delicious. The server brought us some dinner rolls - knots specifically. They were burnt and bland - no seasonings. I ordered the shrimp scampi over linguine. Now, this was really good! The shrimp and pasta were perfectly cooked. I love wine/garlic sauces and this one was amazing. I nearly licked the bowl clean. The owner (I assume he's the owner) sang a few opera songs while we were eating. I'm deaf so I didn't really care but my coworkers said he was really good. There was also a pianist. Everyone there were very nice and friendly. I would go back - only to eat the shrimp scampi over linguine if I was in the area again.
