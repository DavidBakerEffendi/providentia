Great food! Homemade and fresh! Very friendly (and funny) staff with Chef Marie still cooking all the great food! Restaurant has relocated and is better than ever- always clean and better parking than the previous place. Best falafel in miles and the tabouli salad cannot be compared to. Forget that store bought hummus- this is real hummus and the best, for a comparable price and greater quantity, not to mention the fresh and real ingredients. And the restaurant is BYOB!! Nice quaint cozy atmosphere and makes you feel like you are in your mom's house. This restaurant is a MUST GO if you are in town. You will not be disappointed!
