For lunch I had the lobster which was really nice but nothing amazing. However, my friends and I really did love the restaurant! My friends enjoyed their meals and despite my EXTREMELY slight negative comment on the lobster, I would recommend people on going and I would definitely go back. My rating is a lot higher than 3, though maybe not quite 4 just based on my personal opinion of the lobster.
