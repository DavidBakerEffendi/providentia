I came here on a Friday night a couple weeks ago where 2 girls were working. The one was on her phone as I was ordering drink, and they were more busy talking to themselves as opposed to the customers. Generally speaking, I am not a complainer. Â This place has decent food so the one thing that will have people coming back for more is the service. And this is not a club, so service matters on the weekends, especially. I'm not sure if my friends and I will choose this place as a pre-game place again.
