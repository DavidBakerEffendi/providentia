When walking through the front door of Dempsey's for a good night out with two of my  friends Ed & Adam, I couldn't help but notice what a s@%# hole this place really was.  Dark, dirty, and out dated is how I'm describing this joint, but there were surprisingly more than a few really cute girls having a good time....eating peanuts, which is part of the restaurants theme is to eat them and throw the shells on the ground.
