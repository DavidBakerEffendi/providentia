Service was slow, despite there not being may people in the establishment.  The prices are not in proportion to the sizes. This is another example of a restaurant charging full price for bite-sized dishes.  There are plenty of good authentic Mexican places around.  Leave this one for the douches who like to overpay for slow service and small bites of food.
