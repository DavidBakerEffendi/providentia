Probably don't go here for the hard stuff. I ordered a revolver of SoCo Lime and the bartender gave me the stink-eye. Momentarily. then we had a laugh about my liver's ability to survive in formaldehyde. They're a great bunch of guys over there and the atmosphere is very friendly, if a bit overly-hipster (if that affects your opinion of a place). We were a party of eight and had a great time there mid-September. Long tables, plenty of room and not boisterous at all. The snacks are relatively inexpensive, if limited to basic fried stuff (fries, pretzels, bratwurst, etc) but dude, this is a bar, not a pub.
