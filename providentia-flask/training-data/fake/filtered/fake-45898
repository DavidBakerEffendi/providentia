Had reservations for 7:30pm our Creek salad showed up by 740 and there we died! No waitress until I called her over no food, at 8:45 I asked for the manager, he came over and asked what the problem was. I thought it was obvious NO FOOD! He said he would look into the problem and he disappeared. wrong! what he should of done was make good their irresponsibility, we at this point decided to get up and leave. What a waste of what could of been a great evening.
