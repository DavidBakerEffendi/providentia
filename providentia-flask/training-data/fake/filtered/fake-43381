I've checked out Hawthornes off and on since they opened last year. Â And I had hoped it would get better - it hasn't. I know nothing about the food here, so I won't comment on that - I am a beer guy, and Hawthornes makes itself hard to like. It is certainly the most expensive bottle shop in the city, which doesn't make much sense - considering the location and relations to Bella Vista. The selection is ok - but skews very heavily to the Bella Vista family of beers - seemingly to the detriment of the other great beers and breweries we can get in the Philadelphia region. The growler concept again would be fantastic - if the prices were anywhere near reality - and what's with the glass price - aren't those things like $5 everywhere else that has ever sold them. Finally, it's the attitude towards the beer that gets me more than anything else - a certain arrogance not to expose a new craft beer drinker to great beer - but to rip them off at every opportunity - this is not the spirit of american craft beer. So, go to the Foodery, go to Brew, and go to Food and Friends to buy great beer - they embrace the craft beer ethos and embrace the customer, alike.
