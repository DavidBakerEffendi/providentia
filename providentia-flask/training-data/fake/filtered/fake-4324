This restaurant turned out to be quite a pleasant surprise. You really have to set aside the fact that it is extremely tiny, and the tables are quite cramped in there. I was hoping for a romantic, intimate evening, but we were right on top of the table beside us -- so much so that the server had to reach over our heads to hand them their dishes or pour them more water. With all of that said, the food was absolutely fantastic. The menu is limited (5 each of appetizer, entree, dessert), but with such quality you do not need to trouble yourself with a thousand choices. All of the dishes we ordered were delicious. They were creatively put together, and the flavors melded very well. Â  Note for the non-seafood eaters: there are no chicken or vegetarian alternatives here. This restaurant is very appropriately named!
