we had dinner there last night. we went in at 6:00PM so there werent that many people. so we ordered our meal around 6:15PM. we waited 15 minutes for first dish... and then 45 minutes later, we got our second dish, anther 10 minute to receive our third and fourth dish.......the house started filling up around 7. The portion is super small. the last dish, sirlon steak over a hot rock, $25, six small slices.. i was like, HOLY COW!!! i can put all six slices in my mouth at the same time, definitely not WORTH $25. I had many Japanese meal in the city but this one tops my NOT-TO-GO list.. we ended up going to a Japanese noodle soup place at 52nd between 8th & 9th Ave to fill up our stomach...... what a night and what a experience!!!
