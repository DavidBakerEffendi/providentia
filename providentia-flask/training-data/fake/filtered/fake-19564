The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is because there is better Soul food down South but only slightly better. I have never been disappointed with anything I've eaten at Great Jones Cafe. The food is consistently excellent and I highly recommend the Po' Boy and pulled pork sandwiches. It is a small place so getting seating for parties larger than two can be difficult but on the flipside, it's a great place to take a date or your significant other. If you find yourself craving some Cajun cooking while in the East Village, you can't do better than this place.
