I live in Wooster square and laugh hard when I see people wait in line. NO one from the neighborhood will wait in the line, thats for first timers and out of towners. For starters this is the BEST pizza New Haven has to offer, hands down. Its consistent and for pizza this is what I like. Good luck trying to find that Pepe's ( To greezy or dry) or Modern ( Undercooked or brunt to high hell). They are very old school as are all the pizza places on Wooster. But its obvious it works as they are all world known. If you want the best pizza, just order the plain ( sauce) with garlic and grated cheese. Its perfection,and a real pizza, that why mozzarella is extra, Its considered a topping. But I have yet to have a bad pizza. O or try mozz, pepperoni and onion  !!!! AMAZING !!! I've got to learn the staff and how to deal with them. So listen up ! 1.) POLITE , always be very polite. This is old school Italian so don't think because its a pizza place they owe you something. If you don't like the service they don't care. But if you are polite and show respect you will get it. Remember half the people are from out of town and they will most likely never see you again so they don't care. 2.)If you want to eat in there, go there after 9PM and you will have no problem sitting down and getting a pie. 3.) If you don't want to wait  you can reserve a table or pie in advance. usually if I know I want one around the weekend I will go there and make a reservation. Talk to the old woman in the booth next to the register. She will take your reservation. You can reserve a booth or just a pizza for when ever you want, regardless if its a few hours later or days later. Good luck enjoy and don't wait in line !
