This place is delicious!  My mouth is still savoring the various sauces that came with the homemade tortillas as an app, and the shrimp in my "El Sol" were exquisite.   I'm not a great food reviewer, but after eating here tonight I feel really compelled to let other people know just how good my dining experience was. The chef came out to answer any questions and take our order, made a vegan plate for my friend, and the entire dining experience was superb. I hope this place sticks around, they really do it right.
