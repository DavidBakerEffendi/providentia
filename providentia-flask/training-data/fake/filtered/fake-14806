There should be negative stars for this place. We  went on a Thursday night, restaurant had barely 10 ppl. The hostess was nowhere to be found, for ten mins. We just needed some takeout and had to wait for a couple to finish ordering at d counter before we could get our turn.  The hostess was dumb beyond measure, she couldn't help the couple before us with their food, nd they left in a huff after pursuing the menu for an eternity. Finally when we did get our turn the hostess went off again, asked us to wait nd check the menu. She finally comes back after taking a stroll in the restaurant, confused woman, didn't know where to go what to do. She comes back, takes a call instead of saying something to us and asking us for our order. The  confused woman then started making reservations for some group, on the phone, all the while still ignoring us...that was it... We just walked out after waiting for like 15 mins to simply order takeout, nd still the woman wouldn't utter a word of apology. Place was smelling funny inside too, nd the desire to serve was not there. Sad to see such a place....wouldn't step back in this place ever! M glad we didn't order the takeout either, m not sure what to expect after this.
