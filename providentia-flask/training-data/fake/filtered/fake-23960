This place is a standout when compared to everything else in the area.  Its super clean, very friendly service, and their menu has items which are unique to this restaurant. We stopped by while driving through NJ based on the reviews as we had already tried most of the other spots in Edison.  Upon entering the owner prompty greeted and seated us - argubally one of the nicest restarant owners I have met.  We ordered a a paneer kati roll, a vada pav (as per the owners recommendation), a paneer methi (as per the owners recommendation), and samosa chaat.  The owner offered plenty of recommendations and highly recommended the paneer methi which I am glad we tried.  All of the items were amazing, a touch on the spicier side, but really really flavorful.  The paneer kati roll had a bit of a Mexican flavor which I appreciate as it was a change of pace compared to everything else.  The paneer methi was probably the best item we tried and it is a dish that no other restaurant in the area offers.  This is a very low key and simple place with great flavors, even better service, and very clean.  I really appreciate it when owners go out of their way to welcome guests and treat them the way the owner of this establishent treated us.  Even if the food had been subpar (which it was not), I would still give it a 5 start due to the geneoristy and niceness of the owner.  It would be great to support an establishment such as Talk of the Town in the tough Edison market because its clear the owner really cares about his product and his customers.
