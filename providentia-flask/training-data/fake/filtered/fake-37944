Unfortunately star just based on slow service - husband and I walked out before getting to try any food. Took 15 min before waiter got to taking our drink/food orders.  With our growing appetites couldn't help but notice couple sated after us had already received and finished their apps.  Over 30 min after placing our order and no one checking on us - decided it was time to leave. (PS - restaurant week so shouldn't prix fixe cold apps be ready to bring out)? On our way out waiter apologized profusely after he realized we never got our food (suspect miscommunication with his "runner/server").  Politely told him we know he's swamped (restaurant week/Friday), and while he was friendly to tell his manager he needs extra help. Based on other reviews criticizing slow service, doesn't sound like food is worth the wait.
