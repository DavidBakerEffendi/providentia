I should have read the reviews before coming. Worst experience I have ever had during lunch. My wife and I came here during a busy time. Now, I understand if there is a slight delay in service - fine with me! However! Here's what happened: 1) came in by the waiting area. Stood there for about 5 mins until the waitress approached me. 2) she said she will give me the seats that I was standing next to as soon as the other party leaves. 3) other customers fall in line behind me. Another lady (by the cashier), tells the other customers to sit at the table that I was supposed to sit in. 4) 3rd group of customers come - they sit by the bar stools. Giving up, because my waitress hasn't approached me after all of this, my wife and I sit on the bar style table. 5) the other two groups of customers first get their menus (given by another guy - not the waitress). again, we were last to get our menu - which by the way is very limited in terms of crepe selections. 6) two waitresses come and take the orders of these two customers - again we were last to give our order. 7) the original waitress that spoke to me felt bad so she moved us to better seating - great! 8) so we wait.........while waiting! i noticed that the two other customers got their food first (which is also fine, ours may have taken longer to make). But then, they also got dessert...and got their checks and one already left. Meanwhile, we were still waiting for our food. SO food comes...my panini was slightly burnt - you can taste the bitterness. The turkey was a bit dry. Same with my wife's panini - her chicken panini was dry and burnt. This was during my lunch hour so I was already very late. I had to get a box for the other half sandwich. The ambiance was nice and clean enough. Staff is not very helpful. Service was painfully slow. Safe to say that I will never go back there again.
