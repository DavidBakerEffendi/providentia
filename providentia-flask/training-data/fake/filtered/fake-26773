The food was great, the portions were great and the price was great!  Outstanding in every respect even though we had to wait for an hour and a half for a table.  The staff was also incredible.  We were a party of four with one blind person and were positioned under a speaker with music.  We asked if something could be done to accommodate and they promptly lowered the volume which was highly appreciated.   Five stars for food and service all around.  We've been to the Astoria location before and the East Village location lived up in every respect.  Thank you, Kyclades.
