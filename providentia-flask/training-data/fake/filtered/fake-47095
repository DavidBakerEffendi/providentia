Great bar, great service..some of the hardest working servers in any bar I've ever been to. They'll even park your car for you..which is a plus considering new haven parking. My girlfriend and I came in a Friday and we had a great time. The server, Brandon was very friendly and made sure we had everything we needed. Would be a five star, but the nachos were a little burnt. All in all I would recommend this bar to friends and family.
