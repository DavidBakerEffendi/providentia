I have never written a review before for any restaurant.  I went to Silk City two weeks ago for Sunday brunch and it was by far one of my best brunch experiences ever.  I had one of the brunch specials: braised pork belly over ginger jalopeno grits with fried eggs and grilled endive.  It was truly amazing! This is me officially begging the powers that be at Silk City to put this on the brunch menu permanently ! To top it off, my cocktail, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of, was delicious as well.  It was something with grapefruit.  Silk City seriously made my day. Keep up the GREAT work guys!
