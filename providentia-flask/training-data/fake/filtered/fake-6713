I have no complaints about this place.  I sat at the bar for a late tapas dinner on a weeknight and it was GREAT!  Everything was really tasty and the prices were fair.  I went with a friend and our bill was about $120, but we ordered 4 tapas and what must be 8 drinks (which were all great). I will say that the sangria was not my favorite sangria, but it was still really good!  True sangria.   I got this amazing bread pudding dessert.  I think it was dulce de leche bread pudding or something similar.  It wasn't an everday thing, but ask if they have anything like it.  It was great! The bartender that night was very sweet, talkative, and attentive.  The place is also very cozy.  Lighting was just right.   Loved it!
