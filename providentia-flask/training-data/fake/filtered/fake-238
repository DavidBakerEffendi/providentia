Pat's over Geno's by a small crapy margin!!!! FML for having to taste Geno's then to Pat's!!! The meat had more falvor than Geno's but really by not much.  Same cardboard texture with a bit more spices..  If I were to be deserted in Philly and Pat's and Geno's were then only two places open (what a nightmare), I would have to eat at Pat's... Btw, if you ever need a plastic knife to cut your sandwich into smaller pieces for whatever reason, make sure to take your own from home because the idiot cashier will not help you out..   The point:  avoid this place just like you avoided Geno's; they both suck big time and their fake so called rivalry has added to their good for nothing fame.
