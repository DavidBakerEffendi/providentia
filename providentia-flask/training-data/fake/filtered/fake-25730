I have been to Katzs many times I love the Pastrami and CormBeef  Rubens but this weekend the pastrami was all Fat and thin as paper I don't know what happened .i asked the waitress all she said was oh sometimes we get a meat that's fatty really . Good thing for coleslaw  I'm giving them a rest . I was very disappointed  for the first time ever with their food .
