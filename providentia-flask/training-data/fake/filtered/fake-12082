Delicious Italian meals.  No overly sauced, huge "Italian American" dishes here.  This gals the real deal.  Makes each daily special, each Panini, each salad from scratch.  Not sure how Gaia's staying in business with only charging $5.00 per Panini, but, we'll happily continue to buy them should she have to raise the price one day.  Gaia makes the sandwich bread daily - thin, crunchy, unforgettable. Favs:  Polenta with gorgonzola, Panini Milanese, Lasagne, Salads, and the cookies - chocolate nut and lemon.    The Cappu's are true Italian quality as well. Delicioso!
