About 2 weeks ago, we ordered take out, a regular pie and a sicilian pie. We waited for 40 minutes at the store because they forgot that the dough had to rise. Really! A week later we ordered pizza for a party, and when we went to pick up, they had try to call us to let us know, they ran out of dough. Are you serious? Not the way to start the new ownership. Never again.
