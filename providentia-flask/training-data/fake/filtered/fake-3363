While I was visiting my daughter and son-in-law in New York CIty, they took me to one of their favorite lunch spots - Five Tacos, on St. marks Place. I was impressed! This  is a real find in the city. The tacos were really delicious.  I do like Mexican food , but too often it can be greasy and heavy, This food has a wonderful fresh, clean, light taste. I like the open kitchen, where you can see what's being prepared. They'll even give you a sample to help you decide.  It's a cozy spot and what also impressed me was how clean everything was!  When we were there, they were whipping up a fresh batch of guacamole - amazing!  The owner was very friendly and accommodating. And to top it all, the prices can't be beat!  Definitely a place to try for great tacos on a budget!
