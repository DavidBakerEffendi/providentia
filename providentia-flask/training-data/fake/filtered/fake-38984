We've recently moved to the neighborhood and my wife and I came across Da Andrea 3 weeks ago. We were so welcomed the last time(only having an appetizer and glass of wine while waiting for the movie across the street to start) that we had to come back for dinner. So, this Thursday we just walked in with another couple to have dinner. The waiter was charming and quite funny. He told us the specials which is what I had. A stuffed chiken Milanese. excellent!! my wife had a green pasta (or the sauce was green) it was very good but the pesto totally overpowered the dish. the chef seems to have a heavy hand.Our guests seem to enjoy their dinner. Everyone was very helpful, and the owner came by to ask how our dinner was. (a nice touch) The deserts were superb, all homemade! We will definitely return.
