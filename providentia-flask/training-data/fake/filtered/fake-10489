Princeton Soup and Sandwich company is truly a great establishment. Not only do they have amazing fresh and delicious soups every time I go eat there, they have great costumer service and try to get to know their costumers. My favorite of their sandwiches has to be the Turkey Day, there cranberry horse radish spread is amazing and unique, I've never had any such thing at any other restaurant.
