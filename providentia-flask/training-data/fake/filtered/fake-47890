The first time I went to Contra, it was a disaster. I live nearby and had wanted to try it for a long time, but after 90 minutes, my guest and I had only received our first course and were too hungry to wait for the next four. Contra had just opened, kinks were bound to happen, so I gave it another chance. And I am so glad I did!!!!!! The meal was absolutely magical. From the amazing homemade bread (extra $3, and SO worth it!) to the perfectly cooked chicken to the wonderfully unique and delicious desserts, I don't think that I've had any other meal that compares. Because of the slow pacing last time, I told the waitstaff that my guest and I had theater tickets for 8pm, and they did a wonderful job accommodating our tight schedule, getting us out in plenty of time for the show. In short, Contra is an incredible restaurant that is a welcome addition to a slower block on the LES. I can't wait to go back!
