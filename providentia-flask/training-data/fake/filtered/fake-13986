Having eaten at some of the best Indian fusion restaurants in NYC, my standards are very high.  Tashan disappointed me with all but one dish.  We sat at the bar hoping for some innovative Indian cocktails and unique appetizers.  We went with the tequila drink and it was nothing more than a below average margarita.  We shared a tandori shrimp, a dish of spinach and morels, the kobe beef skewer, and malai kofta lollipop.  It was all meh.  The malai kofta had a very heavy and sweet batter and tasted like a donut.  The spinach dish had a very unusual flavor and I'll leave it at that.  I did like the shrimp, but it was overpriced.  The other problem is the atmosphere is trying to hard to be swanky but the Popeyes across the street really kills that vibe. Plus the entire bar/lounge was empty on a Friday night at 9pm.
