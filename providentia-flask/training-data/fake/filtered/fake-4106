My wife and I heard about Caseus and went over early (6-ish) on a Friday evening. All tables were taken or reserved, but the full menu of French inspired bistro food was available at the comfortable bar. My wife had the steak and frites, the steak done perfectly to medium rare and the frites cooked in peanut oil which gave them a nutty taste that brought out the rich flavor of the steak. Her wine, (they gave us a taste to see if she liked it) was a red Spanish wine, Dignus, from Navarra Vineyards, 2004. I had the rabbit, which I enjoyed tremendously. It was perfectly cooked, (no, it doesn't taste like chicken, it tastes like rabbit) and seasoned with a nice balance of salt, pepper, and thyme (I think). The vegetable medley that came surrounding it was a great accompaniment. When I asked, the bar recommended a Belgian beer, Grimbergen, which was just a little sweeter and fruity than I would have liked, but blended deliciously with the rabbit. Staff were friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about their food. We completely enjoyed our evening. Caseus is a welcome addition to New Haven's food scene. Â We're going back tonight and taking friends with us!
