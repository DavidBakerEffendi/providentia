The only downside I could think of about Lombardi's is that they are cash only. The classic margherita pizza was delicious and thin. Big enough to have leftovers that tasted fine nuked the next day. Ask for a table upstairs and get to walk through the kitchen! I stopped by around 3:45 and was told that the ovens closed for fifteen minutes at 4 to prepare for the dinner rush, which is something to keep in mind.
