I love this place. Their poached eggs over haloumi and a roasted tomato are my go to daily snack, plus the price is right. I also love their green tea ice tea that is perfectly sweetened. Dean is always a great host and even when it gets a little hectic in there I don't mind because the vibe is still chill. Perfect spot to grab a bite while shopping in Soho!
