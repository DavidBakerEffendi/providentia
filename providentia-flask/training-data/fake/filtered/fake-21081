I'm another of those BA bikers who has ridden through 43 states, rode from New Jersey to Duluth in a day and a half and to Spokane in 3. I and a bunch of fellow BMW riders do "Polar Bear" rides all winter and one of our favorite breakfast stops is the Brass Ring. Plenty of parking and great food. I don't know about the $1,000.000 insurance policy, but two of the service staff are mother and daughter and both are extremely friendly. This is a fun place to stop in a car or on a bike. I heartily recommend it.
