OMG! This little Italian joint in Maspeth is incredible. I got a delivery, first time customer, and the pasta was aldente, the fried calamari lightly breaded and crispy. The brocalli rabe with sausage had just the right amount of olive oil. Then..the bread was so crusty. (They make it on the premises) Kudoos to Forno ..Well done
