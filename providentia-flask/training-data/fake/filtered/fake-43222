Been to Grand Ferry a dozen times or so now & always a great time. Perfect cozy tavern especially if you're headed to or from the city & need a pit stop. Late kitchen is awesome; had a delicious & affordable bottle of Gruner last night & split the vegetarian Shepherd's Pie with a friend- perfect combo. Fried clams are awesome & the cheeseburger should have its own fan club- it's that good. Cute patio & super-nice staff, to boot.
