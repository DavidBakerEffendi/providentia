I visited this restaurant last Monday. What a waste.  We ordered 2 paellas marina for 4 people.  They no longer come with lobster tail.  They also changed the rice to a mushy type of rice.  The rice was under cooked.  After they reheated the rice, the food tasted worse.  I told the head waiter I was discontent. He ignored me. They did not try to accommodate us in any way.  We left almost the entire 2 platters of food.  If you are interested in a good Spanish/Portuguese restaurant, I highly recommended staying in the ironbound section of Newark.  You can try the Spanish Tavern, Fornos, Ibieria, Fernandos or even venture out to the new restaurant on Washington St and Jouralemon St. In Bellville.  In my opinion I would probably never visit or recommend this place to anyone.  They need to get other chefs to cook a real paella with the same ingredients they used in the past and also need to take care of their customers.  Poor poor poor customer service.  I don't mind paying top dollar for a good meal and service but have a problem when I get a combination of the two.... A BIG 2 thumbs down.....
