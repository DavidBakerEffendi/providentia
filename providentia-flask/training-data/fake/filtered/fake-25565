WATCH OUT FOR YOUR BILL CAREFULLY.  They will bury a tip very good in your bill. When I got the bill there was an amount in "Beverage," so I asked why I'm being charged a beverage that I never order it.  Then, they cross off "Beverage" and wrote "Tax," and guess what "Tax" became?  "Tax" changed to "TIP" in my bill.  I guess a lot of customer here is getting ripped off by giving them tips TWICE in a bill.  I'm very sad to see when a local restaurant try to rip off locals.
