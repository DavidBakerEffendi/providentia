This is a new place in town that we decided to try. The food is amazing!! Everyone raved about their meals. That day my husband even had lunch there and said he really enjoyed it. The next day he bought all of his employees lunch from there and again, everyone loved it! We had no service issues at all which is surprising because the first week of a new restaurant could be challenging I could imagine. We will definitely be back!!
