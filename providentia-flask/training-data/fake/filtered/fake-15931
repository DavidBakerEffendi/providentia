The food is outstanding! I've been several times and each time I order something different and I'm blown away. The staff are great. I have to say my favorite thing about this place is that they do not rush you, they let you sit and enjoy your meal...even if it's just a snack, they want you to savor it along with your wine. Speaking of wine, that menu is fantastic as is the by the glass options. Can't recommend this place enough.
