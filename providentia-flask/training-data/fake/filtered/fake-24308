The food here was great, but I'm really giving this place a 5-star review because the service was GREAT!  Our server was Andrew, and he was so attentive and had great recommendations for what to eat.  We came for the AIDS Walk fundraiser, and it was really nice to see that the restaurant is committed to the community, and they should definitely do this more.  Andrew seemed to be really supportive! I'm glad I listened to his recommendations on what to order, because the Laab chicken and the Pom-Lychee and Mango martinis were super yummy.  I'm definitely going back, love the atmosphere and staff!
