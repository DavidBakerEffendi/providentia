Only good thing about being delayed in Newark Airport Terminal C.  Staff was GREAT and probably the best homefries I ever tasted!  My flight was delayed indefiinatly due to weather and if wasnt for this place I would of blown a gasket.  Round midnight I asked my bartender what time do you shut down and she told me 10pm with a smile.  Had to be the most genuine friendly restaurants I ever been to.  Flight didnt board till after 12:30 when I left and place was still bumbing.  Floors were clean, music was hip for old do wop music.  I would DEFINATLY come back every time i am in Newar Airport!!  Thank you Stephy and Garden State Diner!!
