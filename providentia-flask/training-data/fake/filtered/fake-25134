Food is AMAZING but the service is terrible.  Visited this establishment for a second time yesterday for Brunch.  Place was not very busy.  There were three of us and it took 45 minutes for us to get our food.  It seemed like there was only one waiter working in the entire place.  The waiter came by our table and told us that would meals were being plated - which took 10 minutes.  I ordered the french toast burger and the burger was 100% raw.  I had asked the waiter to send it back.  It took 15 minutes for my burger to come back.  The two other people who were with me were finished their means before I received mine for the second time.  When I looked at the burger, half of it was missing and all of the cream cheese icing had been scraped off.  I told this all to the waiter and he apologized and said he would "take care of some of it."  After receiving the bill I notcied that I was still charged $12 for the burger.  I notified the waiter and he apologized and then removed the charge completely.   It is a shame that service is so slow both times that I went to this restaurant as the food is quite delicious.  Not sure if I would go back a third time.
