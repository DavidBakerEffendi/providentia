I know Sally's reputation and was prepared to wait, but this was utterly ridiculous. I waited in line for an hour outside and then a whole pile of people showed up right at 5 and poured in in front of us (website said they didn't take reservations-wrong).  Then I waited 3 full hours for my pie!!!!!! I gotta say, the pizza was good-but no where near worthy of a 3 hour wait.  There was only 1 server on, and he was pathetically slow: you'd  think that in 3 hours, he might even refill my dinky water glass. That was my 1st and last visit to Sally's-extremely disappointing!
