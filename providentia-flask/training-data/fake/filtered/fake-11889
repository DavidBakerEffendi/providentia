Once again Tony's made me look like a star.  I sent yet another freind and his family to "my favorite italian restuarant in all of NYC" and got rave reviews back.  Even a thank you card signed by the husband, wife and all the kids.. Ciro, Jimmy and Dreni, managers all,  were all on this night and they made a point of welcoming my friends. Their server Jordana, did a fantastic job, thanks sweetie... The report I got was the food, oh the food...they couldnt beleive how much, how good and how reasonable.  And they added the sangria (which they want the recipe for....) This is one of the absolute best places to send out of towners to when they are in need of a great place to eat.  Especially family style.  Just a wonderful restuarant, super managers and staff and oh the food, the food.....FANTASTIC.... Thanks all....Ron
