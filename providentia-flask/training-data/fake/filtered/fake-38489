Do'nt know what the buzz is about.  The server was not very knowledgeable about wine choices, saying an Italian Supoer Tuscan was from Napa.  Appetizers were okay but the mushroom onion soup was overwhelmed by the onion.  The big sins?  The main course took just under 1 hour from order to the table during which time, after appetizers had been served,  our server  spoke to us only once and that was 5 minutes before the finally plates came out.  The roast chicken was good but not memorable.  The veal piccata was simply not good.  Although the veal was thin and tender, it was overbreaded, and the piccata sauce was dark and heavy, rendering any flavor of veal nearly non-exisitent.  We won't be going back
