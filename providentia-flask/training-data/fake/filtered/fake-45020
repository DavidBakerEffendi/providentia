I have lived in the upper valley now for awhile, one of my new friends in town told me about Cantore's Pizza, mentioning that they have Gluten Free pizza. I was so excited to try their pizza and loved it so much that I went two days in a row. Since going Gluten Free I have really missed a good pizza. This tastes homemade, with fresh toppings. My husband isn't gluten free and loves their calzones. I recommend their pizza to everyone!
