Without a doubt, a guilty pleasure for cheesesteaks late at night.  I love going to Pat's with some friends and just chowing down after all the night's festivities are thru.  The best is when it comes out piping hot.  Order one wiz-wit and send it down with cheese fries and a cherry coke and you can't go wrong!
