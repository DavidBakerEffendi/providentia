I had heard enough of how good this place was, so I had to try it.  Well, I must say that good indian food certainly comes at a very low standard in Philadelphia.  I am from Edison, NJ.  That is a hotbed of great Indian restaurants...and Ekta couldn't survive there.  The only reason they get 2 stars from me is because they seem like really nice people.  Next!
