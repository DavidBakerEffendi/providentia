So I went here for dinner and as far as the atmosphere...some may or may not like it...BUT the food was mmm mmm good! I heard a few mixed reviews and well, I know that most people just like to complain, but you  have gotta find out things for yourself...and I'm glad I did.  It is a bit....lot of loud from the music and being very busy, they are very crowded! The food I had the pleasure of tasting was the Churrasco and the arroz con pollo...mmmmm!!!!  I thought they were both very tasty! Big servings and my belly was satisfied!!!!  I don't know if I just got lucky or what...but I would go back again!!!  So far...I likes!!!!! :)))  See for yourself!   I would however tell you...if you like a quiet calm place....it may not be for you.  If you are looking for a fun lively environment....you will enjoy it.  Good EATS!
