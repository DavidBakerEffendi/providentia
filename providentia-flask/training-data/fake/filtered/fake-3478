this place was easily the WORST vegetarian chinese food i've ever had. the place was EMPTY which should've been my first indication to get the hell outta there..but i decided to give it a try.. the only flavor i could taste was salt and the rice was so dry it was inedible. i ordered a bubble tea while i was waiting, and i was handed the most watered down beverage i've ever had. i wouldve been better off ordering an ice water. needless to say, im NEVER going back, and urge others to STAY AWAY
