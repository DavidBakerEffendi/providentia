I've had lots of cheese steaks, some in recent years when visiting the Philly area, but most of them from the Chester and Media areas where I lived in the 60's and 70's.  They were to die for.. Fast forward to today when my 15 year old and I ordered with provolone and onions at Pat's while visiting our eldest son who lives in Philly.  I was so excited to introduce my hoagie/sub-loving teen to my favorite childhood take-out (well besides pizza).   Well he ate his in about 1 minute and said it was ok.  Clearly, I had built this up too much.  When I got two bites into mine, I found just a big bunch of gristle that I could not bite through.  It was gross and definitely not like the meat I remember having at any other place.  The prov was not melted, there was more gristle than meat, and the sandwich was too dry.   They obviously don't care about repeat customers if they serve such grisly meat.  I don't care how famous they are!  For $9 it should   SO sorry that I bothered going there.  I could have had and definitely have had a cheaper better cheesesteak at the Reading Terminal Mkt. or lots of other places.  Will never go to Pat's again.
