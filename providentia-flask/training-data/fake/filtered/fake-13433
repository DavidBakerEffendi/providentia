do NOT go there. i went for brunch with two of my friends, and a little later i got very stomach-sick, and one of my friends (who tried some of the onion soup i was having) experienced stomach pains as well. i think the health department really needs to check this place out, as i noticed other reviewers mentioned having the same problem!! i also ordered the crepe au poulet et legumes, it was soggy, and it was a whole wheat crepe, which was not mentioned on the menu. Â my friend got the risotto...it was more like a rice stew that was swimming in sauce. the table was dirty when we sat down, the waiters kept on trying to take our plates before we were finished, and they even took away my iced cappucino (pretty much the only thing that tasted good) when i wasn't looking and before i was done with it. my two friends also thought there could've been MSG in the food because they both had headaches when we left the restaurant. this place is AWFUL.
