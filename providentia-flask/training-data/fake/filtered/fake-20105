Being from Berkeley, I expected this eatery to be a popular hipster locale given its old-school diner feel. I was pleasantly suprised. I ordered the blueberry pancakes and a side of bacon. The pancakes were great and the bacon was some of the best that I have ever eaten. This all came in under 7 minutes. It was really cheap, only like 6 for everything (not including generous tip) I think that I might have to come back before I fly back to the Bay. Amish people rock!
