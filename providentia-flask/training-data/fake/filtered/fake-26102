My husband and I went for dinner here because we saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives the other day. Guy Fieri spoke very highly of it and we wanted to experience it also. It's a small place, so don't look for spaciousness. The waiter/host was very friendly the entire time. The wait for the food wasn't long. The food itself was delicious. The burger was better tasting and I think the best I've had in years! We could have had seasoned fries for a couple dollars more, but we stuck to the regular fries. We plan to return another day to try out other items on the menu.
