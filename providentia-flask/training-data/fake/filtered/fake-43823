What's not to love?  Landmarc's attention to details and penchant for tasty breads and cheeses is a winner.  You'll leave here with a warm fuzzy feeling knowing you've had a great dining experience without paying way too much for it.  I've never had a steak here, but based on the glowing reviews I'm going to have to try that out sometime.  This has got to be one of the best places to have a terrific, relaxing breakfast in the city.
