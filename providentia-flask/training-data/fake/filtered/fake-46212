I know this place has food people describe as porn in your mouth.  I wouldn't go that far.  They make good food - but really, is it really worth the long ass wait and the huge price tag?  And each item costs an extra $2-4 - so if you want bamboo, that's $2, oh you want egg, that's another $2. The build a ramen gets pricey real quick
