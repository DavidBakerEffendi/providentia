As a lover of sushi I'm always looking for a good place on Staten Island. I work in Brooklyn so I am spoiled by so many excellent sushi choices for lunch. When I got home dinner was a different story until I found Kyoto Sushi. It is by far the best sushi I have encountered on Staten Island. Indeed a little overpriced but still the best I have found close to home.
