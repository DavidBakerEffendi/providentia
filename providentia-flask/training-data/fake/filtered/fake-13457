One of the all-time great neighborhood spots. My boyfriend and I generally have brunch here at least once if not twice a weekend - we're totally addicted to the tasty food, GIANT cafe au laits, charming atmosphere, and general European sensibility. I dream of the chicken salad (I normally don't even like white meat, but I swear, they must poach it in butter!) and the delicious crepes, both savory and sweet. Totally worth the wait (maybe 20-30 min for 2) on weekends, this has become quite the popular spot! Great corner to sit on a bench waiting for a table, there is some...remarkable people-watching.
