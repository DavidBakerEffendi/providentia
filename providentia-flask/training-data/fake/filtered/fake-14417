Chanced to dine last Sunday after not having eaten there in ~15 years.   Double thumbs-up: great people, polite atmosphere (conversations are possible) and most importantly--   The sashimi is like butter. I had 4 types with each one better than the last. The unagi was perfection- thinly sliced and lighted crisped on the grill but very tender. And with a lovely unusual sauce that was not cloying like some can be.   Not as good as Nobu in NYC (but what is?) but certainly the very best Japanese in the Princeton area.   A bit more expensive than the other local choices for this cuisine but well worth it.
