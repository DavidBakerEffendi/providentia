The staff and food were amazing!  However, the kitchen was open to the seating area and it took away from the dining experience.  The kitchen had bright flourescent lights, which was ditracting and the smoke from the kitchen filled the dining area.  It left an odor on our jackets that could only be removed with dry cleaning. However, this was an awesome place.   I just advise them to close off their kitchen to achieve 5 star status.
