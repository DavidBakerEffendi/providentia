I celebrated my birthday here with a group of family and friends Sunday afternoon and I have to say, I was amazed by how perfect everything was!!! The food was excellent and prepared just as I asked. The appetizers, sides and desserts were also excellent. Great customer service and the owner even surprised me with live music! Beija Flor has become one of my favorite restaurants. I frequently come here with my family when we want to eat good Brazilian food. We love the steak (picanha). It is my favorite and the best I have found in Astoria. It is definitely worth the trip from Manhattan to Queens just to get happy over a really good meal. If you are looking for good (Picanha), steak cooked Brazilian style in the area, I absolutely recommend this restaurant!
