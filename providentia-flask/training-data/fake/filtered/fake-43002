i was at johnnys hots today.had a roast pork which i eat there almost every time was great nice lean and very flavorful.always eat the hot sausage always good.today also got a cheese steak started out good taste like rib eye was enjoying first bite until the second bite mouth full of gizzle like rubber second bite nothin but grizzle lost my appetite brought second half home hopin to enjoy later.but no luck heated it up same dissapointing grizzle in every bite.tryed the roast beef a few weeks ago same thing nothin but grizzle eww lose my appetite as soon as my teeth hit the grizzle.love the scrapple egg and cheese love the hot sausage egg and cheese love the roast pork.cant understand how the place that serves three of my favorite sandwiches in philly servred me two of the worst threw the same window it dont make sense.ill just stick with my old standbuys i guess.if ya like grizzle and rubber band texture in the mouth youll like the roast beef and cheese steak.i was very sad with them but still love jonnys hots if that makes sense.
