I love this place. Very cozy and not too much crowded and narrow. And server is so kind. You can get nice service at there. The restaurant has high ceilings and the ambiance is great. I've only been here for dinner so it's always lit dimly and there's always a crowd but with reservations (which I highly recommend for dinner) everything usually runs smoothly. We usually order the pri fixe meal with a couple bottles of wine. I've always enjoyed everything I had chosen for my meal. There were times when others found their dish too salty and it would be returned and a new dish served right away. Very happy with this place and very highly recommend it!!!
