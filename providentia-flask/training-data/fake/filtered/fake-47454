Honestly, their pizza is the good BUT!!! Their service became ugly!!! My friends and I (total of 5 people and a kid.) went there last Sunday to get 3 pies to go. We got there like 40 min before they close, no line outside or inside were found. When we walked in a guy who works there said that we have to stay outside and only 1 person can come in to make an order. Again - no line, no people, plenty of space inside. It was pretty muggy outside, we had pregnant woman and a little kid with us and that guy made us wait outside for like 25 minutes standing. One of us was inside ordering and I went in to make some suggestions and get a bottle of water. That guy came to me and said "listen, you have to get out!". That was sick - I was ready to beat him up for that. Nobody talks like that to customers. Nobody make pregnant woman stay outside by the door for 25 minutes! He did not even offer her a chair, just said that they are out of capacity (when it was pretty empty). I asked him to call a manager and his respons was "oh, please, don't make my night harder". So he didn't call a manager and had us wait outside with plenty of space inside. We could just leave, but we already paid for order. We made an order for $75. My friend who was ordering told me that a lady who took his order was far from being polite too. One thing I can tell for sure now: We will never visit that place again. upd: I read reviews and found that I was not the only person who was disappointed! And yeah, that ponytail man is crazy!!!
