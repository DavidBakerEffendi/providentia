I had a steak here a couple of months ago and *still* can't get over how bland and overpriced it was. To add insult to injury, the "ramps" that allegedly accompanied it referred to one measly, shriveled husk of a ramp on top of it. Even the bread here seemed rubbery and flavorless to me. I know BC's reputation and I'm sure it has at some point in its history been pretty good (heck, I might just have been there on an off night), but I sure don't have the funds to try them again on the off-chance that they've improved.
