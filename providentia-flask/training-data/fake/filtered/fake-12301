This is what pizza should be! If you can put up with the tourists and the lines it is worth it. I would have given it a higher rating but they play games with the line. It gets me ticked off when after waiting 30 minutes, some guy and his family cut the line claiming they are a friend of someone and a Robert Loggia, wannabe , let's them cut in front of everyone. Not cool!!!!!!
