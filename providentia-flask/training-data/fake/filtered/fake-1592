Nice looking diner.  They are going for that NY style diner.  The food was not good.  Large portions but no flavor & cold.  The owner greeted us at the door but no other interaction with you.  He is too worried about what the bus boys are doing & his servers are providing less than standard service.  I asked our waitress to take back mozzarella stick that were still frozen in the center & I over heard her talking about us, not cool.  She brought out another round & they were still cold not cooked through.  Over all not a great experience.
