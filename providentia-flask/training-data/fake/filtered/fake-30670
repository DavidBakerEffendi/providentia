A Traveler's Delight! My wife and I were heading up I-95 to see my brother in Mystic and saw a billboard for this family restaurant which came to our delight as we were planning to stop at McDonalds for another greasy meal. When we arrived we were greated by a friendly staff. The waiter promtly came over to the table and took our order as we were famished. It was lunch time so I had their Tuna Club and my wife had their Steak and Cheese the Works. Both of our meals were amazing and quick. I think we were there for no longer than a 1/2 hour.
