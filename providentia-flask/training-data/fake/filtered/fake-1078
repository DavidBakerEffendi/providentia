What a warm environment and such a great vibe! We sat at the bar for happy hour and it seemed the place was filled with regulars making conversation, which is always a good sign. The bartenders were friendly and engaging and the cocktails were great! Fried tofu was delicious - light and crispy on the outside and gooey and soft inside.
