best brisket in the city, melts in your mouth but not too flimsy. Wings, ribs and beans are excellent as well. Can do without the pulled pork and beef rib, there's better elsewhere. They've recently introduced 'burnt ends' which are decent but a little gimmicky, stick to the brisket its the real deal. Don't waste your time on the rest of the sides.
