Visiting Philly for a weekend, and wanting something different, Rangoon seemed to fit the bill.  Indeed, it fit the bill so well we ate there two nights in a row.  Very efficient service, reasonable prices, but the main event, the food, was the attraction.  Subtle spices, delicate noodles, a wide variety of choices...the Ginger salad, so simple, but so different and delicious.  The thousand layer bread, like a naan, but different than a naan in many ways...the jungle curry, and a deep fried fish filet in a red curry sauce.  Every dish we tried was delicious, and we'll be going back over and again.
