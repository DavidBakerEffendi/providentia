I work in the area and just happened to walk by as the place was DEAD empty. I walked in anyway and saw an AMAZING array of treats that looked fresh and ready for the taking. I wasn't in a position to buy nor was it in my "diet" plan for the day, but I vowed to come back... Well I did tonight and it was empty... again. The case looked less exciting than before, most of their product was nonexistent, and I wasn't in the mood for a muffin at 8pm. I asked if they had any cookies and the man there told me there were some chocolate chip just about to come out of the oven. Within SECONDS the timer beeped and the woman preparing the next batch mix, un-gloved, re-gloved and pulled them out of the oven... FRESH COOKIES STRAIGHT OUT DA OVEN, YA'LL!!! I HAD to get me one of those joints! Normally I am a fan of the WHOLE FOODS vegan chocolate chip cookies, but THIS RIGHT here at CHAMPS was on POINT! Think Levain Bakery thickness with a gazillion mini chocolate kosher chip something or others, yet and AMAZING cookie to chocolate ratio! Well balanced in the sweetness, but not so chocolaty that all your tongue is coated and you miss something. Good crust on the bottom, but so soft everywhere else. Yeah, before I got half way through the first one, I quickly purchased one for the road! $3 seems steep for a cookie at a spot I've never been, but my belly and taste buds was not mad at it. I was so excited I was sing praises to random people on the street. Some went in to get in on it! I'll be back...
