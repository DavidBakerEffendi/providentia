Decided to try & impressed.  Enjoyed a great dinner with family.  Service was excellent.  only draw back, brocolli rab appetizer was bland.  Beets/pears a must try as was the tenderlion cognac.   Just a bit rushed bewteen starters & soup/salads( only reason we didn't rate 5 star).  Atmostphere great, waiter did an awesome job, we were served a complementry champange toast at the end to the meal.  We'll be back
