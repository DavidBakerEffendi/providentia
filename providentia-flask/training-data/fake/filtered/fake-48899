I attended Almond for brunch. They required my friend and I to wait about 15 minutes while there were a mulititude of open and available seating. I can understand holding places for reservations, but over ten tables is quite ridiculous. Once the host caught my friend's irratated demeanor we were sat within the next minute. The atmosphere was very stuffy and condescending. The waitress was very flat and unhelpful. Did not check up on us once to see how we were doing and had to hunt her down to heat up my coffee. The food tasted satisfactory in the moment, however I have been sick (throwing up/glued to the bathroom) ever since I left at noon and it is now 11pm. I do not think they practice good food handling. I do not recommend this restaurant.
