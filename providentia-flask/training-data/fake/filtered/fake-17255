We went here for breakfast on 10/19. It was busy, but we were seated at a booth immediately. Our waiter was fast and just the right amount of attentive (not overly intense on checking on us, but my coffee was never emptied or cool). Food was good. Standard diner fare. Prices were amazing. I can't think of any place in the region that you can get a large breakfast sandwich with a generous portion of home fries for under $5. Seriously, enough food that we weren't hungry again until mid afternoon after eating breakfast at 8. Anyway, we will definitely be back again. Â Happy to have a breakfast restaurant so close to our house!
