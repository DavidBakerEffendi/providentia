WOW! 70 degrees today and I was out for a walk in Washington Square park. Haven't been down here in awhile the frosted glass wall was all of a sudden missing and in its place was what looked like an enchanted garden, I had no idea it was a restaurant. The gate was locked but the staff told me they opened at 5 so I came back with a friend for a drink. Quite simply put, the BEST glass of Pinot Noir I've ever had. So bold and flavorful and none of that cheap glass wine taste. I got peckish so we decided to be experimental and order the rabbit appetizer with pasta which was very tender and very good not gamey in the least. My friend cannot eat gluten so she ordered the spring salad with almond milk dressing which was so refreshing and just really delicious. By the time we left it was packed with people and the hostess told me it was only their second night open?! I made a reservation for the first Saturday they had available (a month from now!) An incredible place, warm, friendly and fricken delicious!!
