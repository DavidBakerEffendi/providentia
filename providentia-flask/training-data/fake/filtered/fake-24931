I've been going here for 7 years.  The owners are two brothers from Naples.  They are real Italians from Naples, the birthplace of pizza, and pizzamaking is in their blood.  I've been all over Italy and all over the outerboroughs of NYC and I know pizza.  This is the best non-brick oven pizza that I've ever had in the United States, plain and simple.  It's worth the trip from anywhere.
