Consider this a 31/2 star review please ! Plenty of positives about this place so yes check it out . The food is good and flavorful but the portions for the price are a bit on the small side . The only other thing I warn about is the wait , I was prepared and didnt come very hungry , but your more then likely to encounter a wait . The atmosphere and set up are interesting which makes the meal kinda worth it , service was fine .
