Great food! Warm Italian place with a family atmosphere. I recommend getting a few meatballs on the side, maybe even a few to go. I've ate at the Villa more than once and could never complain about one thing. Food comes out hot and is delicious. Employees treat you like you are a regular even if it's your second visit. I will continue eating at the Villa whenever I'm in Philadelphia again. Highly recommend.
