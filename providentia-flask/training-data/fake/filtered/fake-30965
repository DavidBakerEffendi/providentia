This place is awesome. First of all, the music is f*cking great, housey, loungey, the best. Lights are real dim so it's very private. The tables are somewhat close together but if you're claustrophobic, stay at home. The food is banging, my girlfriend and I had the rock shrimp tempura app then split three different rolls (obviously she chose) and it was awesome. We finished off with fried ice cream and that stuff is incredible. She also had three martinis that she couldn't stop raving about while I drank Sapporo draft. Bill came to just under $100 which is perfectly fine for a Saturday night out. I keep hearing about how crazy it gets there on Wednesdays so I'll have to check that out. Definitely a great place for a date or friends night out.
