If I could give it no stars I would. We went there with a party of ten. Let me start of as saying that I can completely sympathize with anyone in the service industry. It's not easy at all. We all ordered our food and were pretty excited as everything on the menu sounded like it was well thought out and would be prepared just as well.  They sent out one order of grits and two pancakes first for some reason. The pancakes weren't cooked all the way....Pancakes...We were later told that they are "vegan" and that's why the texture was the way it was. The grits. I am using that term very loose. They were dry and horrible. Then we waited. For a long time. Three tables on the deck sat after us, and ordered after us, and still had food delivered before us. I ordered the banana walnut French toast. It was just okay. I also ordered a side of bacon. It was literally one piece of bacon broken in half. Did I mention the wait. Yeah. Because the waitress didn't.  If the kitchen is clearly dropping the ball, tell the manager and make it up to your table. It was like the elephant in the room. Finally someone I assume was the manager (he never really explained who he was) said we are really sorry for the wait,  the kitchen is backed up or some excuse, I couldn't really hear him because he only addressed one half of the table. I will finish by saying that I will never return. You can draw your own conclusions but rolling the dice you might loose out too.  There are plenty of good places in the area that I have never had a bad experience at.
