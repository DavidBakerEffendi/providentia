We ate there last week.  It was a good lunch.  We had four empanadas and the guac and plantains.    The guac and plantains were tasty.  It was a nice change from chips and guac.  I thought the plantains were a little salty but my wife thought there were just fine.   We had three savory empanadas.  The one with chicken and Mamas piquant sauce was nice and spicey.  I ordered the Colombian meat corn flour empanada.   Both were crispy, hot and delicious.  Some of the best of empanadas I've had before.   The desert empanada was just so-so.  I had the apple empanada.  The empanada wasn't as crispy as the savory ones and needed to be sweeter.   The service was exemplary.  My water glass stayed filled and the food came out quick.   For $25 after tax and tip, I thought it was good deal for NY.
