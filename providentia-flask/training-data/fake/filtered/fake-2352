Really good pizza!!! Definitely one of the top pizzas Â in New York. The crust is thin, the sauce is flavorful, and the cheese is right on. I found that the dough had a slight salty taste, which wasn't bad at all. It actually added to the overall package. A good crust should be slightly charred and have some flavor anyway.
