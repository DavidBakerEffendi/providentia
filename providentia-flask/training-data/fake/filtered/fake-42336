This place hits the spot.  Good heavy beer with sausage.  That's all I need to feel like a man.  Yes, I had some serious gas after but I was out with a buddy so I didn't care.  They put some type of cheese in my sausage. Maybe that's why I had gas.  It was worth it since the sausage was cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.
