This theater district spot is another winner for Lidia Bastianich. The food and service is attentive, and professional especially for a place that is so packed. While we didn't sample the price fix menu, we could see from others who did that it is certainly one of NYCs secrets! The striped bass special was sensational. Not to be outdone is the extensive wine list where all selections are $25! There is a full, pricier list too, but at $25 a bottle, our Italian sauvignon was a steal! Try it, you'll LOVE it!
