Like everyone else I've been dying to try this place. Finally, got a chance Saturday night. We sat at what they jokingly called the "Elvis" table. Wife had the spiked lemonade which she enjoyed. We ordered the crawfish boudain balls, and I think I found my new addiction. All I can say is WOW. Our entrees were both really good.  The fried chicken with mac and cheese was best I 've had in a  looong time, and the wife really enjoyed the blackened catfish. We were going to skip desert, but the waiter said something about dump cake ( yeah that's what they call it). With a name like that we had to try it. Another winner with cherry, pineapple and cake all mixed (dumped) together. And just as a side note, there's something about this place where you just feel welcome and comfortable, unlike other places on 30th ave. From the funky tables, stuff encased in the bar, and TV cabinet storage?!?!?   Someone really poured the love into this place. Really hope they stick around, because I found my new go to place. And to the whiney snob who gave the place one star because you couldn't get in. Go back to reviewing Wendy's
