A special place that transcends every category to which it might belong.  It isn't just a restaurant.  It isn't just a sushi place.  It isn't just Japanese food.  It isn't just a vegetarian refuge, nor just another healthy place.  It isn't just a place to try food you didn't know was edible.  It isn't just a nurturing environment for its creative and capable staff.  It isn't just a test kitchen for a brilliant chef.  It isn't just a multi-generational family business with a long and rocky history.  It isn't just a neighborhood and community institution.  It isn't just a place to be educated, to celebrate, to romance, to indulge, to be nourished, to delight, to stay too late.... Miya's is whatever you want it to be.  It's a project with a culinary, environmental, and social mission. Want to splurge?  Reserve a tasting menu.  Want to scrimp?  Go late at night and wash down simple rolls with cheap beer.   Just don't expect it to be just any one thing.
