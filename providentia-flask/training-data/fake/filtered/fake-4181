We ate here last night and it was awesome!! I lived in Korea for three years and this place is the real deal. I was happy to see that it was busy and bustling. Keep in mind you'll cook yourself on little grill if you order that. But they come by and get you started, or you can ask them to cook it for you, but what's the fun in that. The food is generally pretty healthy too. Â I'm glad this place is close by- we will definitely bee going back.
