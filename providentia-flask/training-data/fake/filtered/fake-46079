Just left from Rose Petals Cafe where the cops were called on my grandmother. Last week we both went to Rose Petals and the food was delicious but today 7/23/14 I've never experienced a business calling the cops on customers for bad food. My grandson order pancakes,eggs, and bacon and I ordered the wheat French toast. When the food came out My eggs were runny when I asked for fried hard my grandsons pancakes were old not fluffy and her eggs were scrambled hard when she asked for light. We sent it back and they brought out the food again our bacon was burnt my grandsons eggs were still hard, my eggs were the same ones they recooked and runny still. I sent my food back a third time and my grandmom didn't want her food at all at this point. The manager a Hispanic woman came out and apologized but then stated they would cook the food again at a discounted price but she had to pay for the food. We couldn't believe it pay for food she didn't want or eat. Non the less they called the cops and brought out my food for the third time and my bacon was cold and greasy my eggs were fine and my French Toast was made with the ends of the bread and weren't fluffy. We asked for the manager again and waited about ten minutes to find that she didn't come out because she was waiting for the cops to come.  Never again will I return to this place being forced to pay for something I don't want, having the cops called on me. Sad, so much potential bad ownership, bad customer service and no accountability.  Beware of this place
