Yes! Yes! Yes! This is the pizza I remember growing up.  Love the little quaint, circa early 1900's rustic vibe.  Love the BYO.  Love how sweet Mark is.  The waitresses can range from aloof to very sweet.  The hostess can be a little rough around the edges, but that's BK for ya! If I could change one thing, it's that I like more of a buttery crust, and the one here is more matzah-like.  That's just a personal preference.   Love taking visiting friends and relatives here.  All happy tummies :) xx
