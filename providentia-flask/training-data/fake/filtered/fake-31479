This was my first time trying Korean food and I found it to be very good. The folks that work there are very pleasant and customer friendly. I had the rice, spicy chicken and all of the different veggies that they had to offer. I felt that the food was light and healthy, oh yea the price was great also. I will go back again and again and again.
