Stopped here for a happy hour date on a Friday; We had walked passed it a few weeks before so I kept it in mind, especially with my attraction to $1 oysters during happy hour. The decor was nice, gave a 30's vibe with the music that blended nicely with the scenery. My bf was a fan of the simple menu that was just the right size. The oysters were good, clean and nicely presented. The horseradish was freshly grated on the cocktail sauce , which was a Â nice touch. They featured cocktails they called Bubbly's for $5. We got the Southern Belle and the Clever Name, which were fine but our favorite was hands down the Treaty of Paris, which had the blend of honeydew and St.Germaine and it was carbonated, hence the name bubbly. It was so good. Lastly, we got the Duck Fat fries which were really great. Hot, crispy, and well seasoned and the accompanying dipping sauce was perfect. I can see coming here again soon.
