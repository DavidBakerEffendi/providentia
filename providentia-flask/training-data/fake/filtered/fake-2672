The first thing that struck me about Graffiti is the size of the restaurant. It's small even for a New Yorker. I had read about it and decided to visit it but nothing prepared me for it. Having said that I have to mention, that if you just want to see the creative use of space then you have to pay a visit to Graffiti a. Even though it's a small place, you feel cozy rather than cramped. Chef Jehangir Mehta (who owns Graffiti) has added so many quirky design elements to the interiors of the restaurant that for a few minutes after entering you just look around in wonder, taking in all the personal touches to the design that make the place so warm and inviting. I really loved the funky animal chopsticks. The service at Graffiti is flawless. Actually that is how I spoke to Chef Mehta for the first time and heard that he was one of the participants on the Next Iron Chef. I now watch the show regularly and make sure I tell everyone that I have met him. The place is almost always full so I prefer to reserve my table, especially on Fridays. Though they do accept walk-ins, be prepared to wait for quite a while. Graffiti is always full! I don't like waiting for my food and that is another reason why I appreciate Graffiti so much. They serve food giving a detailed description of each preparation. This is something I really appreciate about the place. It makes you feel like they really know their food and they genuinely take pride in what they create. The proportions though small are filling and the best part is that nothing gets wasted. My favorite dish is the crunchy crostini and walnut salad as well as the watermelon feta salad. But no meal at Graffiti is complete without ordering atleast 2 portions of mango paneer!
