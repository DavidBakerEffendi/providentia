i think this place is nice and casual.  You cant beat the prices, and its great for a good and filling lunch if you are in northern liberties.  There are tables outside which is right across from the piazza which is cool, when i was there they were playing live music at the piazza and we could hear it at our table.  I like the three different kinds of barbeque sauce that they have, pretty authentic.  I recommend the Huevos Rancheros.
