I got to say, the Skinny Pancake is like a fine wine, it seems to get better and better year after year (and it was great when it first opened!). The place has great vibes, excellent music (Josh Panda rocks the house there), and I think EVERYTHING on the menu is priced between $6-$12...AND it's basically all made from local ingredients. I recently had the Lamb Fetatastic which was EXCELLENT and The Love Maker, a classic that never disappoints.  By the way, I never do this but I'm gonna have to call out Claudia W. below: $12 bucks and change for the Lamb Fetatastic quite possibly could be the best food deal in BTV.  It's made using Winding Brook Farm lamb sausage and other great veggies - I'll pay $12 for a "local" meal like that any day of the week! ohh and Claudia W...I'm pretty sure that the menu says that it's a buck extra if you want mushrooms ;)   ....I just checked and there will be good tunes there tonight!!
