Folks I hate to break it to you, but this is not Brazilian... The food isn't bad, (Not great either). But they have what I'd call an identity crisis. If you just walked in unbeknownst of the fact that this is a Brazilian place you won't hate it, but you'll think you're eating anything other than Brazilian food. All this said, it's a nice place to hang out, and if the right bar tender is working you'll get a great Caipirinha. Pair that with a "Mixto quente" which is not bad at all, and hopefully with good company you'll have a good time. Not sure if they always have the same guys, but once I was there and there was a Trio, that was nothing short of fantastic. They played some beautifully nostalgic chorinhos... ...que me deu saudades...
