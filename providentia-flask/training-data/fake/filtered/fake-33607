Went on a sat. for lunch. They offered a buffet for $9.99 or you can order ala carte. We opted for ala carte. Had the Seafood w. chili sauce which was very tasty,Tsel Shoko Ngapa also very tasty, Tsel Pay Tsel tasty but too salty and the Yak Dumplings which was ok. Service was friendly and decor was nice. Overall we had a good time.
