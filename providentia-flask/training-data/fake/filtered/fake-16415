Best in town! Me and my family go there all the time(at least once a week). The food is amazing and the staff is very friendly and service is great. The owners are very nice and make you feel like you are home. Its a nice family friendly casual place. There is so many amazing appetizers to chose from and all the entr√©es are amazing as well. Every time I go I always have something different and am never disappointed. My favorite appetizers are the shepard salad, fried liver, the humus and the squash salad. i cannot chose a favorite entree because they are all so good from the chicken, gyro, adana, shish, steak and fish, IVE HAD THEM ALL! The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because they get very busy on the weekends and its hard to get a table, so make sure you have your reservation so you can enjoy the night at bosphorus! Oh and i forgot to mention the prices are great! Can't wait to go back!
