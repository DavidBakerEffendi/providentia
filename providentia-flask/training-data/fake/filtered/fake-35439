I'll keep it very simple.  Food was excellent and the service was the best you're ever going to encounter in NYC.  I eat out with my family at least once a week and the services in most restaurants in NYC just plain suck.  I get really pissed off because I still have to tip them but the service here was so good that I was so happy to give them a 25% tip.
