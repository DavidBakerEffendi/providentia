I came here with two other people for a book club meeting. It was happy hour, so we ordered a $10 half-pitcher of mango sangria, which was DELICIOUS. Also, almost all the food we ordered (tortilla, potatos w/ aioli, tropical salad) was flavorful and well-made. My friends ordered the chorizo with onions, which looked and smelled good, too (I didn't have any because I'm a vegetarian). The only exception was the asparagus tapas, which was actually pretty gross--I had to force myself to eat it because I hate wasting food. There were only two small pieces of asparagus, which were horribly overcooked and mushy (possible from a can), very cold, and drenched in mayonnaise. Our waiter was very friendly and engaging when we arrived, and did a cool long pour of the sangria, though he seemed to forget about us later on. But overall, this was a positive experience and I recommend this place.
