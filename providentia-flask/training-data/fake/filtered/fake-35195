The worst service ever. I met rude people before, but never like the one who works at Gaia. I've never seen someone yelling for 5 minutes at costumers just because they asked how long more would it take for them to be served. It happened here. If they treat their costumers that way, I can only imagine how they prepare the food. I will never come back again and I do not recommend this place for anyone.
