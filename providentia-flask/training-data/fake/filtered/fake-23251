I had heard from friends that I needed to try this great mexican restaurant and bar called Ofrenda in the W Village. Last night I finally got there with 2 other friends and wow! What a great experience and the food and cocktails are much more than just a typical mexican restaurant. The cocktails were hand crafted (try the Mexican Lady) and food choices had some new and inventive ideas (Scallops!).
