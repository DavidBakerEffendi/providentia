I love cafe Renata. High quality food and coffee at a good price and a definite feel of home. There are fresh and super delicious baked goods - such as crumb cake and out of this world chocolate oatmeal cake that I highly recommend- homemade from the family recipe of Katie the co-owner. There is also a large selection of coffee, teas, and hot chocolate to satisfy any taste. Everything I've tried here has been delicious. I went to the opening and was able to try free samples of items on the menu and loved every one. There are lots of vegetarian and Mediterranean options such as fresh hummus. I also tried the Cubano panini and just have to share how impressed I was. The sandwich is huge, it is on freshly baked bread, it has chunks of real cheese melted on it, and here's the kicker-not only is there a good amount of meat, but all the meat such as the fresh ham, was baked by Yasser the co-owner and chef. I mean who makes their own sandwich meat? Super good. The cafe is bright and cheery and I highly recommend stopping in, pulling up a chair, and trying out some stuff. It will be worth your effort.
