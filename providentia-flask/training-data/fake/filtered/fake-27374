I'm with the other negative reviewers on this one. Don't understand the hype. I've given this place three tries, and each time failed to impress me. First time we were really hungry and waited almost an hour to be seated. Decided we couldn't wait anymore and just ordered to go. Even that took 20 minutes. Ordered the square. Nothing to see here people! All they did was switch the order of the cheese and tomato sauce so sauce is on top, cheese on the bottom. Had a pasta dish that was meh, but hefty portions. Another time, an out of town friend visited me and insisted on trying it. Originally wanted the lobster salad but they said it wasn't available! Shame on them for not stocking their kitchen better. She ordered the seafood salad instead. Not impressed! Hardly any expensive seafood. Mostly calamari tossed in with mussels. Already wanting to leave, my friend suggested we order a dessert. Big mistake. We ordered a tiramisu to share. It took them literally 20 minutes to bring to us, and it wasn't even busy. By that time, there were only a handful of tables occupied. The server was nowhere to be found - probably on her cigarette break?! I mean, all she had to do was slice a piece and bring it over. I could not wait to get out of this over-hyped greasy joint. Never again!
