Delicious food and Excellent service. Karim the waiter was great and had extensive knowledge about steaks and was very professional in his manners. This restaurant is a hidden gem and I am surprised to see how slow it is compared to their Morristown location which I have been dining at for the past two years. I guess Montclair is not used to a high end restaurant which surprises me since they call themselves the food capitol of New Jersey. I highly recommend J and K Steakhouse I hope you enjoy it as much as I do and that business will continue to flourish so Montclair can keep such a great restaurant in town!
