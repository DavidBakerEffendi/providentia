Wont ever take another step into this place ever again. Over expensive menu for very little. You will be leaving hungry. I went through the weirdest interview with an arrogant GM and once I stepped into this place I knew he would never hire me a Native American this place is not diversified. From reading the horrible reviews I would say you Mr. GM dont know food, wine and what your patrons want!
