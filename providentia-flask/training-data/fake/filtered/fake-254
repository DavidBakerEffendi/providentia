This is a total tourist trap. I feel bad that some tourists only go here and that's their lasting impression of a real Philly cheesestaek. The steaks are not prepared fresh, they are already wrapped and ready to hand over the counter (don't even expect a smile, these guys are the dourest you'll find anywhere). Basically you get a crap roll, a flat piece of "steak" and a ton of cheese wiz. I'd call it the McDonalds of cheesesteaks, but that would be an insult to McDonalds. Go to any other local steak joint and you'll get the real thing, this place is just crap, I work on South Street, there are probably a dozen better options within 5 blocks of my job, and...wait for it....they make your steak fresh to order!!! This is a copy and paste of my Geno's review, these places are exactly the same.
