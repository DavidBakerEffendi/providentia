The restaurant is conveniently located blocks away from union square. It is open 24 hours so you can stumble in drunk after a night out bar hopping. I highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates and definitely any of the mac and cheese dishes. The staff there are not only trendy but also very friendly. One of the managers Miguel is definitely attentive, professional (unlike many) and has great customer service. The bartender Miguel (also) will serve you strong, top notch drinks and make you laugh and enjoy the atmosphere even more. I highly recommend this place if you're tired of snobby servers and less than mediocre service!
