Well it's supposed to be the French take on her Gottino that she sold to her partner. BUt I don't see it as particularly French, although it has accents and certainly looks the part. The food can be spectacular, if expensive. I love the chicken liver when she has it and the beet salad. Had a mustard rabbitt the other night which was delicisous. The place has wonderful veg plates which the girlfriend loves and we have had some wonderful wine there. Although why she carries that heinous Bastianich wine from Lidia's son and Mario's partner is beyond me. That is some sad grape remains. But plenty of other good choices and the counter fellow (only place to sit, tables are weird and back room is a no way) is knowledgable. Good waitstaff although few do much so it can be a little sloooow. The eggs frothed in the capuccino machine are a reason to go oout on a weekend morning. The desserts levae me cold, a passable tarte tatin.
