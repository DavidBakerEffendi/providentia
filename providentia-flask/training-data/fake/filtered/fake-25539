Hello friends, I know that you have all been waiting to find out the opening date of my new BYOB restaurant in East Falls......well it will be Tuesday July 5, 2011 for dinner at 5PM! There it is...and I look forward to see you here if not Tuesday at some point in the near future. Thank you all for your kind support. Franco Faggi
