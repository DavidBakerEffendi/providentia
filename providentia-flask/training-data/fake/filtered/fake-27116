I went to this fabulous Japanese restaurant with my friends yesterday. I still cannot forget the taste of sushi. We had the 'beauty and the beast' and 'hon' sushi and those were both amazing. They were very fresh and the price was totally reasonable. Also, I really liked the modern, luxurious interior. Because I'm a big fan of sushi, I went to many places in NY. I would definitely count this restaurant as one of the best Sushi place. I'm so excited that I found a great place in NJ! so I don't need go to NY to taste great sushi. I am planning to go there again, tomorrow!! :)
