I love this place, sometimes its hit or miss on the fries and I guess if you prefer your burger cooked more than medium depending on the cook.  When the Latino guy cooks, he will burn your burgers unless you get rare to medium rare.  I enjoy the burgers here and the price is great for the amount of food you get.  It does get pretty packed, but then I just get take out.  The wait time for food has never been bad and I enjoy the different burgers they make for the specials (kobe beef, bison, ostrich, etc.). The salmon burgers are also delicious and definitely worth trying.  There chipotle sauce and variety of hot sauces are a huge plus also.
