The manager came to us many time asking for ordering dinner and reminding us for close of restaurant at 10:00 PM. We ordered all the food by 9:30. When we order the drink at 9:30, the manager came to me and denied to server the drink and said I have to order the food and he will not server anymore drink. I have been visiting P F Change since last 8 years. I visited in Michigan, Washington, New York. This was my worst experience.
