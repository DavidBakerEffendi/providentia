This "pizza" is just plain bad! I ordered one of their "special" pizzas thinking it was going to be good, since it was a few dollars more than their other pizzas (which must be even worse!) Yeah, it was real SPECIAL the way the delivery guy must have dropped it down the stairs or something, because when I opened the box, all of the toppings were kind of sloshed to the side. There were 3 sad looking pieces left that sort of had toppings on them, and since I was hungry, and knew that I wasn't going to eat for awhile, I choked down those 3 soupy pieces and tried to forget the whole experience. The pizza was really runny and warm, it wasn't even hot. The crust was really doughy and fell apart, and the sauce was like water. If I had more time to explore the VAST culinary scene in New Jersey, I would've tried somewhere else, but since this place was open and they had free delivery, they were a good option. Their late hours and free delivery is the only reason I'm giving them a star. The pizza was soggy and bland. I only ate three slices, but don't worry, the pizza did not go to waste. The best part, was when I threw what was left into the Hackensack River, and watched the locals dive in one by one for a free meal. So I guess I did my good deed for the day. Even the Pepsi I got was bad (Hackensack river). Any pizza joint worth its weight would serve Royal Crown, its the only way. I would've been better off ordering Dominoes, which to me, is nothing but a beer mop.
