This is an unusual place and seems to offer something for everyone.... There's a coffee bar, a bar that serves up cocktails and Sangria next to it, and the restaurant itself. I really like the Mediterranean style of cooking here, as I love the flavors of grilled foods with olive oil, lemon and herbs. I walked by this place dozens of times, but when I decided to actually go in, I ordered a Tuna Stix and a Pork Stix (the meat is cubed on sticks like a shish kabob) to go. I liked the tuna so much I went back the next day for more! It tasted so fresh, and I ordered it rare, and it really tasted like tuna you'd get at a fancier, more expensive restaurant. The pork was also good; I'd also recommend the roasted baby potatoes with its delicious rosemary flavor.
