A girl friend and I went there today with our ultra low budget.  We ordered the famous Pork Belly Ramen and tender beef.  The beef was standard but the ramen was really good in NY standard.  Being a fan of Taiwanese Pork Belly Bun fan, I thought the pork was soft but not too salty or oily.  The noodle was perfectly cooked.  The soup base, however, was a bit too oily for my liking.  The pork belly was more suitable for pork belly bun! We only spent 20$ for two but we only order one ramen and a side dish...um...a bit expansive.
