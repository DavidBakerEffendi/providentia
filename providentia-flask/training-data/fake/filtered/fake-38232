Honestly thought the place a pretty cool. Unfortunately I felt disrespected by the waitress when what seemed to me like she was blatantly racially profiling myself, my friends and family. I am originally from the area so I know that 6 well dressed black people stick out like a sore thumb at an upscale bar in Glastonbury. Â I have worked the industry nearly 10 years now and half of it bartending and I know that her behavior was unacceptable. Not too sure If I would return here. Too bad the place was fun.
