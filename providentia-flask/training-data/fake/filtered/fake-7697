Easily one of my favorite Stephen Starr restaurants, El Vez is a great for a large gathering to dine and drink, as well as grabbing a quick margherita at the bar. There is no doubt that the vibe, atmosphere, and interior decoration are enticing. The food is wonderful, though a bit pricey. I recommend getting their El Vez guacamole, a guava mojito or blood orange margherita, and tacos al carbon for two.
