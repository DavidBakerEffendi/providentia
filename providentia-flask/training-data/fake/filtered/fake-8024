I have been to Walter Foods twice the first time I left thinking its was the best meal I have ever had in Williamsburg apart from Peter Luger's. Last night the food was so mediocre the chewiest, rubbery steak and the service was so lacking in personality or interest it was just BAD! I guess this place is inconsistent which mean I won't be rushing back anytime soon!
