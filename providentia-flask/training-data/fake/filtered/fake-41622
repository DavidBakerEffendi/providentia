When Yalies need a late night party venue with LOTS of chicken wings and milkshakes, you have to go Yorkside. Yeah, their pizza can be greasy and their salads too drenched with dressing, but when your hungry and you have 8 friends with you, Yorkside can seat you fast and feed you full for a great price. I've been so so so many times. As a senior in my last year of college, I'm definitely hitting this place up on weeknights again and again.
