Went here for New Year's Eve as we have the last 5 years.   We had a 7p reservation for 10 people.   Had to wait 30 minutes  no updates from the hostess. When seated we were met with a special menu which we were not expecting   Every other year the regular menu was in place.   Our waitress was spread very thin and service was slow.   We waited over an hour for our meals.  Three of us had the sea bass and were sick.  We will not return for New Year's Eve or any other night.  Very disappointed
