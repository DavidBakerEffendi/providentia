wow..I'm really surprised by some of the reviews.  I Live right down street and have been there a number of times.  Complaining it's not enough of a dive?  Look I'm all for atmosphere but I was afriad to eat or use the bathroom in Skinners.  And the booths, the booths were gross guys.   I understand the air is a glitch right now but could you at least be happy they put AIr in?  Give them a chance.  Maybe next time be pleasant, introduce yourself to the bartender and chill out.   We've had nothing but good visits.
