Reno's Pizzeria not only offers friendly service and a family eating environment, but a diverse menu that does not limit you to pizza. Their specialty pizzas, especially the Spaghetti and Meatball pizza, will surely satisfy you, but I recommend branching out to their dinner salads and Italian dinners. Personally, I have also used their catering services for picnics and parties. My guests are always asking who catered and I am happy to refer Reno's every time.
