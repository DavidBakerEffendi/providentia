This restaurant is really expensive for what you get. Tiny portions and simple sides are not included and expensive if added.  The food was about average at best.  In an area where you can get amazing food easily, it was disappointing.   My husband had the steak frites, the portion was small (maybe a 6oz steak and a tiny portion of fries) and though they boast about their special local meat it was average, it was also over $30.  He never eats all his dinner but it was such a tiny portion that his plate was bare when he finished.  I had mussels, they came with some very stale toasted bread and nothing else, I ordered a side of fries for $7 (it was about a half handful of fries) they were okay. I have had better mussels and fries many, many times (Bluebird does them fantastically).  We also each had a drink, and he had an appetizer of shrimp fritters (three ping pong ball sized fritters on a giant plate with a scatter of wilted arugula) which he said were good but I thought were gross, squishy and bland.  The best thing we had was the free chef's taste of braised carrots, which was a tiny carved ball of carrot braised in cider and served with a dot of marscapone, it was excellent but not actually on the menu.   The atmosphere was okay, comfortable and clean but really loud.  The dining room is one large open room and is also open to the kitchen, it has leather benches, maple tables, rustic lighting and decorations and then elaborate framed mirrors and art work.   The service was good and I appreciated that they had a coat check. Our bill came to $96 and we came home not feeling full or fulfilled.  I don't mind an expensive dinner (we knew it was going to be when we went there) if we are getting some value for our money, an excellent meal, real portions and not being nickled and dimed.   I wouldn't go back.
