I don't normally bother writing reviews but after reading some of the thoughtless things written below I had to respond. Until recently I had never even heard of Misconduct but a friend told me about some things they were doing for beer week, so we decided to check it out. My friends and I visited during a busy event they were having with Dogfish beer. I found that although the place was packed the service was very attentive and sensitive to a few dietary restrictions one of my friends has. We were smart enough to know the difference between salmon fillets and cured salmon, which by the way, has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IN COMMON WITH LOX, except neither is "cooked" with traditional heating methods (sorry, my family owns a restaurant back home so I get a touch worked up over the little things). The menu offers both. We know this because we actually read it. Two of us had the Misconduct Burger because our server suggested that this was the way to go since it was our first visit. They were incredible! They were cooked exactly as we had ordered them and the bun was sweet and just perfect. The fries were hot and crispy. OBVIOUSLY NOT FROZEN. My friends had chicken tenders, wings and the mozzarella. It seemed clear to me that these were not frozen either. Misconduct is now part of our bar rotation.
