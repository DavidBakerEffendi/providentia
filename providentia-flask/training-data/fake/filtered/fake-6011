I have been eating at Four Seasons for a number of years and love the food, the atmosphere (the outside patio is fabulous and private) and the service.  This past week for the first time, however, I catered a party for 65 people from here.  The owner, Ozturk, sat with me to work out a menu and to make suggestions.  I changed my mind four times in the week before the event.  Each time I called to change the menu or the pick-up time, Ozturk was friendly, patient and helpful.  The food turned out to be fabulous.  Our guests raved!  We served chicken and lamb kebabs, which were juicy and flavorful, Shepherd salad, Falafel and rice.  The spinach rolls and zucchini pancake appetizers disappeared faster than we could put them out.  And we ended the meal with amazing Baklava.  Ozturk was fabulous at estimating how much food I would need.  I am used to over-preparing and having way too much food--just in case.  For this party, Ozturk estimated exactly right.  We had the perfect amount of food.  Everyone was full and we had virtually no leftovers.  Most importantly, though, Ozturk is a wonderful businessman who makes an art form of customer service;  he is  honest and as nice as they come.  He made our whole event so special and put my mind at ease throughout the process.  I will continue to patronize the restaurant as I always have but will now cater all my parties from here as well.
