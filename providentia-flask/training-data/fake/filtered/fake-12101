My favorite restaurant hands down! Menu changes daily and everything they offer is seasonal and fresh. I've been going here for years, but am only just writing a review, as I'm only just now joining yelp. One time I had my steak cooked incorrectly. I ordered my steak medium rare and they brought it out well done. They immediately told me before they put the plate down that it was overcooked and they were working on my correct steak. Everyone in my group was eating and I was able to eat my sides. Finally they brought out my steak and it was incredible. To make it even better they told me they were removing it from the check so I got my meal free. Excellent service, excellent food, Excellent atmosphere, doesn't get any better than that!
