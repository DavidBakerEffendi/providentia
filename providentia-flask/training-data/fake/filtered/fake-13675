The corn crab chowder was AMAZING. & we loved their signature dish, the Cioppino, as the broth was the perfect compliment to the seafood. Our food came out quickly, but we were never rushed. It's BYOB and our waiter came by frequently to refill our glasses. It's almost like having a catered dinner party when you have already purchased the alcohol. Â The staff is expert and friendly. We will defiantly be back ........ Merci Beaucoop Petite Crevette!
