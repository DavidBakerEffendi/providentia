I have been going to this place since I moved to the area going on 10 years.  I love the food, but sorry to say that I will not be going back.  Just last week I was having dinner with my wife and to our surprise she found a piece of SHARP BROKEN GLASS in her food.  The waitress express deep concern and empathy.  Upon contacting the owner by phone and she put him on to speak with me.  I can clearly hear he was upstair and he did not have the decency to come down and speak to me face to face.  All he can say is he's sorry and did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to accommodate or make us feel he was really sorry in any shape or form.  As the place was busy and most tables were full he had only 1 cook handling the whole place and even he did not have time to address this issue.  So be warned that all that taste good is not safe.
