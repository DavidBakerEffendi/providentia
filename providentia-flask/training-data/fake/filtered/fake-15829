This place had the fastest service I have ever seen. The food was good, the cheesecake however was some of the best I have ever had. On one visit we had the original and on our second visit we had the raspberry swirl. Great place to go when you have the late night munchies :-) or if you don't have a lot of time. They will get you in and out quicker than you can say, "check please".
