Recently went to this restaurant with friends because we had heard great things about it.  Do not understand the great reviews at all.  I had a salad of mixed greens as my appetizer and the lettuce was all brown, wilted and bitter.  I then had the chicken francaise for my entree.  It was extremely bland and the vegetables that were served with it were disgusting.  They were extremely overcooked and mushy and were swimming in oil and garlic.  They were pretty much inedible.  I also tried the dishes that the other 2 had and they were ok, but nothing to write home about.  The food here is Pizza Parlor Italian food at best.  I will say that we ate outside in their courtyard and it was very beautiful.
