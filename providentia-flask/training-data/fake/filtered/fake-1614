Black and Brew ROCKS! The employees are very friendly and chat it up with you, if you so desire, while you are having breakfast or lunch. Seriously visiting this neighborhood café is on my agenda at least 5 days a week especially in the summer when I can sit outside, enjoy the weather, sip on an ice coffee and browse the net. The La Colombe coffee they serve has to be the best coffee I have had in years and their protein shakes are great after the gym. Try the signature omelet with a chai  YUM!  What really stands out about this establishment is the presence of the owner; she clearly takes pride in her work and truly appreciates her customers.
