Just tried it for the first time with family/friends for lunch.  Service was great, food was even better.  We had the truffled meal chips which were excellent.  I had the croquet madame - hands down the best sandwich I've had in a long time!  The fries were good and food presentation was appealing.  Would definitely go again.
