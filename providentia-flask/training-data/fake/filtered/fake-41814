Considering myself to be somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, I had to try Santucci's when I heard that they had opened a location in my neighborhood. I went in to find the place pretty full, which is always a good sign. My friend and I couldn't decide between getting a pizza or a panini, so we decided to get both and share. The square pizza we ordered was topped with a delicious tomato sauce and plenty of yummy cheese. The garlic bread cheesesteak panini was delicious! The rib-eye steak was sliced perfectly and not fatty or chewy. I would vote for Santucci's as the best pizza in the city, hands down!
