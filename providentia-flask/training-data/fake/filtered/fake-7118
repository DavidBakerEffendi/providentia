The best of the best, my all time favorite Indian place. First, the service is fantastic. It feels to me as if every waiter/waitress comes to my table at least once. Food is outstanding, a little scared to try something other than the tikka marsala sauce but I will one day..... the amazing decorations give this restaurant the 5th star. Although when they are packed, service is not at its best- what who am i to complain? i just want my food. Last thing, I have been to many indian restaurants around New Jersey, but Jyoti has the cleanest/best bathrooms! I know it sound ridiculous for my to put this in the review, but its TRUE! other's- well, lets just not go there.
