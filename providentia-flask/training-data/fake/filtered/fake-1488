the most consistent and best tasting ramen in philly. formerly ramen boy, this place has matured significantly and the food offerings are much better after they re-branded as terakawa (a welcome import from NY) and switched chefs. the broth for the ramen is really consistent (many other places in philly are good some days, and sub-par on other days) and offers a very balanced taste - not too overly seasoned but very flavorful. definitely get the terakawa noodles in everything, including the tan tan noodles which normally come with another type of noodle (the terakawa noodles are the best). a very nicely done decor but not a lot of fluff (which is good - nom nom is overly "fast food" like with a mcdonalds feel, and hiro is a direct ripoff of this place that doesn't quite measure up). i would recommend the octopus balls, the pork buns, and the gyoza - all very well done and reasonably priced. i especially like the fact that you can get many appetizer pairings with ramen as a lunch special - very convenient.
