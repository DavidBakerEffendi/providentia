Had been here several times. Second time was a disaster. We came here on a weekend late noon, and ordered two ramen, one cake, and a hot tea. The server forgot the tea completely until we remind her. I mean...I understand this place gets very busy all the time, and I was fine with it. BUT..... The ramen didn't come after 20 min. The tables next to us came after us, and their noodle was half finished. The server told us that the kitchen stopped our order because they were closing out. WHAT?! but she said they are cooking for us already, and it will be out soon. So at the end, we got the cake for free, drinks are also on the house. I was here for many time before and after, nothing like this ever happened. So I believe it was a one time thing...and the server was super nice. I would definitely come back again, but just hoping something like this won't happen to me anymore =S
