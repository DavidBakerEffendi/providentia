Bibou, the husband-wife BYO in the former Pif location is churning out wonderful dishes in a lovely space.  First, the space itself is wonderful -- warm and cozy, with lovely silverware and glassware, perfect for a delicious french meal.  Next, the food is delectable; having been there three times, my wife and I have ordered the majority of things on the menu and we are yet to be disappointed.  The pig's head terrine is silky and delicious; the duck breast is perfectly cooked; and the various specials of chantrelle mushrooms and tripe are outstanding.  Simply put, the food could not be any better.  Finally, the team of Charlotte and Pierre welcome you into the restaurant as if you were walking into their home.  They treat you as the perfect hosts and are gracious with their time and charm.  I would recommend Bibou to anyone who loves good food, value, and atmosphere.  In other words, get here as fast as you can.
