Quite possibly the best dining experience in little italy.  From. The staff, to the bar to the main dining room this place is amazing.  They have local beer on tap at the bar and they served my boys sprite in old fashioned glass bottles.  We had the house salad for an app, and my wife and I shared the lasagna for two and the boys had chicken parm.  It was fantastic.  We finished everything and the boys said the sauce rivaled my mother's who is second generation Italian.  A must for those visiting lower manhattan.
