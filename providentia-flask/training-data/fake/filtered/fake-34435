What set Umai apart from other sushi restaurants in the city was their massive specialty rolls for a great price. I've been eating at Umai for well over a year now, and eat there on a pretty frequent basis. The rock shrimp tempura is amazing, and we typically order multiple appetizers of the rock shrimp and calamari salad. When I ordered last night, I was notified that the menu had changed a bit with the rolls coming in a lesser number of pieces, but was assured it was the same amount of sushi for the price. The godzilla roll and spartan roll are our favorites, which came with about 12 pieces for $16-$18; however, the amount per roll was definitely worth the price because they were amazing. When we got the rolls yesterday, there were only 6 pieces of the spartan roll and 7 pieces of the godzilla roll - a substantial difference - for the same price. Although reassured that we'd receive the same amount regardless of the decrease in pieces, there was absolutely no way it was the same amount of sushi for the same price. I'm extremely disappointed in the decision Umai made to decrease their amount per roll because the price/amount is what set them apart from other sushi restaurants in the city tremendously. Minus how delicious the food is and the great quality of service, I doubt I'll eat there again soon. Do any other Umai-goers have similar thoughts?
