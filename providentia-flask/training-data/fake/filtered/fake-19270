After having dinner there with friends last night, Mayfield is now on my short-list of best restaurants in Crown Heights. The food is inventive without being fussy. Really enjoyed the grilled octopus with pork belly. The crisp smoked pork contrasted beautifully with the tender octopus. The fluke ceviche featured wonderfully fresh fish "cooked" to a perfect consistency, bathed in a bright citrus marinade. The duck confit salad, accented with bits of duck liver, was another surprise that worked really well. And my wife's pork chop was tasty and tender with a not-too-sweet smoky glaze, lightly charred and delicious. To top it all off the staff was prompt and helpful. Mayfield is a great place to eat.
