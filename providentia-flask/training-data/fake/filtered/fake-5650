This place is amazing!! (just ignore the awful elevator music). As soon as you walk in, you are inundated with the sweet scent of chocolate! I went in with a friend, just after dinner, and there seemed to be every table full, except for the two next to where we were seated. Though the tables were small, and kind of next to each other, it was very intimate, and private. The waitress that we had was more than attentive to our needs, and explained everything quite thoroughly. There is a whole story behind this Max guy, but you'll have to learn about it yourself. I ordered the Banana Split Waffles, which looked very much like a work of art when it came out. there were two waffles, underneath bananas that had been drizzled with chocolate. I got a side of vanilla ice cream and a vial of extra chocolate in case I wanted to pour more on my waffles! My friend got a Max-which (?) which was an ice cream sandwich of chocolate ice cream between two warm chocolate cookies. But it was HUGE, not your average ice cream sandwich! My friend ranted and raved about how good this dessert was, so much so, that she forgot to offer me any! GO to this place and order the Banana Split Waffles! It will be the best thing you ever did for yourself!
