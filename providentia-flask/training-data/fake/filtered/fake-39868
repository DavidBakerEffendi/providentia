Tony and Lucille?  they better be divorced, cuz their food needs to be taken to court for investigation.   Making racists comments and making the customers feel uncomfortable, especially out of the mouth of "Ursula" was not cool.   hey Butch, you're not funny, and next time you want to make stupid racial comments, try stand up comedy, they will probably throw tomatoes at you.   Ridiculous!  Most horrifying service ever in my entire life!!! I would rather wait on line for Pepe's for 2 hours than go back to this place.
