My boyfriend is Filipino (Pinoy) We ate here the other day and it was good! I havent really eaten too much filipino food before....so I cant really compare that much, but this was amazing! My boyfriend said it was just like home. The lechon was great! People were really nice. Really genuinely filipino place. We are definitely coming back to the place often! Oh and Halo Halo for desert!
