My wife and I visited New Haven recently and ate at the Kitchen Table several times. The food and service were great. The servers were friendly and efficient. The wine list was impressive. The chicken dinner was great; you can tell just by tasting it, that it was free range chicken (as staed on the menu), Italian night was very good as well. All in all an excellent dining experience.
