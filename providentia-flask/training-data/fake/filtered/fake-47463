We went there on 9/13, Friday night around 6pm, waited in line for about 30 minutes. When we finally got in, sat down, we were ordering drinks and our waiter informed us that their alcohol license expired and they got a new one, but something happened to it and we can't order beer or wine. Fine, we ordered water and apple juice, got our drinks and were ready to order pizzas. Our waiter again started explaining how the oven is not hot enough and we would have to wait about a half an hour to get our pizzas. After pressing him for a couple minutes he admitted that the half an hour would be more like 45 minutes and then we would have to wait for all the other people to get their pizzas (at this point he pointed at the yellow slips in the kitchen, there were about 20 of them), we also noticed how one of the guys in the kitchen was just shoveling coal into the oven. Needless to say, we left. And all this happened, after we called and asked how long is the wait for pizza and they said: 'no wait at all, two minutes for pizza' and the old grey-haired guy coming out and checking on the line outside every five minutes really just forgot to mention all the problems inside.
