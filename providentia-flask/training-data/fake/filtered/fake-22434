The first time  ive heard of this place, i already liked it so you could Just imagine my excitement the moment i actually came in to eat. The name just speaks for itself. Its very comforting especially the food. You just have to go there and try their own version of French toast, it's really good. I also tried pulled pork and grits, but you have to be early for this goes fast.  The first time I went there, it wasn't available anymore. Also, the burrito is not bad as well. Long story short, everything is good. Only thing is, the menu changes from time to time.
