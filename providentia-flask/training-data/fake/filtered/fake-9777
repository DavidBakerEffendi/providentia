having gone to school in hamden, and having lived in new haven, and having dated a highly educated food and wine expert, it comes as no shock that some of my best meals were at goodfellas.  i had my first drink with my father at goodfellas, have celebrated a number of birthdays at goodfellas, taken a number of females to goodfellas, and have drown my sorrows more than once in their meatball salad and too many bottles of chianti.  ive never had a bad meal or a bad time at goodfellas, the meatballs in the meatball salad are the best i've had (don't let my grandmother or mother hear that!) and the veal, fillet, and pork chops are all top quality.  i would say the best dinner there was at the sopranos dinner a year or so ago, nothing like being able to smoke cigars in goodfellas like you're at rao's or something.  once you become a regular, not hard to do here either, you no longer need a reservation, even on friday at 8pm. i can't say enough good about the joint, it will always be one of my favorite places, and now that i'm in nyc, i miss it more and more with every over hyped and over priced italian joint i try.
