Four stars for quality of food. It is delicious I'll give it that, but still not the best in NYC. I certainly wouldn't deter anyone from going here. Love the atmosphere, even the crowded dining area, but service can be spotty and sometimes snooty. The wait is an hour or so at brunch time but if you're not in a hurry go next door and grab a hot chocolate or tea while you wait.
