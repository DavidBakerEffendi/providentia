Been wanting to check this place out since I read about it in Weird NJ magazine.  Met friends for a quick drink late Saturday afternoon so it wasn't busy and had a great opportunity to look around. Very cool and interesting place. Great beer selection and top shelf alcohol at reasonable prices.  And the staff and owners were genuinely friendly. Had to leave but came back later that night with more friends.  Band was playing a little too loud so we grabbed a table in the bar. We didn't all have seats, and I think it was an owner who offered to get us some bar stools. My friend commented, when was the last time you were in a bar and they brought you seats? The bar itself was jammed but I managed to find a spot to order. There were 3 very busy bartenders but I was taken care of fairly quickly each time I went to order...nothing makes me crazier than when a bartender looks everywhere but at you. These ladies get high marks from me. Interesting clientele, wide age range. I was probably one of the oldest people there but I felt comfortable. We did not eat so I cannot comment on the food. In sum, interesting vibe, lots of character, great drinks, reasonable prices, great customer service, we all agreed we'd go back.
