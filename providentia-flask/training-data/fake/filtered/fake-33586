prices are fair, food is yummy, cozy ambiance. I love thai food and I was definitely not disappointed, I defaulted with dumplings and pad thai ( as padthai is the general marker for thai restaurants) - my favorite part was actually the mango and sticky rice, mango was fresh and sweet, the sticky rice contrasted nicely.
