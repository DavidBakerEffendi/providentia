I went to McLadden's for the first time last night and will definitely come back with friends.   Started off with an app that really could have passed for an entrée: the colossal baked potato.  It's a build-your-own type of thing, and I went a little nuts with the toppings.   Having learned my lesson, I opted for one of McLadden's pre-designed specialty burgers instead of going with the build-your-own option again; I had the Hawaiian burger, which was excellent.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the curly fries were delicious.   Throughout the meal, I enjoyed a few IPAs.  I don't recall the specific brew, but the server recommended it and she was spot-on.  I don't know a whole lot about beer, but they had a wide selection. McLadden's doesn't have an extensive dessert menu, but there was still a nice variety of items--which ultimately didn't matter, because I didn't have room for dessert anyway.  I'll try not to make that mistake next time!
