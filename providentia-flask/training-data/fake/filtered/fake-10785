There are better burger place for cheaper price. This place is pretentious burger joint with over priced menus. I asked for Medium rare burger and received almost burnt burger after 30 minutes of waiting I also had to wait 30 minutes before I could even place an order, and there were only 6 people in line. For a burger, fries and drink expect to shell out $15 or so. burger comes on a generic sesame buns that you can buy in any supermarket, beef was burnt and greasy, fries were pretty good but overall no extraordinary burgers here, just good ambience and over priced burgers. I've had better burgers served from a food truck.
