I don't see how one can give a lower rating because a place is crowded; it's called SUCCESSFUL.  It's a market, and markets tend to be crowded.  We had a great time, grabbed wine, fresh fish, and some great bruschetta from the vegetarian restaurant.  Have some fresh pea raviolis to cook up on Tuesday eve.  Staff was helpful, friendly, and professional.  We'll be back.
