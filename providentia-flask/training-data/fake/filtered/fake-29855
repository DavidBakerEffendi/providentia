This is a great place to bring people to if you'd like to impress them.  The soft warm colors make for an inviting ambiance.  The chandeliers bring it up a notch to classify the place for the romantic types, yet the unassuming staff make the place very welcoming.   As for the food:  delicious.  We've been there several times and each time have tried something new.  When I tasted the Duck Confit Tatertots I knew this place was a keeper.  Next time I enjoyed the Pretzel Crusted Chicken so tender on the inside and so delicious.  Next was the Mac N Cheese, loved it.  And most recently the Scallops which were also delicious and cooked just right. I enjoyed this place enough to keep returning.  I would certainly return again, in fact, I'd like to bring my mother-in-law for brunch soon.
