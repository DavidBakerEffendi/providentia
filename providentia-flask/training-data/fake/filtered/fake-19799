NIce Indian restaurant in Central NJ   Menu has very nice selection and had some tasty thing last night Score B Atmosphere is pretty cool but some of the benches on the booths were showing its age.  Score B Clenlisness was acceptable table could of been a little better wiped down floors were not swept/mopped after lunch Score C+ We were the only people at the restaurant when they opened at 5 and we finished at 6:30 and were still the only people there. Could of been because it was a Sunday night Service waitress was super nice gave us suggestions and made sure the dishes were prepared the way we like them Score A+
