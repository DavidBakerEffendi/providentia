Better than average pizza but nothing to  make a detour for. The real food is quite good (e.g., venison ragu, tripe, etc) and they clearly care about what they're doing but  portions can be miniscule. Some might say "small plates" but I'd say "amuse bouche". Come on, if your charging fair prices in a very simple restaurant why not provide  fair portions? Until they ramp up serving size I'll spend my dining dollar elswhere. Pity, I like going out for a meal near a street named "Bogart".
