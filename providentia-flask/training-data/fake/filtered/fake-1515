I've got to admit, I come to New Moon often, mostly because they've got the best cup of coffee in town, and fast, free wi-fi. Today I walked in and was pleasantly surprised to see New Moon has made some major changes. The house-made cupcakes that used to be hidden away in the back (reserved for members of a secret club or something) are now front and center. Each one that I've tried is unique and delicious. Want a recommendation? The Salty Cocoa Caramel and The Buzz (Kahlua/Espresso) are great versions of the staple cupcake flavors, but try the Champagne or Cranstachio (Gluten-Free) for a unique cupcake experience. They're BY FAR the best cupcakes I've had in BTV, and they're made with organic ingredients. There's also now an extensive selection of prepared salads available to purchase by the pound. I only tried one, the Asian Chicken Salad, and it was incredible. I'll certainly be back to try some of the others soon. The sandwiches and salads remain their usual, outstanding, selves. With an endless opportunity to modify a bed of Romaine, Field Greens, or Spinach, you'll never get tired of the options here. All the dressings are home made. They're so good, I've bought bottles to take home. If I've got a complaint is has to do with the process for ordering food. Honestly, it's pretty confusing. You've got to order first, and then wait in line to pay. If it's your first time here, you might feel out of sorts. Overall though, it's no biggie. I'll take a great atmosphere, great food, great coffee, any day. Hit up New Moon. It's one of Burlington's hidden treasures.
