Make sure to try the Yams, they taste like Christmas.  My family used to go here years ago and I recently had my first trip back since they re-opened.  The food is still amazing and Sandra's kids bring a new energy and passion to food that needs no introduction.  Glad you guys are back!!!  Great atmosphere, very friendly and at home feel.  Sweet tea and cornbread are must haves.  Just make sure you are hhungry, servings are more than generous
