Well there are over two thousand reviews so it's all kind of been said. Not worth the wait. If by some miracle you get to this place on a day with no wait at all then sure, sit down and enjoy a decent breakfast. But, waiting for anything over a half hour and honestly it will not be worth it. Pancakes are fine. Certainly not the best in the city, or best in the neighborhood, maybe nor even best on the block. Not as fluffy as other reviewers have said. Like diner pancakes they tend to just crumble apart (meaning they are slightly too dry.) The bacon was store bought and really nothing special. Eggs slightly over cooked. I am confused why this place is considered to be so amazing. Unlike some other reviewers I have to say the staff was friendly and trying there best to accommodate the enormous crowd. In fact they gave me a free coffee because of the long wait and were quick to refill it for free. Thank you. Sadly, some tourist patrons think this place is a hang out, and continue to stay seated at their tables for an hour even after they have eaten and paid. Rude tourist behavior...especially while there is a line of people waiting in the cold to be seated. So highlight- staff, food- ok, wait- not worth it.
