Of all the spots in Philly for two out of towners to land on a Saturday night, my buddy & I hit the jackpot! For a couple of 30 somethin' married guys this place has "Danger Will Robinson, Danger!!" written all over it. :) I had the meatloaf dinner which I devoured in about 2 min... and instead of just having our 2 drinks & hitting another spot, thanks to Rory the bartender upstairs we stayed for a few hours! He was AWESOME!! ...as the night progressed it got a bit crowded, but we hung in there...met a few "meatheads" but the ladies we met made the time fly by! Thanks Rory!! Had a great time!! We'll be back!! One-Eyed Mike
