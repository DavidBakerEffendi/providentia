My friend and I were in Philly for a few hours last night and were on our way home when we stopped into this wonderful little shop. The sign said they were open until 11:00 and it was around 11:45, but we poked our heads in to see if they were still available. The staff was so friendly, even towards late night stragglers. They took our orders, made conversation,and all the products were pretty cheap. Even though the experience lasted about 10 minutes in all, I would definitely bring a friend there the next time I go to Philly. Check it out! You'll be glad you did. (P.S. The ginger twist tea is SUPER delicious!)
