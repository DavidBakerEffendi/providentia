Don Peppe...  the food is 5 stars...  however, if you take no offense to the rudeness of the staff, the management.  If you take no offense to being handed the check and literally asked to leave just as your dessert is being served..  the reason,  "They need the table"     what can I say..   except ..  never again!     if in Queens, I'd go with Vetro or Matteo's..  at least they are civil!
