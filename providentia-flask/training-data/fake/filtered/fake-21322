I absolutely love Bogota! I have dined here a few times over the past few years and it gets better every time! Every dish I have ordered is great. The last 2 dishes I ordered was the Paella and one of the specials, the Fried chicken. Both were delicious! The fried chicken was so crispy and juicy. You have to dip the chicken in the honey, it makes it so much better. I love the mojitos, I have to get one every time I go. Maragritas are also very good. Who can beat all day happy hour Monday - Wednesdays? We had Catleen as our server and she was awesome!! She was nice, attentive and friendly. We had a very late dinner so we had a chance to talk to Catleen since she didn't have a lot of other tables. She had us laughing the entire time! Over all I love this restaurant. I never have to wait long for a table or for my food. Food and drinks are always delicious. We definitely hope to be catching Catleen on another one of her shifts. She was a fantastic server and made dinner so much more enjoyable.
