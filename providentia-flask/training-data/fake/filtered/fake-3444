These four stars are for the excellent food, if there were stars for customer service it would be a negative four stars.  Every single time I go there or order a delivery the girls are so rude and short with me.  It's kind of annoying and I am not a person to get upset quick about people not being nice but they really are never nice.  If you have a short temper send someone else to get the food because you will be upset.  The food is delicious and I guess you have to just put up with the rudeness.
