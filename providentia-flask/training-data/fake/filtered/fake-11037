Simply the best ramen in NYC! Ippudo has been disappointing for me because of the over-hype, but despite the high expectation my friend has given about this place, I simply cannot find fault about this place! The chicken paitan ramen (the original) has absolutely the best broth I've ever had; and the torched pork was wondeful, it's thick cut but tender with the perfect proportion of fat and meat, which I much prefer than the ippudo's thin-cut lean pork slices. And the off menu unidon (yes, uni as in sea urchin, not unagi) was delightful as well! Oh, and the obligatory note: yes, it's a long wait but it's worth it.
