Came tonight with a group of six. It was Labor Day, and the place was pretty busy, but it only took around twenty minutes for us to be seated. We didn't receive service for at least another ten, and when the waiter finally came over, he told us they didn't have any bread left. However, a few minutes later, we saw another table receiving bread, and we finally did as well. Don't know what was up with that. The waiter also apologized in advance because they were short-staffed, it being a holiday and all. Okay, no problem. We all ordered our food. While waiting, we watched another table receive multiple wrong orders. Our own food came in a strange order, with appetizers and main courses arriving at the same time, while others were missing. My salad arrived after the eggplant rollatini and pizza did. When my pasta finally arrived, it had cheese in it. It was spaghetti aglio olio with diced tomatoes, which is traditionally a cheese-less dish anyway. It had to be sent back, meaning that everyone was pretty much finished by the time I got to eat. Despite the terrible service, the food was pretty good. My dish had a bit too much garlic, but otherwise, everyone was satisfied. It would've been nice if they had offered us free coffee or dessert or something, rather than just apologizing as we walked out. Certainly not a place I would go back to again, unless someone else is paying.
