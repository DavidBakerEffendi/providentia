I recently had a baby shower event at Frankie's in the backyard Stable, and while I only have great things to say about the food, ambiance and staff, I have to caution future party planners about the "beverage package" they select.  While you think that you're paying for 3 or more hours of cocktails you should know that your guests will not be asked or advised of their beverage choices at the event.  No beverage items will be displayed on the bar or anywhere else after the first round of belinis or mimosas are offered on trays to arriving guests.  The wine you thought you purchased will not be in carafes during the meal and no wait staff will go around taking drink orders.  The result for my afternoon party was that guests had their initial preprepared bellini on arrival and then drank the water that was frequently replenished in their glasses for the rest of the afternoon.  Being the hostess, I drank wine and got immersed in the event.  Only after a guest asked me where to purchase a glass of wine did I realize this problem.  But that was 2 hours into the party and right before desert.  I informed Frankie's the next business day and the response was that they would keep this in mind for future events.  My advise to future party planners utilizing Frankie's is that there are some simple solutions to this problem if you preplan with a cautious approach.  Maybe ask for servers to actively take drink orders, or ask for wines to be in carafes on the tables, or have a few bottles/drinks displayed on the bar.  Perhaps prepare a bartop chalkboard that lists your beverage options. Having this variable taken care of, the rest is the best.
