I have tried most of the restaurants in the Hartford area because I travel there for work on a regular basis. Usually I am not impressed with any meal when I'm on the road. I came across Rizzuto's a few years ago. From the first visit it felt like home. The friendly staff and impressive food selection is worth just walking in. Once you try the food you will always come back. One of the appetizers everyone needs to have is the mussels Fra diavolo . This dish can only be described as delicious.. The menu ranges from unique salads to fire grilled pizza to incredible sauté  work  to pasta that bring back memories of long trips throughout Italy. The wine selection will make any Foodie smile. It is wonderful to see an eatery run right!! The best best thing is you don't have to take a second mortgage on your house to have a fabulous night there...
