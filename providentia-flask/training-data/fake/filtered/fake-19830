Service by Alex was great but the food was terrible.  It is clear that the jambalaya has been sitting in a pot out of which it is dished.  It was bland and mushy, and isn't anything like what is served in New Orleans.  I've never taken the time out to write a restaurant review, but we all felt outraged at how terrible the food was.  There are so many wonderful restaurants in Astoria.  This is not one of them.  The restaurant is a great gimmick but lacking in substance and quality.   By the way, if you are a wine drinker you can forget it.  There is no wine list.  They only have one choice of white and red by the glass, both of which are very poor.
