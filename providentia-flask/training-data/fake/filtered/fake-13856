It's got that old school,thin crust,grease dripping flavor.Standard toppings, nothing special.But that adds to the guarantee.Fountain drinks,cold cuts, and manicotti to die for.Chicken Parm and Veal Parm---perfection.And back to the old school feeling,steak style French Fries.Hey, i's even got Italian Icees, straight outta the can!Marino's brand straight outta Brooklyn! Can't go wrong, not the best neighborhood,so go during the day if you're the timid type.
