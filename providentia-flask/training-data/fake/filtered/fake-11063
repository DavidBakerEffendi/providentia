I love grilled cheese and get it everywhere I go!! When I walked by, the relaxing atmosphere drew me in as did the cute boy by the counter! The selection of grilled cheese sandwiches made me drool and not for no reason; when I got my sandwich, I enjoyed every aspect of it- the combinations are unique and definitely worth trying. After I stuffed my face with a grilled cheese sandwich and some french fries served with a delicious aioli, I couldn't resist the "dessert" sandwich and got the one with the nutella and banana! It was like a symphony in my mouth! Not only do they have these amazing sandwiches but they also have wine on tap as well as an awesome selection of beers! The overall experience was just splendid and I would definitely recommend it!
