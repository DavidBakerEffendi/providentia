I ordered the chicken and rice platter and paid.  I then asked for a cup of water.  They refused to give me a cup of water and pointed to the beverage case.  I know restaurants make money on beverages, but I can't believe a restaurant can refuse a paying customer a cup of water.   The menu said the platter of chicken and rice comes with lettuce and pita.  What it did not say was that a generous amount of yogurt sauce would be squeezed all over the chicken.  I can't blame them -- the chicken was surprisingly bland given the restaurant's name.  But I didn't want yogurt sauce on my chicken.  Adding insult to the injury was the gigantic squeeze bottle of yogurt sauce they brought to my table.  If you are going to give me a quart of yogurt sauce, why did you squirt sauce all over the chicken already?  Also, if you give away the yogurt sauce for free, why can't you give away a cup of water?  Could I trade the yogurt sauce for the water?   I probably should have gone with one of the rolls, since those seem to be well reviewed, but I'm never going to bother returning to try them. EDIT 7/31/13 (changed rating from one star to three):  With all the positive reviews of the rolls, I just had to try them, and they are good.  I've been back twice. Particularly like the aloo.  Every time I go, though, I ask for a cup of water, and then ask why they won't give me one.  One time they told me they had "issues."  I asked what that meant, and they said people were spilling the cups of water.  I guess the other beverages never spill?  I was tempted to say, "Give me a cup of water -- I'll give you five bucks if I spill it."  The next time I was told the policy exists because "this is fast food" and it would slow things down if they had to bring me a cup of water.  Frankly, none of this is credible. Whatever. In sum: go with the rolls; skip the flavorless chicken platter; fight the power and politely urge them to give you a cup of water.
