I am writing this review after visiting the restaurant for the second time. Interestingly my negative experience preceded the positive one I had today. I was convinced by my friends to give it a second chance, and I am glad I did. The first visit was right before Thanks Giving with my family. We were seated in a drafty part of the restaurant, ignored by waitstaff, and our food arrived way after the food of others who ordered after us and who appeared to have had ordered similar dishes. That set aside, the food was decent, except it all came out at different times, which was strange. By the time the rest of my family's food came out mine was cold. That's no fun, especially for someone who works in a restaurant and understands why there is never an excuse for this happening. This experience alone is a 1 or a 2 star event. Today, however, my experience was relaxing. I went in alone and was greeted with a pot of delicious herbal tea, which I enjoyed until my Pho special (typical pho with an assortment of beef balls, and various cuts of beef) arrived. All of the accouterment (sprouts, basil, jalepeno, lime wedges) were fresh and allowed me to experiment with the taste throughout the meal. This experience alone is a 4 or 5 star event. For me a good bowl of pho is an elixir. I left Nam Phuong rejuvenated today. My advice is to go during off hours in a small group. Long live affordable Vietnamese cuisine! Cheers!
