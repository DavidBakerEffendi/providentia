Food was salty and soulless, it was a sunday night and I was there for dinner. The food was overly salted and had absolutely no care put into it, if the chefs can't even taste the tripe(dare i say tripe as it is one my my favorite ingredients) they serve. Things like the duck rilletes were unbalanced and had no care put into it. Since it was sunday the chef could possibly be out but if his lackeys are to inept to even handle the food then why bother. The only good points were the cold cuts in the beginning with great cheese albeit too mild, and the dessert which was fair enough. I would come back here but only if any of the criticism of this place was taken into account. I would give it a 2.5 but i will settle for two.
