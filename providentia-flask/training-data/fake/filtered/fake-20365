Like someone else who recently commented, my mom and I ordered waters which we never got. We ordered the pot of "moroccan green tea" which was not filtered, so it poured leaves and other tea bits into our glasses. We asked for a strainer and they said they did not have one. Our tea was filled with tea leaves. Then, I took a bite into the piece of falafel on the salad I ordered, there was literally glass in it. Tiny shards that crunched so loudly, it was the biggest turn off from food I'd ever experienced. I told one of the waiters (with entire sets of keys dangling off their pockets, like the observation of a previous reviewer) and he said it was probably salt or plastic... I did give them the shards I had spit out to prove it and he was polite about it. But still.. The place is cute, I'm a fan of the lights outside, but I question their sanitation and wouldn't visit again.
