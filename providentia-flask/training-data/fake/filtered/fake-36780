Found this little gem quite by chance and we can't wait to go back!  My wife got the Vegetarian Mediterranean with delicious variety of olive salad etc.  When the owner brought out the dish he had overcooked the initial set of falafel and brought them out along with an extra set of perfectly cooked falafel.  I ordered the Bean Wrap with cheese etc and had all I could do not to order another it was soooo delicious.  Every place I've ever been will bring you a "glass" of chi.  The owner brought us a small pot that we had to share.  If vegan always tasted this good everyone would walk away from meat.  This is a destination!
