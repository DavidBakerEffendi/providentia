I live around the corner and am super excited that this place has gotten so much better since it was a euro disco cafe bar! I went in with my boyfriend and we split the fish tacos (mhmm flavorful) and the quinoa salad. Both were great. With the tacos you can get a corona for $2 or a house margarita for $5. The margarita was a little weak but very fresh. :) The service is great and I hope this place thrives!
