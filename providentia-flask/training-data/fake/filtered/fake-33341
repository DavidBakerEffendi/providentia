I heard alot of wonderful commentary about Audrey Claire's that it definitely caught my interest and curiosity.  I went last weekend and was a 3 hour wait which made me even more curious and anxious to experience this place.  I honestly have to say that myself and my party of 8 were all so disappointed.  Some of the food was decent enought but the service was ok with a bit of an attitude.  The workers treated you as it you were lucky to be eating at thier restaurant.  The shortrib was very fatty and not a good cut of meat at all and the mussles very fishy.  The creme Brulee was over cooked as well.  After waiting 3 hours I had high expectations which were definitely not met for myself nor anyone else in my party.  I think this place survives because it is BYOB and would definitely not recommend waiting 3 plus hours for this lousy, obnoxious experience.  This is by far not my definition of fine dining or even would consider it a trendy environment.  In addition to the inadequate food and service with a tude, the place was so noisy that it made it complicated to converse with the folks next to you.   NONE OF US WOULD EVER GO BACK AND WOULD NOT SUGGEST WASTING PRECIOUS TIME ON THIS RESTAURANT.
