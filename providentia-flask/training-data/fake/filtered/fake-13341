Well my first official review goes to this wonderful God sent restaurant which me and my wife visited last night. At first I was a little worried about the service because the cashier didn't really know anything at all about the menu at all but the food wrapper saved the day he came and told what to order and how to order it. He suggested the chicken burrito with short rib and it was BOMBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!!! I hope I didn't get him in trouble he actually tried to make it for me but that didnt sit to well with whom I assume is the owner. My wife had the pork burrito which was spicy as helllll lol. Over all I love this restaurant. From the food to the staff. So the combination of the food and the food guro/foodwrapper I give u guys a high 5 star. Ill see u soon and tell him im sorry if I got him in any trouble.
