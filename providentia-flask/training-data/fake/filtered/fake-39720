food fabulous, service not so good. Â the wait staff are pleasant, enthusiastic and knowledgeable... they're just way too hard to find for a dinner that's way over $100 per person (with average wines and other libations). this place is so close to world class ... silly to cheap out on the easiest thing to fix -- enough staff to tend the table...
