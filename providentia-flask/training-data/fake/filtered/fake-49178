Just to tack onto what Hassan A commented on... a few times my lady and I have gone to this spot and they have been good but began to slowly decline overtime....we assumed that maybe they sold it to a new owner or something...we began to notice things like chipped plates being served to us, broken and chipped beer glasses being served to us (on several occasions), dirty silverware, unprofessional staff members, some wearing fitted hats with shirts un-tucked like if they just come in off the street and right to work, sushi has been sent out warm/above room temperature on several occasions (just to name a few as this was never liked this before) but we still kept going back hoping that at some point, things will hopefully be better the next time. The last time we went, it seemed a little bit off ....we were seated not by the hostess as she was too busy texting, but by a person who appeared to be a dishwasher as he came out to the front area with a wet, dirty apron on..... we then noticed that there was a second "hostess" that set up a bar table and began to charge a cover at the door... so as i was finishing my meal, i asked my server what the second hostess was about and was told that Â after a certain time, the owner rents out half of the bar to a promoter and the promoter then charges an entrance fee for it. Its seems to be something done without a lot of the staff knowing as that was pretty much all he told me or all he wanted to tell me. when we decided to leave we noticed the guard posted outside the place (assuming he was ID'ing and patting down people) at this point i was convinced that this joint becomes a night club after hours... but anyways...the food was good, it's so-so now...service was good, the service is terrible now....the fish tank is the only thing that keeps me coming back
