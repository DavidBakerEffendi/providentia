We went here recently and ordered some food.  It took 38 minutes for the appetizers to come out and another 20 before the entres came out.  The OCD waitress kept refilling everyone's glasses with water every 30 seconds (not exaggerating), even if you were drinking sprite.  Other people had come and gone by the time we had gotten our food. Pad thai was good but the meat was dry.  By the time we were eating we had headaches because of the 60+ minutes we had been sitting in the smell of thai food with the lights dimming every few seconds like the wiring was bad.
