Just came finished having brunch at Joseph leonard and I have to say I was extremely disappointed, not by the food but by the service and the waitstaff. Not only did they open 15min late but they were rude and treated everyone like they were doing you a favor for letting them eat there. I am over paying to be treated badly. Not only that but my entire meal I had to listen to 2 bitchy queens (I can say that cause I am gay) make fun of the customers as well as the people passing by it was really an uncomfortable experience. Longer I stayed the more annoyed I got and notice the people around me trying to get some service but the waitstaff were too busy gossiping and making fun. Very disappointing considering I love Jeffrey's and part of the same ownership. This place was amateur at best
