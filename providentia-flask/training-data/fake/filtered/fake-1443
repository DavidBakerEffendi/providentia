Cute little Austrian cafe. We waited in line for 30 min to get into the cafe. Once we got in, we were seated at a nice window booth. The desserts, especially the sachertorte, were delicous! However, we thought the price for the coffee was way to expensive $6 a cup. It was good coffee, just not really worth the price. If we had not waited in line for so long and the prices for coffee were maybe a dollar or two lower, I would have rated this place higher. Waiting 30 min and paying $25 for two coffees and one dessert, just wasn't worth it.
