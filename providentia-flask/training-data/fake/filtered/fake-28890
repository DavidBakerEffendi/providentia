Not at all satisfied with this place. Terrible service, waitresses and bartenders with attitude. Touchtunes was muted so don't waste your credits. When I brought it to their attention I was rudely told off and asked if I wanted my money back. At the same time a patron (old man with beard) began to get more hostile and flashed his t shirt for the bar. Not sure if I was supposed to be intimidated or what but I found it to be a bit more unprofessional. I did not ask for my money back as it was more a matter of principle. Coming from the service industry myself I was not impressed whatsoever. Go next door to bru. Better atmosphere and much higher quality of service.
