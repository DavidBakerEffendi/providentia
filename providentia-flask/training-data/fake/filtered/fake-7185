I have been going here for about six years now, and I have never had a complaint. Everything I have tried has been excellent, from the sandwiches to the catered meals. I try to stop by at least once a week and pick up a #4 (Fresh Mozzarella, sundried tomato, and basil) which is hands down the best sandwich I have ever eaten. My family has ordered catered food multiple times and everyone only has the greatest things to say about the food, and that means a lot coming from such a large and picky family. I have friends who will come in from Hoboken and Weehawken just to get a sandwich. To top it all off the owner Frank is a great guy, who is constantly throwing in either biscotti, assorted Italian cookies, or garlic bread for free. The only problem is anytime I go to another deli for a sandwich I am left unsatisfyed because they do not compare to Appetizzio's.
