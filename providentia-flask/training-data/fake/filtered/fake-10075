FAB - U - LOUS! The atmosphere is trendy and sexy. 70's square boxes chandeliers over the bar with light blue velvet swivel bar stools with backs .. the food is great - BEST i had was the SHRIMP TACOS and the MAC AND CHEESE -- served in this sinful little pie crust - tasty --- oh, and the SPICY MARGARITA is fantastic-- but only for the edgy... an uptight a-hole who is sensitive to spice may not appreciate it - be warned :)
