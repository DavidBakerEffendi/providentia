Think twice before going there.  I have been a customer for years and noticed that I was overcharged but did not realize it until I got home. I thought they had made an honest mistake so i let it go as being my fault for not catching it while I was there. It was just a small amount but on my next visit I told myself I will make sure the amount is correct before leaving.  Well, sure enough I was told a price that is too high again!  I was using a coupon and the 7% tax should have been all that I owed.  When I pointed it out to the owner, he became very smug and blamed it on his calculator.  Instead of apologizing and fixing the mistake, he threw the difference in change at me!  We exchanged some words and I swore I will never set foot in this place again!  Not a nice way to treat a repeat customer!!  Make sure you are not OVERCHARGED as I was!!
