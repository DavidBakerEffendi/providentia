This was one of the first restaurants I went to when i moved into this neighborhood and I loved it immediately. The ambience has this amazing rustic feel and every thing is really really chill. The wait staff is fantastic and it feels very authentic. I have eaten here for both breakfast and dinner. The breakfast is really good and cheap, try the cinnamon coffee with steamed milk, its amazing. And I love the steak and empanadas for dinner!
