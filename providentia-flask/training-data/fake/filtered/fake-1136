My girlfriend and I love this spot. The sharing menu is awesome. Great for groups. I'd highly recommend the bbq chicken quesadilla the chicken, Â lettuce wraps, the lamb flatbreard and the chicken marsala. The vibe is super chill, great decor and if you don't want to eat the roof deck bar is a good spot to hangout with friends.
