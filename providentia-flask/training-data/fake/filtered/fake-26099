I have eaten at the restaurant at least a half dozen times since they opened and love the food. The place is clean and the dining room tables are spacious and stylish. I like the feel of the place and the servers are friendly and helpful. I have not had Mexican food this good in years, and will not even dare compare Azteca to the chain restaurants that serve Mexican-style food. I love the homemade guacamole and chips and the pico de gallo. All the menu items are made from scratch and are worth ordering. The fish is fresh and very tasty, and I think the chef does a great job preparing the huge rib-eye steak to my liking. I have eaten every dish on the menu over my last few trips, and my favorites are still the rib-eye steak, tilapia, shrimp and quesadillas with the grilled pork and pineapple called carne al pastore... Sometimes I just stop in to get a salad topped with grilled pork and pineapple or chicken. It's about time that an authentic Mexican restaurant opened in Bergen County!
