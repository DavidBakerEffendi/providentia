My family and I accidentally stumbled upon D'Angelo's while strolling through Princeton last weekend. My husband & I  were blown away by the food & its presentation. Our panninis were delish...kind of reminded us of our favorite restaurants back home in Brooklyn. Even though it was a bit crowded, the staff made us feel right at home by accomodating us with seating foor us and our triple stroller. Its hard to go anywhere with triplets but I have to say...D'Angelo's is definately kid / family friendly.  Their desserts were also amazing. My husband chose the chocolate truffle tartufo and I had the frozen yougurt & berries...they were both sensational. As we were leaving, one of the owners offered our triplets, Kyle, Connor & Emily, a small batch of cookies free of charge. We would highly reccomend this eatery to anyone!!!
