As a great fan of their sister restaurant up the street this is usually the first option if the wait is too long at The Little Owl. Their food is almost as good, the space is more open and spacious, and the service is equally good. There is just something about these two restaurants; they use the best produce and are not afraid to let those flavors come through in their dishes. Great wine selection, and usually a few really good beers to boot. My favorite used to be the squid that is no longer on the menu, but the carpaccio is also great. I recently had the braised shortribs, and it was great! I loved the accent of the horseradish that really gave the dish some character. This is a great spot for a date, or maybe a family dinner!
