I love the food, the ambience and it's excellent. I hope they will stay that way and keep up the good work. I was also reading the other reviews and especially the one from Angelo G. First of all, YOU SOUNDED VERY BIASED AND VERY IGNORANT. How dare you to talk ill of that pregnant lady. chill and get a life dude. If she gives good service, then she deserve a good tip. It sounded very personal when you wrote up about her and said something good about the other waitress ( To me, sounded like someone told you to make that statement). Every time I patron the restaurant and mind you, I am also a frequent customer and everyone, including the owner, is wonderful and the wait staff is very friendly. So, before reading the NEGATIVE Â I would suggest that everyone go try it and I guarantee that you'll love it just as much as I do.
