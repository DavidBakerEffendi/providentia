What a disappointment. The atmosphere was ok, though they could turn the air up a little. My dinner arrived cold (I guess the air is working in the back). My guest's meal arrived about 5 minutes later (service anyone?). The staff did not appear well versed in any of the foods or have any knowledge regarding pairings. 'Everything tastes good with everything'. I could almost hear the gum clacking. Very expensive. Not worth the wait. Avoid.
