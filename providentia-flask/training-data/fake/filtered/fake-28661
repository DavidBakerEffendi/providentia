their shish kabobs are really good, rice and grilled tomato. the included salad is meh. they are a little in the pricey side for shish but it make i usually end up with 2 meals. Good hummus. Baba ganoush was not good but i think its because i am use to lebonese version. their bread is really good. stuffed cabbage is a good vegetarian option.
