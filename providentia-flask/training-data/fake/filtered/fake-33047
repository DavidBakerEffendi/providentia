OMG... I live in NJ and i went by downtown and i sow the restaurant and i promise i have to come to eat arepas..so i did wit my husband... this is food from heaven and talking to the waitress this is is a family owned restaurant so i felt like  at home.               in downtown all the restaurants are very expensive and small so this has a good space and the price was right. the decor is cool,i felt like in vacation for 1 hour1/2. I have read some of the recommendations and 1.) i dont think is fair to judge this restaurant food by how the waitress did by you.( make a complain to the owner but no in the internet) waitress come and go and they can be nice or not  its not the owners fault. 2.) not everything can be fried, but if you ask the owner _chef he might be able to fried the empanadas for you. ( just try) 3.) In this economy people should be more careful with posting about restaurants , some of this owners are not rich so they need the income to survive. you can complain if you see a rat in the kitchen, a roach, the place is dirty.. but just because you dont like the food because is dry for you (?) or no fried(?) is not fair, not everybody has he same taste. 4.) I am picky and i dont eat everywhere and i can say its a clean place, nice people, nice food, cool prices, not super crowded ( even though i waited 15mntes for a table sitting on the bar) and i won't eat everything in their menu. I will eat the things i like ,i dont need to try things that i know i wont like and then complain ( i know already i dont like it in this restaurant or any other. so i dont eat thing that i know i dont like. ) Peace and love to everyone and give it a try, i  know i will  go back next time i go to new york!
