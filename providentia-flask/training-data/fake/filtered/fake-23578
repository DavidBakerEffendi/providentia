Love it. The food was delicious, we were a group of 5, and everyone was super pleased. Shared appetizers, Artichoke salad, love, grilled sardines, love love, Calamari was ok, polenta and mushroom appetizer was amazing. And we had spaghetti carbonara, steak, lasagna... but the best best best dish was the mushroom penne (homemade penne), it was to die for. The ambience is awesome, staff was very attentive... the crowd, uh, not trendy, not very interesting. But go there for the food!
