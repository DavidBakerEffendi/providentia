Having enjoyed breakfast, lunch and dinner several times at Kanella, I (and those dining with me) have found the food consistently outstanding. All of the dishes are fresh, flavorful and presented appetizingly. The service is wonderful, with caring and attentive waiters and hostesses. A small restaurant, the atmosphere is both intimate and festive. I have found Kanella's specials to be exciting and creative....At the same time, I always look forward to the pita and varied dips. Oh, and the desserts...from homemade ice creams to baklava, unique and delicious. Yummy coffees and teas (I enjoy both). A strong personality is behind any successful restaurant. I was lucky enough to be dining when the chef came out from the kitchen. He seemed to care about everyone's meal and was friendly and personable. Enjoy the food and enjoy the atmosphere. Kanella is rare gem of a restaurant. What more can one ask for to have a wonderful dining experience, but fresh, flavorful food, lovely atmosphere and great service...all with a lot of heart.
