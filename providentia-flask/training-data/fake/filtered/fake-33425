I always drive past this place and never really gave it a shot. If you say the name out loud it sounds like "Lousy Chinese Restaurant" which is funny. I finally got around to trying it though and it is a shocker. The food is great. The service is excellent. And the fare is quite close to authentic. I'd rate the place higher, but sometimes there is a consistency issue. If they could hit the mark every time this place would be 5 stars for sure. It's really good food though, but stick to their recommended items and you'll never miss.
