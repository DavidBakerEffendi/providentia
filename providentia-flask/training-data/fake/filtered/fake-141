We drove from NYC to attend a day at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Wonderful day trip until we took the suggestion of a couple of locals to head over to this dump for cheese steak. The bread, meat, onions were just  as tasteless as the people who were serving it up.  I had a stomach ache all night after eating one of these fake cheese steaks. Sorry for you Philadelphia ...YUKKK!!
