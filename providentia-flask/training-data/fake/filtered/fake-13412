Service was terrible.  They had us at a table that was for 4 people and we were 5.  Everything was crowded on and around the table.  The servers kept knocking into us and not apologizing.  The food was good, but the experience less than . . . Also, I have never seen a messier, less attractive rest room at what is supposed to be one of the nicest restaurants in town.
