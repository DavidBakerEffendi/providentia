Love This Place! Whenever I visit my college friend on the UPS we go to Kefi. The place is always lively and the food is truly great. I enjoy everything. In particular I love the meatballs, pita spreads and last, but not least, the sheep milk dumplings! AMAZING! Not sure if the offer the special menu but they offer a three course menu at $39.95 where some of the aforementioned items are available - can't beat it! Will always go back- craving those dumplings now!
