I work close by to the 3 monkeys and love going there after work. The decor is new and mondern but it still has a homely feeling some how. There is something for everyone here big tv's brillant playlist, beers and beers on tap, i try to have a new beer everyweek. The food here to is awesome the wings have to be some of the best i've tasted in new york. The staff here are always so friendly and welcoming this is one of the best finds in new york. Worth checking it out
