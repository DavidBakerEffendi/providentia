I absolutely loved this place, I went last night and was blown away! The space has such beautiful the decor; marble counters, expose brick, candlelight, amazing photography. The details are gorgeous! The service was really great, friendly, prompt yet professional, and the FOOD was so yummy! My fav was the eggplant parm ( which I learned is a family recipe) Love that! And to top it off everything was priced just right :) Go and check this place out. it's well worth it!
