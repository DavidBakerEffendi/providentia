The wait time is pretty long but they text you when your table is ready, which is pretty convenient. The atmosphere is nice. Love the decor and the meat hook lighting, but this place is LOUD. Don't expect to be able to have a conversation in here. We were surprised to discover that our nacho appetizer was made with fresh kettle cooked potato chips instead of the usual tortilla chips, but it tasted pretty good. Anything with their cheese sauce is amazing. Our entrees were okay. I had the burger salad with parmesan crusted fries on it. The fries seemed greasy and soggy... they weren't that good. The burger was juicy and tasted pretty good. The salad was alright. Nothing special. I took 3 bites and was full. The food here tastes good but is so heavy and greasy that it fills you up for hours. We were feeling slightly sick for the rest of the night. Overall experience was sub-par.
