The food is good. The decor is charming (as long as you're inside). But comparisons to "Manhattan's elite" and the "West Village" are a stretch. So is "best in all of NJ." Just not true. Certain dishes -- like the much-mentioned lasagna -- are very good (although even that is not really consistent). But, all in all, 3 stars is the most you can say with certainty. Atmosphere is incredibly noisy -- you can't hold a conversation, especially if you're two-top and there's a six-top nearby. Service is either slow or rushed (or, too often, a deadly combination of the two) and servers are a bit too obvious in their charm. "Welcoming" would be a stretch goal for a Giotto hostess -- I've never even seen one of them smile. Hostesses and servers are downright rude if they are feeling stress (which is pretty common since Giotto consistently overbooks). I actually had a busboy ask for my plate when my fork was still in my hand! I don't find HUGE portions to be appetizing or even preferable. Risotto slushing over the side of the plate just looks messy and unappetizing. Likewise any pasta dish. Skip gimmicks like the fried potato basket for calamari and focus on fresher, more tender fish. Make salads smaller and charge less -- don't need a meal-sized salad to precede a meal. Desserts are good -- no better than most local restaurants -- but hard to enjoy if your server is rushing you out to make room for the next seating. You can tell the difference between a restaurant that loves its food and customers and one that has become smug. Giotto is one of the latter. Sort of like Raymonds.
