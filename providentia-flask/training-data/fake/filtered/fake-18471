SERIOUSLY? It is 29 degrees outside ((you have a crowd of people including the elderly)) at 11:53 and the doors are locked for a 12 noon reservation...called the restaurant to confirm the address and yep I am at the right place but the doors literally do not open until 12pm...WHAT??? Me:  You think when someone is making a reservation you would want to tell them that? Gramercy Tavern:  We'll it's like a bank, we open when we open? HUH??? Poor, poor customer service!!!...I don't care if the food is good you just lost a customer! and I plan to find as many sites to keep posting this same complaint.
