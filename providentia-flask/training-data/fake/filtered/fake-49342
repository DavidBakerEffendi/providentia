I bought a groupon for this restaurant. We like indian food - it was a bit of a drive but we figured we would give it a try. We drove over there and we presented it and he said "we are not taking that" I said "its a groupon, i paid money for this" he said i know the guy in charge of that is no longer here" I said "you got this money already". I also explained that we drove 40 minutes. he said "i cant help you sorry" the restaurant was empty at the time - really messed up We went to the turkish place next door and enjoyed that very much. DONT PATRONIZE this guy
