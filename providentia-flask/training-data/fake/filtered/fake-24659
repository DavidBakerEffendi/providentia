Our party of 3 was there during Restaurant Week end Jan 2013. Amazing food, fabulous service. My only gripe is that the kobe beef fried rice was overcooked, almost to the point of being slushy. The rest of our 7 course Restaurant Week Special was Â faultless ! Definitely, a repeat visit is guaranteed. 4.8 out of 5 stars ...
