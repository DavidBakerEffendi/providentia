Daughter told me of there delicious HOME MADE iced tea so I had to try for myself...anyone who made iced tea that good had to have great food!  Hubby and I stopped in for lunch...they gave general tsos chicken in form of huge white me cutlets! Not that fatty dark meat peices everyone else gives...and made to order any way you like hot to mild or inbetween!  The help and the owners make you feel like family or friends for years! So friendly. And having a huge family with 5 kids...it can become costly  but NOT HERE!  Everything in priced so reasonable!  Its amazing..ordered to go, order today and was just as much food and qualitywas just as great as if I was sitting in the restaurant!  No different still excellent, excellent quality, taste and service!  YOU HAVE TO TRY TO BELIEVE CHINESE COULD BE SO GOOD! Thanks Rice Bowl..We will deff be in once a week...if not more for that famous iced tea ...move over SNAPPLE!  The hot summer is comming so you better make some extra batches just for me! lol  Everything is superb! tony...think about making a face book page so I can promote your restaurant! Let me know if you make one please. Robyn
