love the couscous dish and trout salad, the thing that i am bothered by in this place is being kicked out from the place as soon as you put your fork down and do not ask for a desert but get the vibe presented with check 'now get out'.., and i am not the type of person sitting in a cafe for hours, yet i do like to sit and have a little chat after i finish my meal, stuff varies from very friendly to playing cool/unfriendly, all over i am a fan but must ignore the two annoyances mentioned here
