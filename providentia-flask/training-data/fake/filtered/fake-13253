There are a thousand and one Rays, but from the history you read in this restaurant, you'll see that there's a connection to one of the original Rays (if not the original) who got this whole Ray thing started. The pizza is classic New York pizza. Nothing fancy, just a decent slice with gobs of cheese and a crispy crust. May it lacks the psychologial boost of using New York City tap water, but I'll say that Montclair water works just as well. This is by far the best pizza outside of the City.
