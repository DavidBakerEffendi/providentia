I saw this place from the street and it looked busy, so we decided to drop in for a drink. We enjoyed the drinks, bartenders and music so much, we booked a table for the following night and invited our friends to join us. We sat in a big booth which was great for conversation. The food was excellent and the service was superior. We all enjoyed the way we were allowed to eat and converse without feeling rushed. We ended with dessert at the bar (the rum babba was excellent). I'll keep this place on my list to frequent.
