Awesome place and very reliable. You know you can go for brunch, lunch, or dinner and get good food. Service is great; your glass of water will likely be refilled before you even finish it. The bloody mary's here are excellent. I only wish they didn't go to all cash. They used to take just AMX which was good, but then they dropped cards all together.
