I'm so discouraged to see so many 4 and 5-Star reviews.  I tend to distrust the one negative review in a batch of 20 positive ones and just chalk it up to an isolated bad experience, but I've given Jacob's Pickles several opportunities to redeem itself and it's only gone from bad to worse.  To be fair, the food is actually good--the burger, the mac and cheese, the shrimp and grits--all good.  The problem is that the food isn't nearly good enough to redeem the insulting and useless service.  I was going to write this long tirade about the terrible service we got on Saturday night from everyone from the hostess to the waitstaff to the manager, but that's really all you need to know.  We walked out and I have no intention of going back, in spite of the fact that we live two blocks away.  Sorry, Jacob's Pickles.  Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice...
