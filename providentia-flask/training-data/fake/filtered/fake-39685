Been away from hometown after years and surviving in New York City after graduated from university, coincidentally i reside myself in Elmhurst after got to NYC and found this barely noticeable Malaysian Cuisine restaurant. Its totally a hole-in-the-wall restaurant if compared to major restaurants in NYC area; however if you have Malaysian bloods running in you, you definitely know this is a place to pay a visit. With approximately 30inches(?) length of entrance door, while most people would missed it and got into the next restaurant entrance, with the authentic Malaysian restaurant environment, and with rough interior that has almost no aesthetic but serving you the best food in the neighborhood. They have earned a loyal customer after my first visit.. Roti Canai is always a must for appetizer whenever I'm there; with the taste of butter in the pan fried roti, dipping wit the curry provided makes it complete. Satay is another recommendation; where the meats area marinated and grilled, coming along with the special peanut sweet source that perfectly matches each either. Personal favorite would be the Belacen Fried Rice, it isnt the best dish for everyone but definitely for me. Topping with marinated sour mango accompanies with vegetables and shrimps, meantime enhance the uniqueness of the belacan rice. The Â curry noodle taste awesome too, imagine while the richness of the coconut milk spread over every taste butts on your tongue. It is not that spicy as it is suppose to be as a curry, but knowing the locals in New York don't enjoy much of the spiciness, assimilation is necessary and perhaps can be tolerate. Jus be concerned that the restaurant only take cash and there are several bank around that area, so it makes it convenient too.
