I've been to Race Street on multiple occasions and never once had an issue with the service, food or drinks.  Every time I go I always find something new on the menu that I love!  When available I would recommend the Shepards Pie.  The best in Olde City!!! As for the previous reviews regarding service, I find this hard to believe.  Unlike other restaurants I've been too in the city, the servers at Race Street have always been attentive to us.
