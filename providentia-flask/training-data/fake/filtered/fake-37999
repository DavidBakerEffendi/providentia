We went to this place for drinks and light appetizers/meal in the early evening but were disappointed. The food was so so. We ordered fries, meatballs in southern tomato sauce and catfish tacos. They were also out of 2 of their beers on the menu which was disappointing. However the service was friendly and prompt.
