I've been coming here with friends and spouse since it opened because we love good Thai food! This is probably the best Thai food I've ever eaten here in the US and I've been all around the country. In all fairness on that last statement, there are many other good Thai restaurants around the country, but Blue Elephant Trail (and it's sister restaurant in Avon, CT) are definitely among the top 5. Everyone I've recommended Blue Elephant Trail to who have gone have had a very good experience with the food there as well as the hospitality. The funny thing is that the location use to be the home of another "Thai" style restaurant, but I never enjoyed their food the few times I went there so when it closed I wasn't surprised. My Thai friends all said the same thing to me about the older restaurant but as for the Blue Elephant Trail, they've all enjoy it. One of them even told me that it reminded them of the cooking (for the traditional dishes) their mom use to make. The other special dishes served at the Blue Elephant Trail are truly unique dishes with a Thai style that shows the character and the quality of the chef. All this, plus the prices are incredibly reasonable (average dish range between $12 and $22). Most of the other restaurants in the Blue Back Square/West Hartford Center area of the same caliber of ambiance and quality are not as economical in price per dish by comparison. I highly recommend the Blue Elephant Trail. It is no wonder that they won this year's "Best Thai Food Restaurant" in the Hartford region this year!
