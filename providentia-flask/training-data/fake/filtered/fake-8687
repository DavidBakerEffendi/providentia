MODO MIO is garbage. My friends and I (part of 9!) made reservations months in advance for our annual holiday party. The reservations were set fo 9pm and we called the day before to confirm. We all live in the suburbs and made the trek to that particular neighborhood specifically to dineat Modo MIo. We arrived at the restaurant and 8:45. There was no room to wait and we had to stand in the unheated vestibule. The hostest offered to open our wine while we stood outside, honestly who does that? at 1040 I approached the hostest and the table still was not ready!!!! The hostess had no explination or plan of action to get us seated. She did not try and accomidate us at all. What was the point of taking out reservations if they had no intention of honoring them? I dont care how good the food is proported to be, I would never recommend Modo MIo. In fact I would tell anyone I knew to skip it!
