is up to 4 stars, if you enjoy this type of cuisine. Good price, too. Service is good EXCEPT for one CRAZY short waitress who appears to be a relative of the owner. You cannot order without her badgering you to order more. And she will keep at it for 5 minutes. One time, I got up to leave and she said "OK OK, you sit".  Another time, she got into a long shouting match with cook.  Difficult to know how many people she turned off to coming here. One star removed for her.
