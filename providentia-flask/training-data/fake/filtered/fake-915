So I came back to blues, exactly a week later (they're only open fri & sat) and had a completely different experience.  The pizza ill tasting and really not edible.  Completely different from my first experience.  I must agree with the commenter below that being open 2 days a week the ingredients must not be staying fresh.  I guess what I came in a week later they were on their way out!  I won't be coming back until they're open full time
