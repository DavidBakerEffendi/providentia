Warm and cosy spot in Hell's Kitchen. My first experience here was okay. I had the pumpkin soup which was lovely and fresh. My friend didn't really like The Marshal that much though and I agree that it doesn't really have the 'wow' factor, especially with the price tag. On my second visit I opted for an entree, unfortunately it just lacked in taste. No seasoning. It was the same for my friends food. As the place is only young, I'm hoping they will read these reviews and improve some small things. The staff need to start refilling empty glasses. They need to refrigerate the bottled soda (even if it is going to be served with ice it is just more fresh for the customer). A very small cup of coffee cost $5 - that genuinely shocked me. The place only seats 24 people but I felt the staff acted and waited in a manner that felt busy and rushed. My experience didn't feel as relaxed as the place looks. It's definitely worth a visit because it seems (so far) you'll either love or hate this place. I reckon in a few years, when in the swing of things and some changes, this place will hopefully be on point.
