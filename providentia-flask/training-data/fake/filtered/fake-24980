Wow. Something has happened to the dumplings here and it's not good. I stopped in yesterday for a quick fix while cruising C-town. I have been to Vanessa's many times and to its decidedly grittier Dumpling House predecessor. The dumplings (pork and chive, fried/seared) I got yesterday barely resembled what I had come to expect from this spot. My first impression upon gleefully opening the styrofoam goodie box was that the dumplings appeared to have gotten bigger - almost 150% of the size that I was used to. Unfortunately, more did not turn out to be better - the increase in size was due entirely to the increased volume and thickness of the wrapper, which instead of swaddling the pork ball, created a dumpling cavern filled with as much air as pork. The wrapper itself was also much thicker, and seemed to have soaked up all of the oil in the restaurant. Consequently, the dumplings tasted like oily, mushy dough with a hint of pork - basically the same thing as the dumplings in a suburban mall's food court (although certainly cheaper). The meal left me feeling kind of bloated and gross, like the wrappers were continuing to expand in my belly. I don't have it in me to hate on this place, and I hope the experience yesterday was an anomaly. Their other menu offerings are insanely tasty and great value for the dollar. But for devotees of the fried dumpling, beware - change appears to be afoot at Vanessa's, and it's not for the better.
