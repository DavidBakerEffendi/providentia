Govinda's is a good place to go if you are into the hipster vegan scene.  The food tastes average, but is well priced for vegan cuisine.  What I'm not too fond of is the wait times, I know things are prepared to order but a number of times we will be sitting across from the kitchen and they won't even call out the order name and will be sitting there, leaving hipsters and the business crowd alike staring into your food.  Overall a great vegan option for Philly just keep an eye on your food!
