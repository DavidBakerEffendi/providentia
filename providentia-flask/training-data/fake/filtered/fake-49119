Can you say FABULOUS! Â LOVED EVERYTHING about this place! From the food, to the ambiance and even the doggie bag of cookies they sent us home with. Wow!! We began our meal with the house bread and the tomato butter, followed by calamari (I persoanlly loved the peppers that came with the calamari)..I followed the app with the Chicken gnocchi in pestle sauce and it was delicious . My husband loved the Clams Fettucini and felt the clams were perfectly prepared! We ended dinner with the Lava Cake and it was the prefect ending to our meal. If I am ever back in Hartford I will visit Salute again. My goal is to find a restaurant of equal caliber in Atlanta.
