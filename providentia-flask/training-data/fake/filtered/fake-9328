It's unbelievable that in such a metropolis there's only a handful of Filipino restaurants but luckily at least one, Grill 21, is a great choice for food that is masarap!   My husband and I went twice today - first for brunch and then for dinner.  For brunch, we both ordered Longsilog - the sausage was sweet, eggs cooked over-easy to perfection and garlic fried rice was nicely seasoned for breakfast.  Tonight we ordered Lumpiang Shanghai, Pancit Bihon, and Chicken Adobo.  All entrees were  delicious and fresh, not oily.  The Chicken Adobo was really tender with a balance of traditional flavors - reminded me of how my Lola makes it.   I appeased my sweet tooth with Halo Halo (ube ice-cream on top) AND Leche Flan.  Both desserts (even though Halo Halo is traditionally a refreshing "beverage") were outstanding - I brought an entire Leche Flan home - I've eaten half of it before I've finished this review.  I'm allergic to dairy but both desserts were worth the consequences - and I normally avoid dairy like the plague.   I don't live in New York anymore but I'll be sure to visit this restaurant whenever I'm in town.  Thanks for 2 great meals!
