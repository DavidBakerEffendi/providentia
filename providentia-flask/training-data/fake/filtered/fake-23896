This place totally lived up to the hype I had heard from friends. The food was good, the beer selection excellent and the staff was very pleasant and friendly. Pierogie week was a blast. We paired several plates of pierogies with the various PBC brews they had on tap and it was outstanding. Even the dessert peirogies (yes dessert - cheery cheesecake peirogies!) were damn good. Their selection of brews was impressive - not overwhelming but certainly much better than average. They have the standard domestics (Rolling Rock, Pabst, Yuengling, Miller), a wide variety of craft bottles including many local breweries (Troegs, Victory, Dogfish Head) and a bevy of imports from Guinness to Franziskaner. This is not a big place but it is cozy and friendly. And the childhood toys all over the bar back certainly liven up the place. I would highly recommend it.
