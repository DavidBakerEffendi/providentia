Jeez a loo! Fried pickles have never been done better.  Tangy inside, perfectly breaded and fried, dry crisp.  So incredibly flavorful.  You wanted to eat them like fries.  While the tables had a half hour wait the bar and back counter were a faster choice and seats opened up relatively quickly.  The BBQ Pork Sammy is to die for.  Masses of perfectly sauced and tangingly moist meat atop a seeded white bun with a dollop of Cole slaw could require a knife and fork to consume. It weighed a ton.  The aforementioned pickles were the side.  I began with the deviled eggs, three plump, perfect orbs mounded with mustard and horseradish hinted filling.  Perfect amuse bouche before the Brontosaurus BBQ arrived. All servers were pleasant, efficient and attentive.  Worth the trip even if you aren't getting the famous burger.
