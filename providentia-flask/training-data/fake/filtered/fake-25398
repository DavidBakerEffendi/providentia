Lemon chicken over basmati rice with salad. It's unbelievably amazing for only $6.00. I'm thinking of putting a boot on one of the truck's wheels. That way Old Slip and Water will be its permanent home and I can have it for lunch everyday! I chose to go to Comme Ci Comme Ca after reading its awesome Yelp reviews and proceeded to learn more about it on chefsamirtruck.com. Chef Samir has a compelling and relatable story that makes his food even more enjoyable. Also, it has such great value. The price is pretty low for large portions of wonderful homemade food. The extra ingredients that come accompany the basmati rice show just how much care and thought went into the dish. When you eat this food you know it wasn't just tossed together and mass produced. Any platter over the rice and salad comes with white sauce on top, so remember to specify if you want it on the side. Though I definitely recommend however which way Chef Samir prepares it for you.
