Hey this is my first time at this place and I used to work at a bar and I know what a double taste like but I didn't get what I ask for so the bartender real cheap when it come to drinks an apparently he dosnt like black people because he didn't want to server my friend but goes to show you the true character of this place me and my friend are both veteran but we go unappreciated so I don't recommend this place
