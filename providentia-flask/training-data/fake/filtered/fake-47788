Noise Level: HIGH Over the months since it opened, this formerly quiet place has become a noise riot. The music level is so high, you'd think you were in a disco. And th music choice? There's nothing consistent except inconsistency. Today there was even RAP! Unbelievable for a place where one might want to think or read or chat. This will no longer be a favorite unless the music is toned down and better music is chosen.
