I bought a Caprese style panini (basil, mozzarella, tomato, and pesto[?]) and an Italian cookie platter.  The staff was friendly, the sandwich hit the spot, and my co-workers polished off the cookies by the end of the day.   Also, they carry a small array of food products from Italy:  pasta, spices, cookies, etc. Warning:  Do not order the panini if it's busy or you're time constricted, because the toasting requires a longer prep. time.
