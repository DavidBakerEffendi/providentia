Full disclosure: am giving this place one star for the execrable, "I GOTS A BIG ASS CHIP ON MY SHOULDER" host. That alone could explain why I thought the food was mediocre at best. We had dinner and the host left a bad taste in my mouth not one minute into the place. Upon walking in for the first time, I remarked to my boyfriend how cute the place was. Interesting. Odd spacing and great use of a pre-existing, old school building. Flattering lighting. Lots of candles. About ten feet in, I was jostled by a group of people exiting. I was pushed into the squat, swarthy, vest-wearing host. "An excuse me would have been nice," he shot loudly over his shoulder as he sailed to the front door where, presumably, he finds a small degree of self-esteem and power in Â an understandably tough, tough town. Look, pal. I'm sorry you hate your job. I'm sorry your music/art/film/writing career hasn't worked out the way you dreamed it would, back in Des Moines. That's not my problem. Believe me, I'm in the same boat you are. Which is why my boyfriend took me to your restaurant for my birthday dinner. Thanks for ruining that, by the way. Thanks for not apologizing. I used to have your job, buddy. Never, in a million years, would I have even considered saying something like that to a patron. Additionally, thanks for making a point to eventually sit ten feet away from my seething boyfriend and proceed to smirk over. PS. I feel really badly for your co-workers. Our waitress and bartender were awesome. You are a miserable human being, Vest Man. Enjoy music/art/film/writing limbo.
