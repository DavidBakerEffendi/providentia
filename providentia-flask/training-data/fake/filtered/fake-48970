I was walking around my neighborhood (Brooklyn, Bay Ridge) and eventually stepped into my childhood, with the familiar smells of Moroccan home cooking and with a traditional Moroccan hospitality, I felt right at home. Great authentic Moroccan cuisine and nice ambiance, the owner Nasser is a genuine gentleman and very generous. I had a great back to time "ride". Thank you and good luck.
