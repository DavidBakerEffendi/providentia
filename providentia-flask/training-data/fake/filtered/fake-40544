This is a regular lunch spot, my co-workers and I all love it. You can't go wrong with the Bash Burger, Tater Tots, Sweet Potato Fries or Fish or Shrimp Tacos! I have also enjoyed the potato soup special. The Salty Peanut Butter Sundae, was yummy but not amazing.... It made me feel guilty for the calories and usually I'm a sucker for anything chocolate and peanut butter. Â The spiked shake though, is brilliant! And if you ever there for brunch... the short rib hash is really delicious. The service is always attentive and I haven't yet had to wait long for a table.
