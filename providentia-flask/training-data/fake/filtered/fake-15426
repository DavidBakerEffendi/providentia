We were looking for a good seafood restaurant not far to travel.  We found it n the Blue Point Grill.  We started with the fried oysters and Lobster Bisque, the fried oysters were amazing but we would not do the Bisque again.  For dinner we both had a steamed Lobster that was cooked perfectly.  The food was great and we would surely eat there again.  However, it is a bit pricey so it would have to be a night that we had some extra cash. The parking also is a bit deceptive, you need to park by going down the driveway next to the Ivy inn.
