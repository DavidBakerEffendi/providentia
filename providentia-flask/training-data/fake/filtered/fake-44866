We were celebrating a birthday here last week. When I arrived with my friend we were the first to arrive (6:30). The bar was busy and we had nowhere to stand and the hostess told us we'd have to wait till our party had all arrived. We were going to be seated in the back which was completely empty..I asked the manager and he said no problem...ok, enough of this. The food was great and our appetizers arrived pretty quickly but we waited a long time for entrees. I think the waiter was either really high or drunk. He disappeared for stretches of time. One of our guests gave my husband a piece of cake for this day. When we asked if he could eat the cake - they wanted to charge us 3 dollars per person x 5 to eat the 5 dollars piece of cake...we had ordered cake before hand but our waiter forgot or didnt understand Overall, the food was really great, the restaurant is very pretty. Back room better for groups or larger parties. Front is nicer for dates. Service is pretty lame.
