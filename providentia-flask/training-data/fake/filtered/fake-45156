Today June 22, 2014 we had a Bridal shower for 25 ladies at Lo Monaco's.  We agreed on a  time table, a menu consisting of hot app's as well as an offering of a main course of three choices.   The food was excellent  beginning with the HOT  app's, the Penne a la Vodka ( amazing!) , our salads and then our main dinner selection.  ALL  served promptly,  and professionally   AND   our time table adhered to.   The service was excellent.   I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wanted to have a party or a meal.   ALL of our Guests were impressed!   When you host an event you WANT your Guests to feel that you care about them enough to serve the very best!  i believe that we did that!!!    Thank you Lo Monaco's, The Wait Staff, The Chef's and Maria !  Our Very Best!   Cheryl, the Bride's Aunt
