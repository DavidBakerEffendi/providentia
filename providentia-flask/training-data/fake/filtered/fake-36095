The food is delicious here! Not your standard greasy cheesy Italian joints. This place has excellent menu choices, sophisticated presentation of food, the flavors will tantalize your palate. The calazones are a must try. The grilled vegetables in a portobello mushroom sauce is exquisite -- the subtle flavors will seduce you guaranteed, esp. if you are a foodie like me. The service is friendly. This is a must do to experience Philli if you are a tourist. Glad we stopped by to satisfy our craving for Italian food.
