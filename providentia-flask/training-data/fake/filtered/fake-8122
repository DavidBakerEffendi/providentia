Last night my husband and I ate here for dinner. We ordered a favorite of ours, the "Soguk Meze" appetizer. As I was eating a bite of stuffed grape leaf I realized there was something I could not bite through in my mouth. I spit it out only to realize that it was a BAND AID! We brought it to the attention of the waitress. She only said "I'm sorry, it must have come off while he was making them." By law the chef should have been wearing gloves and maybe this would not have happened to me. My dining experience was disgusting and horrifying to say the least. Â We will never eat there again.
