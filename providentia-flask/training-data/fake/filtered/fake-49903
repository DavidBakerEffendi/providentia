went for dinner and comedy show w/ 2 other couples. Dinner was very good and our server, Virgina, was excellent and very personable. Moved downstairs for comedy show and encountered a problem w/ our reservation. Gentleman working the door was very professional and called a manager (Connor). He explained the mix up, took Â full responsibility, and was able to turn a negative into a positive. We look forward to returning to see the show. In the meantime 2 thumbs up for the food, beer, and staff !
