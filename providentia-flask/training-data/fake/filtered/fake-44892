I came here with my husband last week since our friend recommended this place. As a big fan of Italian food I was really exited. The menu is great, what i like the most is that they have so many risottos! I had the one with chicken and spinach and my husband had the one with sea food. Both were perfect, so creamy with lots of flavor. The portions are quite large so we took home what we could not finish. For dessert we enjoyed the vanilla panna cotta. It was so good and fresh, melting in my mouth. The space is nice and cozy, for some reason it makes you feel very comfortable, almost like home. The staff is friendly but not overwhelming. It was a long trip, we don't live in Brooklyn, but it was worth it.
