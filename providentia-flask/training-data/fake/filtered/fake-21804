Went here about Â a month ago.. The food is so tasty! We had a party of 8 and shared a lot of the appetizers. They had a home made pasta special that was the best dish I've ever had! Their artichokes and olives are out of this world too in the antipasti. I will definitely be back. Good drinks, good service. ;)
