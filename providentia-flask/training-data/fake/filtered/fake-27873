I'm so happy this lovely couple chose my neighborhood to build this gem of a restaurant. I love this place. The staff are friendly and provide excellent service. Everything I've had is superb and a good value. Try the lemon thyme chicken - simply delicious - I'm addicted!. The Steak Tacos and FISH TACOS are excellent, as well as, everything else I've had on the menu so far. The decor is tastefully eclectic with French movie posters, actors, and soccer teams well displayed. I'm so happy Bar Bruno is just two blocks away.
