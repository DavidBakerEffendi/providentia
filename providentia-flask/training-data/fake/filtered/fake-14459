Who ever says they don't enjoy this place for a great meal should stick to their normal places they frequent such as Burger King or Mc Donald's.  I have never heard so many unfair comments on one of the best places that I've ever ate at.  If your a hater just stay home and stop trying to make comments that you have no clue as to what your saying.  This place is second to none, I dare you to prove me wrong.
