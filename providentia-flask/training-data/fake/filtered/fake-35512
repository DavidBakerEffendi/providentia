Wait staff is nice and good for a diner, however food was gross, we found a bandaid one pancake. We discreetly set it aside, when we went to pay, the cashier we had a discount for 10 percent off, she said she could not apply because she did not know how. I found this annoying three people in line had coupons and she did not honor any of them... We paid for pancakes with bandaids uck... We will never ever return to the star diner under the current management.
