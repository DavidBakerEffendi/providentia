I've driven past this place many times, but never had the opportunity to stop until until a couple of weeks ago. Being in Newark, having a dedicated parking lot is a big deal. I spent some time finding parking, only to learn I was able to park in the lot across the street. As for the food, they offer a variety of burgers, sandwiches, and pastries. The burgers and sandwiches are top notch (I was able to try three different kinds, two p√£o de queijo sandwiches, and a burger), although their competitor on Adams St had better quality meat and everything tasted a little fresher. But the fact that they have dedicated parking and are open 24 hours make up for that. The food wasn't bad, it was good. Don't get me wrong. It wasn't the best, but I wouldn't want to drive business away from them. I was there once, maybe it was a fluke. I would definitely go back. Their pastries, however, weren't great. I bought some (pastel, coxinha c/ catupiry, etc) and brought them home. I ate them the next day, and they weren't great. I'm sure they're better if/when made/consumed fresh. I will give them another try, for sure.
