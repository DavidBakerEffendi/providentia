Yeah, I'm upgrading. I just had some fabulous Lamb Vindaloo. MMMM...spicy goodness. Still cheaper than almost any other Indian joint in Philly. Â I do not understand these "it's too spicy" reviews on Yelp, especially when these folks don't tell us what dish they ordered. Perhaps, that is, the food was supposed to be spicy. This is Indian food prepared for Americans, which tends to be spicy.
