For years, this was my favorite restaurant in town. Then after many visits where the service was terrible, the food took over an hour to arrive, and was inconsistent in terms of temperature and quality when it finally did, I stopped going. They have a great location and used to be a great restaurant. Maybe they'll get their act together some day, but until then there are many other, better options nearby.
