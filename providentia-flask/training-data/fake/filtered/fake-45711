I stopped into Garces to get a soup to go, for a little snack. The minestrone was about $7 for a cup, but there were about 2 spoonfuls of soup in it (and I waited about 10 minutes for it to come out of the kitchen). still, I thought, it could be worth the wait. Hardly. The pasta was hard and stuck together, the peas were undercooked, and there were a few beans in the soup but nothing else besides broth, which was not special at all. I could have enjoyed a better minestrone from a can! The soup was accompanied by a thin slice of focaccia, with pasil pesto and parmesan, and that was pretty good. But the soup was a disaster, and a rip off.
