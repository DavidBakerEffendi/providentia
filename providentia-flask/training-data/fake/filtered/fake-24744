I could easily have given Bianca 5 stars for the desserts alone, but I was under-impressed by their special that I got as an entree (white fish). But the desserts!!! We got tartufo (sort of an ice-cream, gelato would probably be more accurate) and tiramisu. They were amazing! Like heaven on earth. They should just quit serving other stuff and focus on desserts, because they are the best. My boyfriend had mackerel and he loved it (he claimed it melted in his mouth), but I still stand by the desserts. Appetizers were also very nice, as well as the wine. It was a tad loud for my taste and the tables there are absolutely tiny. We had to constantly move our plates around in an attempt to optimize the space available.
