Drinks: The margaritas are awesome! I would recommend the pink cadillac. They are, however, pretty pricey at just over $30 for a pitcher. Food: Go for the shared beef, chicken, and shrimp fajitas. The open-faced shrimp quesadilla is also not to be missed. Service: Hostesses are not very helpful and are borderline unaccommodating. Unfortunately this is a make or break for me.
