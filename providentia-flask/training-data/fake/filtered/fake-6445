My family had a birthday party for my grandmother at The Appian Way.  All was fine during the planning process until 3 days before the event, when all of a sudden they wanted to charge us for all of these services - per person soft drink charge, maitre d fee, cake cutting fee -  that were not mentioned in the contract, although we had already explained several times exactly what we needed for the event.  By that time, right before the party, we couldn't switch venues. When we questioned the charges, the manager became extremely belligerent and rude with us.  The service during the dinner was pretty good, but the food was mediocre. It was served family style, which was not mentioned at any point during the process, and was not ideal for our elderly guests.  If you must have an event here, make sure to get an itemized contract.  But really, you should find somewhere else.
