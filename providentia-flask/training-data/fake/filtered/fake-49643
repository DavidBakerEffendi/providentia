This review is long overdue.  Went to this lovely place a fee months ago for our 10th anniversary and had an absolutely delicious meal.  We had the meat feast, which was a delightful combination of flavors presented in multiple courses.  Fancy and inventive in presentation, but without the pretention of fancier, more expensive places that you encounter in NY.  The atmosphere is casual and intimate, and the service perfect.  Would definitely go back for the great food or even just for a glass of wine.  Five stars all around!
