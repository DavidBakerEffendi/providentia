karma is by far the best indian in the city - for the food, service, cleanliness, and atmosphere...the buffet is one of the best i've had anywhere in the country - attractive, plentiful, fresh - and what other indian restaurant puts 'lobster curry' in their buffet?....although it is the more pricy of indian joints in town, you get what you pay for and always leave feeling you've nourished your soul....
