As Yardley Borough residents, my husband and I have been going to the Continental Tavern regularly since they've been under new owners.  We go in almost every Thursday and Friday night to have a few drinks, meet up with friends, and often sit at the bar and have dinner or a few appetizers.  We always enjoy our time at the Tavern; however, what enhances our experience (and is a huge reason for our frequent visits) is the face of the Continental, Sean.  Sean is a huge reason my husband and I decide to go in and grab a few drinks at the Tavern.  However, recently it has come to our attention that Sean will no longer be working behind the bar and that deeply saddens us.  Just as any great bar needs great drinks, food, and atmosphere, what sets off all of those things is a great bartender.  My husband and I feel that Sean is great bartender for his quick service, his generally friendly demeanor, and most importantly his willingness to laugh and joke around and make small talk with everyone in the bar.  The atmosphere is greatly enhanced due to Sean's presence and  without him behind the bar we will now be considering other options when going out for a few drinks.
