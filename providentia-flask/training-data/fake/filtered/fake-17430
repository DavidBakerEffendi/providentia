Spent a very fun, sunny Sunday afternoon in the comfy rooftop bar. Enjoyed the creative cocktail menu along with perfectly salted chickpea fries, deliciously savory ratatouille and goat cheese spread, and two types of fresh oysters. Great service, great food, and great views --- a memorable experience!
