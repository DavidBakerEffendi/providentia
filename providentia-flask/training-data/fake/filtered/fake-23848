Visited Sazon for the first time on a whim last night.  The husband and wife team running the place were awesome.  I sat at the bar and they were both attentive and even held conversations at length with me which was nice considering the amount of people they had in the seating area and others at the counter.  I ordered the appetizer sampler and a mixed salad - both were freshly made and had an attractive presentation.  I also sampled their drinking chocolate (I chose the Orgasmo) and their solid chocolate (I tried the Ooey Gooey).  Greatness.  Generous portions and friendly atmosphere.  I have traveled quite a bit and found the food to be very consistent with what I expect from an authentic Hispanic eatery.  Cash only & BYOB.  I will definitely be back with others!
