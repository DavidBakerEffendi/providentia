This place has delicious Thai food for soooooooo cheap. Love, love, love the spicy noodles with shrimp. Also, they have amazing tiger shrimp rolls and summer rolls. A must try if you are into Thai. Cool vibe on the weekends. Bar tends to get packed in the front while people wait to be seated. They have cool music and the decor is very trendy. Staff is quick and so is the kitchen.
