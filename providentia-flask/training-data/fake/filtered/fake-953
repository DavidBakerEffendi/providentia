There is just not enough room in here to be comfortable. Getting a table or a seat at the bar is tough.  Make a reservation if you plan on eating here; becaise it always crowded and people stay for a while after eating. The food is descent but not worth how long it takes to be brought out.  The pizza is good and as a bar its good; but it needs to be a bigger space and the food needs to come out faster to get a better review. The staff is very nice .
