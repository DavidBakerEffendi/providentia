In Jersey for my niece's wedding after moving to Maryland eleven years ago. During the three hour break between the ceremony and reception, we brought a pepperoni and a plain pie back to the hotel. The front desk had touted Famous Ray's as the best in the area. Having grown up in NJ, and sampled pizza all over the NY Metro area, I was hoping Ray's would make me remember why no other part of the USA should be allowed to sell it. Maryland offers mostly pre-made, perforated crusts, and cooks the pies in conveyor belt type "ovens." The sauce is inconsistent as to seasonings, thickness and taste, but is universally disapointing. The cheese is generally bland, as are the meats. Famous Ray's didn't let me down. Though not super thin, the crust was firm and crispy. The sauce and cheese brought back the nostalgia of Tito's in Clark, NJ, after High School basketball games (thankfully, without burning the roof of my mouth), and Cuitar's in Bloomfield after softball games. The pepperoni had that little kick that makes the beer so much more satisfying. The counter guys were a fun bunch, even offering an opportunity to pay them for my pies at a later date. Very generous. And at only 17% daily interest! This is my lone experience with Famous Ray's in Verona, so I cannot comment on their consistency, or rate the single slice quality. I would have given another 1/2 star if it were allowed. Also, the menu is robust, with other Italian dishes. Just one reminder, Ray: anchovies are NOT a cheese.
