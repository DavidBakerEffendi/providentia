I am very excited about this restaurant!  I can not believe how lucky I am to live close enough to make this my go-to joint.   My experience there felt like I had gone a one night vacation.  It began with a surprise when we walked in, because it is very low-key from the outside. The interior is rustic, with a beautiful oven and a feel good atmosphere!!  We were greeted by a lovely host, who made the 45 minute wait sound like a treat, suggesting we hang out at the bar while we waited ( ... um, try the pear cocktail ... very yummy and potent).   My husband had the best wine from Sardinia (bartender suggested it, and kudos to him for not suggesting the most expensive one!) We were seated in the upper level, which gave us a nice view of the restaurant.  Our waiter was a delight, and the food was so worth the wait. I ordered the arugula salad and the husband ordered a bibb salad.  Both were fresh, delicious and were better than salads I have had in much more expensive places.  I loved the clam pizza like crazy and my husband ordered the eggplant zucchini, which was also incredible ... the spice gave it a special zing. The flavors were amazing and the crust could not have been better ... I really am a fan of the charring on the outside with the softer inside part of the pie.  Such an authentic neapolitan pizza -- better than I had as an art in Italy! I am trying to watch my weight (and that doesn't mean watch it go up!!), but I had the gelato for dessert which, when they brought 3 scoops, I was sure I could never finish.  I was wrong, because the chocolate, was crazy good, the espresso strong and great, and the strawberry was so delish ... Thank you Barboncino for the best meal of the year!
