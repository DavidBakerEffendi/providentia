I had the same experience this past Saturday night when we happened in at about six.  The hostess told us the wait was an hour and a half.  As we said "no thanks" and turned to leave she yelled out "Just so you know if you want to come back on a Friday or Saturday night you need a reservation" .  Very loud and very rude.
