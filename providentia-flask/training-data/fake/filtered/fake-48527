This was by far the absolute best cheesesteak I have ever eaten. The steak was sliced extremely thin so once cooked, it had a light feel. And once you add some melted cheese, the sandwich tasted like heaven in cheesesteak form. The only thing to worry about is seating; there is limited seating so be aware that if it is crowded, there might be no seat for you. But you can always eat on-the-go or standing, so you should definitely go.
