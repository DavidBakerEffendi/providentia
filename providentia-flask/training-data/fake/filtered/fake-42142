I have eaten over 100 NYC burgers over the last 3 years and I had heard good things about Royale's burger. I figured their Pulp Fiction-referencing Royale with Cheese (american) would be the way to go. The bar itself is a perfect neighborhood retreat; the bartender was friendly and the service was excellent. The burger was cooked to temperature (medium rare) and it was definitely juicy but overall the meat was completely underseasoned and lacked any sort of beef flavor. I never add ketchup to my burgers because it masks the meat's flavor but this burger desperately needed something to help it out. The fries were plentiful but also underseasoned. The food is fairly priced but lacks flavor. Do not come here for the burger, you will be disappointed. If you need a good burger in the area you can try Back Forty or Black Iron Burger. But do come here if you want to drink in a relaxing, warm bar.
