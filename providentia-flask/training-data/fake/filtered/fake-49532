As a local to VT, this is my absolutely favorite place to eat when I am craving spices, flavor, and a meaningful cultural experience, and I ALWAYS bring guests here who are visiting out of town. The Samosa Chaat is the best thing in Burlington right now!!! p.s. In my opinion, you always need to try a new spot out a few times to experience their growth and fine-tuning. If you tried out Sherpa in their early days, and were disappointed, definitely try them again. I'm a pretty critical foodie, and they have REALLY found their sweet spot!
