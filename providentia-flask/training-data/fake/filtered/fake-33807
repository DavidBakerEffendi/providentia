I walked in unimpressed with the industrial-style decor and the open food station where you can watch the chef prepare your "flatbreads." This is gimmicky, I recall thinking, let's call this stuff what it is...pizza. However, American Flatbread was more than ready to exceed any expectations. My negativity began eroding when the server fielded our questions after our examination of the menu. She was perfectly informative and far from overbearing. The bartender's expertise was apparent as he put forth his favorite beverage/food pairings. But it was the flatbreads (most decidedly NOT just some pizzas) that forced me to tuck tail and find solace in humility's open arms. The pepperoni and peppers flatbread was delicious, but my favorite was the Mopsy's Kalua Pork. The menu description might read like chaos, but it was one of the most delicious dishes I've ever tasted. One word: BALANCED. Two large flatbreads filled the six of us. The only surprise left was the bill. Brace yourself New York, it is somehow possible to go out in TriBeCa to eat, drink and be merry at a fantastic restaurant...and keep it under $50/person. American Flatbread...do it.
