Obviously Diamond's does not read their reviews, because ours is not very different from the others.  My wife is a Trenton girl and this is nothing like the Diamond's in Trenton.  We tried it three times and found the service lacking in so many ways.  Basically, we want to go to a place where they actually care about their clientelle.  Food was adequate but overpriced, and it went downhill from there.  Out of three visits only the first one was good which was why we gave it three tries.
