This place is obviously from the future. Examples: - excellent, fresh food - clean bathrooms (with inexplicable canister of hair spray) - fast service - user friendly menu with helpful workers who are all about letting you know what's good and what you might like - relatively cheap (though the surroundings accord with this [i.e. it's located being Abner's and a strip club])
