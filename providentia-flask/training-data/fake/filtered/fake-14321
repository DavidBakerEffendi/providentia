I had been meaning to stop and finally did.  I requested potato balls which she made fresh.  This is the first time I have ever seen someone actually make these tasty treats.  I ordered six and they were created to perfection.  Of course, I ordered rice and beans with pork chops.  I believe I was Spanish in a different life.  This is a new stop on my list for Wethersfield.  WhooHoooooooooooooo
