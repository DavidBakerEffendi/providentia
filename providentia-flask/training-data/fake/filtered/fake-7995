My family and I have been patrons of this restaurant since the beginning.  Some things have started to annoy us, however.  First of all, chefs do make mistakes at times, but at this restaurant, the kitchen staff does not take responsibility for their errors.  Over the years we have sent items back only 4 or 5 times.  However, the chefs never make the dish right.  When ordering a pork chop without the sauce, it came to the table in a one-inch thick layer of heavy balsamic glaze.  When the salmon and sole meals were requested with "no butter or sauce," the dishes were delivered covered in butter sauce.  When the dishes were sent back, the chef simply poured off the sauce and sent it back.  Another annoying habit is when the owner curses and screams at the staff in full view of the patrons--so unprofessional.
