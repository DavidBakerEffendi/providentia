Delicious! Had a marvelous and generous sized appetizer of mussels and clams. The roasted butternut squash and asparagus sides were wonderful, as well. The waitress was terrific at handling our large party efficiently and graciously. And the kitchen staff was very accommodating of my dietary restrictions. I'll be back!
