Every single time I have gone to Pierre's something has gone wrong. I went for a bridal show to see if I wanted to book my wedding there. The food made my husband and I literally sick! The atmosphere was old, outdated, and smelled funny. Also, I was promised a raffle gift from Pierre's and after many attempts to contact them...still have not received it...it's been two years now! Now today I decided to give them another chance. Their bakery has always been pretty good so I decided to order my birthday cupcakes from there. My specific instruction was pink, girls, and pretty. What I received was hot stripper pink, messy, and careless. The cupcakes were so ugly I went to Stop and Shop to get nicer ones. The Stop and Shop ones were better tasting, much more beautifully decorated, and cheaper! I was quoted $12 on the phone with Pierre's Â for a dozen cup cakes. When I got there I owed 3 more dollars because they tinted te buttercreme to a hot stripper pink...are you serious! 25 cents extra per cupcake for food coloring ! In closing, the workers are incompetent and careless, the food is sub par, this place is not worth the prices that they charge!
