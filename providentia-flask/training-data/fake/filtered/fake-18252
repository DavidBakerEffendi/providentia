We just moved here from Brooklyn, and were so glad to discover this place. The first time we went it reminded my husband and me of the kinds of places we loved there. We went for drinks when it first opened and have been back several times for dinner since. Every time we go, we love it more. The drinks at the bar are creative and generous. The atmosphere is great -- perfect lighting and clearly a lot of attention went into designing the space around its history. That's another thing about this place that reminded us of Brooklyn, and I think it's part of why the restaurant has so much character. And the food...it's just the best we've had since we moved here - by far. Quality ingredients. You can tell. The only bad is the wait. It's often crowded. We're going to start making a reservation but at least this is one of the few places in town where there's a bar with proper cocktails!
