The staff here I found quite helpful in terms of helping navigate the restless sea of Italian cuisine. Keep in mind, this is America, and nothing here is a true representation of the actual fare one might find among the lifetime denizens of a quaint Sardinian estate. Notwithstanding, the uninitiated gourmand should find shopping here a joyous and easy task with the well-meaning staff leading you through the spicy and satisfying variety's of italian wine, cheese, and coffee. Beware, you will spend more than you intend, so this place is not for the faint of wallet. But a fulfilling experience nonetheless.
