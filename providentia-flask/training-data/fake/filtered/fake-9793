I'm a huge fan of diners! I eat at them all the time. But this one was by far my least favorite! It's lovely inside. Very pretty and very clean but the food was more important to me. I had a lunch special of a soup and gyro Greek salad. The soup was great (french onion), the gyro meat wasn't terrible but with tzatziki sauce it was edible, and then the Greek salad was TERRIBLE! It was oily and there was really no dressing. It was just a bunch of lettuce on a plate with like 4 pieces of topping. The waitress offered more dressing but when she brought it out it was just a cup of oil. I had to send it back. I couldn't deal with it. The people here seem nice especially since I'm so difficult. But I'm super serious about my salads. If the dressing isn't right you've lost my business.
