My experience at Kanella's was wonderful. The food was amazing and worth the 20 minute wait for a table. I would recommend the lamb sandwich,cyprus breakfast, and baklava.I am not a big fan of fish however the smoked fish my boyfriend ordered as a side was delicious and has really changed my opinion on fish. I can not wait to eat there again!
