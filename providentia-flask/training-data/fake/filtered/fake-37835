We originally had read an excellent review of Blu in NJ Monthly.  We went a few times and enjoyed our meals.  We decided to return last night for a belated Valentines dinner.  What a disappointment!  The noise level was deafening.  We could barely have a conversation.  Food quality had diminished.  My trout appetizer was bland with no hint of the horseradish mentioned on the menu, but the piece of trout was actually larger than the piece of red snapper in my entrée which was more than double the cost of the appetizer.  Again the fish was bland with no accompanying starch or vegetable except for some slices of endive on top. Dessert was not great with what seemed like some chocolate mousse and peanut butter interspaced with crackers. We will not return.  Paying over $120 for an experience that was more like a noisy bar was definitely not worth it.
