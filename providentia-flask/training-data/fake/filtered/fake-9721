Definitely love the food here, and definitely the best in the area! Last time I went it was full (no surprise here), the only fault is the parking lot. There are about 10 stores in that area with a small parking lot, other than that, but the food definitely makes up for taking 10 minutes to find a parking spot. Quick and friendly service.
