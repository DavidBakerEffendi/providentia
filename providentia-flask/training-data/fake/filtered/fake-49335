On my way home to Boston after a morning photoshoot in Waterbury a couple of months ago, I was ravaged with hunger, and I needed to eat before road rage kicked in.  To my luck, I found this place.  It was a comfy little nook, and they had a large buffet with many, many options.  The cuisine was excellent, and I will definitely be back!
