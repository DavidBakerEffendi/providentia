Excellent restaurant... and the service was SUPERB!!!! Went there with two 4 year olds and two 1 year old and the hostess and waiter were very helpful at all times! The food was excellent but made it even better with the service... did not see too many tourists but I guess because it was a weekday... Thanks Tony's Di Napoli for your service. Byron Mahwah,NJ
