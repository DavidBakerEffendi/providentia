needs to be updated, most of the seats are ripped, and have tape on them.  wife and daughter went to bathroom, and never got to go. besides ladies room being filthy, the smoke smell from the workers taking cigarette breaks in there is awful.  the food, we never finished and the waitress didnt seem to care and was in a terrible mood. she cared to look at me when i left a quarter tip. this is a once and done place for me.............
