Jane G's does awesome Szechuan food. My favorite Szechuan restaurant in Philly is Four Rivers. Han Dynasty was a very distant second-for all the hype, the food never compared to Four Rivers (it is prettier though). Jane G's easily beats Han Dynasty hands down. I can't speak for their non-Szechuan dishes, but all of the Szechuan ones I have tried - cumin style beef, dried pepper style chicken, spicy Parsley beef- were delicious, wonderfully spicy, and nearly as good as Four Rivers. Seriously, get the dried pepper chicken, it's like wonderfully tongue--tingling spicy popcorn chicken. I drool just thinking about it. And for those who want a fancier setting than a Chinatown restaurant, I think it is more pleasant and comfortable then Han Dynasty. The portions are very generous and the service has always been very gracious- fast and pleasant. Our first visit there, the waitress dropped our plates with the leftovers. While that was a small loss to us (stuff happens and they were only left overs), she gave us our desert (yummy fried bananas) for free. I have since gotten the takeout and it is every bit as good.
