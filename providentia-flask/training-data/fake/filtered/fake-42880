Man o man......i came in for the first time after renovations the other night expecting somewhat of the same vibe from the former " life cafe" but sadly good things never last. The vibe was uptight, the employees seemed miserable, and i felt like i was sharing a table with 4 other people. My girlfriend ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich, her favorite item on the old menu, and was so disappointed with the "newly renovated version," which sadly can be said about everything in this restaurant. We made a vow to never waste our money here again and to let all our friends in the neighborhood how horrific our experience was.
