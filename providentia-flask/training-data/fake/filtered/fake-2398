Prince Street Pizza does it right. Fantastic slice. These guys aren't joking around, I walk in and the guys behind the counter are talking pepperoni & mozzarella with their local guy, not some generic out of the box stuff, but fresh, local ingredients. Â Now thats how you make good pizza. NYC is know for it's pizza and this place has perfected it. Hats of to you guys.
