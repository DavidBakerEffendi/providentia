Johny's is an awesome place.  I think enough has been said here about the food, but just to reiterate it's a diner and has pretty standard diner food.  It's very tasty, if not very healthy, and is very cheap.  I usually get two eggs, bacon, toast and a coffee and it comes in at under six bucks.   In my opinion, what makes Johny's truly spectacular is Johny himself.  He's the one that runs the register, answers the phone, cooks the food, fist bumps everyone on the way out, and has a heart tattoo with the name Melissa on it.  Over the course of the first breakfast I ate at Johny's I must have seen him call at least 50 people by their first names and ask about their wives and children also by name.   He treats his employees so nicely, it really is a pleasure to watch.  He is simply a kind, good hearted human being, and you can't walk out of his diner without being happy just having spoken to him.  I ate at Johny's four times in the week I was there just to make sure my day started off on a high note.   I don't get the impression that you're the type of guy that would read these reviews Johny, but if you do, keep up the good work man.  You're an inspiration and you really made my stay in New York great.
