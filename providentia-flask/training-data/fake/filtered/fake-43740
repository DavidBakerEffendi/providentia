I was very disappointed in my experience this evening. I found the food to be pedestrian and to make matters worse the service was terrible. If you are planning to dine there with a group be prepared to not receive drinks in a timely manner if at all. In addition, they charge a 20% gratuity vs. the standard 18% and they charge gratuity on alcohol (not an industry standard). As a side note, I have no problem paying 20% on alcohol, but don't make me beg for it! When I spoke with the manager and asked him if he found this acceptable service he said no. I then asked him what he thought should be done and his response was "did you continue to ask your server to deliver your drinks?". Clearly he didn't want to take accountability for his team and never said "I'm sorry" about your experience, but instead he just walked away. I came home and was looking to write the restaurant via their website, however there is not an area for "contact us", so the owners aren't looking for feedback either. So, if you are looking for average food and terrible service, then this is the place for you.
