We read the review in the Record, I HAD to try the Restaurant. Let me start by saying, Maria is a Gem, the Diamond of her Pops restaurant. I am Gluten intolerant. My dining experience was wonderful. My family enjoyed their food tremendously. I have been trying to remain GF and its hard. Everyone goes out ot eat, but that isn't really a safe option for people who need to remain GF. This restaurant is a safe haven for us. I think its wonderful that we have an option to eat out and stay safe. I had seafood salad appetizer. It was excellent. The dressing was lite, lemony and tasty. The fish was fresh and firm, Shrimps were crisp. My husband had scallops, shrimp clams mussels and calamari in a lite tomato broth, over cappelini. It was flavorful and delicate, the fish also very fresh. While dining, Maria approached me to invite me to a Special GF dinner party she was hosting the following Monday. I was intrigued and asked a friend to attend with me. We could not have been more pleased.The price of the 6 course dinner was all inclusive. We tried so many wonderful selections! There were products for sale, to cook at home. I am so glad we found this restaurant. I feel blessed,Thanks to Maria and Family!
