Oh so delicious.  The classic combo is great.  Possibly the best baba ghanouj and tabbouleh I've had.   The hummus is delicious, but I've had other hummus that I've liked at least as well.  The falafel is among the best I've had.  The chicken gyro is great.  And somewhat surprisingly, their burger is really good too.  Who'd have thought Mediterranean takeout would make a good burger?  I don't think I've ever had anything that wasn't delicious here.  Sadly, we moved out of their delivery radius.  Now we have to drive 30 minutes each way to get it.   Oh, and the people there are some of the friendliest people you'll ever meet.
