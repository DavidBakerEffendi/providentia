I was first introduced to Bubbys when I moved to NYC- now it's a favorite. The food has always been divine- and great quality. Sadly, they randomly started charging for their world famous biscuits. The complimentary biscuit upon arrival was their distinguishing factor. Our waitress was fantastic however, and made up for the let down. Covered in tats, awesome hair, and great attitude. She saved your rep Bubbys- but if you want to keep your charm- go back to the old biscuit ways. It made you YOU.
