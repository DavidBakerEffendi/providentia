Few Chinese restaurants still offer a sit-down establishment for fast-food asian cuisine. Ivy Noodle not only provides this but has very convenient hours of operations, Â often open well past midnight during the school year. The food is delicious and they offer a wide variety of selections. Their noodle entrees and fried rice dishes are noteworthy and I'm a huge fan of their curry chicken special. Definately worth the stroll down the Blvd. for when you're in the mood for that take-out style, no muss, no fuss dining experience.
