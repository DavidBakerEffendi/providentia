Did not enjoy myself on Sunday at all. Myself and a friend joined me for a few drinks near closing. I noticed that the bartender started to clean the bathrooms picking trash off the floor and take the trash out of the bathrooms. Then she never washed her hands and proceeded to go back and make drinks for customers. We will never return to the bar ever again.
