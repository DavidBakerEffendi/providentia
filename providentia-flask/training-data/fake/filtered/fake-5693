If you are looking for a place that serves absolutely delicious cheese steaks in Philly, the Dalessandro's is the best by far. Oh my goodness, I had the chicken cheese steak and it was such a treat for my mouth. The steaks are piled high with the meat of your choice (I chose chicken, but the beef looked good too). The bread wasn't soggy and my steak was piping hot when I picked it up. This place is very popular so I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you call in your order ahead of time. This way to don't have to stand around waiting with dozens of other people for your order. OH! and the lady at the front counter was very nice. She's always greets me with a warm smile whenever I come in to pick up my steaks. Nice folks serving up good food. What more could you ask for? :)
