This place is so horrible that I actually created an account and joined yelp to write a review about it. Which is something I dreaded due to my laziness. However this place ticked me off that much that I had to write something about it It is musty and smells weird. Everything is old. It's old enough to make you question the hygiene. At first glance it looks as it has an interesting decor but you'll end up realizing that it's just old and repulsive.   Service is fast however i cannot say that it's friendly. Food is horrible. I have never been a fan of Asian cuisine but that's a problem between me and my taste buds.  Even though I may not like Asian cuisine I will always appreciate a well prepared meal. So to keep it kinda western I ordered lemon chicken and my girlfriend ordered sweet sour chicken. Lemon chicken was just a schnitzel in lemon jelly soup. And sweet sour chicken was something similar to that. Both meals were disgustingly sweet and bland.  We couldn't finish our meal and left the place as soon as we can. Worst 60 bucks ever spent.
