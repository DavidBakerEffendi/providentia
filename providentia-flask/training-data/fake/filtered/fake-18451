Fantastic! Alma de Cuba was recommended by our concierge at Sofitel, and this restaurant exceeded our expectations! Service was spectacular, and every course was unique, perfectly prepared and delicious! Well worth the $$$! Â Only recommendation if you are looking for intimate / romatic dining experience - request a special table since the majority on 2nd floor were too close together.
