Unfortunately, I would not recommend this place to anyone. I paid a 14$ check with a 100$ bill and paid no attention to the money the bartender gave me back. Later throughout the evening I realized I had exactly 14$ dollars in my pocket. We went back to the bar, everyone was really nice and polite while listening to my complain, but I got no money back. I realize it was difficult to determine who was telling the truth, but since I am positive I do not just throw 100$ bills around, I know how much money I gave them. The thing is is that the manager chose to disregard the fact that one of his staff was mugging the customers, so beware, it might happen again.
