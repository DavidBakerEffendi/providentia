Cafe Habana is some of the BEST Cuban food I've tasted, and I've been to quite a few Cuban restaurants, in New York, LA and Miami. While the place is small and the wait is usually long the food is TOTALLY worth it. The Corn is a MUST-HAVE. ...I also really enjoy the verde enchiladas and the lime juice! You will not be disappointed here
