This place is my new go-to spot in the neighborhood for inexpensive and healthy food.  I've tried four MOB's so far.  The Iron Man (shiitake mushroom, sauteed kale, and horseradish aioli) and the Belly Charmer (tagine with pistachio, mint, and cilantro) are outrageously delicious.  The sage saucisson is good, but you don't get much saucisson so it seems like a rip-off compared with the heftier MOB's.  Also, the anti-oxidant (bananas, choc-fig marmelade, and mint) made on graham cracker crust is a great dessert.  Service is friendly.   Gluten-free MOB's are also available on request for those interested.
