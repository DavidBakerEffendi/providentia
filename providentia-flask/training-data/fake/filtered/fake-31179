We keep coming back to Wafa's...  And you will too. It is for good that this amazing place was featured in a New York Magazine article titled 'Queen's Top 20'.  You can't go wrong with any of the meat choices.  If you are indecisive like I am when I eat here you have a platter with a choice of two or even three different meats.  The sides are also amazing full of flavor.  Personally I am a fan of mousakaha and mujardarah.  You also have to give the specials a try.   The staff is both endearing and courteous.  You want to eat at Wafa's not only for the food that tastes homemade but also for the pleasant dining experience.   My tip to you is don't leave until you've tried the Baklava.  You can thank me later.  Enjoy.
