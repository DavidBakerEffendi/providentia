I was visiting Philadelphia and explored this tiny cozy spot on our way back home. We stopped by to try something for dessert after eating the cheese steaks. I must say that they serve the best crepes in the town!!! I have tried several crepes places in the past, as I love crepes but this is certainly the best.  I was impressed by the amazing choices they have in sweet and savory crepes especially the "Ice-cream crepes". I tried the Dark Belgian chocolate crepe with Fresh strawberries and "Honey Honey" Lassi (Honey, vanilla, Levender). Everything was so fresh and flavorful. Owner was very kind and sweet too. She told me that they use "All Natural" stuff. I will try Kashmiri Chai next time as I am too full today. The only con is that they don't have a parking of their own and it's just street parking which could be difficult to find at times.  I'm definitely coming back!!!  Can't wait for my next trip to Philly.
