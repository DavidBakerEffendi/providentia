Horrible - Just spoiled our day!!! No words to elaborate. Trying to forget . Worst Indian restaurant I ever been in my 30 years of life. 45 mins waiting time to deliver even the starters. Need to remind multiple times, what we ordered. Not at all clean , indian street shops much better. In short, try at your own risk Note: This is all about their restaurant, not sure abt the sweet section - Didn't take another chance
