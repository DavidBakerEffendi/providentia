I may be in a small crowd of people that think this is one of the most over rated restaurants in NY. The scene is horrible, the restaurant is loud, the tables are literally butt up against each other and your wedged between a supreme douchebag who looks like a TLC channel reality show star. To top it off the food was ehh at best. Believe me people there are much better steak houses in NY that have a much better and more relaxing scene.
