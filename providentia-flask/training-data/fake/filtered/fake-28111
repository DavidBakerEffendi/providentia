A really nice winebar in the east village.  Really dark.  Very dark.  I tripped several times, but perchance it was the wine.  The bathroom is cool, for those who appreciate those things.  Didn't have the food, but I'll bet its up to par.  Someone at the bar kept changing the music after every song which was really annoying.  Especially when it would change from something good to something god awful
