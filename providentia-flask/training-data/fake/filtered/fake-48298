Pats Steaks is "Way Over Rated" I cant believe I have to give it a one star.  I ate a cheesesteak about 2 months ago because my Bro-in-Law forced six of us to go there for his birthday.  Well, the cheesesteak was dry no flavor - the condiments are outside in jars where all the lovely flies and insects can get to them. The cheesesteak meat was cool so it couldnt of been just cooked .  I didnt even finish the garbage. I have no Idea why people still want to go to this place still.  Please dont think this is what a philly steak should taste like.  I also ate there about 7 years ago and same results.  I thought they would correct there problems but people keep coming so why bother.  You are what you eat.   I recommend Tony Luke - Prince of Steaks or any place but here.
