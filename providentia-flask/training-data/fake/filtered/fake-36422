Don't be put off by the location (a bit of an industrial area) or the look of the building from the outside (a log cabin, inexplicably), inside this little gem is cheery, light, and bright.  The food is homemade and fresh, with good size portions.  Sandwiches made on homemade bread, well-composed salads, and your standard grill items are very reasonably priced.  You won't feel rushed and the noise level is low enough that you can actually have a good long conversation. Fiesta-ware type dishes add to the feeling that you are enjoying a meal at a good friend's house.  Do not leave without one their incredible cookies; seriously the cookies alone are worth a trip.
