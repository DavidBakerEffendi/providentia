Prime 16 happy hour and beer selection cannot be beat in Nee Haven!  The burgers are great and can be made to please almost anyone's discriminating palate. A few nit-picky observations:   Stop changing the glassware! The 12oz stemware is so bad and now the traditional cocktail glasses are being replaced with the non-standard ( less volume) glasses. And, of course, don't get me started on the horrible music. Just don't play anything, if that is the best you can do.
