They've got a fan in me now.  Tried a slice of pizza (plain) to see if this would be the place for me as I've tried the pizzas in town and nothing comes close to the ones I've had in NYC but Anthony's is pretty close.  They won me over and their online ordering system is a great bonus.   The calamari needs just a little bit longer in the fryer (too pale) but otherwise, everything I've ordered have been heavenly.
