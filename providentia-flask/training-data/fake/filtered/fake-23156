Saturday night, 2/8.  Looking for a steak and a beer, remember this place, used to go to the one in Mountainside years ago. Sat at bar, 2 bartenders, more or less, younger one down at service bar, women that served me may have been manager or owner, she was not concentrated on the bar, moving off to do something else often.  Tad more about the service, took a while for her to notice me and take my brink and food order, she was at one end of a very long bar or absent behind it.. Steak came out pretty quick, she dropped it off but did not give me any condiments, asked for vinegar for my fries, I should have been specific, she gave me oil and vinegar salad dressing. Now the food & drink, beers at bar come in plastic cups, at a steak house, enough said. Steak was cooked fine, ordered it just south of medium rare so that's not a problem. Choice of mashed or french fries, really, no baked, it is a steak house. The fries were fries, nothing to comment about.  Veggies were 1 floret of broccoli and a few slices of carrots. The steak, Delmonico, good size, but tasteless, it's advertised as lightly seasoned, but some would have helped.  I'm going to give them the benefit of a doubt saying it was basted in olive oil, but based on the aftertaste I'm  going w/ vegetable oil.  It was oily and bland.  The vegetables were the tastiest part of the meal, should  have forgone the fries for them. Overall, I'll avoid this place in the future. Going to a chain at least offers consistency or to a higher end steakhouse; for the $25+ for the steak, it was really disappointing.
