I've been frequenting here for quite a while and the quality is definitely going downhill. We started with salads, which were great, as usual. The salads are always fresh and perfectly simple. We ordered the punctuated equilibrium, our favorite, and were unfortunately dissapointed. The crust was soggy and the pizza wasn't as large as usual. When paying over 20 bucks for a pie, I want it to be close to perfect. The service was good, but it was so packed (often) that the server wasn't able to truly connect with us.
