TOTAL: $??? PEOPLE: 4 OPINION: A group of 4 of us came here for dinner on 5/26. We started off with the oyster sampler was a nice way to get a taste of the different kinds of oysters.  I haven't developed a taste or preference for oysters but all were good.  I would not recommend the burger....because it's an oyster house!  My friend loved the Gumbo. And she is a native to Louisiana.  My lobster roll was good, but by the time I got to it, I was already stuffed.   We didn't have room for desert.  The service was warm and welcoming.  They were also informative.   Overall, a solid dinner. If i'm back in town, I will have to check it out again.
