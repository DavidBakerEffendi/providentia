My family loves the food and the owners (Haseem and Miriam). The food is fantastic and they make us feel like they have known us forever..like we are family. It's rare that you visit an establishment and they go the extra mile to win your loyalty by providing great service, complimentary appetizers or desserts. They know how to make their patrons return! The food is finger lickin' gooooood.
