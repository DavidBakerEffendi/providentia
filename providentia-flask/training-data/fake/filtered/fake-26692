I thought Pitaziki was fabulous! The food was really fresh and delicious and the steak shawarma was melt in your mouth good! They heat the pita bread for you and you get unlimited toppings for your dish! It was great! I highly recommend this reasonably priced, fresh and healthy, on the go mediterranean food!!
