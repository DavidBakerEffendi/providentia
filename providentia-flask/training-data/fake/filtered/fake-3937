Juventino gave my husband and I the most bizarre non-dining experience of our lives, followed by an absolute commitment to never set foot in the place again. And this was before we found out that the owner is a horribly abusive employer. Saturday night at 7:30 we walk into the empty restaurant save for two tables in the front. The hostess asks us if we have a reservation. We answer no...she scurries off behind the bar and huddles with a group of servers. Incredulously, we look around at the empty restaurant. The hostess returns and leads us to the worst table in the house (by the kitchen door). We tell her we'd prefer a better table, of which there are about 20 empty ones all around us. Shocked by our request, she explains that she has reservations coming in...then scurries off and huddles some more with her servers. Returning with a pained expression, she offers us the bar (which is also empty), at which point my husband is on his way out the door and I reply: Yea, we're just going to go. We cannot imagine how this place stays in business. We can also not imagine what terror these women are subjected to to make them act so irrationally. To them I say: know and exercise your rights, walk away.
