My experience was not good at all... me and my husband came to this cafe round 4p.m. and it was empty - no guests at all... the waiter was very rude. it was the first time we tried turkish cuisine and the waiter was not helpful at all... we orderer lentils soup... the waiter didn't warn that the soup was boiling hot and I burned my tongue!!!!! we also ordered Yayla Tava with lamb... oh my god... I cook much better!!! the meat was tough and the rest of the dish... simple as 2x2 and really nothing special... by the way... we had to wait for our dessert (KÃ¼nefe) round 15 minutes while Yayla Tava and soup came out very quickly... Nevertheless I noticed that this cafe is very busy in the evenings and I guess it is just my opinion and personal experience... oh by the way - the bread was delicious
