Visited friends in Montiville sp?, and they drove me by Teresa's house from the NY housewives nearby. Stopped at their favorite pizza place in Boonton - Pasquale's. Loved it. The pizza is the best and loved the traditional sub sandwich. The guys are so nice and friendly. The decor is in transition - that's why I gave it 4 stars - hopefully the guys will get a woman's touch on the ambiance. If it's all about the food it gets 5 stars. I guess they are renovating. They have new storage. The place looked clean, not sure what the other folks were talking about though that was awhile ago. Believe me, if I thought it was gross I wouldn't eat there. Sounds suspicious to me.
