Absolutely awful customer service experience.  Went for dinner to celebrate my birthday.  Left my BlackBerry on the table in case the babysitter called.  Waitress spilled water on my BlackBerry, which ruined the touch screen.  I needed to purchase a new phone and called the restaurant to see what they will do for me because I was out $169.  NOTHING but be RUDE!!!!  The manager told me that I should have had insurance and he doesn't know what happened after I left the restaurant.  Got blown off by the owner but finally got him on the phone.  Yelled at me that my phone shouldn't have been on the table, and that he didn't spill water on it so he wasn't doing anything.  Told me I was free to take it up with the waitress.  As her employer, I stated that was his responsibility but he didn't seem to care.  If they spilled food on my clothing, they would pay for dry cleaning, but a phone isn't the same to them.  Good food, but there are plenty of other Italian BYOB with good food and better customer service.
