This place used to be five stars. But the last two times I went I felt like I'd been had. The chicken is definitely an inferior grade compared to what it used to be for YEARS! The line is super long, the rice is good, and so is the white sauce/hot sauce/pita, but the main star of the show ? well lets just say he's on a sick leave and there's a cheap substitution in his place. Won't be going back. Feel for sorry for all the tourists who go there because of all the hype.
