best brunch in nyc! i love the biscuits, sugar bacon, and all of their main courses! had the brioche french toast and the soft-scrambled egg with organic cheese, roasted tomato, and sourdough last time. their oj is freshly squeezed and very sweet. adore this place! oh, and if you go in the morning on weekdays (they open at 8), there is no line.
