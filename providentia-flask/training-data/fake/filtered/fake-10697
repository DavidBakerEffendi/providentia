Went for a drink after a nice dinner.  Still a bit early when we got there on a Saturday night (9pm).  Tiny bar, but some nice comfy couches. My friend wanted a B&B (Benedictine and Brandy) , young female bartender never heard of it, she switched to Cointreau.  I had a Manhatten, made decently.  Large drinks, about $12/drink, high for Little Falls, but nice ambiance for this area.  Get the feeling this is a Martini bar for neophytes.  I do hope it stays around for a while as it's a nice changeup to the regular bars in this area.
