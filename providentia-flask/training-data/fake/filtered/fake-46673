Like most others on here...good food, bad service. I must admit they have some of the best hummus in the city and seem to know it and not bother with being friendly. I had the salmon which was very good, friend had the chick kehab which she said was dry. Maybe it was an off night as I've had it before and it was fine. I mainly go for the hummus though and the bread they serve...ohh that bread!
