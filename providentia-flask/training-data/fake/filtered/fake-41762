Featured in the Wall Street Journal "Lunchbox" series, the Bakehouse Café and Bistro had me from hello--or at least first bite. The seared sea scallops were sweet, plump and sealed with a kiss from their brush with a hot pan. They arrived with a drizzle of celery root puree as a cool, almost sweet, contrast to the punch of the basil ginger oil. I had the grilled octopus salad as the entrée. Crisp baby spinach leaves were brightened with strips of jicama and finished with a deft touch of sesame dressing. The chewy bland octopus in the mix, however, dragged down the entrée. I washed back this mistake with a pint of the draft Racer 5 IPA, a Healdsberg, California craft ale. Served with cloud-like head of foam, the Racer 5 IPA was a brilliant amber sunset in a glass. The caramel malt emerged from an earthy foundation, followed by a citrusy floral, honey, and grassy hop. The malt sweetness engaged as the hop bitterness slid to the back of the tongue. The abrupt bitterness was tempered by a soothing, silky malt finish. The waitstaff was relaxed, yet knowledgeable and attentive. I look forward to the next bite.
