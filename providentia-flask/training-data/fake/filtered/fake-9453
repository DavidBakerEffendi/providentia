Stopped in last night w/out a reservation, we were told that it would be 30 mins for a table but when we explained that we couldn't wait b/c we were hitting the road heading back to Boston, we were told to hang-on to see if they could do something for us. We were told that a table was reserved for a seating in about 90 mins and that they would need the table by then but we were welcome to sit immediately if we understood the need to turn-over the table for the reservation....we were delighted and understood. Given the intimacy of the room, we were delighted to have been offered a table. My husband and I had a light and lovely meal...he had the sliders and fries, I had the corn bisque and soft-shell crabs....all were excellent. On a stormy rainy night, w/out a reservation and with four hours of driving ahead of us, Little Owl, it's staff and menu were just perfect!
