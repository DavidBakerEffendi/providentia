Great food, great time!  The Chicken Gnocchi is incredible, as is the Shrimp Fra diablo!  The bar scene is vibrant and fun, the place truly has the best bartenders and waitstaff in Hartford.  There is even a Gluten Free option for the pasta selections. Truly a great atmosphere for dining. Highly recommend.
