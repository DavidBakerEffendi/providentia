Eh, avoid this establishment, it is infested with cockroaches! Uno's used to be a good restaurant years ago when ran in a professional manner. I had ordered a large numero uno and found a cockroach hoping around in between the cheese. That should have been the last straw, but yet my children beg to return. We did decide to put this incident behind us, and yet we found a disturbing scent lingering from the kitchen, which smelt like "pot". Absolutely ridiculous, where are the managers cleaning this place up rather than texting on her phone in the lobby?! Â Will only visit Franklin Mills location, due to the higher sanitary conditions.
