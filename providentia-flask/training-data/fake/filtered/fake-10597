went to cast iron for the first time tonight.  omg! this place is terrific.  had the grilled pork chops with macaroni and cheese and coleslaw.  d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s!  i was eating late and planned on just "tasting" a little bit of this and that and then bringing the rest for lunch tomorrow.  no way!  i couldn't leave it alone and ended up eating the whole thing!  can't wait to go back and try the fried whiting and the dirty rice!  oh, and did i mention the coconut pineapple cake!  surprisingly, my husband let me taste a bit of the banana pudding cake i brought home for him.  when i was at the restaurant i saw a sign advertising their lunch buffet tuesday thru friday, i believe, from 12-3 - for $10.  i will definitely be there soon and i recommend this restaurant to all.  glad to have them near my place of work and will certainly be passing out their menus at work....and they cater too!
