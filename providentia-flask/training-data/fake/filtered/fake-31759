I am a big fan of Indian food and Spice Grill has consistently deliverd good food at a very affordable price.  I had a lunch buffet on Friday 9/9/11 with about 8 of my colleagues. As always, the food and value is excellent.  Ambience is OK and not that great.  Their rice pudding is amazing. Only negative is that clothes smell like Curry due to strong odor from spicy food.  I don't mind, but just want to bring to you everyone's attention.
