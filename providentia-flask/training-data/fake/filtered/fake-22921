I went to Mezetto with 2 friends and we had a great time. The menu offers small plates, tapas style so we tried many of the innovative dishes on the menu. The food was so delicious and the place has a great vibe with a beautiful bar. Plenty of street parking which made it very easy. After our meal we saw the servers bringing out dishes that we can't wait to go back and try. What a fun place to bring friends a family!
