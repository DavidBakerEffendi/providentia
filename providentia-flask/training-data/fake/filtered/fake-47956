Having been here on a number of occasions, I recommended Ibiza to a friend, and we went during Restaurant Week.  As is often the case, the meal and service were not what they would have been on a typical evening.  In fact, we were quite disappointed.  Without going into detail, suffice to say I had made up my mind that I would never return.  I expressed my feelings to Ignacio and he graciously offered to make it up to us. We returned to Ibiza last week and our experience was entirely different.  We shared 4 tapas and 3 desserts.  Not only was the food as wonderful as I remembered from previous experiences but the service could not have been better.   In my opinion, it is how customer dissatisfaction is addressed that determines the caliber of an establishment.  Restaurant Week, like Mother's Day, may provide good value, but, is designed to move people in and out quickly.  Consequently, the food and service may not always be up to par.  If you want the real experience you should visit on another occasion.  Ignacio proved to us that he values our business and my friend, once again, trusts my opinion when I recommend a restaurant.  :)
