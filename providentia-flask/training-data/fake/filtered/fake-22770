Having to yell to be heard over the music is simply an annoyance in a restaurant with otherwise good vibe. Even after the happy hour rush ended, all was too loud. It felt as if the music was turned up!  So people yelled to be heard over the music and yelled to be heard over the others yelling to be heard over the music.  Good food and service but unpleasant place for conversation.
