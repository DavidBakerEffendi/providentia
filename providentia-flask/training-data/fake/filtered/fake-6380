Great restaurant for anyone who likes Discrimination. We were seated immediately upon arrival. We waited 40mins before we realized that we hadn't been offered drinks or anything. Another family who were Caucasian, noticed how the waitresses ignored our rather large party of 9. This family was outraged and spoke up on our behalf. There were 4 other parties that sat at additional hibachi grills, they arrived after us and all were served and we were not. It was my birthday to say the least, and the Sakura in Manchester gave us some trouble so I made the executive decision to leave and was advised to go to Glastonbury. In Glastonbury the manager didn't offer us an apology until my brother confronted him and explained his frustration. He said we are people and your not treating us like that. Then the manager said "I'm sorry". It is sad that I am a school teacher, and my brother a police officer, and because we didn't have our profession painted on our clothes my family was treated horribly. My daughter said "Daddy it's not fair that they didn't serve you but they served other people who didn't have brown skin." She is only 6 years old, how do you explain that... It felt like we were living in the times of segregation and we just went to a restaurant that we knew we shouldn't have been allowed to attend. I hope people learn to treat everyone equal, and not prejudge people.
