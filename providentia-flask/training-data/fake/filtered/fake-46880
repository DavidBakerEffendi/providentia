WOW! Read a story about this place last week. Philly Weekly i think? I just started working in the area and decided to see what all the fuss was. The place needs better decor, but then again it wouldn't have the same philly style. I had the Diavalo Sandwich, I think it was the best sandwich I've ever had in my life (sorry mom). I was watching all the sandwiches ahead of mine being made and decided when i go back. I'm gonna start from right to left and try them all. BTW all drinks are only a buck. Even the Hanks Root beer in a bottle. GO! NOW!
