We just moved here from Phoenix and love Hamilton's!  We have taken our kids there for brunch, lunch and dinner, and my husband has been to the bar to watch sports in the evening.   We have loved it every time and bring friends here when they come over.   We are all vegetarian and always find something so yummy.  The past couple of times we went, one of the specials was a vegan dish, which they  pointed out when they told us about them.   The staff is so friendly and helpful with menu questions.  I think the food is worth the prices they charge, although...I wish it was a little cheaper just so we could go more often! It's a newer place, and some of the early reviews may have been while they were working out the kinks, but things seem to be running smoothly now!  The food is delicious and the ambiance is comfortable.
