Kanella always makes me smile.  Nothing is better in this world than sitting at one of their wooden tables surrounded by GREAT food, wonderful / personable servers, and a simple (but elegant) cozy atmosphere.  Brunch is always good when you need a pick me up after a late night out and it's the perfect date spot if you're trying to impress.  I always want to branch out and try new dishes but I've been there enough times to find my go to dishes that I can't live without. My Go-to dishes for Brunch: Cyprus Breakfast- for a basic but delicious breakfast. Kedgeree- for a breakfast with a little bit of uniqueness and that extra little oomph that you sometimes need. Pasticchio- For a nice hearty flavorful lunch. IT'S AWESOME! My Go-to dishes for Dinner: APPS: -Bureki -Koubes (but i don't think they have them anymore) -  Rabbit Casserole -Dips of the day Entrees: -Veal (OH MY GOD! THE VEAL) -Goat Stew -Pig Cheeks ***I normally don't do any specials but last time I was there I got this wild wood pigeon and it was mind blowing. Meat was incredible, the stew underneath made with a spiced middle eastern beef, chanterelle mushrooms, and some kind of green was equally delicioso. I ate that this as quick as I could fit it down my throat and spent the rest of the time asking the server for more bread so I could soak up the rest of the juices on the plate.  A MUST HAVE***
