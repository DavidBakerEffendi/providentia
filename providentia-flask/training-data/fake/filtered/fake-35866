This place is no beauty from the outside. My friend and I walked in and were immediately greeted and seated and served water. It seems like more of a take out place as for the duration of our meal we were the only ones in the restaurant! The food was excellent however. I had the beef dumplings and sha momo (i think!). The broth was delicious and all ingredients tasted very fresh. Although the restaurant is a sit down and waiter service it was very casual. Â Our waiter was excellent, bringing my friend a fork without condensation and running to get me a new pair of chopsticks when he saw mine had fallen. I liked it a lot!
