Jones is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Philly. During my college career, I did not visit the restaurant as much. However, in my last few months of college and now whenever I am back in town, I make it a point to stop by Jones for a one-of-a-kind brunch. One of the managers moved from another one of my favorite Stephen Starr's, and he has made incredible improvements. I have gone to Jones with extremely picky / difficult-to-please friends before, and they always find something on the menu that they like. The monkey bread is a must-have. Beyond the food, the service is excellent. The manager always stops by (at least once) to see how the meal is. Further, he has an incredible memory. Even if several weeks or months elapse between my visits, he always recognizes me and makes me feel at home. I would highly recommend Jones if you are seeking a stellar brunch that tastes delicious and is one of the most comfortable atmospheres in which to dine. I look forward to see what new additions the management has up its sleeve.
