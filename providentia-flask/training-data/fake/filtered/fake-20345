We had Sukhadia cater at my daughter's wedding in Jacksonville, FL. Prior to that we visited their Gokul restaurant in NJ for tasting. All the items we tasted were very good. The appetizers and the sweets were excellent. The Gujarati items were excellent and punjabi food was also very good. During all the meals and all events at the wedding, evereybody loved the food. The taste, presentation and service were excellent. It was a wonderful experience to have them cater at the wedding.
