Flaccid and rude customer service. Visited Taboonette on a Friday at 6:30 pm. Deserted. I had a gift certificate, but when I presented it, the cashier told me the restaurant didn't accept them. Which it should, it's a certificate to the specific restaurant, and totally legit. I asked to speak to her boss or manager, but she couldn't produce anybody who would deal with the problem nor would she deal with it herself. I said clearly you should improve customer service here, because this instance is a failure, and it's not like you've got any other customers to fall back on, and I was told "You don't need to be an asshole." Classy. No worries, we went around the corner to Nam Pang on 12th. yelp.com/biz/num-pang-saâ€¦ That place is delicious, and nobody called me an asshole! How novel. Maybe the food is fine here? I don't know. I'll never go there again, and I encourage others to avoid it too.
