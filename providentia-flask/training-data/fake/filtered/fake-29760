Fresh, creative, delicious.  This is easily my favorite restaurant in a neighborhood with a lot of good options.  The best part is they have a really well balanced menu with options for everyone, even people who aren't usually drawn to health restaurants.   I can't say enough nice things. I do echo other's comments about the uncomfortable chairs, but I would sit on the floor of this place if I had do. I also had a really nice experience with the owner last year when I reached out to solicit a donation for a charity event I was working on.  Even though we didn't end up partnering on that event, she couldn't have been nicer and seemed generally interested in the event and cause.   It's so nice to see a restaurant that not only takes interest in the customers' experiences, but also wants to form a connection with the local community.
