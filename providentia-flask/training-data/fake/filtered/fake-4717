Blue is, when all things are considered,  the best restaurant in Staten Island.  The food is fresh, creative and generally excellent.  We have dined there at least a dozen times and while every dish is not a winner - most are.  A fun way to eat there is to take the "tapas" route by just ordering appetizers.  Two couples can linger for hours and enjoy the harbor traffic, carefully crafted setting and warm and attentive service.  Also, the restaurant supports a local 'farm to table' initiative which only improves the fresh seasonal offerings.
