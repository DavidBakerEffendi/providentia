Party of 3 went for dinner Saturday night. Seats were available at 715pm but when our third guest showed up at 745pm, the wait was well over 1 hour. We drank at the bar. Bartenders served great drinks (French 75 and fresh lemon lime soda). Had drinks, appetizer, meal and desert for a little over $200. The mussels from PEI (Prince Edward Island) were fresh and juicy. I had filet mignon which was good. A friend had the sirloin special that night and was awesome. Everyone loved it. It was much better than the filet mignon I had. Other friend had scallops. It was good but a total rip off to me. $28 bucks for 4 quarter sized scallops. We all laughed when it came out. Desert was ok. We had the cheese cake, strawberry shortcake and Madeira digestifs.
