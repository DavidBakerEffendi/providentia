This is such a nice little place. I don't know why some people feel the need, the compulsion, to be 'spoilers', but we live with technology all around us, and we see these people in every stratum.  I grew up in a world where computer technology went from non-existent to bare-bones fledgling technology.  Mobile phones were things that weighed about eight pounds, and people carried them around in small black suitcases.  There were no graphics.  No pictures at all.  That's where "smilies" come from, btw, ...using punctuation marks just to have any pictures at all.  I've played whole video games made up that way (shivvver!).  And only two colors:  green or yellow (either/or, not both at the same time). ...And there were guys like that "petty/gripey" fellow even back then. The Internet, per se, didn't actually exist, at the time.  It was a loose affiliation of dedicated bulletin board systems (BBS's).  And use of capital letters in very lengthy 'rants' are a sort of legacy, and as such, a couple of the things that we've inherited that we're all familiar with (that we all probably could do without). This is a very pleasant, homey little place.  It's not haute cuisine, but it is cozy and comfortable, and the food is nice. *shrug* Talk to Yasser about his food (and food in general).  He's the owner, and he (and Kate) prepare the meals.  It's pretty obvious that he loves food.  The place is relaxing.  It's nice. Again, *shrug*
