Pat's or Geno's..Geno's or Pat's - the real winner is you, if you avoid both altogether.  The place is disgusting, as you get closer to the place you wonder if you're going to be swarmed by rats, then when you're up against the shack, the grease overwhelms you.  Of course, if you're still able to eat after seeing the place, the food will knock you out.
