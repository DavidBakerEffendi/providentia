Went there for Valentine's Day and loved everything about it! The spaghetti really is amazing and tastes like it came straight out of the kitchen of an Italian Grandma. The duck was a bit too salty, but otherwise everything else was delicious. For the guys - maybe a bit too small of portions, but for me it was perfect. The desserts were incredible as well!
