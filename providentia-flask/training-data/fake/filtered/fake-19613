I come here often.  Staff is friendly and service is always pretty good.  I think many of the same people have worked here for years, which I consider a good sign that management treats their employees well.  The food is very good, but when they get busy it can take a while to come out, which is reasonable considering everything seems made to order.  I recommend the "signature" margaritas which are excellent, but the "house" ones aren't bad either.  I do not care for their sangria.  Their hours are a little unconventional considering they have a sports bar upstairs.  This is also a good spot to have a drink while you wait for the train or grab dinner on the way back from the city.
