the food hit the spot! but is it any better than any other chinese hotpot place? not really. They're all on par. This place is a little more expensive actually. The vibe here is more young and trendy than other chinese places. for thanksgiving night they only give each group ONE HOUR Â to finish eating. it wasn't a problem for us since we eat fast, but when they told us that up front, i was definitely a little bit anxious about the time crunch. overall it's very MSG-ish even though they say there's no MSG. I would recommend the vegetable base soup if u don't want the heavy pork base or spicy base. but if ur in the for the MSG experience, then get the pork!
