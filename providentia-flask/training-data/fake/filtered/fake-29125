This place knows nothing about service; went an hour and a half before seeing a show at NJPAC-waited 40 mins with no attention to the table.  When i questioned where my food is because I have a show to go to, the waiter (older staff there) said IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM YOU HAVE A SHOW TO GO TO.  I responded to why nobody has come to the table in the last 40 mins- he said YOU HAVE TO WAVE YOUR HAND TO GET SERVICE.  I was like who is the manager-I'M THE MANAGER.  I said , now I wonder why everybody else here has an attitude.  No way will I go back to this place.  It's a shame because the food was good.
