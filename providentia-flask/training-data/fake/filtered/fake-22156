The food and waitstaff are a step up from Penang. They were very nice to baby Jack! I loved the food (Vegetable Curry in clay pot, Fried Whole Snapper, Satay Tofu, Mee Siam, Shrimp Puffs (my mom loves anything wrapped in bacon)) Chinatown is always a favorite destination and I love Malaysian BUT all in all for a trip to chinatown there are equally good dishes for a quarter of the price at Ting Wong! (Chinese) Ting Wong is still the shit! (roast duck with chinese vegetable a must) then I am going for Vietnam Palace or Banana Leaf! even Lee How Fook! -M
