Visited this place last week. Very unorganized. Managers seemed to have no knowledge of the restaurant business. Service was very slow. Most of the younger bartenders seemed to be very inexperienced. Food was average. Quality and service is not half as good as the Nutley location. Don't be fooled, It is completely different.
