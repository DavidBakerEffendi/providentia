Totally Sweet!!! I heard about Artichoke from friends in Australia, and every single day there were queues snaking around the corner so long they defied my rumbling stomach....but that is a GOOD sign!!! It made me want to go there even more.  Of the squillions of pizza joints in NY, Artichoke has already cemented itself half way across the world as a definite place to hit... Sure, you may have to wait, but wouldn't you be worried if you didn't? I chose my time carefully, late afternoon, and there were only a handful of people in there. My pizza was only a few minutes til ready, perfect temperature, consistency..thin crust, sweet tomato base..it was, the perfect New York slice.  The staff entertained me while I waited, and could quite easily charm the pants of anyone...friendly, chatty, it made for the perfect pizza experience.  If you go during peak hour, i'm sure you'll have to wait, but it will be well worth it...otherwise, hit it late afternoon for the perfect slice, and some sweet charm....
