I work at a hotel in chelsea & I reccomend people to go to Alta all of the time. I've been there myself several times and loved the food every single time. At this point, I believe I have tasted almost all of their menu & basically everything was astounding. The atmosphere is super fun, and the design/layout is genius. Great place to go with a lot of people to get to try everything and have a great night. Only issue that I have is the service. Each time I've been here, it takes an abnormally long amount of time to get anyone's attention for help. The waiters will make eye contact with you, and then proceed to ignore your blatant staring for an extended period of time. I think the restaurant is just understaffed. There can be a lot of people and a lot of little dishes, so perhaps more people need to be hired because the servers cannot do their jobs adequately with the volume of guests. But don't let that keep you from going. It's really just a minor pebble. It's not AWFUL like some other NYC restaurants I've been to, places where the servers make you feel like you are burdening them with your presence ( and money? ). It's just that if they fixed this little detail then it would seriously be a perfect place in my eyes. Almost there though!
