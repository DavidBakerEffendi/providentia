We just stopped here for a beer tonight- I thought the place was a win, lots of beer selections- the food was good- burger was a win, wings were solid, the chile was excellent- I like the two selections for the burger- pink or no pink- simple and quirky, the waitress was cute and did a solid job, let's face it I'm not going here for a tenderloin dinner-it a beer & burger spot, which works for me as Im anti chain dinner aka- chilies, Fridays, Tuesday's and the dozen others- and the topper it's reasonable- 3 adults- beers, burger and app-40 bucks .
