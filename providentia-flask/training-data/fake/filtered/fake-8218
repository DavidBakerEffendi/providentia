i went to yuca last weekend, the did not take reservations, but we didn't have to wait that long considering the place was packed. We all had flavor mojitos, and i have to say they were all great, specially the mango.Service was fast and my waitress was a lot of fun, we ordered buch of tapas to share , the lobster quesadilla was delish.I will defenatly will come back in a slow night
