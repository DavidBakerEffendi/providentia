Rating reflects that this location is a consistently above average Bertucci's. This has been confirmed after being subjected to a few other Bertucci's locations in NJ and elsewhere over the years. As with any chain restaurant, more sophisticated entrees are hit or miss and the assumption is that you may be better off at your local neighborhood Italian joint for that kind of meal. That said, we stick to the consistently good brick oven pizza (Portofino or the Bella Napoli), pannini, and salads. Â Plus they have Stella on tap. Good for a group that includes kids and good for a quick bite before or after the movies (200 yards from Regal Cinemas).
