Was there last night  the food was awful and the service was horrible!! They are rude and obnoxious. Had to ask 4 times for utensils and they watch you like if your stealing something that is worth having.  This was my 2nd time there  decided to give it another chance, but the service was no better. These people need to realize that we are paying customers and the public is who make them or break them. The owners wife is real snob!!!  Forget about trying to get a napkin to clean your hands with, 2 napkins per table???  really???  THE BIGGEST COMMENT I HAVE  IS CLOSE YOUR BUSINESS  THE FOOD WAS HORRIBLE AND THE SERVICE  IS UNDESERIBE  WOULDNT HAVE TREATED A DOG THAT WAY! most animal gets better treatment than that
