Yummmmmy.  I think that's the best way I can describe the food here but especially their slices.  I actually was in the area and just wanted to buy some water and stumbled into here randomly, HELLO glad I did that.   I knew right away I had to order a slice from this place.  A beautiful oven being tended to by a guy with an italian accent saying he has a fresh pie out and i needed to try it.  he gives me a delicious beautifully charred slice and shows me over to a table with fresh roasted garlic cloves and peppers to use as a topping.  UGH it was all so delicious and worked well.  The crust is perfectly charred, the sauce is sweet and perfect, nice smooth mozzarella and of course basil leaf.  I'm actually hungry writing this review thinking about it.  I wouldn't drive out of my way to eat here but if I'm ever in the area I wouldn't hesitate to stop here for a slice or more.
