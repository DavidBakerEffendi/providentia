The space is very cozy up top, if you're looking to sit down.  They will literally make your food from scratch, so be willing to wait.  You could call in your order and take out as well, if you're pressed for time.  Either way, when the piping hot food, fresh salads, and amazing smells come your way, you'll be served up really great comforting Caribbean food.  This is not for the light of heart of the obsessed of calories.  You get a good sized meal- maybe enough for two with the small plates.  My buddy and I got the citrus drink (not to sweet but really delicious), small curry goat and the shepherd's pie.  My girlfriend is English and she swears she's never had a Shepherds pie so delicious in her whole life. If you're not into hole-in-the-wall lots of personality type places, though, i would definitely just phone in an order.  Sometimes there are interesting folks hanging around and having a chat.  I say it's all part and parcel of a great experience.
