This was the first and last time I ordered. The meat in my Chicken Broccoli was SO veiny and gummy that it was like chewing bubblegum. I only ate 2 pieces of the meat before I could not take it anymore. The wonton soup had no taste. It was water with yellow food coloring. The dough was very hard and hardly had any meat. Overall, I will never go back to this place. It has ruined my appetite for Chinese food.
