In order to get the best of both worlds, we ordered a margarita pizza and a plain cheese pizza. The food was ordered and quickly picked up within 30 mins. The bread was great, nice texture, and well cooked. The Cheese didn't have much of a taste to it. The nice thing was that it wasn't too oily. The tomato sauce on the plain is what dropped my score to a 3. It tasted like metal and it was very salty.
