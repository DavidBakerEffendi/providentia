This reminds me of a Texas style place to eat with big portions and family style food. It was hands down the best place for ribs. There were six of us. We ordered the family plater with a rack of ribs, chicken, a pound of brisket/ pork, and 2 large sides. We also ordered the sweetheart deal with a rack of ribs and 4 small sides. The family deal was better; the ribs tasted better and fell off the bone whereas the sweetheart ribs couldn't compare. The cornbread was dry but if you start eating it first while its warm its not bad. I would recommend getting the mashed potatoes and macaroni as a large side and the fries, chili, beans, and potato salad as the smaller sides. The neighborhood was a bit scary but the food makes it all worth it. The place was obviously a warehouse before but they did a great job with it and the bathroom jokes written on the stall was hilarious. The service could have been better but again the food is what matters.
