I tried this place on a recommendation and noticed something. I ordered a cheesesteak and noticed they cut the raw steak meat on the same slicer they use to slice the cheese for sandwiches without cleaning it. I asked about it and the guy behind the counter told me he cleans it after every use.  I suggest everyone reading this go and see what he calls cleaning his slicing machine. He runs his dirty rag over the unit after each use.  It's a 2 man circus and I turned around and left.
