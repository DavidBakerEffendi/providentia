Not even close.. Been here twice, once for a work event, and once on a double date. Both times, it was Â bad. First off, if you're going to charge close $50 for a steak ...please, please know how to properly prepare it. I asked for rib eye (not prime) to be med. rare and it came out hard and over cooked. This is supposed to be a steak house? Cooking your avg. grade meat properly should be the starting point. When the next steak came out, it was almost raw. Nobody at the table was happy with what they ordered, it was either over/under cooked or over salted. With a tab close to $225...we all felt robbed.Bad, very bad. I would go elsewhere.
