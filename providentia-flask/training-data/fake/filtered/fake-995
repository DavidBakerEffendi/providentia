The food was good and our waiter was pleasant and courteous but unfortunately the owner who we met when we walked in was extremely rude.  My husband even went up to him after our meal and told him that he needed to change his attitude and then told him we would never come back to which the owner replied "ok that's fine".  Not exactly good customer service. He also owns Thai Kitchen in Hillsborough. It's a shame because the food is pretty good but we will never go back.
