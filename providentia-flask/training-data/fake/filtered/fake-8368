Last night was my first time trying out Laetus Restaurant & Pho noodle soup & let me tell you I am impressed. The restaurant is a nice addition to downtown hartford - great vibe - great service, staff is very friendly & the food was delicious. The egg rolls were so tasty Â and the pho noodle soup dish get 2 thumbs up. My favorite part of the meal was the lychee martini I had - OMG best one Ive ever tasted in my life, the bartenders definitely know what they are doing there. Want to thank everyone there for a great dinner experience. I will be back again soon :) & will definitely recommend this place to my friends & family and anyone who is looking for a great vietnamese dish & the tastiest drinks.... I can't wait to try some of their others.
