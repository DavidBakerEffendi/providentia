Really enjoy eating with friends in this newly opened restaurant ! In terms of the food, it is excellence.  Long while no eat such wonderful shanghai style food in New Jersey.  Will definitely go back again.   The favorite dishes are Dongpuo Rou, Ti Pang, HuaShui, Huangshan ...   delicious !!   also they offer lunch YouTiao, etc ..
