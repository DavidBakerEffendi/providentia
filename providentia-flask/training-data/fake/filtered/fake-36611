The white sauce pizzas are pretty good, tho the red ones leave something to be desired. The size is great but you definitely pay for it. the subs have been tasty but theres better in downtown Burlington. The customer service has been ok, first time was crappy, but has improved since. the drivers are always polite and friendly.
