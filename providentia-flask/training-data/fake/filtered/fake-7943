Walking into this place you would never believe how good the food is. It was definitely an old dinner before they transformed it. It's almost funny how much of the dinner is still showing, it almost reminds me of a cheesy themed chain restaurant, but done badly. But with all that said it is a nice quite place. I eat a lot of Thai and this is my favorite Thai place to go to in the Hartford area. Whenever my family or friends come to town, this is where we go. The food is great and who doesn't like some saki with dinner. Amazing, highly recommend.
