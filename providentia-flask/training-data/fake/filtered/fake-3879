The worst experience in Philly in years. We were there at 8:30pm, put our names down for a table outside and were told it would be 15-20 min. It was not really busy Got beers at the outside bar that tasted quite soapy. Apparently rinsing of the glasses is not practiced here. 30 min later we were still waiting even though there were 3-4 open tables the whole time. When we complained, we were told "You had asked for a booth inside. So you switched?" "No, we said outside." "It will be a few minutes." No apology. 20 min later we walked out. Place is useless. I would give negative rating if I could.
