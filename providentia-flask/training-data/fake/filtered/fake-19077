This place is simply AMAZING!!! From the warm atmosphere to the great music, to the FABULOUS pizza. This place puts all other pizza stores to shame. Walking down the block the smell of the fresh hot out of the oven pizza, is irresistible. The owners are not only geniuses in the field but dedicated and warm. You haven't tasted pizza if you haven't eaten at ARTICHOKES!!!!
