Great bar - no frills no fuss, drinks are reasonably priced. If you want some good whiskeys and single malts you'll find them here too. During the week this place is perfect if you just want to grab a beer and sit at the bar or one of the wooden bench tables, music is good, atmosphere relaxed - can get a bit shouty sometimes, depends on the crowd. Weekends are a bit different - last time I was here it was totally packed, a squeeze to get up to the bar, and two bartenders who were serving drinks non-stop, washing glasses, running credit cards - really don't know how they managed. Have to say, I got served pretty quick all things considered. Only problem - a bit too crowded - I think there was a birthday or something going on, maybe even two. All in all, I give this place 5 stars for atmosphere, prices, fast service, music and - when there's not a million people in here wearing party hats and drinking like it's going out of style - a nice low key hang.
