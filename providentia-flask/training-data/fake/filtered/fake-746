I honestly don't get what all the fuss is about.  This is an average diner at best.  Their food is not amazing and in some cases has been pretty bland and it is completely overpriced (I ordered two egg sandwiches and a side of homefries and it cost me $15!).  I agree with many of the reviews that their service is warm and very welcoming but the interior is kind of ugly and the fact that there are lines around the block absolutely confounds me... it is really just an average diner and certainly not worth a long wait.
