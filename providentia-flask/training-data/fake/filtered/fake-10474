Landed in here last night for dinner and we had a great time.  Fantastic service, great food and solid attention to detail with the Thai flavours.  The menu has good selection and the interior is very warm and welcoming.  It might be my new favourite Thai place and it is definitely the best newest secret in UES/Yorkville.  Definitely, go! I know I will go back!  Thanks Up Thai!
