My third visit.  Why did I go back?  Friends chose the spot, not me.  Still way underwhelmed.   The waitress was really nice -- excellent service.  But the food is just really below average especially for the price.  My husband actually said that what he had was pretty gross (some sort of chicken sandwich which was on the specials board).
