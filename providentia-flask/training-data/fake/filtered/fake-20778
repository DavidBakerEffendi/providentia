Food was fantastic!  Waitress was so pleasant and gave excellent recommendations.  Love the BYOB!  Portions were perfect, especially since French food is so rich.  Walked out feeling very full with 1 appetizer shared, dinner and 1 dessert shared.  All of the pate's were phenominal.  What I loved the most was how the side dishes and main course paired so well together.  The flavors melted in your mouth.  The only downfall is that this is listed as a romantic restaurant but it was loud and you sat so close to your neighbor that you could hear all of their conversation.  Not a deal killer - still had to give it 5 stars simply for the food and service.
