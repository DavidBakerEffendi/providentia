Seemed like a great idea, but wasn't so great. First off, the service was really just so-so at best.  In the hour we were there, the waitress only came up to take and deliver our order, and then drop off the check.  Other than that, they were pretty much nowhere to be seen (and the house was quite packed).  I had to wait a while for a coffee refill.  They took almost 10 minutes after seating us to give us a menu. Second of all, food wasn't so great.  I got the chicken with sun dried tomatoes and artichokes, or so I thought, I'm not quite sure because the dish didn't have artichokes.  It came with the cheapest looking greek salad I've ever seen, which was a ton of lettuce, two slices of tomato, two small squares of feta (not even crumbled or anything--if you're gonna be cheap with the cheese, at least crumble it) and ONE kalamata olive.  That, and a tasteless, sparsely drizzled dressing.   Third, for the price you really can get better.  I mean, this place is right in the heart of college town near Princeton U and there's a ton of eats in the area.  I'd go elsewhere.
