I came here b/c I heard the food and drink was great.  I was not disappointed....  Service was great and staff friendly.  Drinks were the best and the price was reasonable.    Love coming in for great breakfast and good coffee in the early morning.  I have heard Tyler Florence speak highly of the food here since he started his career here while in NYC.  So I came here to try it out.  I will be back.
