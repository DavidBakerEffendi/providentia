Went for restaurant week lunch with my husband. Love the environment very much. The waiters timely serve you but never bother you with questions like "is everything ok?"; you even did not see them closely around. I like the bright natural light coming from the big windows. My husband and I ordered different options for each of the three courses. Except my entree, all the other five plates are great. Fresh and good quality raw materials (very tender chicken and salmon) and processes elegantly. I wrote some calculation on the table paper when I waited for food. When I left, the waiter was so nice to ask me whether I wanted to take the paper. The overall experience was so pleasant. It deserves its reputation. Will definitely try others in the menus in the future.
