Being a Burlington local, I have had my fair share of breakfast from the area.  Pearl Street Diner is hands down some of the best you can get.  Their corn beef hash and benedicts are out of this world.  The homemade pie is also heavenly.  The service is slow so avoid the diner if you are in a rush but the food is more than worth it.  Good food & cheap prices!
