I've been to Kim's almost every week for months.  The service is unbeatable... be prepared to receive a warm welcome flood from everybody in the restaurant right as you walk in, and then a thank you from them all as you leave.  The miso soup is amazingly fresh, and the salad is in a mayo ginger sauce which is unusual and not my favorite, but this is my only problem with the whole restaurant.  I've been to Japan and the best sushi restaurants in NYC, and I can assure you this is one of the best sushi restaurants in the greater New York area.  I don't know where they get their fish from, but it's better than anywhere else around.  The dawn roll's my favorite (get it with regular seaweed) or the Kim's special roll is also wonderful.  They always include a free special roll, and a juicy orange to end the meal.  Considering everything they give you for free, it's a cheap meal of amazing sushi.
