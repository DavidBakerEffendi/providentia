Always a fabulous meal. Close sitting and small but good service and owners fun and personable. Get the cannaloni! Love bringing friends here. Be sure to make a reservation for this small BYO! Not sure I understand the poor ratings. I;ve been a fan for years. This is my favorite place to eat in the city!!!!!
