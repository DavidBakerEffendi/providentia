I have driven by this restaurant many times and have been wanting to stop in. Today I did and was so glad that I did. The food was delicious and the service was attentive. I also like the idea that it is a BYOB so that the focus can be on the food. I had Rigatoni Carbonara that was perfectly done, just enough sauce and the pasta was cooked to perfection. The staff is welcoming and the decor made us feel relaxed. The restaurant is light and airy. I can not wait to return with my entire family!
