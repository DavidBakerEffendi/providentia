Yuca bar was a brilliant experience  for me. The service was good and even though the wait time was 10 mins. past what I was told, the hostess was super sweet-just ADORABLE ! The noise level was comfortable enough and the crowd was mixed yet mature. The tapas meals were fantastic--very large portions and DELICIOUS!!!! I really had an AWESOME  time there- i was aplogized to for waiting 10 extra mins -but truth to be told i dint even notice as i loved chatting  to the waitress -she was so respectful and cool . A+++ for service and A+++ for the AMAZING FOOD!! Im from Melbourne, Australia and it  was a unique New York experience for me.
