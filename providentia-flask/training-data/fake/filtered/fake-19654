Food- This was some of the best BBQ I have had in the city! I give it an A. Vibe- I felt like I was out in the country, real relaxed and laid back. A+! Service- It was basically like being at a cafeteria. You walk up and order the food. That is kind of cool but I'd much rather like a waiter. B. Price- A little pricey but it was worth the price! B
