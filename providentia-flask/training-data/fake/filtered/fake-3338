Fantastic location!  Staff were awesome, quick and very welcoming.  We are always looking for organic, humanely raised food that is also cooked properly.  This place hit it out of the park!  Great appetizers followed by some great burgers and finished with a snicker doodle ice cream sandwich.  If we didn't live so far away this would be a regular spot for us.
