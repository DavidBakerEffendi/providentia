this place is the best in philly, really the best i've tasted anywhere...i've been to fla., de., md., & nj. and nothin comes close. my husband & i live in s. jersey and the time it took to get there & what we spent was well worth it !!! keep up the good work, everything was fresh and we even took the rest home 'cause it was sooo much. my husband & i are definately comin' back !!! i do wish i could've gotten an ishkabibbles t-shirt, but that's ok :)
