The tacos here and deadass solid. GREAT FLAVORS WITH JUST A LITTLE KICK IN THE BOOTY. My favorite taco here has to be the kale and potato. Its flavorful and a bit healthy. The beef brisket is really good too but a little bit too meaty for me. If you need a quick bite or some lunch, come here in the essex street market. They won't disappoint you. If you're looking to save some money and can come all the time they have a stampcard by the side for buy 9 tacos get the 10th on free!
