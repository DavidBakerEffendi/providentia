Eating here right now and truly enjoying the food, atmosphere, and service. I ordered the Thai Tiger with steamed tofu and it's extremely flavorful and filling!! Only $9 for the noodle and rice dishes and there are many more things on the menu. I ate at Canoe Club last night and this place beats it 10-1
