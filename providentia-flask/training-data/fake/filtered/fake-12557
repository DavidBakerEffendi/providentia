They should not do rolls.... Ingredients were not fresh and there were too much rice. Â Sushi rice was not seasoned properly. In addition, all the rolls are over priced. They charge $2.99 for the miso soup that is only 1/3 portion of other places. One of the men who works there was wearing sweat pants with filp flops and his underwear was showing. They need some kind of uniform or need to wear neat looking cloths. That grossed me out and they did not look professional at all. The place was neat though since they just opened up. Maybe yes for Korean foods, but do not ever order rolls. Personally, I would not go back to this place.
