I want to like this place, honestly because it's 1 block from my house. I've been here several times and its been quite terrible every time. Last night I got a cheesesteak to go. It was 10pm and I just got back from a class in the city. I was so hungry because I hadn't eaten all day. Sand would have tasted good to me at that point. The meat in the cheesesteak tasted old and they overlooked it so much there was not one drop of moisture left. On top of that there was grizzle. Just a disaster. The fries were horrible too. My stomach hurts just thinking about that place.
