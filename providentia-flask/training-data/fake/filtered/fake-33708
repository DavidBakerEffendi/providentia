Be expected to wait an hour before being seated at your table Came here on a Friday night, and it was PACKED. Had to wait outside until there was space inside to get a table. Waited an hour until we got our table. Â There's a bar upon entry, and that's where people drink and wait for their table. The ambiance of the restaurant is nice. Christmas lights all over the restaurant. Feels very tex-mex. When you get seated, you are brought chips and salsa. The chips were warm, and were a great balance to the salsa. Food came out right away, and were reasonable cheap. The food was actually good. Drinks were cheap, about $6-$9 for Margaritas. They also serve beer, and sangria. Great place for casual, cheap, and tasty dining. Nice place to spend a date night in Central Jersey
