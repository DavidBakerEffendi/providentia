We had our office party here and it was just an AMAZING experience.  Thumbs up on the: 1. Food -  Excellent balance with quality engraved in each aspect of the food.  The food tastes brilliant, and little touches and attention to detail on presentation just makes the food even better. 2. Drinks -  Perfect drinks with a touch of class.  Love the metal/steel straws that come with every drink 3. Service - Even though it was a large party, services were just on the mark.  From the host of the establishment taking out coats, to the servers who were patient, and ensuring that everyone was attended to, and following up to ensure that they had everything they needed. 4. Decor -  I have been to many many indian places but this one just exudes class and you can see how well thought out the everything was.  This is a place I can hang out with friends and family and just relax to good drinks and foof...or have a formal client meeting as well. 5. Attention to detail - Just what it says....embedded into everything that they do. In short, hands down one of the best indian restaurants I have been to!
