New place opened up down the block from work. Very interesting decor and cool artwork. Staff was very friendly, the chef/owner even walks the floor and talks to everyone. Nice guy (I assume you will see less of him as they get busier, but nice to see him engaging). We went for after work drinks b/c of the crazy happy hour deals and they always seem to have a fun crowd. Great pork belly sliders, sick fried oysters (maybe the best I've had) and very cool drinks list. We ended up sticking around for dinner and didn't disappoint. We split steak frites and rotisserie chicken. Both were excellent cooked well. We tried the two new side dishes staff recommended (shaded shaved brussel sprouts in habanero infused olive oil with bacon and jalape√±o cheddar buttermilk biscuits) and ended up ordering another of each. Not sure where this place came from but will be regulars for sure now that we know about it...P.S. they need to do more marketing, we only happened by it on our way to another place!
