I used to go there all the time.. LOVED IT...Then, The last few times the food was not fresh. I assumed they had a day or two off. Went last night and ordered a Stuffed Artichoke and it came with about 10 leaves swimming in broth..almost like leftovers.. Also, ordered Beef Carpaccio. They were out of Arugula and gave me old Braciole instead. To make matters WORSE: they started shutting the lights while we were eating (saying the restaurant was closing)... REALLY? Needless to say, that will be our last trip to Bruno's Forest Ave.!!
