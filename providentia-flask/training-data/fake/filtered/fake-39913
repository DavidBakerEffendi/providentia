I went to " The Skinny Pancake" with a friend and the food was great and the atmosphere was pleasant. I was a busy place, but between customers eating and drinking and the live music it was a nice way to view the Burlington Water Front, listen to live music and enjoy some yummy food. We started by eating the Spinach and Artichoke Dip....so yummy and creamy . I had the Veggie Monster, and it was very tasty,and filling ! My friend had the Apples and Brie she enjoyed her meal too . Best of all the food is local, supporting VT farmers !! The food is great and the staff are very friendly. It's difficult to find parking (but then again this it Burlington and parking just in general is difficult) Â but the food it well worth it !!
