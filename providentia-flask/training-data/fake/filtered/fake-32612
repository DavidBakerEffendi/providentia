One of the worst in the area. Filthy, with a "waiter" that is rude and condescending. He obviously does not understand English but pretends that he does. You will ask a question he will reply but have no idea what you asked him and you will find yourself trying to figure out why on earth you walked into this horrific place. Btw, they "only take cash", do not give receipts (can you spell tax evasion?) and are generally a disgrace for the neighborhood.
