I love this restaurant! My family and I have have been going there for years and I simply cannot get enough of it! The food is excellent, and the service is great. Everyone there is very friendly. The baklava is simply amazing!! Â I'm half lebanese and know how middle eastern should taste like, and till today, I have not had food better than the food served at Sahara Restaurant. The chicken and beef shawerma is to die for, and I especially love the meat grape leaves. The food is fresh and the portions are generous. They are just perfect! I highly recommend this restaurant.
