To drive by this new chinese restaurant would be a mistake.  There is an extensive menu that features Shanghai cuisine, and it is authentic, so the sauces are on the sweeter side. We began with the Minced Chicken w/garlic sauce appetizer. The chicken was plentiful and mildly spicy and it was topped with pine nuts, which added great flavor and a nice crunch. For the main course, we tried the Bone In Chicken with a slightly sweet thick soy sauce. We also had the Shrimp Duet, which was beautifully presented (this is NOT your typical Chinese-American fare). On one side of the dish, the shrimp were covered in a bright orange sauce (made from fresh sqeezed OJ) and topped with a glazed walnut. The flavors were heavenly.  The shrimp on the other side of the dish were equally good, though completely different in taste, as they were tossed in a red, mildly spicy sauce that had a sweet finish. Service was friendly and attentive. FU Resaurant is definitely worth a visit!
