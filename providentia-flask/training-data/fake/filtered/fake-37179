On December 11th, 2014, around 6:30pm, my daughter and I arrived to Houstons excited to dine and have Spinach dip and Steak. The hostess said the wait was going to be about 30-35mins. After 35mins passed we checked with the Hostess to see if a table was ready and she said no it wasn't. During that same time another patron who told us he came in after us, also went to ask the Hostess how much longer did he have to wait. She told him about 10 more mins. To our surprise...the man who came in AFTER us was seated....BEFORE my daughter and I. By this time I was turned off because my daughter and I had been waiting for nearly an hour. Then we ask how did he get seated before us and we arrived before him. The hostess gave a very poor excuse as to why she seated the guy and his guest first. The way we were handled felt very PREJUDICE...so we left and went to Ricardos Steak house instead. I will never go back to Houstons again. All $$$ spends the same and all patrons should be treated equally. The hostess at Houstons were NOT good and their prejudice behavior is bad for business.
