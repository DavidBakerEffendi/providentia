Bridgid's is one of my favorite spots in Fairmount. The food is not only delicious, but unique... For example... Hand-cut French fries fried with onions, peppers, garlic, and drizzled with balsamic and aioli. Yum! There is also a fantastic beer selection. The bar is really casual with a relaxed, cool vibe, and great for a short or longer stay.
