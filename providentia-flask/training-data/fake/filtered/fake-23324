I just ordered delivery from this place for the first time tonight. They forgot half the order, so I had to give them a jingle to let them know. Not only did they bring me the rest of the order, but 15 minutes later they brought over two sides as a token of apology. As I opened the bag, an apology note as well. I'm from the world of "mistakes happen," so I wasn't upset about the missing food, more just confused. But, this service really impressed me. Really smart recovery and an appreciation for the customer that you just don't encounter much anymore. I will order again -- and, did I mention the food was also delicious?!!!
