took them over an hour to deliver a pannini four blocks away... im still waiting as I'm typing this... and took them about 7 to 10 mins to pick up the phone when I tried calling... I would walk right over... but I'm at work. I don't think I'll call them again. Their food is good I guess... EDIT: called at 12pm... it's now 1:20pm and I still havent eaten yet... ugh..
