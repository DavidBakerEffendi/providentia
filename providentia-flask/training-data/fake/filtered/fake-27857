Is there no option for more stars!?  I give 5 stars for every category.  Service, quality, price, and quickness!  I love to eat pizza in every city I come to.  It is a must.  If it isn't the first meal I eat when I land, it is the 2nd!  Sometimes the 2nd, 5th, and 11th! No, seriously I was in town 4 days and yes I had it 3 times. I just couldn't get enough.  My friend said it was a sick obsession.  I digress.  Pizza is delicious and a must have when you are In Brooklyn.  A++++
