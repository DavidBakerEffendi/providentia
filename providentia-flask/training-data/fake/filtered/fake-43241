Been here about 5 times since it opened & tried 5 different sauces. We always order the complete dinners where you choose your sauce and your meal, & it includes rice, soup & salad. The ginger salad dressing is made in house & is so good i could drink it by the glass. The mango (mild), peppercorn (mild), coconut red curry (medium) sauces are my faves. The green coconut curry is good too, sweeter & not as spicy as the red. Portions are big for the price. Definitely worth trying. Plenty of parking.
