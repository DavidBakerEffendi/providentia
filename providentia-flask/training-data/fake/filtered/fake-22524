The ambiance is great, especially if you are looking for somewhere to sit outside on a nice summer night. The service is decent. However, the food is just okay given the price. For a $26 pasta entree, I would expect fantastic food of a sizable quantity instead of the small plate of mediocre rigatoni. The sangria was fantastic, but for $12 for a small glass, overpriced. Overall, a good choice if you are looking for a nice date night and don't mind shelling out some good money. Otherwise, just head somewhere else.
