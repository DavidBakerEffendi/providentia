Ate here last night for my Birthday with a group of friends. PERFECT place for a birthday dinner. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share including the mozzarella di bufala and black kale, which was our favorite. Most of us ordered pasta as entrees and they were all amazing. I had the tagliatelle ragu which was fabulous. My friend had the kale gnocchi special which was great as well. Great atmosphere...loud but not too loud that you can't hear across the table. Ended up being a really great place for a birthday dinner.
