Had a drink dumped in my lap by my waitress and never saw a manager. I finished my cold clam chowder before I got a second drink. I think the soup was from a can but usually canned chowder has more flavor.  The ice in the drink had half melted when it arrived with the excuse that the bar was backed up.  Not sure if it was a sewer back up or what because I could see there was no one sitting at the bar from my table. Then I got the bill....... 75 dollars for cold soup and two drinks not to mention the one I wore home in my lap.....Then on the way out had the front door slammed in our face by the bartender on her way out to chat with the hostess waiting out front for more unsuspecting victims.  I do hope Gordon Ramsay pays them a visit soon. I owned a restaurant in NY and if these people worked for me I would have fired them long ago.  EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE AND PRODUCT......Enjoy the 75 dollars It was worth it for the peep show your waitresses give by wearing such short skirts.......... cheaper than a lap dance in Montreal even with the exchange. Needless to say I wont be baAAAAAck !
