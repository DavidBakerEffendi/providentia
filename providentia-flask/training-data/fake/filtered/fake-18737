4/5 for Atmosphere 4/5 for Service 3.5/5 for Food This yakitori/sake bar is nicely tucked away for only those who actually seek it. Once you find it, you'll see that its underground setting offers warm and cozy atmosphere to enjoy some great sake and delicious food. The portions are not too big, but the price is reasonable, and most of their food was above average. Considering the plethora of awesome yakitori spots in New York, I'm sure there are better places out there, but this is a surpringsigly very decent spot in Midtown.
