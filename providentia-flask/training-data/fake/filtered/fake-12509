This is one of the only places I'll travel all the way to the Upper East Side to eat at.  Both the appetizers and main courses area great, particularly for the price.  I will mention that they run out of lamb pretty often at dinner time, which is unfortunate, but the rest of the menu is so good that it's not a big issue.
