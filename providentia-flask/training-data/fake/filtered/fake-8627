Do you like lemons? Do you like olives that look like grapes? Do you like food that tastes like citrus detergent? If so, this is your place. Franco & Luigi's was a pizzeria that I grew up around the corner from, and they made great pizza and Italian food. Now, it's a rip-off restaurant with great entertainment that serves crappy wedding food with bad service. The only redeeming quality these days is that it's a BYOB. It should be a BYOD (bring your own dressing) for the house salad. The garlic rolls were delicious and most likely store-bought. Both entree choices (fish and chicken) sounded delicious when the waiter described them, but turned out to be drenched in lemon sauce that overpowered the taste of the food. Both entrees also included a lemon slice, just to make sure you got that lemon taste. The waiter thought our French wine was Italian. A decent ricotta cannoli for dessert, also probably store-bought. The subpar food was totally overpriced ($152 for four people) and included a 20% tip that was added to the bill. The food is not Italian. Gordon Ramsey would shut this place down.
