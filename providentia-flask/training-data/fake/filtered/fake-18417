Great place for a romantic setting (Although 'romantic' wasnt my intention here, it could be). Also, excellent place for attentive service. Good place for a quality dish but avoid the Shrimp&Grits(Bitter, too spicy, disappointed). My friend ordered this and she didn't finish it. She enjoyed a lot of MY meal because of it. I ordered the Rum soaked Duck Breast which was great, the creamy yucca turned me (and my friend) to addicts of it. My only complaint was the waiting time. You're likely to wait 45 minutes past the time you reserved. The overly crowded bar will be offered to you as you wait but you're better off standing. However, calling has its perks. You'll receive better seats.
