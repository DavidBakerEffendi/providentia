Food (flautas, rice and beans) was decent, but my friend, who is Dominican--and ordered in Spanish, was charged $2.00 LESS for his dinner, which was practically identical to mine. I'm Anglo and ordered in English. We talked to the people at the next table and they said they always charge non-Hispanics more in this place. THat's it for me; I'll go where my business is appreciated, not exploited!
