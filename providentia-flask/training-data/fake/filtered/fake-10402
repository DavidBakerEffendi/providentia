Negative stars would be appropriate.  I wanted to like this place since it is local & atmosphere is nice.  But food and service are absolutely horrible.  Food is tasteless and overpriced.  Service is awful, inattentive & careless.  Stay away & go to other Italian options in the area which are significantly better.
