My partner and I spent a week in NYC in late May this year.  The Ear Inn was the first place we went for a drink after getting in to our B&B in Canal Street.  Michael made us feel right at home from the moment we arrived.  After a 20 hour flight from Melbourne it was great to be somewhere we felt comfortable in.  We made it our local and over the week we were in NYC we went plenty of times.  Its a cool relaxed bar with great Jazz, good food and a terrific attitude. Not to be missed.
