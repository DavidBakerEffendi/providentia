La Fonda is the one and only place I usually hit in Hartford for Colombian food; I've tried a lot of places, and frankly, this has the best food. The service is friendly and fast, the wait-staff speak both English and Spanish, and the food is excellent. I usually always get the bandeja montañera, (which is a heart attack on a plate, but I love it) as well as batido de guanábana (sour-sop shake; get the milk-based one, it's richer). The only issue I would say is parking and sometimes the music is a bit loud, but all in all, this place is worth your time. I've taken my folks there, and they've gotten fish dishes usually (which I've tried off of their plates!), and these as well were delicious. I would recommend this place both to newcomers as well as those who already love Colombian food.
