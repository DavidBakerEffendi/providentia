I love French food and I'm always looking for a new place to try. When I visited NYC and tried La Sirene, I was completely blown away by the food and the experience. First, the food was incredible and tasted like real French food. Second, the waiting staff was very friendly and didn't bother you for the sake of asking you questions. Finally, it's BYOB. It's rare that you can enjoy good French food in NYC with your own wine (usually you can have one but not the other). Â  Since my first visit, every time I visit NYC, I tried to visit La Sirene. Keep up the good work!
