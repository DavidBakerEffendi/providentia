LOVE this place. my good friend i visit in philly laughs how every time i'm in town i insist on going to la viola.  it's become tradition. great food, great service, and BYOB!  although my default dish is the lobster ravioli, i've had plenty of pasta dishes there that i've loved. can't go wrong ordering what's on special either.  excellent salads, grilled calamari appetizer, and espresso.  i'm greeted affectionately every time i show up and everyone i've ever brought here has become an instant fan.  make a reservation and bring lots of wine! (and cash, they don't take credit card)
