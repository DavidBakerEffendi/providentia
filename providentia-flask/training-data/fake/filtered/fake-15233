I went here for brunch and it was just 'ok'.  Nothing to rave about really.  Service was a bit on the slow side and the food was average.  The Mission Fig Crepes were good but a bit light for an entire dish.  The decor is good and the atmosphere is refreshing. All in all a reasonable stop, but if you're looking for something spectacular, I'd find another restaurant.
