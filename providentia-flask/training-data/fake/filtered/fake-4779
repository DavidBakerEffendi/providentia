Came here after work for Happy Hour and it was great!  We got a table on the first floor, which definitely got more crowded and noisy as time went on, but isnt that to be expected?  I couldn't decide what to get so I told the bartender/mixologist (what are we calling them these days?) my spirit of choice and he made me something completely delicious!  Cool, chill bar that I will almost certainly be back to.
