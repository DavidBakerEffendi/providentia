After enjoying a truly delicious dinner at  Ralph's last April, my husband and I decided to have our May 31st wedding catered by Ralph's. We couldn't have been happier with our decision.   Pat and Joe provided excellent service and delicious food. All our guests commented to us on how fantastic the food was.  We really enjoyed the salmon and Chicken Francese.  Pat worked with us on the menu and even prepared a ham for our Irish guests. Joe and Pat's attention to small details made our day more relaxing and enjoyable, we didn't have to worry about anything. We still love going to Ralph's for dinner and are never let down by their food or service.
