I attended the event that Jillian mentioned in her review.  It was great!  I've been to Halvorson's Upstreet Cafe many times for a quick bite to eat and I've always been satisfied with both the food and the service.  I was even more pleased with the service at this event.  The waitress was wonderful, I'm sure if I was her I would have forgotten who ordered what drink, but she was great, and fast!  The atmosphere was perfect for the occasion.  I never knew they had that back room.  The atmosphere was similar to some of the eclectic cafes I've been to in New York City.
