I don't think I ordered the right dishes. The scallops appetizer was really not so good -- they looked like they were supposed to be ceviche style (?) but it was warm; the pancetta pieces were tasty though. The calamari pizza was pretty good. I also got another dish that was forgettable. Everything was just alright to me. Even the bread they give you was just okay. But the staff was very nice and accommodating. Maybe go back for a second try. It was so busy and crowded in there, there must be good dishes that I should have ordered.
