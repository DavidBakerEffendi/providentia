Excellent Gluten Free pizza.  Beer. Cookies.  AND did I mention the breadsticks?  Wow. I have not had breadsticks like that since I went GF about 5 years ago.   The great thing about RIsotteria is that they have regular pizza as well so I can go and get my gluten free fix and enjoy it with a friend.
