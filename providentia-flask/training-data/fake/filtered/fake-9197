I went in a group of four on the recommendation from a friend. Overall, the food was ok but not great, but maybe I ordered the wrong things. Atmosphere was typical Asian restaurant...a little on the nice side. Service was good. We were a slow table and they let us take our time. It might've been frustrating if we were in a hurry. They also left a pitcher of water on the table which I prefer. Food was hit or miss. We got the thousand layer thing which was great. I got the mango shrimp which was WAY too sweet. I tried some of the dishes of my friends and they were good but nothing mind-blowing. Overall a decent experience. I would come back if someone else wants to go, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
