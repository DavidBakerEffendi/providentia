Had dinner (or rather, attempted to have dinner) here last night with co-workers after highly recommending this restaurant.  Have to say it was the worst dining out experience I've ever had.  Our party of 10 waited over an hour at the table for our first drinks to arrive and it just went downhill from there.  No bread or water on the table for another half hour, and then incorrect appetizer orders, which the waitress blamed us for.  When dinner finally arrived (an hour after the appetizers) , three of our party had already left and another 3 left during dinner because of the poor food quality.   The only positive comment I can make is that the manager was very apologetic, but only after we demanded to speak to him about what was going on.  The meal was comped, but only four out of ten actually ate it, three of whom left the restaurant feeling ill.
