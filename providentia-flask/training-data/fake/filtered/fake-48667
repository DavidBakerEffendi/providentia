Can get crowded and loud, but the food is solid and hits the spot - and is especially convenient if you're in the neighborhood waiting for a broadway show. Definitely recommend the plantain chips and yucca fries (you can get half & half) served with a generous helping of guacamole. I'm also a big fan of their caramel, fig, & cheese dessert empanada. DELICIOUS.
