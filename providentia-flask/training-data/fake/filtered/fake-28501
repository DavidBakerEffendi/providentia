My favorite place in forest hills I find myself going back on an almost weekly basis.  The rotation of food trucks in the parking lot, live music (often), friendly bartenders, and that I can bring my dog keep me coming back.  The ridiculously comfortable leather bar stools are also pretty great. I am a big fan of just about everything I've tried from Station house but my favorite has to be the German Reference pale ale.  I look forward to my next pint.
