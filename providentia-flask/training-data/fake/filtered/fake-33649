Horrible service! I went in early at 6 to reserve a table for 15. When the whole party came at 8 they wanted me to wait another hour! Ive already waited 2 hours and they wanted me to wait another hour?!?! Spoke to the manager and she was very disrespectful and rude to my entire party. I dont recomend this place to anyone looking to come with a large party.
