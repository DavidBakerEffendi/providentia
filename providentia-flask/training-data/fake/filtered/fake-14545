I have had dinner and lunch at this new eatery in Hanover.  I am going back next Tues for dinner again. I really liked the food...taste and quality of ingredients, as well as that they cook to order. That is a plus UNLESS you are attending a concert, play, or movie at the College and was hoping to have time for dessert, as well an appetizer and main course. Even getting there at 5:15 it was tight to get across the street to the 7pm concert- I had to forgo trying dessert. I did have the Chia pudding another time and really liked it, though I could have handled it a tad less sweet.  Good Chi tea, but again, just an itsy bitsy tad too sweeter than optimal for me, but I would order again. I have had 2 of the soups and loved both of them...the spicy red one and the lentil. (I can't remember the name of the spicy red one- it is the 1st listed under soups). The Moo Moo that I chose was spinach paneer. I would like to get Moo Moos again, though I would rather have fewer dumplings on the plate with each having more filling in them. That way, same amount of filling, but with less starch.  The spicing is fantastic, so flavorful. I did not want a burning tongue to overpower flavor so I started with a 6 for heat. The next visit I went for an 8.  I think that is what I would stay with. Friend asked for 10 and I tried it. Still did have flavor but, for me, if I have really burning taste buds it diminishes the pleasure. I have had better goat in Mpls--it was more tender, but I did like the flavor of the curry a lot. Such friendly owners who really have a high standard for what they serve. There are many things I will try in the coming months. How great it is to have a yummy new ethic restaurant that is also of such good quality.
