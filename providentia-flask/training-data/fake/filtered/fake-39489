We just absolutely adore this place. The staff is always welcoming and warm. The freebies are great. Even if they didnt have the freebies I'd still go there! The food is always fresh. Portions are very generous, and prices are extremely reasonable. We never spend more than $60, but we have spent $40, and been very content. When we spend $60, I mean, we reaaally pig out. For 2 people, I'd say it's a score. We recently moved out of the area, and still drive the 1hr 15min's just to go there. Love it. If you're ever in the Rutherford area, this is a definate must! :)
