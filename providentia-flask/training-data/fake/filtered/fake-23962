After a long time I have been to an Indian restaurant that was clean with great/fresh/tasty food. I had "vada-pav" (the way it should be), Kati-roll (best I have ever tested) and pani-puri too was excellent. A good variety in menu and I definitely plan to try most if not all one by one :). Service was courteous and owner was very pleasant. All n all a wonderful dining experience, definitely make the trip !!
