Unique style of pizza. Not like NY, I put citypizza in its own category when discussing pizza places... I believe the people who own the place are from Jordan. Very nice people. There are two crowds of people with city pizza, the people who love it and the people who hate it. I enjoy it as the cheese and sauce combination is good. Again, I don't compare this to NY style pizza places cause its not that type of pizza. Give it a try. Also, I have ordered their BLTs and find them to be tasty.
