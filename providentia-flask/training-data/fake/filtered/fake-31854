I dined at Calle Ocho last evening. We reserved a table for 10 women. We had a fixed priced menu that was supposed to include wine, beer and sagria. We were never asked for drink orders and had to actually point to our specially-designed menu that they were included. We did eventually get two pitchers of sangria, but we the red was never refilled and the white only twice. The wait staff was rude - from the waiter at the bar to our server at the table. The food was very average too. I do not understand the allure of this place.
