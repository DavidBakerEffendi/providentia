As both my wife and like Mexican food we chose Mexicali to go out for her birthday. Even though a previous visit was not so good , we went thinking that the mistakes with our order was a one time only happening.    Wrong !   We were seated quickly and our order wings came with the wrong sauce, no big deal. But when our meals came Mine was a mouth burning load of salt.!  I looked for our waiter and he was now seated at the bar with a beer in hand. So i got the attention of the next passing waitress,she asked if it was the meat or the sauce that was too salty, I could not say as there was so much salt, as much as someone dumping an open shaker on the food.I reordered a different dish.Soon she came back and said a New person made the sauce and put too much salt in it.  When my second dish arrived my wife was done her meal so i asked to have mine wrapped along with the remaining wings.Although the wings were not the package when we got home.I paid full price and gave a tip to the new waitress as the original waiter never returned.  On our previous visit my wives dish was badly over seasoned, as she is of Spanish decent and have been to her home country many times i have to agree with her.   PS. And about the attire of the most humble of restaurants in Mexico do not dress in warn jeans and black tee shirts. Black tee's hmmm, maybe a biker bar wannbe.
