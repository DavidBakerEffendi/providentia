I live in the area and have always wanted to try Suppa. Neat menu all the time, so we went here for Brunch today and it was awesome! The brunch menu is great and reasonably priced. The food was delicious and our server was great as well, Joe, maybe his name? We will return for this menu. Great classic food here. This is a great newer spot in Northern Liberties and I think more people should get there fast!
