kudos to the staff/owners for being open on the evening of Irene. altogether an excellent meal. the salad was great, and the burger ranks among the 3 best in park slope. great ambience. i would be shocked if this place does not succeed, despite its slightly less-trafficed location on Union. nicely done.
