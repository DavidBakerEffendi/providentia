A group of us were taken here for a fast bite before our business meeting and we all loved our food. The staff was so friendly and helped us with our selections. The Sherri special and the Scott Louis were a hit! Â I'm a New Yorker and I eat out often, and I wish we had a Wrap Shack that makes such fresh food.
