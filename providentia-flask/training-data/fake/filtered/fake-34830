do yourself a favor, don't bother going to this establishment.  very unwelcoming, dingy, dark and definitely not worth the money they charge.  MOST IMPORTANT IS THE MANAGER jean michel THAT IS COMPLETELY OBNOXIOUS!  if you want to have a miserable experience go...if not then stay home.  you'll be better off.
