So I went here a week ago with my cousin and visitors from out of state. Overall, I can say we had a near terrible experience. It felt very dirty and the hospitality was horrendous. We had approximately 4 different wait staff of which 3 were extremely loud. We had some difficulty in receiving a straw from the wait staff. In addition, I felt very rushed when it came to taking my order. Our orders came at substantially different times. When my order did come, the waiter seemed to have forgotten what I had. I ordered pan friend noodles which the waiter brought but called it lo mien. I had questioned him and he quickly corrected himself abruptly. To my understanding the fried rice was good and the lobster was outstanding. However, my pan fried noodles I felt were terrible. This was definitely the first and last time we visit.
