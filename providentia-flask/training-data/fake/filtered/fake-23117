I attempted to use a PNC Bank Gift Debit card at Varelli last Friday evening. I was cautioned by the server that the Bank (PNC) would take 10% of the cash from the debit card as a fee of some sort. Thus I did not use the debit card. I called my son-in-law, who is a VP at PNC as he and my daughter gave me the debit card as a Christmas Gift. My SIL advised that PNC DOES NOT take 10% of the cash from a debit card when a bill is paid using the card. I called Varelli today, 2/5/14, and asked for an explanation. I was given a royal run around and the person who I spoke with (I had asked to speak with the Manager) could not explain why 10% would be taken from the debit card, and the person hung up the phone on me. I want a full explanation as to why the server advised me not to use the debit card. BTW, I then proceeded to use my own personal BoA debit card to pay the bill in full (including the tip), yet there was no fee nor assessment taken from my personal debit card. BTW, I then used the PNC debit card at WAWA and the full amount of the card was used for the purchase with no fee taken.
