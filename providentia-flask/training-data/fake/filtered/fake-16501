Toast of the town! My favorite new place on smith street. Fun neighborhood feel with a unique and tasty menu at a reasonable price. Make sure to order the toast of the day as an appetizer or snack at the bar, you won't regret it. If you're looking for a low key bar Hunter's is open late and draws an attractive young crowd.
