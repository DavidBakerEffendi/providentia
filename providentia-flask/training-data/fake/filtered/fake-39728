everything about this place was great, the restaurant itself is beautiful and very unique I like how the drinks were served in cool little mason jars with homemade toothpicks made out of strands of wicker.they have very interesting appetizers along with small vegetable dishes and an assortment of cheese plates to choose from. We chose to get the secret stash cheese plate which is an assortment of five cheeses and meats that the chef chooses and they were all incredible, every single cheese was described to us in great detail by our server who was incredibly knowledgeable about every single food item it really seems like the kitchen staff make sure that the servers know exactly what they are talking about. we also received a gift from the chef they were caramelized onion rolls with sage butter on top and I actually couldn't believe how good they were I was so impresses by this roll it blew my mind. we also had an amazing appetizer which was smoked Applewood sausage with a delicious cooked cabbage and with some kind of sauce to go with it. I have to be honest almost every dish on the menu had one or two ingredients that I had never heard of however everything was so good that I just put my trust into the chef and it was definitely a good choice. Our entrees were amazingand all the portion sizes are just right, they are not too small as to where you feel ripped off but not too big so you can order several different things and really enjoy everything and not ruin your appetite. The desserts were also incredible my girlfriend had a lemon pudding cake and I had the cookie collection although they were both very small the portion size was perfect because we were both already full but we were so glad we chose the dessert. The ambiance in this restaurant is great it is a great place to bring somebody on a date or a romantic evening. I have told many people about my visit and I plan to tell more! A+!! I will definitely return here in the summer for the outdoor seating
