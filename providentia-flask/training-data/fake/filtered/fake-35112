Ok so this place only accepts cash, big deal. The cost of a meal for two will only set you back $20-$30 so make sure you have a few bucks in your wallet when you go. Any of the bad reviews of this place in my opinion are ridiculous. The food is always fresh, the Pho is delicious and will warm you up on a cold day. The Vietnamese egg rolls with lettuce are one of my favorite treats to eat. (are they gourmet, mouth watering delicacies? No, but this is simple asian street food presented in a comfortable clean place - so take your expectations down a notch). Also I have always found the service to be very friendly and attentive. I cannot give it 5 stars because I have never had Pho in Vietnam so it may not be the best in the world. It is the best in Central Jersey though.
