We have eaten at Doma many times and have never had the experience we did last night.  The noise level was unbearable not only for patrons but also for the staff, who were clearly rattled by the sound level.   The entire half side of the restaurant was a group of the loudest women on the planet, and sadly the staff was not able or willing to ask them to tone it down, as once at Umai when the chef came forward and requested a table of four to cool it.  A restaurant builds and keeps it's reputation not only by its food (which my one star does not reflect) and service but also for the ambiance and most people do not go to a Japanese restaurant expecting a chuckie e cheese evening. Yes it does say it's not good for groups and ultimately it's up to the restaurant to hold to what they aspire to be.
