I usually go to the Burrito Bar early, before it gets too crowded. I love their frozen margaritas and sangrias. They should bottle and sell their salsa. Great fajitas, quesadillas, and chili. Their Baby Burgers taste like mini steaks. The bar and some tables are downstairs, with a second floor for dinners and parties. (second floor usually opens around 4 PM.) Nice staff. Reasonably priced. Hippie-themed. Good music downstairs. Â LUV it! They now have tables outside. (May 2010)
