I went last week for lunch and it was so sensational that I decided to take my family back for a birthday celebration 4 days later!  Pretty much everything we had was sublime and I don't say that often.  The lamb meatball sliders are wonderful (get 2 orders because one is not enough) as are the crostini and the fritto misto.  The highlight of the meal- or I guess one highlight- was the pasta, gigantic in size, with a duck ragout on it.  wow.  everyone also enjoyed the pasta with the wild game sauce and the penne with sausage.  the scallops on a bed of lentils are fantastic also.  We shared the garlic chicken for two, really just a plain roasted chicken au jus with garlic that is delicious but not as exciting as the other dishes.  For dessert we had the semifreddo and the maple custard; both were excellent.   I will be back.
