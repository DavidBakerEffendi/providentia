The Red Stone Tavern next to Fuddruckers seems to be the Sonoma Chicken Coop Â re-launched under a new name. Smart idea since it does have a very nice bar area and I think a lot of people just thought if was fast food like Fudds. The food menu looks like the old menu to me, even using the name Sonoma as part of some dish names. In spite of that, the food was very good. I have salmon over risotto. The fish was very fresh and the risotto was very tasty with lots of vegetables in it. My husband had roasted chicken that he thoroughly enjoyed. The staff was very attentive and personable. The prices were reasonable. We definitely will be back
