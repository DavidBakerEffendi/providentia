The food is amazing, the location is great and the decor is just beautiful! The only problem is the Russian staff: extremely pushy to order more, very rude and loud!! I've been at the restaurant first time when it just opened and everything was great, however, the last time i stopped by for dinner, the atmosphere completely changed. The staff was all Russian and spoke very poorly and unwillingly English. Further, the bartender girl had audacity to strike a very politically oriented conversation while serving drink, trashing US and promoting Russia, and complaining how demeaning its for her to work in Ukrainian restaurant for a ukrainian owner. In addition, our waiter Alex was pushing us to keep order food that we ended up leaving without finishing our dinner. I hope whoever is the owner will change the staff so it doesn't turn to your typical russian restaurant.
