Thanksgiving Dinner at Kim's! Omg, so much food and all spectacular. It's BYOB, so we brought some smooth Malbec - add that to the crudit√©s, gumbo, beef ribs, yams, string beans, fried corn, stuffing I ordered and now they're trying to cram pies and cakes down my throat. So, so good! And everyone is so friendly - it's better than being at home! Think I'm gonna order a whole cake to bring home. Mmmm.
