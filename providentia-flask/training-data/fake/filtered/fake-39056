Stopped Â with tourist friends as we wanted a quick lunch. What a mistake, seafood platter was over fried and served on a mess of chopped iceberg hearts shreds. Caesar salad was made of cheap greens that tasted awful and then my daughter was asked "what kind of dressing do you want for that Caesar salad". we muddled through as the other two meals we ordered were edible. Then my daughter ordered blueberry pie a la mode. It came to the table and thank heaven the waiter placed it in front of me first ...the top of the pie was covered with mold.. yes mold. I called over the manager and she said "oh I am so sorry" and walked away. You could not PAY me to eat there again. (and yes we have a picture)
