The food is OK, Nothing spectacular.  The reason why Pio Pio Riko gets  one star is because the service is HORRIBLE!!!! I placed an order for delivery and not only did take a 1 hour and 30 minutes to arrive, but when it did arrive I had only recieved half of what was already charged o my credit card. When I called back to notify them that my order was incomplete they assured me that they would return with my complete order. They did return. Only this time they took another hour and 45 Minutes to come back with my completed order. I was a regular at this restaurant but after today I dont think I will be ordering or eating from there again. IF YOU DONT SPEAK SPANISH YOU COULD FORGET ABOUT GOOD SERVICE AT THIS RESTAURANT!
