Sorry Pies N Thighs, I must give you this poor review because of your poor customer service. The story... Vegetarian goes along with large group of Â friends to soul food restaurant. Vegetarian is cool with this because she can order many sides which can be very satisfying. Friend of vegetarian places large order for entire group. Soul food restaurant says they are out of like half the sides, including a couple of things the vegetarian ordered. Friend placing the order thinks quickly as nice counter guy is stressed and needs the line to move quickly, and orders potato salad and cole slaw. Three minutes later friend tells vegetarian about potato salad and cole slaw and quickly learns of he vegetarian's aversion to mayo. Vegetarian talks to counter guy six minutes after placing order about changing mayo flooded foods to practically anything else- restaurant simply says, "NO, there is nothing we can do." Ahem. Really? Even in the sides were already in their little containers, they hadn't left the kitchen, they certainly could have been returned to thee giant food vats or sold to someone else in ten minutes I'm sure. Jeez, it's not like I was asking to change an already made sandwich. Thanks for making this experience so poor. The only reason I gave two stars was because the mac n cheese was good enough, and the very sweet shy counter guy that was forced to tell me "NO" by some other cook or manager woman... was so nice.
