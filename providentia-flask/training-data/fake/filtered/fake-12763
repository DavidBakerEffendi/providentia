I would of liked to have like this place but the service was horrible. When we got inside we liked the way it looked. We waited at the bar to be seated. The bartender never gave us drinks because he was to busy talking to some lady. We finally got seated to get a nasty waitress annoyed to serve. I believe if you don't have good customer skills don't get into a job where you have to work with people. Come on use your brains. I would say Ill give it another shot but Ill be lying.
