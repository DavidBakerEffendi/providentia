The food is great but the serivce not so great.  I have had dinner here multiple times and always enjoyed it. I heard from a friend that they have really great burgers so a few of us went in to try.  It was the day after St. Patrick's day we were nurshing hangovers and only drinking water.  When we ordered burgers the waiter looked annoyed and then completely ignored us for the remainder of the evening.  We had to go up to the bar and grab another bottle of water after waiting 20 minutes for a refill.  He didn't even stop by to see if we were enjoying the food.  Another server delivered the food and the hostess dropped the check.  It killed me to leave him a tip.
