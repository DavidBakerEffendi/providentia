I've wanted to try this place for a while and finally was able to have lunch there yesterday.  Absolutely delicious! The restaurant is small, rustic and perfectly cozy for a cold day. I started with the squash and apple soup (a special) which was so thick and creamy and amazing. It was a large portion and definitely filled me up. My brother had the pasta fagiole soup which looked hearty and was served with a wonderful piece of garlic toast. We then split a slice of the vodka pizza which was thin crust and just really fresh tasting. Perfection. I then had the octopus salad which was a nicoise type salad with grilled octopus, olives and potatoes - very good.  My brother had the chicken francaise panini which was decadent to say the least.  It's very rich but the field greens salad that's served with it is a nice balance.  We were so full that we didn't save room for dessert. A great neighborhood spot and we'll definitely be back!
