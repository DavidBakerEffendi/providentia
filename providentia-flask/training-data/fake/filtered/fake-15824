Celebrating my Birthday with Junior's Classic Strawberry Cheesecake was probably the best part of visiting New York...Junior's is a treat for anyone who goes.  Although I have never eaten there, I have ordered plenty of cheesecake from their side shop to go.  It is certainly a classic must do when in NY and I would highly recommend the classic Cheesecake with real strawberries!  Alas, I wanted to take this home to share with my family across the US but before I could do so, it was eaten.....For these reasons I would say that Juniors is deserving of a 8.5/10 for Cheesecakes!   windoweating.tumblr.com/…
