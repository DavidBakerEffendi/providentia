Excellent for breakfast and lunch!! I stumbled across Cafe Ole one hectic morning in between client appointments. I really just needed Wifi access because for some reason Startbucks was closed. I only ordered a latte and a banana to justify my internet use, but the coffee and friendly service were exceptional! I noticed other diners enjoying pancakes and eggs, which looked delicious! My second trip was during another hectic work day. I had only 20 minutes to order and eat so I opted to order something pre-made in refrigerated display. My choice: Spinach Salad--baby spinach, a generous portion of goat cheese, walnuts, and dried cranberries with the most delicious pesto dressing on the side. I never eat dressing but this was actually house made pesto! Soooo good with the goat cheese! I should also mention that by the time it was my turn to order, all the Spinach Salads had been taken. I asked how long it would be...they said 3 minutes. I was nervous to take the chance since I was in such a time crunch, but in less than 3 minutes I was happily eating my amazing salad! I have been craving it ever since!
