Let me start with I've only every had their delivery... that being said, they're super fast, super nice, and super DELICIOUS!  The vodka pie is honestly amazing.  A little too good, like, "I'm already really full, but I should probably have just one more slice," good.  A large isn't a "huge" pie, but with how good it is take that as a saving grace!  I definitely recommend :)
