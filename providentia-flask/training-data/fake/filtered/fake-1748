I can't tell you how much I hate trekking to Brooklyn from Manhattan.  If this were in the city I'd be there every week!  My cousin drove in from the Poconos to try this place on my recommendation & she said it was worth the drive!  It's just a hole in the wall kind of place & sometimes has a little wait.  I LOVE the chicken biscuit and its quite small in size but the taste leaves you wanting more!  The food is rather filling so don't eat too much - you definitely need to leave room for some pie!
