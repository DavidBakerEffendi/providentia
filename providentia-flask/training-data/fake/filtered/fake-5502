Astoria has many great bars and this one really tops the cake!  I recently had my 30th Birthday here and they were very accomodating of my large party and loud friends and provided impecable, accurate, and quick service!  Our server Mika (sp?) was fantastic and the bar manager Mike really helped make it a smooth and special event.   In terms of food and drinks it is not possible to go wrong here.  EVERYTHING on the menu is amazing and they infuse their own liquors to add a flavor punch to many cocktails.  I love a place that takes the time to really understand the type of drinks they are selling and not just mix something crazy up.  They clearly do their research and taste testing well and make some GREAT drinks.   Last but not least the beer selection is truly devine and this time of year, with the fall beers coming up and the cooler weather to,  combined with Sweet Afton's rustic decorum makes this the perfect fall drinking spot (and all seasons really). Thank you Sweet Afton!
