Ok, I love Risotto, and I am picky. This place was amazing! It's a tiny restaurant where they have to move tables out of the way for you to get in to your seat, and you have to wait an hour to ninety minutes to get in at night, but it is worth any inconvience! We split the pizza and risotto, to try everything they had. Both were delicious! They have fun toppings for the pizza and delicious additives to the risotto. The breadsticks were amazing too! All of these were gluten free! At the end we tried this gluten free apple pie, which was a delicious finish to our meal! We also enjoyed that they had a wine of the day that was priced so well you couldn't say no to adding a bottle to the order. The waitstaff was friendly and the decor was nothing special, but the closeness of you and the person you are with in the restaurant makes it a cute date place! We plan to go here every time we are in NYC. That is how good it was.
