So after a few attempts to eat here, during peak breakfast/brunch hours, I finally made it inside....hip hip hooray!!!! Right? Nope, not much to celebrate about. I ordered challah french toast, potatoes, fried eggs & bacon. I think the French toast was over cooked bc it was dry & tasteless thank God for the cinnamon, powered sugar & syrup. If blindfolded I would have had no idea what it was that I was eating. The potatoes were ok as were the eggs, but the pork bacon was to die for!!!! The best bacon I've had in a very long time. Oh & the coffee taste like I smoked a cigarette & I'm a non smoker.... My date ordered the Foccacia Breakfast sandwich which she enjoyed & I must admit looked quite tasty. Maybe it's just me, or maybe the cook was having a bad day but overall I did not enjoy the food here BUT I'm willing to give it another try in the future. According to the other Yelp reviews the food here rocks & that was one of the many reasons I wanted to eat here
