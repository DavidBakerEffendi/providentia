I am sorry to say, it is really bad, I am from the area and i feel bad about this place but it was just terrible. I heard that they changed the chef , maybe that's why it was bad. Well, i went there late night, around midnight. I had a craving for turkey dinner. Well i got there and it was pretty quiet, service was good though. Well i got the turkey dinner with gravy, stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce and pickled beets. It looked good coming, but when i started to eat, right away i knew the turkey was bad, it didn't smell right. Me as a chef, i don't really like to send food back, but this was a different story. Well i said OK, maybe it will get better, well i tried the pickled beets, well they were sour, went bad. Then i tried the gravy, it was terrible, it looked like they thickened up with bread and was lumpy and tasted like sh... even the mash potatoes were bad. Well the server came over and asked if everything was OK, well i had to say no and told her about the beets and the turkey and the gravy. I then asked for just a grill cheese instead and that was just OK. Sorry but it was terrible, i actually went back again, because i thought maybe it was a 1 time thing and i was wrong, i ordered the pork chops and they were dry and tough like a piece of leather would stay away...sad, because they were good at one time.
