I can't argue with the reviews about the food---it is spectacular!!! But I think success has gone to their head and now, at times, you can expect attitude--particularly when it's busy. From what was once noted for an atmosphere of warmth and charm, unique for an Â UES eatery, Heidi's has turned into a "Well this is how it is at Heidi's" tone. In the past you could expect to see owner's Chis and Heidi welcoming you and saying hello. But nowadays, all too often they are nowhere to be seen; and the staff doesn't express the same desire to please that was such a genuine part of Heidi's House's roots. As Heidi's grapples with success, I hope they can recapture the feeling and atmosphere they once had; Unfortunately, success on the UES does not depend on such things and being "Trendy" may be all that matters. Best of luck in the future
