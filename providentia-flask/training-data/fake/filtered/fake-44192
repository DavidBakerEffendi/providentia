What an AMAZING place to sit, eat, and enjoy great quality coffee with an excellent service! We go to Cafe Fulya every sunday since we "discovered" it. We like it especially on Sunday because we get the BEST costumer service! The food is exceptional, they are very quick to serve, and the prices are more than reasonable.
