Can't get better coffee then this ... just can't this is IT!!! The very best coffee in all of NYC. Cafe con Leche, (coffee with steamed milk), this is the stuff!!! Â I have actually driven from Jersey City just to come and get a cup of this coffee, actually I would grab two it was a long drive back to grab my second cup. When I am in NYC breakfast must is a buttered roll and a Cafe con Leche. I love the atmosphere, the help is always quick, and friendly, if you go in often they know you. Try the rice and beans with baked chicken its a meal that will fill you, and give you energy enough to get through another long week, or be your weekend yum yum meal. I am so glad this place has stood the test of time. I first went to La Taza De Oro in about 1990, and it never changes, and I hope it never will!
