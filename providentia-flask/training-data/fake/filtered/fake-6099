Yesterday was my second time at Obao. Me and my friend got a table really quick, but i will recomend having a reservation especially during dinner time.. because it gets full. Yesterday i was in a rush and only had 45 minutes to eat and leave. I told our server that we had to leave quick and we ordered our meal .. i was suprised when our food arrived so quick. It is good to inform your personal server that your in a rush. My favorites is beef luklak and kalbi short ribs
