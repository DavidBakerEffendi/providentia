Yesterday we had an absolutely delightful lunch at Bistro Petit. The moment you walk in you are made to feel welcome by Chef Park and his staff. Once we made our food choices, Chef Park gave us some details about the fresh ingredients he would be using. Seated at the counter we had a view into the kitchen and watched as he thoughtfully prepared our meal. We shared a Kobe burger and the kimchi bouillabaisse which were delicious. There was also freshly squeezed orange juice, hand cut french fries and home made ketchup. Lastly we sampled some home made donuts. They were light and the perfect end to our meal. This place may be small but Â the food is wonderful so don't pass it by.
