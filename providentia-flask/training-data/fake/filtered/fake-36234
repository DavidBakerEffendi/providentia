Came here with Â large group and they were able to accommodate us! I ordered the salmon with mushroom risotto which was awesome. Reasonably priced for NYC except the wine. I don't really understand how a beer could be $7 a mixed drink is $12 and a glass of wine comes out to $15! However, everyone enjoyed their meal and location and atmosphere were both very nice! Would definitely recommend.
