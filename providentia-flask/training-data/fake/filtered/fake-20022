I love everything in here!!! They have really special decor Oh and their food, we order the pork bun which is really good, and the pai tai noodle, taste a little different form home made ones but not bad, really special. It's a little pricy but compare with the food and the atmosphere in here, I would say it worth it! In all, 5 star!
