2 stars because with low airfares these days, it would have been cheaper to fly to Texas to have what I had in Butcher Bar.I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and for 10.99 i received an anemic,dry, under flavored pull pork sandwich. this place needs to be in the trust fund section of town where people can afford to pay so much for so little.
