First things first: The food was delicious! I was here yesterday for lunch and I ordered the roasted potato/green bean/yellow beans and eggs with toast and it was so good. The potatoes were nice and crispy on the outside and creamy in the middle and the vegetables were cooked but still had a good crunch! And the eggs were just right! It's an open kitchen so you can watch the cook make your food for you and it's so interesting and fun to see. Secondly: The coffee was amazing. I ordered a latte and it was perfect and foamy and delicious and creamy and the best I've had in a long long time! I won't be able to go back to Starbucks after this... Thirdly: The service and environment was really pleasant. The decor was very hipster-ish. My favorite thing about my meal (aside from the food and drinks of course!) was just the general feel of the place. It was really homey and comfortable and not at all pretentious or anything. And I really enjoyed the fact that the staff at this place (the server, the cook, and the coffee girl) were interacting so well and so funny! It was like they were just three friends who decided to open a coffee bar/restaurant together. They were all super friendly to me and I couldn't help but eavesdrop on their conversations and their singing.
