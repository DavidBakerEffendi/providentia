The place is awesome....such friendly service and great food! The  mussels to start off was a great choice and the steak was so tender...was able to use a butter knife.  The place was packed, but not difficult to get a drink at all. The waitress was very on top of the table and always had a smile. We had a party of 11 and we all agreed that it was amazing! I will be back very soon!
