We went there yesterday (first time), the hostess ( with was 3 of them) was using Ipad to check people in asked for name and phone numbers, says that it would be 20 minutes waiting time. So, in order not to be in their way ( when their server come out with big trays) we told them. We are going to get a drink and waiting in the bar area. They say it would be just fine since the next client name announcement is loud. So after 25 minutes they say my husband's name and we walk there, just to hear that they just have seated that party. What? She keeping asking our numbers and them says that she did not remember if we gave her the number. And one of them says. I am the manager.. we do not have you here.. bla bla bla.. we'll seat you soon.. We was like.. Well I guess we are going to pass it. Why lose our time if they can not even checking people correctly?
