Yum! Love the tostones appetizer and the sangria.  Fun place, great music, and awesome food.  Get there early as it is a tiny little gem of a restaurant...not much seating but very charming. The menu is extensive. I came for dinner and fell in love with the food.  Eat here and you will want to visit Cuba!
