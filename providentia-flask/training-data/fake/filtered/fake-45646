This is a must-try!! If you're looking for some delicious Thai cuisine I would definitely recommend going here. Them menu is large with many choices for everyone (including many vegetarian choices for people like me). My husband and I decided to start out with the shrimp summer rolls and the grilled corn with coconut milk. Both were delicious, but the grilled cored was amazing and I noticed this dish is only offered in the summer so everybody needs to go try it! For our entrees I went with the Drunken Noodles with tofu-the noodles were cooked with just the right amount of spice and the tofu didn't have that rubbery-texture that it can sometimes get. It was perfect! My husband went with the Papaya flounder seasonal special which was a pan seared flounder with papaya salad. The presentation of this dish was beautiful, and my husband seemed to really enjoy the flounder. The service was professional and fast. Also, we went on a monday night so the wine bottles were 1/2 off!!! Such a great deal. I will definitely be back to dine-in and also grab take out. Overall a great experience.
