I often hate recommending restaurants to coworkers and friends, I always fear they may not feel the same way I do about places. That has all changed. Thank You Garces Trading Co:  I have full confidence I can recommend you to anyone and they will enjoy it.  The energy is great, the food is always amazing, and a BYO you don't have to plan a trip to the wine store before hand? Genius!   Lunch or dinner, this place is great.  I have come here with big groups where we sat for hours without one dirty look from the waitstaff and I have brought my family for a quick lunch that was equally amazing.  This place never fails!
