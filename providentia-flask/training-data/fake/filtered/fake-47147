Let me start off by saying that if I could give this restaurant 0 stars, I would. With that said, I came here on a Thursday evening, by myself. I travel constantly & thought this placed looked intriguing. Being from NYC, I have quite a defined pallet, but not picky when it comes to good food. Chicken especially. Never, in my 35 years of life, have I experienced such putrid food. My appetizers were enjoyable. But my, oh my, was I mistaken when it came to my entree. Kind of humorous that the worst part of my meal, shares a name with the restaurant. Regardless, steer clear of this wretched excuse of a restaurant. Save yourself the $30+ & head to a mcdonalds where I'm sure your dollar menu chicken snack wrap will be more than adequate.
