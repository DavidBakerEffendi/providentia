Not very good. Our burgers were way undercooked and the fried egg was overcooked so the yolk, which our waitress said was the best part, was nonexistent. It was a shame for me because I don't usually eat meat-so I was really looking forward to a good bacon burger. Service was good, although slightly overwhelmed. Good wine, nicer pour. In short, I wouldn't waste my money again.
