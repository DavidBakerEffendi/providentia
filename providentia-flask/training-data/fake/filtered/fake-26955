A friend threw a party for 20 people at the Butcher Bar and it turned out great. The owner and staff went above and beyond to set everything up. All the food was delicious and flavorful. The spicy pork sliders are a new favorite of mine but the roasted suckling pig stole the show. I've never tasted pork this good! I can't overstate how cool the staff were in helping organize and pulling off this fun little event. Everyone was friendly and helpful. This place is a great addition to an already great neighborhood.
