Unlike some posts from 3,000 miles away, I have actually been here a few times and live within driving distance. The food is good, the drinks made with consistency, and the wait staff are very attentive. There is a wait time though, so be prepared. Very popular place. I always tip generously and have no qualms if they post my receipt. It's a testament to one's character, if you catch my drift.
