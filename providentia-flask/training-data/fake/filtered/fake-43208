Stopped in over the weekend with my boyfriend ..I have been begging him to take me there for weeks now and it was well worth it! Our waitress was extremely friendly and we had good conversation with her which made us feel at home and relaxed ..I ordered the stuffed waffle with bacon, egg, and cheddar cheese and my boyfriend ordered the cinnamon waffle with a side of eggs and bacon ..the food was amazing! I'm definitely going back next week ..and it doesn't hurt that the price is within anyone's budget!
