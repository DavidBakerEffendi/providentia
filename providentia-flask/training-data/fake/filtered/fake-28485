I recently went to Acacia on a date due to a recommendation by a friend.  The food and service was excellent.  Our waitress Lauren was extremely friendly and personable and had extensive knowledge of the menu which made our experience that much better.  As far as food, I had the duck which was out of this world.  Also, the ambiance is very quaint and comfortable while still being fancy to allow for a great night out.  I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.
