I went with a big group to Feast last night and we sat on the big table at the back of the restaurant. The decor of the restaurant is stunning and atmosphere of the room is intimate. As we were a group we ordered a "feast" which alternated between pork and salmon. the food was incredible - and there's lots of it so you should be hungry when you arrive! Apart from a salmon overload, and practically rolling out of the restaurant, I totally enjoyed my experience there. The service was really very good - the staff are attentive and make sure to describe each course as they place on the table - Â the service matches the menu prices. It's not cheap but it's certainty worth visiting if you're looking somewhere a little more special than your average East Village restaurant... This has become me new local gem :-)
