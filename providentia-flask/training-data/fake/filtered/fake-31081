I come here often to do work out of the house. I usually hit up cafes cafes that meet a few basic, practical needs so I can zone out and get work done in a place that balances my need to 'be left alone' with my need to 'not feel isolated'. When the cafe first opened a few years ago, a lot of folks prejudged the place as 'pretentious' and complained that non-dairy milk was 'the wrong way to drink brewed coffee'. Which is a statement that sounds pretty pretentious but is more so ironic -- if you are putting milk of any sort into your coffee you are drinking coffee wrong. Dairy or not. (I said it.) And while I'm on the subject, their coffee is delicious enough to drink black. I strongly recommend the Bourbon. The music is always at a reasonable volume. Admittedly, I am already familiar with metal and punk, so the atmosphere doesn't conflict with my tastes, the noise of Coalesce is far less distracting than the sound of a blender going off every 5 minutes in many other cafes throughout the city. The staff doesn't seem to be burnt out on customer service. While the place is frequented by punks, and can be overrun with punks when there is an event in the city, the majority of the regular customers are just construction workers and families from around the neighborhood. The staff knows many of their customers by name and the whole place has a very casual, inviting vibe. I also never, ever, saw a barista recoil from a customer asking for dairy-options. Ever. I often see them apologize, even offer to reimburse customers, if they are unhappy with the non-dairy options. The only conversation I overheard from the staff regarding a customer requesting a dairy-option was a practical way to inform people about the cafe being vegan before they order. So no dirty looks or smack-talk when non-vegan customers make themselves known. It doesn't happen. Just the opposite.
