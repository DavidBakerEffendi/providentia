This is a high end event restaurant,  but when you go in,  it's charming and although formal,  it's not stilted.  We went for my son's birthday and the food was delicious,  the wine excellent (and the  sommelier didn't sneer at me when I had to disclose that I like sweet white wines) and the portions reasonable.   We were feeling quite proud of ourselves but then came desserts.  We definitely should not have ordered 3,  as tiny cookies and chocolates came with the coffee,  and they could have served as dessert by themselves,  and they gave us an extra one 'from the chef'  because it was my son's birthday and portion control went out the window and we ate every sweet morsel.  It was over the top delicious.   I'd definitely go again!
