I was really impressed with my dining experience at Kanella the other night. It's easily one of my favorite restaurants I've tried in Philadelphia, even after just one meal! The atmosphere was, as others have noted, unpretentious. Cozy and simple, but very tasteful. One of the plates I got had a browned sage butter, and I'm fairly sure the sage plant growing on the windowsill next to my chair had contributed the herbs, which was a nice detail. The service was attentive and friendly.. they even turned off the AC when I said I was chilly. It was hard to choose between all the tempting options on the menu! I found the flavors to be absolutely fresh and unique. The manti (lamb dumplings) were far more complex than I expected, spicy and warm, and they reminded both my date and me of something nostalgic that neither of us could place. Â For my main plate I had the pumpkin ravioli. I'm always a little tentative to order a totally vegetarian entree, but the dish definitely rewarded the decision. The sweetness of the pumpkin alongside the savory sauce was just perfect. The mushrooms were sinfully tender, the radicchio was crunchy and flavorful--this is one of those rare cases where the supporting components of the entree are just as good as the entree itself. My boyfriend ordered the lamb kofta which we both enjoyed, as it was tasty and tender.. but we agreed the ravioli was far better. I will say that the dessert platter (baklava, preserved cherries, almond creme, and a fig stuffed with cheese) was not as standout as the appetizers/entrees. One other tip - bring gin for the mint tea/lemonade lemonnana drink - they make a delicious pairing.
