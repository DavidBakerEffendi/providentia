I went because the "restaurant" is part of Shop West Orange. So I saved a few tax bucks. Every time I eat Chinese I order the same thing regardless of restaurant. This way I can compare accurately. General Tso  Chicken, Sesame noodles (cold) and dumplings steamed.  I told them I will pick it up at 5:30pm and they had it ready at exactly that time. Profesional staff, courteous and knowledgeable.  The meal was excellent. Chicken was perfect, and I had real sesame noodles, not peanut butter, but real sesame seeds. The dumplings were vegetables and steamed as I ordered them, and they were very good. But I wold have preferred fried.  No complaints whatsoever, though parking was difficult that Saturday night.  Prof. Phililp K.
