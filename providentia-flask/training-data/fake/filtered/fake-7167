Quality is unreliable. I had an absolutely great croque misure Â here once, next time it wasn't as good. Had a similar experience with the mussels, the first time the chorizo really made an amazing dish. The stout on tap is good. The earl grey creme brulee can be memorable, though the last time I had it, the "custard" was cold. This could be a great place if the experience was consistent, and the food was always at the same level. Having been here four times, there is a great variance on what is good on a particular evening. Again I was blown away by some dishes on some nights. Other nights were just ho hum.
