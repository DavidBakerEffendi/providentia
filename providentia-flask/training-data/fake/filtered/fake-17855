So my brother and I decided to stop in to Joe's for lunch.  The place looks very cool and spacious and the staff are really personable and nice, but the food leaves a lot to be desired.  This place is a one in a medium sized chain of restaurants hence the bowl of fried oysters appearing deeper than it actually was.  The oysters were also obviously from the freezer so the flavor was lackluster to say the least.  My brother ordered a crab cake sandwich and it arrived resembling nothing like a crab cake.  It looked more like bits of yellowy frozen crab bits that have been re-fried in butter and spread over a little portion of the bun.  My fish and chips were greasy as hell and the fish was again, frozen and yellowy.  Is it so hard to serve non frozen food at a seafood place?   Overall I think you are better to keep driving and find another place that puts a little more care into the preparation of their food.
