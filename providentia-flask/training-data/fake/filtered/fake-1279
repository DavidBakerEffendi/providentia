Most Terrible restaurant Â management and OWNER. Don't ever book them for a party they are THIEVES. they literally stole my cousins money. My cousin booked and PAID for a christening party at this restaurant weeks in advance. Sent out invites and so forth. The night before the owner called and canceled the party with no valid emergency or reason and just said I'M SORRY. HE refused to refund my cousin and left her with over a 50 guests to entertain. Luckily Mr Bruno's Italian restaurant saved the day which the food was much better than Bella Roma's , and the service was amazing especially it was less than 24hr. Notice. DONT CATER OR HAVE A PARTY THERE OWNERS ARE THIEVES.
