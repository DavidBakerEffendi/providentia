Stone Parke Café easily became my favorite local restaurant. I was searching for a place to take my fiancée and saw the reviews. It looked nice, fancy, but I didn't quite know what to expect. It was such a wonderful surprise.  We have been back two more time since and have never been let down. In fact, we've booked them to host our wedding reception! The food is amazing! They have a playful style with flavors, but still classic. The butternut squash soup is the best I've ever had.  If I had to pick one word to describe all their meals, "fresh" is the one.  The asparagus was crisp. The chicken was so tender, no knife needed, really.  I have yet to try this short rib hash, so I gotta go get me some. The service was friendly and attentive...and professional. They really make it a point that you enjoy the experience. As a friend of mine put it, waiting tables is a lost art. These days no one is a waiter anymore, rather an actor or aspiring musician who serves eggs. But Stone Park has revived that art.they know when you need them, they know when to give you space, they know what you are looking for, they know what to say.  Simply put, it's a five star meal that you can enjoy as easily as if you were at home.
