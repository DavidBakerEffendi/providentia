I can say that we have been loyal patrons to this place since years. There are fond memories attached to this place! We have our kids Bdays, special events here without any issues whatsoever. The food is out of the world, the staff goes out of the way to make it special. I have not seen the owner but talked to him, very professional & very helpful. All i can say is you get what you pay for, if you are looking for quality & a great time this is the place. These guys know what real punjabi, gujrati & mughlai cuisine is. The banquet is just beautiful & the experience is fantastic. When we had parties the owner on our request made JAIN food for 6 people only.......who is going to do that tell me???
