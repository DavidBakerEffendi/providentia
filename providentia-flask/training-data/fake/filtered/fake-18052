Love Devil's Alley! When I eat here, I always intend to try something new, but I can't escape their buffalo chicken sandwich and fries - so delicious.  The mojitos are tasty. I tried their sangria tonight.  It was flavorful and had a fun medley of fruit on top (though it served more-so as decoration as I didn't have anything to eat the fruit with).  The only downside to this place is, like other reviewers have said, the bathrooms can be kind of icky...
