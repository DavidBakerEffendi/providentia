I recently dined at El Rey and was astonished. The food was amazing (although tapas style, so order for the table!). Great atmosphere, cool artwork, and extremely tasty tequila selection. Our waiter Zach was extremely knowledgable in term of all the food and ingredients and sold my date and I almost every single special that they had that day. He checked on us often to make sure that everything was great (which it was), and made sure we were never lacking a drink. He even succesfully encouraged us to try a shot of tequila ... a kind I have never heard of! Bottom line- Great food, outstanding service. Next time I go back, Im requesting Zach and trying a new tequila :) P.S. The chips are good ... but dont fill up on them!
