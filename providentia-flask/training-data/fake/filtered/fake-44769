This place rocks.  Watermelon fries -- WTF?  (They are so good, who knew?)  The cocktails are served up by some of the most creative bartenders in the city.   Great service -- a very professional staff all the way around. Incredible food.  Creativity is the word here.  They make food with imagination and serve it in an elegant atmosphere.   Check out the bathrooms, I wish my living room looked this good. If you want a quality night out and expect to be treated well.  This is the place for you.
