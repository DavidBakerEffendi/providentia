I used to order from Westville frequently, but the dressing they put with most of their salads is terrible (it has no flavor and seriously makes your stomach hurt). Normally I just ask for their balsamic vinegar instead but the last time I ordered they failed to bring it, and after half a dozen phone calls, two hours, and numerous promises from them to bring the correct dressing, I reluctantly ate a dressing-less salad. Very disappointing and I wont be ordering from them again.
