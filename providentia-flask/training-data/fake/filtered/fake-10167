My recent visit was on a Saturday night when a hockey team and hordes of folks heading to the theatre were out en masse. So we waited a Loooong time for a table and ended up having to sit in the bar seating area. Bleah. Oh well - they don't take reservations until you have 8+ personages. But the waitress we got was really really nice and attentive! Hubby & I had their Neopolitan pizza, which was good - I liked the crust but nothing totally special. Â Others in our party had the butternut squash ravioli and pasta bolognese and seemed happy with their meals. What I really loved was their Amazing Bread Basket - three kinds of bread - a regular Italian, a focaccia-type and a soft and yummy raisin sweet bread that I gobbled up! :) I even asked for more of this and got a full basket in return! So - overall, wholesome, filling Italian food - I would go again, but I have to agree with other reviewers that for this kind of food, the prices are a little high. And I probably would avoid Saturday night from now on! :) PS: Didn't get to check out the bathrooms - too busy for me to wade through the crowds! :)
