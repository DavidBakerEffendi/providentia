Came blazing in out of the cold with my 3 year and friend around 5:30 on Thursday.  The owner helped me get the stroller inside.  They were gracious and helpful with menu.  Picky three year old loved the pancake, dumplings and KFC.  The Korean fried chicken takes 15 to 20 but so worth.  So order the KFC up front.   The pork belly taco delicious.  Friendly, helpful and won't break the bank.  Thanks Dokebi for coming to Greenpoint. Can't wait to go back.
