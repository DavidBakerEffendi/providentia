Stumbled upon this place and was highly disappointed. Our service was awful. The wine was overpriced to begin with, but the really tragic part was that they only give you half a glass! The wine barely reached 1/4 of the way up. Not only that, we had to remind our waitress what we ordered after waiting 20 minutes for drinks when we were one of 3 tables present. She had completely forgotten that we ordered anything at all! From that point on we were ignored by the wait staff and treated like lepers. Very disappointing.
