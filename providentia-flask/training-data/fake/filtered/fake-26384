Osteria is hands my down my favorite spot in the city. Customer service is top-notch, decor is interesting and Vetri is a genus! We had the cold-smoked salmon to start, it was ridiculously amazing! Our pasta dishes were perfection. I think they make the pasta on premises? The place is pricey, but I assure you, it is worth every single penny!
