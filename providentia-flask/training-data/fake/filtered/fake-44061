I must say this place was a pleasant and truly unexpected surprise. Pier 76 is literally gourmet quality food dishes and one of the finest pizza delicacy restaurants in NYC. Â I have sampled some extraordinarily fine cuisine throughout New York and the world, and this wonderful quaint affordable establishment holds their own!!! Pier 76 would be an extraordinary hit if in SoHo , Tribecca, Park Ave. ; yet we have them right here on the Island with a delightful ambience and based at affordable prices.
