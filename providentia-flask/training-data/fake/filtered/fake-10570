Really yummy but I think a tad overrated. Waited in a long line and some of the pork was a little dry. But it sure is cheap and convenient location right in the east village. Don't have to travel out to Brooklyn! Also the music is a little too loud for the crummy sound system they have. Tough to carry a conversation.
