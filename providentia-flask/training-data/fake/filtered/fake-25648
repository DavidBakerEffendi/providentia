Great Find in midtown!  I'm always looking for a hip restaurant with creative food, not a stuffy, formal place of which there are many in NYC.  I wanted East side, small plates, interesting food pairings and upscale, contemporary atmosphere.  The service was terrific as was the food.  We are from the SF Bay area and have superb food choices and Vitae was equally as terrific as our local hot spots in Silicon Valley or SF.  The veal meatballs were excellent, juicy, tasty and interesting, and I'm not a meatball lover.  The sashimi was deliious but not as interesting, and the pulled pork tacos melted in our mouths and the duck was cooked perfectly with bacon and herb flavor.  Well done dish but not my favorite to have bacon with duck.  Wine list was generous with CA wines.  WE liked that.  And the server who is from Kansas, was excellent.  We will be back and are happy we found a new place to visit for dinner.
