DEBIT CARD FRAUD AT CABANA MIDTOWN!!!!! My girl friend and I went to lunch last Friday at Cabana Midtown.  We both used our debit cards to pay for the meal. Before the night was over we were both hit with unauthorized charges on our cards for Target in NJ for over $200.  We were both charged the same amount around the same time and the only time we actually used our cards was at Cabana.  Consider yourself warned!!!
