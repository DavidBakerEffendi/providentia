The hostess kicked me out the door since my party has not arrived yet. I had to wait for my party out in the cold. And the cruel thing about it, I can hear the waitresses laugh so hard for what they did to me. Ok, I understand they're busy and I still want to try the yakitori and compare it with my authentic yakitori experience from Tokyo, Japan. As soon as my party arrived we went upstairs to be seated. Disappointment - really tight, customers are elbow to elbow in a very cramped space. I was still excited to have my first yakitori. Another disappointment - The food taste like gas from the grill. I do not mind it being pricey knowing I will be happy with the food. But yuckkk!!! Aside from the bad treatment, it was really a very disappointing night.
