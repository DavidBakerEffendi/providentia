Absolutely amazing freshly made food and great homemade wine if you want. Amazingly pleasant owners in a family business.  Veal Il Triangelo is awesome, as are all the appetizers and other entrees. The desserts are freshly made and very different from the usual fare. Lovely decor and reasonable prices. well worth the trip just for the nice owners. Ricotta stuffed zucchini blossoms are to die for as an appetizer.  Ordered extra to bring home , thats how good they were.  All salads are super fresh and the bread is homemade in the kitchen.  There is no dish I would not reccomend; have brought many friends there and now they're hooked ! Can't wait to go back.
