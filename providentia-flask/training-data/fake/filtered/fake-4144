I love the food at Brooklyn Commune. I haven't tried everything but, everything on the menu looks tempting. I love the beet and spring greens salad w/ grapefruit and pecans tossed w/ a generous amount of crumbled gorgonzola.  Yesterday I tried a salad "special of the day" which was arugula, asian pear , heirloom tomatoes dressed well w/ a delicious vinaigrette. The salads come w/ the most delectable spicy/herby crostini I've ever tasted.  All of the ingredients taste like they were just picked. My husband keeps going back for the pork sandwich and the Old Bay chicken salad. I think the prices are reasonable for the quality/creativity of the food. My only complaint is that I'm not impressed with the dessert selection of mainly cookies. I've tried a few of Amy's cookies and they are just OK. How about some pies? The large open space and big windows are very inviting and best of all NO WIFI. The staff are top notch. I'm there once a week and am so thankful it's come to this nabe. As a Brooklyn lifer I was hoping I'd see a day when we'd have a local place like Brooklyn Commune.
