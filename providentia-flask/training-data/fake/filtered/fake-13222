I have been visiting the Nevada for years now and have never been disappointed. Ive tried breakfast, lunch and dinner. GREAT EATS. The staff is patient and pleasant. They provide service with a smile  The prices are reasonable.  I highly recommend the Nevada mmmm mmmm good!!! Oh on the off chance something isnt right, they make great efforts to please the customer. Im looking forward to going back soon.
