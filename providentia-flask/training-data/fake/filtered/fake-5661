The meat is very fatty. They have a huge pile of it cooked, sitting on the grill at all times and dried out. People rave and I have no idea why. They are riding on their reputation. Chopped v sliced- I am from the sliced school. I like the "chew factor". Chopped hides the fat balls at the ends of the meat. If I ever loose all of my teeth, I may crossover.
