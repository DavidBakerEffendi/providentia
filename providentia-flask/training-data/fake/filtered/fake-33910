The food is always absolutely amazing! There is a wide variety of dishes so whatever you are craving will be presented beautifully and deliciously.  I would honestly recommend everything on the menu but my personal favorites are the Baby Octopus Stew first course and both the Salmon "pinwheel"/Filet Mignon "puff pastry wrap" entrees.  Each visit there are miniature special appetizers called an appease, which change frequently.  These samplings are delectable and while they are not meant to completely satisfy a growling stomach they certainly give a literal taste of the great food to come!  To wrap things up as neatly as the Filet Mignon the atmosphere is relaxed and trendy, the waitstaff is polite and courteous, and most importantly the food is tantalizingly rich and incredibly tasty.
