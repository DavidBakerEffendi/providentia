Wait!! If you don't look closely, you might miss it and that would be a BIG mistake. I happened to park right in front and, incidentally, across from the (currently) better known Pho Dang. Always willing to try new places, we decided to give it a try. From the moment we were greeted and struck up a conversation with the host and cook, this place only got better. We ordered our lunch, tailored exactly how we like it, (for me that means no MSG and very spicy) and enjoyed an appetizer. It was also very nice of our host to actually tell us how much food to order (based on his knowledge of how big his portions are) versus other places that seemingly don't care, except that you're spending money. Turns out, he had it exactly right , we were sated but not overly stuffed. The main point, the food, was absolutely fabulous, cooked to order, using fresh vegetables, and tofu that was perfectly golden-seared. It was delicious!! Nothing more to say really-we will be back. You should go too.
