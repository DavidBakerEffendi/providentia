I can't say enough about this place. Where to go when you don't want to go into New Haven, but are still looking for good food? Ibiza. The tapas are absolutely amazing. Comparable to tapas I've had in Spain. I have been to Ibiza several times and tried various tapas each time, and I have never been let down. They are all delicious. The staff is great, with good suggestions. The manager makes it a point to come by and see how your meal is. Small and cozy, sometimes a bit loud, but all in all, a fabulous place. oh, and how can I forget the sangria? Delish as well.
