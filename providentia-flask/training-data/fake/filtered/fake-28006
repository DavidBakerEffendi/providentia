I have been to Amada and all of Jose Garces's  restaurants many times, always have had great food and great service.  I made a reservation well in advance for a party of 6 for a Saturday night and even gave my credit card info to hold the reservation, not a problem.  I received news 5 days before my reservation at Amada that my wife's sister is flying in to surprise her for her Birthday from Colombia, South America. I know the restaurant business and I know changing a reservation can be tricky, but I am thinking, " hmm I only need 1 chair, they can squeeze it somewhere".  Well let me tell you this I was WRONG!! I was given the opportunity to speak with the manager Andrew, in hoping he could review the floor plan or find a chair to squeeze  somewhere else where  a party of 6 was sitting and just rearrange the parties, but within 1 minute he indicated, "no sorry can not accommodate you", and was not even empathetic at all.. I was shocked and said, "really" and he said no sorry can not do nothing, and Andrew then proceeded to start to get an attitude. In my professional opinion, in this type of business, especially this chain of restaurants, where they thrive on their reputation, food and service I was shocked.  I will NEVER visit any of Jose Garces's restaurants ever again. Jose Garces you can thank you manager Andrew at Amada that he lost you a long time customer of all your restaurants and I will make sure to inform everyone I know as well what a unpleasant experience I had.
