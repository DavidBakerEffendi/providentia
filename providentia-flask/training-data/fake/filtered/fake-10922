Most of the posters have already noted the breakfasts here -- tasty and good value.  But let me let you in on a little Broadway Diner secret -- their baked French onion soup.  It comes in a crock with a light fluffy pastry cap, the cheese is melted to perfection, and the soup has a  wonderful richness to it -- it's a meal on its own!  Don't miss it now that the weather is getting chilly!
