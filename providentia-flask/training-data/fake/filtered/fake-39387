Menu: Dinner Time: Weekend/Early Evening Group: 2 I had a bowl of miso chicken ramen with thin noodles. The ramen was solid: not too salty, good broth, good portion size. I wish they had let it sit another minute before serving - the noodles were still firm and the egg was still cold. The place was small and sparsely populated. The service was fine - nothing amazing, but I have no complaints. Â The food was not too expensive, but I wouldn't consider it cheap, either. The largest drawback was cash only. Overall, I'd say Ramen-Ya is a 3.5, but I'll give it the 4 because I enjoyed the ramen. While I would not go out of my way, I will likely stop by again if I am in the area.
