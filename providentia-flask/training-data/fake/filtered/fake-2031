North Third is a staple of my Philadelphia routine. The beer list is always interesting and enjoyable. And the food...dear lord the food!! I am a true mac & cheese connoisseur, and theirs is just about as good as it gets. Dinner options are always unique and delicious, often closer to fine dining caliber than bar food without breaking the bank. Brunch is fantastic, bloody marys are served like a meal as god intended. Service has always been top notch. 5 stars all around!!
