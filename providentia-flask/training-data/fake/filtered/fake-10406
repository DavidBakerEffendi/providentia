This was, without a doubt, the worst service and food I've ever received in a restaurant. I'll start with the service. The hostess set the sour mood for our experience when she came out and rudely said to my friend and I (the man who was running karaoke that night) "You're, like, killing me right now. Shut this door". From there, we were greeted with cold looks by every girl at the hostess stand, and rushed to our table without so much as a smile or a second glance. When the waitress finally came over, it was another round of cold and unfriendly service while we ordered and opened the beer we had brought to the restaurant. At the end of the night, our waitress took almost a half hour to take our credit cards to pay. Now for the "food" (a term I use lightly). I ordered the mussels as my meal, and they came out smelling putrid. I couldn't believe that neither the chef nor the waitress caught the manure-like smell of what could only be a bad mussel (or a few) in the batch. I debated not saying anything for fear of annoying our waitress anymore, but I finally caved and was as nice as possible. I apologized for the inconvenience, smiled, wasn't combative at all and she just stared at me while I spoke. Finally, she said "Sooo, what do you want me to do about it?". I calmly started to say "Could I please just have a salad?" but before I could finish my statement, she interrupted with a "Yep", grabbed the plate of mussels, and stomped off to the kitchen. I wouldn't go back to Zinna's Bistro if someone paid me to.
