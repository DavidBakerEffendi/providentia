Brother's pizza is a great place. Their pizza is amazing and their staff is extremely friendly. They'll have a chat with you if you'd like, and you'll end your meal feeling happy. I've been ordering pizza from there for at least 5 years. To all of the bad reviews, this place has been under new management several times. I remember when their service and pizza was under average, but can guarantee it's delicious now.
