Everything is so fresh and perfectly prepared. Gila and her son are very friendly and accommodating, and Gila even came out and sat with me for a little bit! The portions are just right, very generous but not excessive like so many restaurants that leave you wondering if you need a bag, and if you get a bag should you carry it, and blah blah blah. Anyway, I can't wait to come back!
