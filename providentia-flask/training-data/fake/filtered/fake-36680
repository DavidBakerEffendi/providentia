Veggie wings were mind blowing!!!  People at our table were not even vegetarian and talked about how it was one of the best foods they have eaten in a while.  Really unbelievable flavor and texture.  Service staff was forgetful at times, and the overall vibe of the place is more like a local bar with tables.  However, those veggie wings are worth the trip anywhere!!
