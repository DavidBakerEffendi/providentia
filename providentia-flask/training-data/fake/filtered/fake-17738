The most fun you can have, standing up: chorizo taco from this truck. Don't waste your time on any of the other trucks around here, this is The One. Why don't you find a nice summer day, get a burrito from this truck, walk over to McCarren Park and eat it. It beats going to church and is twice as good for your soul.
