WoW DO these guys know how to make a good pizza . I heard about this place from a friend of mine that lives in Dumbo . I came by their last Friday and ordered a pie of pizza for me and my girl - the pizza was amazing, very well done , fresh and crispy. I will defiantly come back to this spot. UMMMMMY.
