There's no other ramen house around the area so Ani ramen will do when you are craving for it. Its a small place so the wait can be too long. The buns are good.. Im not a fan of the dumplings as i find it like it was just a store bought ones. A bit pricey though but close to my house so I say I'd still visit them once in a while.
