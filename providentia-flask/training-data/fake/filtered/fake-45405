A nice spot to hang out and grab good eats. There is a DJ playing different types of music, which can be a bit loud if you're sitting in the bar area. However, if you can grab a table in the rear or in the back patio which is covered and offers natural sunlight, you're good to go! Downside, if you have a large party and everyone doesn't show up on time or together you will not be seated until 90% of the group arrives. Sunday's are great for Brunch. Get there before 1pm for the best experience! Order the grits and shrimp! You won't regret it!
