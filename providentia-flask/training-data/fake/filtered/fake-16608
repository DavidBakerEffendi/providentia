Absolute best pizza in Wayne. Pizza is delicious and consistent....and I have been going there for more than 13 years. "Jimmy" is the pizza making Michelangelo. Sandwiches are always great and the eggplant parm dinners is awesome. I hear they may start doing delivery.....if they do their business will go through the roof. Josephina will take care of you. Tell her Mr. Palumbino sent you! Im goin gto get a pie and few sandwiched right now....gotta go!
