WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! all we wanted was to have an onion loaf as a side dish with our lunch. When we asked the waitress about this she replied "  That's not Happening"  So we cancelled the onion loaf I then went to ask the manager why this wasn't possible and he replied "that's not our style"  Needless to say we got up and walked out.  bottom line if you want good service  DON'T GO TO CHICKI'S AND PETE'S
