Went there yesterday for Valentine's Day.  The service was really good, especially considering how busy they were.  Now for a review on the food.  I ordered Fried Calamari as an appetizer, it was VERY FRESH as well as Fried nicely as well as very light. Exactly how you want Calamari, however the flour they use is just that, just flour, so it was a little on the bland side. The sauce that comes with it is very good and once you dip it in the sauce it was very good calamari. They sprinkle salt and pepper on top of the calamari to give it more of a taste but some pieces get the taste, some dont, some get too much. But still very orderable. The entrees come with a salad which I ordered the Caesar salad. I am not a salad eater but it was GREAT! FRESH, the dressing was put on perfectly as well as sprinkled with cheese and salt and pepper and I devoured it.  I ordered the Porterhouse cooked medium rare, and it arrived just as so.  Again VERY FRESH, and cooked exactly how I wanted it.  It was not the best steak I have ever had, but it was still very good.  I would order it again and I do recommend this restaurant.  I saw a bunch of desserts pass by me going to other tables and wanted to order one but I was full. But they looked GREAT! I do recommend this restaurant to those looking to bring a date to impress as they have a nice selection of wines as well as a very nice bar area.
