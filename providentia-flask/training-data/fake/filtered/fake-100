I like the cheesesteaks here and I think it's okay but it's just to greasy and fat like most people in Philly, and frankly the only thing Philly is known for is cheesesteaks. I waited too long for an overpriced disappointment and other people shouldn't go through this, also the policy is kind of racist. Honestly I think coming here was a mistake and I don't want to come here again.
