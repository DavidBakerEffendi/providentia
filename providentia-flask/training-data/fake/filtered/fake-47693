The pasta has a nice texture. It is fine cooked. It has the best pasta I ever tasted! I will go there for my birthday. When I eat the pasta I feel so good. I did not rate it 5 stars because of the waiting time. On friday nights the wait time is over a hour. The seating looks so good and there are hungen pictures. I think it is worth the wait to go there. There is also other good food. My dad loves the eggplant parmesan. Everyone in my family likes at least one dish there. When there is a choice between indian and carmines we would go to carmines. The table service is really nice. They give good water. They are not rude. They ask us how we are doing.
