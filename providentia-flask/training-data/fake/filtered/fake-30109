This place is a great addition to our neighborhood, we are still lacking local eateries but have an abundance of hotels :) I have been here for lunch on many occasions since they opened and enjoyed it every time.  I will return, a couple of times a week!  Try the fish with steamed vegetables and passion fruit juice.  Highly recommend!
