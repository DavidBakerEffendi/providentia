Hate this restaurant. Only reason I give it two stars cos of the titanic dessert. Pasta is always under cooked. Even when you tell them to have it cooked more through. Wait staff is rude and snobby. All I asked for was a clean fork.  Atmosphere was loud and noisy which is fine for time square but screaming children and fallen down drinks are needed  no where  near the dinner table. :(
