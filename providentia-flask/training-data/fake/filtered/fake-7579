This place is amazing don't know where to start crepes , wraps , salads , panini's , coffee , deserts , ice cream , soups you try any of these and will be flawed by the product and detail they put into everything they make top notch cured meats and cheeses... Love everything about this place and i recommend it to everyone I know deff a hotspot all year long with people flocking from every neighborhood in Brooklyn to go to Panino Rustico right here in Bensonhurst !!! Fugedaboutit , tutti a tavolo mangiare e' pronto.....
