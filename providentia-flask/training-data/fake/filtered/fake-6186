I will never go to the Monarch Diner ever again. I've been there before & had a good experience. This time around was a totally different experience. Today my fiancee and I decided to get some lunch on Sunday after church. We ordered french onion soup & wraps. To begin, the french onion soup was not hot at all, I kept eating and noticed a piece of hair in the cheese. I stopped the waitress and told her both soups were cold and showed her the hair in the cheese. She apologized & had the kitchen make new soups which were fine. But then we got the wraps we ordered and they were very bland..not much taste. It was busy so I said ok maybe today wasn't a good day to come here. She drops off the receipt at the table & said OMG I didn't charge you for your beverages. She returned again with a new receipt & we were charged for not only drinks but the COLD FRENCH ONION SOUP WITH HAIR IN IT ! She didn't even report to the manager to come to the table to take it off our tab. Yes I can definitely say I will never go to The Monarch Diner again.
