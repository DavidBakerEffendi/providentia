I was hoping I could give this place an outstanding review, as I love supporting farm to table and was happy to see they purchase from a farm near my house. The food was only "good". The quality of food was exceptional, but as for presentation and execution...just eh, especially for the price paid. Service on the other hand was not so hot. The waitress did not know the wine list (even wines by the glass) from whether a wine was dry or sweet, to what was even on the list to begin with. Good thing we didn't have any questions on the food menu. We were asked how everything was literally less than a minute after we received our food. And, as we were putting money in the check presenter (which was awesome), she came and grabbed it! Despite having cash in hand, wallets open, and a hand over the payment! The building is decorated very nicely; decorated in a modern style, but still keeping the old vintage aspects of the buildings architecture. The end.
