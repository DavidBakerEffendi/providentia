A bit pricey, but worth every penny. the food is delicious, very well presented and service is fast and attentive. My wife and me celebrated our two years anniversary. and we got the dessert on the house. price for two including appetizers, main course and a nice bottle of red wine, was about a $100 (not including tip and tax).
