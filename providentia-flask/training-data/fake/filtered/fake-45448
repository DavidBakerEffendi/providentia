This place was absolutely terrible.  I thought we'd try something new and different for my birthday, but it turned out being a bad idea.  They booked us ahead of time for the private room seeing as I was expecting 20 - 30 people.  When we got there, they told us that the party before us was still in the room, so they'd have to put us at a table.  In addition, we were told when we arrived that there was no way 20 - 30 people would even fit in the private room, (despite being told otherwise over the phone, prior).  My friends tried to speak to the owner/mananger?, (this is before I arrived) and said that he was rude and unaccommodating to them.  We also inquired about the possibility of breaking the bill into 3 or 4 separate checks, but the request went ignored.  Later, our "guests" made trips to the nearest ATM on foot.  When the waiter came, he was rude as well, and continued with an attitude throughout the meal.  When I asked if the shrimp and scallop pasta dish was recommended, he looked at me blankly and said "yup".  When the dish came, it was bland- just tasted like pasta with butter.  Drinks took a while to come, if they came at all, and they didn't have the ingredients to make 2 of the 3 cocktails I asked for.  Out of my group of about 25, one person thought their food was good, a couple said their meal was just decent, some meals were cold and some weren't even able to be eaten.  The food staggered out,  2-3 dishes at a time over a span of 25 minutes.  Apparently they also don't bring you a piece of cake, a cookie or even a mint if it's your birthday!  Bottom line:  We felt like we were more of a nuisance to these people, rather than a large *paying* party.  I could have hosted my own birthday party in my small apartment, made tastier food, saved some money and spent the night with only friendly people.  Only thing this place had going for it was the atmosphere, but even that wasn't anything extraordinary.
