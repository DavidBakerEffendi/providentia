This place looks so impressive from the outside, and even inside. The decor is very modern and clean looking. I had very high hopes. My hopes were very quickly crushed. The service was slower than anywhere I had ever eaten, and it was not busy. In fact, it was so slow, I was almost worried that my server would spend Â too much time at my table (I like to do my crossword while I eat my dinner). I didn't see a server for at least 5 minutes from the time I sat down. He couldn't recommend a wine or even an appetizer. My wine took about 10 minutes to get to the table. (Once again, I think there may have only been two other tables of diners while I was there). The food was OK, but, it obviously sat under the warmer in the kitchen too long. It may have been good if it had gotten to me withing 5 minutes of it being finished. I ended up spending over an hour in this restaurant when I should have and could have been out in a half hour.
