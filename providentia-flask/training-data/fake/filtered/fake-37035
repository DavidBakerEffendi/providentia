Cafe Condesa is one of the cutest little restaurants I've ever been to. The food here is always solid as is the service. They have some pretty interesting daily soups, my favorite being the ginger carrot. The tortellini with crab is to die for! And they serve mimosas with berries for dinner, how cool is that?
