today was my first time visiting this cookie store.  i havenever seen a place that charges per pound for cookies!!!  the counter person was rude!!!  i do not think she liked her job!!!  it is unacceptable to only have two staff members working for this high volume food cout location!!!  staffing and customers service training should occur!!!
