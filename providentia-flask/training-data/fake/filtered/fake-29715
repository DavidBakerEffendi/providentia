This review is for the Vila Nova section.  I don't know if the cooks are the same as the Sol Mar bar across the hall. The dining room is very attractive.  That's the best part of the restaurant.  Also, the service wasn't bad either.  We got cold bread, butter, olives, and fresh cheese as an appetizer.  Less than ok, have had better elsewhere, like Fornos and Seabra Marisquiera. My friend and I both ordered fish entrees.  They took forever to come.  Also, we hardly got any sides.  Two bland boiled potatoes, some broccoli, and the fish.  Both of our entrees were overcooked.  Only half of my flounder was edible.  There was no flavor to any of our dishes, though we kept adding salt like crazy.  I think the fish was old.  I couldn't finish my food though I was still hungry. There are better portuguese restaurants.  Try Seabra Marisquiera, or maybe the Sol Mar marisquiera across the hall.  Only if the cooks are different and their seafood is different.
