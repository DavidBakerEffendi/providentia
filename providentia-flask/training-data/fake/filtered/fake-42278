Oh man I love this spot.  This hits the spot since it's right by my job and I can just grab some great chicken and rice!  The only thing that's annoying is the line and the workers there aren't the friendliest.  The line mosts fairly fast at least.  Extra hot sauce for my next morning runs...just beware on how much you put on. I swear that can eat right through your insides!!!
