Quirkiest little café in Newark, probably. Delicious cupcakes and tasty (although slightly small) pressed sandwiches. Nice selection of coffees and lattes, teas, etc. Shares space with an art supply store. The look and feel of the café is European. But the owner (or manager) needs to stop wearing low cut V neck T shirts exposing patrons to a large patch of chest hair. Gross. Who wants this person to prepare their food? Just dress more appropriately, please. The rest of the staff does.
