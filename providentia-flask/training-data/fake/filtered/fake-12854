Best Greek-style pizza I have had in the Manchester/Glastonbury area.  As someone who grew up in central Connecticut, then moved away, I have sorely missed this style of pizza.  When visiting Glastonbury, Angelo's is a perfect reminder of how good New England Greek-style pizza can be.  I particularly like the mushroom pie (or mushroom and onions).
