What is with the negative reviews of this place? It's a lot like the other cheese steak places in Philadelphia. You can't find it different from those places. Remember people this is Philadelphia, the KING of CHEESE STEAKS so of course there will be a lot of places that taste great. Don't expect something unique or out-of-this-world taste and that's what makes this place and once again a lot of other places great. It's a simple recipe with fresh meat. You won't be overwhelmed nor underwhelmed. You just have to try Pat's for the rich history.
