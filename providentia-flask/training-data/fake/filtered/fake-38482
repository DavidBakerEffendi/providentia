What a treat ! Stopped in Mulberry & Vine yesterday for a late lunch with my business partner and was blown away by the fresh tastes and huge variety of dishes, each with quite original mixes of fresh veggies and herbs, and a selection of complementary sauces. The cauliflower with homemade sriracha was delicious, as were the sesame soba noodles and the beets with chile flakes, and I particularly liked bulgur salad with mint and lemon. The decor is pristine, and I was enchanted by the openess and citrus yellow chairs. With great style and warmth, impeccable service, and seriously good food -- Â my new favorite lunch spot.
