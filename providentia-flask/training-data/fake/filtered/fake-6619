This place is GREAT!!!!! We had the ginger calamari as an appetizer. It was one of the best things I've ever tried! A perfect fusion of fresh ginger and lime. Our entrees were delicious, as well. I had the grilled salmon with rock shrimp and my husband had the penne vodka. Everything was fresh and nicely seasoned. The server was friendly, prices were fair and felt at home in a casual setting. Will be returning to have my baby shower here in the summer....
