I am just starting to get into this yelp business so I do not have many posts however this place is top of the line.  If you are looking for top quality food and even better service then you should make your way over here.  We went with the waitor's suggesting on oysters, clams, and mussels and they were all amazing. Plus the waitor even helped me play a trick on my friends saying we were the 2,011 customer so our meal was free, and they were dumb enough to believe him.
