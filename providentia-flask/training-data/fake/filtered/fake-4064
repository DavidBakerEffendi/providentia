Meh. Had food catered from here for a work party. Nothing to write home to MAMA about. Really. Everything was sweet.. Corn bread was like cake. Corn was sugary sweet. Greasy Green Beans. They opened up a large can of green beans and threw lots of butter in it. There were plenty of un-wanted left overs.
