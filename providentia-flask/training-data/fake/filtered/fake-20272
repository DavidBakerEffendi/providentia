Good god I love this place. Jenga? Free cheese puffs? Frito pie? Hot dogs? Beam Creams? Sold. And people can buy you drinks while you aren't around, and then you come in and see your name up on a board and soon enough you have a free drink in your hand! It's magical. There's also a jukebox, pool (which is fun even though I am horrible), darts, scrabble AND connect four! Plus, I just found out I can bring my dog. This place could not get better if it tried.
