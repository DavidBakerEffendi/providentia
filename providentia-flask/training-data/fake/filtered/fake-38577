Wierd policies.  We were told they didn't take reservations - we were a large party - but they would take our name and time and have a table ready for us. Which is different from taking a reservation how?  When six out of eight of us arrived we were told we couldn't be seated till we were all there.  Now I can see if two of eight arrived, but six is still a decent number I think.  The hostess was really snotty about it too, with a snarky "that's the policy" and a sneer.  Too bad.  The food was really really good, the waitress was very nice, the coffee guy was a hottie.  But the start of the meal colored things a bit.
