This is a gem of a restaurant.  Went their for a good friend's birthday party and was surprised by excellent staff, delicious food and a very warm and friendly atmosphere.  Cannot think of a single complaint and recommend this to place to everyone.  This place was a lot more fun than Bibou I have to say - with zero attitude.  I have to thank Tory and his crew for a wonderful experience!
