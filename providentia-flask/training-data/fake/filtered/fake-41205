I was not let down by Toto Ramen.  We tried the spicy totto ramen and it was excellent.  The noodles were cooked to al dente perfection. I imagine that I will not find a better Ramen spot in Japan. This is hands down the best place to get your Ramen! I will definitely stop by again when I visit NYC. Arigato, Toto Ramen :-)
