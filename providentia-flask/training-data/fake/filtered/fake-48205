What makes these fries so special? It's not just their delicious double-fried extra crispiness or the great salt to potato ratio. It's actually the variety of sauces you can get with the fries. Some really great choices are the mango chutney mayo, parmesan peppercorn and the black truffle mayo. It costs $2 but it's well worth it!
