All five stars are for their strawberry milkshake, which is the best I've ever had. There seems to be a dedicated milkshake lady who uses all fresh ingredients as you place your order. The sandwiches are great, just not my thing. Put a cheesesteak in that roll, now we're talking. Anyways, strawberry milkshake!
