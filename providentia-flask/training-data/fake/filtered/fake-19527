Heard good things about this place, but it wasn't till Groupon that we checked it out. They get an A for effort, but just about everything was done poorly.  The ribs were tough, the baked beans (which actually had great flavor) were under cooked, the brisket was the fattiest cut of meat that I've ever seen, let alone tried.  It was like strips of fat with a little bit of meat between.  Really inedible.  The cubed pork was fatty as well. The cornbread was dry and the waitress was just so-so. Oh... and cardinal sin... frozen onion rings... that should never even have been on the menu... minced onions formed into a ring and fried.  blech. On a good note, the BBQ chicken wings were great, and the dry rub on the ribs tasted good... but that's just not enough to get me to come back.  They brag on the menu that they have a state of the art smoker... but clearly, they don't know how to use it correctly.
