I really love tapas. Casa Mono is one of my favorites. The stuffed calamari was great, the sauce amazing. The calamari may have been a tiny Â bit overcooked, but still tasty. The beautifully plated scallops and rice in squid ink were a tad fishy, but I think I understand the desire to cook them less than more. Still not sure if the slight fishinesh was appropriate (would have been happier if it was not there, but I will admit this is the first time I had a scallop with the shell in tote, perhaps this is more the norm?). The lobster was nice. The Jamon Iberico was good, but I was surprised about how thick it was cut, with no bread on the plate (but readily available nonetheless). Our waiter confused the beer size (he said the smallest beer size available was a 375 ml, which we agreed to order in addition to wine, but instead brought out a 750 mL beer). We also got two lobsters by mistake, and they didn't offer to leave the extra order that they screwed up (it was nice, would not have minded!). Tables are close together. I would go back.
