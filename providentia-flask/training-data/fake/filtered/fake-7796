WOW! This place was fantastic!  Great atmosphere and awesome food.  The tables outside were full so we took a table on the "inside" which was practically the same because they had those big open doors and windows that reminded me of a European cafe.  The tequila selection was very large, however, since I am a margarita drinker I opted to pick from the extensive margarita list.  We shared some table side guacemole which I would recommend people to try.  The dinner menu had a decent amount of variety.  Everything from tappas to burgers.  I had the pulled pork entree and I was very pleased.  I would suggest that to anyone who is a bit hungry.
