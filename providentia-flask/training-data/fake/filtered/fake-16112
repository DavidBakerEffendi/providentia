I am a restaurant enthusiast and I happen to own 5. I also won Iron Chef. What I do know if while the food was good and the service was immaculate the way whoever owns this restaurant allows the managers to run it is despicable. I had a problem with my order, rack of lamb to be cooked medium and it came out rare. No big deal someone just didn't feel the meet properly or maybe a slow burner or a cold oven. Either way quick fix, however my waiter informed a manager and he continued to sit at the table with his friends drinking in the open on the floor. Now me personally yes socializing is a part of the job however 20 minutes later and I was watching and counting and 3 drinks the manager proceeded to get up and walk downstairs not to be seen again for another hour. I understand there is a lounge downstairs but when I went down to take a peak at the rest of the decor he was again no where to be seen. I am astonished that the owners of such a well spoken of restaurant would allow this sort of non professional behavior to be conducted in their restaurant.  Lo an behold the manager re appeared and continued to sit with his friends until me and my associates left. To our great disappointment Cafeteria was not all that we had hoped it would be. I will not be recommending the restaurant nor will my associates  because you have to wonder if the managers on duty can be getting drunk and not care about the other tables in the restaurant what kind of a example are they setting for the rest of the working environment, and how much detail actually goes into what they do. Management aside thank you to our server for attending to our ever need and being so tentative.
