We had the fillet mignon, and mushrooms which were great! The wine recommendation of the waiter was perfect. The restaurant has a peaceful environment, not too noisy, romantic but casual mood. The strawberry fruit salad with olive wasn't the best combination but overall, highly recommend the place!
