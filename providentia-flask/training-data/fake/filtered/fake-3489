An excellent eatery located in the heart of Philadelphia, Sabrina's is sure to whet your palate for an early morning meal. The stuffed french toast is out of this world, and could not be happier with portion size. A real trick is to order a half portion, as you and your wallet will still be stuffed. I also ordered a meal off their specialty menu, which was superhero themed. Excellent! One complaint. This place is TINY so expect a wait or call ahead. The wait staff was nice and they were very attentive to my water needs. A+!
