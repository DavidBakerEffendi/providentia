I'm actually really shocked at some of the comments on here although I'm aware that some people just have bad experiences.  That said, I may be overcompensating.  It's not perfect, but I wish there was a 4 1/2 star option. First off, the hostess was so bubbly, I felt like I'd walked into a Jamba Juice.  She actually seemed really happy to be working or else she should be a much more successful actress than she is.  We sat outside on a lovely evening despite a limited view.  But where in New York has a truly amazing view except rooftop patios?   A quick appetizer cheese plate was really really big for the price. Good and great presentation.  Anyway, I ordered the special of the day which was a sort of lamb rack with a cream cucumber sauce or something.  I'm not exactly sure what I'd call it, but it was the least impressive thing at the table.  Edible, but unexceptional.  More impressive was the Mac and Cheese with proscuitto and the Seabass with bacon skewer that my friends had.  Luckily we agreed to do it smorgasboard style so we shared everything and a side of green beans (ahem... haricot verts).  It was quite good. As was the blueberry tart.  Service was friendly and attentive.  It's rare to find servers that will actually smile and engage with you.  There seems to be a professionalism (or uppitiness) that plagues most NYC waiters, but this staff seems to enjoy their jobs.  Stop by the bar too.  While we were waiting they were extremely gracious.   Anyway,  it was pretty great with a nice, cozy ambient feel.  You could even come to get smashed and play pool!  Win-win!
