Being this was my first experience and I was looking for something quick, easy and would quell a post-drinking tummy...I was very disappointed. In my best Robert Irvine Restaurant Impossible voice : The peppers were soggy and flaccid, the potatoes were obviously frozen and turned out mushy, the kilbasa had no bite. The only thing crisp about it was the fat pods I kept biting into. If I want a decent hot dog, I'll stick to Five Guys.
