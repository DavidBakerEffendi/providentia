I know reviews should really focus on the food (which by the way was delicious) but i really need to note that I watched the waiter clean the table, after it was cleared, with a spray bottle of cleaner and a paper towel! Yay- for being sanitary Quaint! I am impressed! No dirty rags wiping down the tables!!!!
