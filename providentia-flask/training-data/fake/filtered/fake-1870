I love this bar.  I love it. I bring my colleagues from work repeatedly all of the time.  We love the food, the atmosphere and are so glad that the place exists. But the main reason I keep coming back is because of two bartenders: Michael and Angela. These people have provided me and my friends with so much warmth, cheer, talk, laughs and understanding when times have been bad.  Michael always makes my friends feel like regulars on their first visit. He is so kind and the type of bartender I would like to have working if I owned a bar.  He loves the place. LOVES it! And his love for the bar comes across to his customers. Angela is always smiling, always so welcoming when we come in she makes us feel like family.  We will keep coming back because of YOU!
