Great little restaurant tucked away down the stairs-you'll find the perfect hideaway to grab and great burger, burrito or fish and chips at a fair price. The food is fresh and the family/owners/waitstaff are super friendly. Want something that's not on the menu? Please ask. If they have the ingredients they are more than happy to accommodate your taste buds. TVs in the both the bar and the dining area-make catching your favorite sports team a breeze. There is a fireplace to keep you warm in the winter. And an outdoor patio to enjoy the sun in the summer. I've gone here on numerous occasions and have invited different groups of friends, no one has ever left disappointed. Pop in an see for yourself.
