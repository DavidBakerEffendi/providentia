I visited last week with my girl friends from queens. We heard that Katsu-hama had really good tempura and crab cakes. The crab cakes came out nicely, but the tempura shrimp which i order was really soggy. I order a bento box, that contained the tempura shrimp a few pieces of sushi, some veggy and a bowl of rice and soup. My girl friends also order tempura chicken and the other ordered veggy tempura. All three tempura turned out really soggy. The restaurant was busy during the time and little waiters were moving about, so instead of ruining the day i didnt decide to ask for a change, but instead paid and went for fast foods instead. The price for the bento boxes were moderate at about $18 dollars. I wouldn't dare say the food was entirely horrible, but they should improve the tempura foods if i were to revisit.
