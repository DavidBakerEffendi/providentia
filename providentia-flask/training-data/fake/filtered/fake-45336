I will never go here again.  On November 15, 2014 I went for a birthday dinner for a friend.  It was a Saturday night and crowded but our group of 6 had to wait over an hour for our table.  We had a 10:00pm reservation and still had to wait.  The birthday girl requested a seat away from the front door.  When she reminded the hostess of this, we had to wait ANOTHER 30 minutes and then we got seat in the back courtyard place.  After the birthday girl was given an incorrect drink order, she was told she had to wait for another one because there were NO MORE CLEAN GLASSES. While waiting for the food and drinks, another patron noticed something CRAWLING on the walls.  It was a CENTIPEDE!.  It crawled into one the plants and we alert the waiter.  A few minutes later, a SECOND CENTIPEDE appeared.   We asked to have our table moved inside, which caused another 10 minute wait.  We still had not eaten.  By the time we got a new table, around midnight, the food we were given was cold and hard.   The worst part, however, was the nonchalant attitude of the manager, who told our group that there was "nothing she could do" about the centipedes.  She offered to take 20% off of the total bill, which was approximately $4.  When questioned about the 20% she said that was "all she could do," and she sent the waiter to handle the rest of our meal wrap-up.  He said that the manager "just wanted to get this situation over with" and asked him to deal with the bill. I was HIGHLY disappointed with the customer service at this place.   I WOULD NOT recommend eating here.
