I heard good things about Kefi, so we tried it out to remind our selves about the last years visit to Kavala. Kefi is a little overrated and overpriced. The classic greek salad did not taste anything like in Greece. Feta tasted like the regular stuff you get from grocery store. Wine was good, but too expensive. Service not personal.
