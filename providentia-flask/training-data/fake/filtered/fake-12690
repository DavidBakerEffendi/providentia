I came here for dinner after many years of staying away because I had a horrible service experience previously.  It'sa long story but it was my father's birthday and they moved us mid meal because they need the table for someone better - and I swore I would never go back....but my friend had organized a table for us and so we went. This time we waited for about a half hour to be seated - I guess they can get away wiht that being so popular.  Overall the service and food were actually very good once we got to the table...but the attitude from the host stand and the arrogance of being so popular again colored my perspective on the night.  We did feel a bit rushed like they needed to turn our table and would like us out after our entres were complete.
