Tonight I visited Blue for the first time. All my friends had been raving about it, especially this "clam bake" special on Sundays ,so we decided to give it a try... Boy was everyone impressed. We came with two other couples and sat at a lovely spacious table. The gentleman who took care of us was friendly, fun and informative. He recommended a great wine for me and an even better cocktail for my wife. Â  All the other waitresses that stopped by our table to clear a dish, or ask if we needed a refill on our drinks were super friendly and the decor was gorgeous. They have really fixed up the place since it was Tuggs. The clam bake was excellent. What a deal! 3 course meal with lobster for $25... Sign me up!!! Overall a great experience. I will definitely recommend to friends and be going back myself
