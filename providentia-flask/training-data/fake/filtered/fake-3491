My collegeaue had breakfast at Sabrina this morning.  Our server Courtney greeted us with a cheerful greeting.  She was extremely pleasant and gave us absolutely great service.  My food was excellent, however, having great service goes hand and hand with the meal.  I will definitely come back again and ask for Courtney.   Stephanie
