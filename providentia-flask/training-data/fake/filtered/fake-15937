A lot of places in New York claim to serve "authentic' Italian style pizza, but I have yet to find one that gets as close as Piacere. Â The ingredients here have the freshness you usually only get in the motherland, plus the spicy olive oil was out of this world. I was also pleasantly surprised by the wine selection here: the chianti we ordered was great and totally reasonably priced. Will def be coming back any time I get a craving for pizza all'italiana.
