Absolutely love this place, the staff is warm and welcoming and the sushi is to die for. I frequently eat here alone because I love the coziness of the place. I have tried most of the menu and would be hard pressed to pick a roll I did not like. From time to time the chef will make an extra roll and give it to me for free which is a great incentive to keep going back. My only true gripe is it can get a bit expensive.
