They have a good Pizza, but nothing to go crazy about. After all the reviews i read over here, i thought i am about to taste something that i have never tasted before. I am happy i tried the place, since i heard so much about it. the place look authentic, and i like the way they make the Pizza. I am not sure i will try it again, maybe if i will be in the area.
