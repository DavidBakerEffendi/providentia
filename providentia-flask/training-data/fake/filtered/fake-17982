i ate here once, inside, and liked the food. Took a menu home, called and asked first wether they delivered to me (in PLG), and they said yes, took my order and charged my card. Received a call 5 minutes later from the owner (I believe) who told me that while i live in the delivery area, it was too busy too deliver to me. She offered to void the card, as if that needed discussing. Person clearly never heard about the customer being right and honoring the commitment, since the decision to take the order was made by one of their employees. Way to Â lose customers. By bye birdie, never again.
