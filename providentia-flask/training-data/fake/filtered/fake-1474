It takes a lot for me to give a business a one star rating. I used to love this restaurant, and was excited to stop in after a few years for a Sunday brunch with a friend. To be fair, we didn't even experience the food (from what I remember, it used to be pretty tasty), because the service while we were waiting to be seated was a study in ineptitude. We went around 2 pm, and the restaurant was pretty empty, both inside and at the outside dining area. Despite this, my friend and I waited for 20 minutes while the hostess stood behind the desk, chatting on the phone... or staring vacantly into the waiting area. We asked her twice during this time if we could put our names in, and she responded "just a moment". Oooookay. FINALLY another employee came to the reception area and asked if we were being helped. We had high hopes when he said he would go set up a table for us immediately; however, after ANOTHER 20 minutes, we decided to head to another restaurant. I certainly don't mind waiting if there seems to be a reason for it, but the only thing this fiasco proved to me is that the staff is completely incompetent. This used to be a great place, but I'm sorry to say that I will not be going back here.
