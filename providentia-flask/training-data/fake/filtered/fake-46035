First of all i would like to say how they deleted my comment and blocked all my comments from my account ..so i have to write it from my friends account...this is real professional guys.. .i think people deserve to know this,,,if you have a problem then maybe you should fire the people that dont belong there and make this place a better environment to be in ... wow...do not know where to begin...first off I was excited to eat there since I'm a pro Astoria person but after experiencing what I did I will not be back, and I bring large groups where ever I go..So the place is not that busy which is good so we step inside..The manager (a blond headed guy) introduced himself I wont mention his name and quickly took care of us running here and there while being way to attentive to one of my lady friends checking her out several times quite bluntly, but she's so attractive so we went with it no worries, then he dropped the "F" bomb (Fuck) Twice to be exact, as more people began rolling in. a bad day I guess, so we let it go, but if your projecting yourself as being the most glamorous restaurant /bar in all Astoria as he said with a wink, adding "most others our trash" quote unquote..you do not curse... my good sir..Ok we eat our food which Â was very decent, servers great , and then we step out side, with all the windows open my group and I just converse a bit, when we notice a lovely Hispanic girl hand over her resume to Gianni another manager who I will name, she walks out ok...When all of a sudden one of my lady friends nudges me and we all look over as he rips up her resume and throws it in the garbage..I had to hold her back from storming inside and making a scene...HORRIBLE...WOW....DISGUSTING BEHAVIOR GUYS....Very upsetting. These guys belong in the back cleaning the grease off the cooks shoes
