This is a gluten-free paradise!  But even those of us who enjoy the pleasures of gluten can appreciate the splendor of Risotteria.   We started with an order of the gluten-free meatballs, which turned out to be both sizeable and delicious.  I then ordered the thin-crust pizza, which was also very yummy, while my wife went for the daily special seafood risotto and loved it.  Even the seasonal Steadfast GF pale ale was OK (that's high praise from a real beer drinker by the way). The only downside here is that the place is so small.  Getting in and out requires a lot of moving of the tables, and this is definitely not the place for a private conversation.  The staff were friendly, and the cooks do an amazing job in that tiny kitchen.  Check out the GF baked goods at the bar too.  Jolly good!
