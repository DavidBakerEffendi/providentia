Must Go Restaurant in NYC. Even though the line is longer (around 30 minutes) it is totally worth it. I recommend Akumaru Modern Ramen and Crab Cream Croquette (sorry for bad spelling). I've been to totto ramen and thought it was the best but this food here is more amazing. Totally worth it and I will definitely come here next time.
