I have been to this thai restaurant many times, the quality of food is great and the price is affordable. Neat and clean spot I am used to eating spicy dish but I cant handle their most spicy dishes..The good thing is that You can get it medium or mild. The only negative I could say about this place is that , they only accept cash and yes, it can get pretty crowded during dinner times. Rest all is good
