Great restaurant.  Very attentive and professional staff.   Always there but never hovering or rushing us.  We had a party of eight and a reservation on a Saturday night for 6 pm.  They immediately asked us if we were going to see a show (which we were) and made sure we were out by 7:40.   Food was excellent and pricing is average for New York.   Atmosphere is nice and noise level was great.  We all sat on a  round table but could easily talk to each other without raised voices.
