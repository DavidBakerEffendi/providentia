I just moved into the neighborhood was looking for a new breakfast joint... Â Bagels aren't too bad, but the service is HORRIBLE. One guy that had helped me was VERY rude and we actually got into an argument. As soon as I left, I checked my bagel, and it was the wrong order. So I went back in, and just asked for a refund because I didn't want to bother with the guy's rude attitude. I will NEVER recommend this place to anyone. I rather eat dunkin donut's stall bagels, then order from them ever again.
