I have been to both this pizzeria and the other roman gourmet in Maplewood many times.  In my opinion they are very comparable and both have some of the best pizza in NJ.  I havent had any dinners there, but they look good.  I always stick with the pizza which is delicious.  Their ingredients are fresh and they have a huge selection.  Unfortunately I no longer live in NJ, but whenever I go home I visit one the Roman Gourmets.
