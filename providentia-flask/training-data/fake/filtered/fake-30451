This is, without dispute, the best cheese steak in Philly.  Too bad about their hours, but that just means you have to work to get it.   Tourists, skip the nasty, soggy excuses for cheese steaks at Pat's and Geno's, and go to John's.  If John's is closed, then you have my permission to go to Tony Luke's instead.
