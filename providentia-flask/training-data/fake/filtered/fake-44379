Thought that this was a nice Italian sports bar... Come to find out that Replay along with Castello's are owned by Albanian Muslims. I also witnessed the manager Emir a t Replay Bar and Grill speaking down to one of his employees. The girl who was my server was amazing after she took my drink order and food order, he then came up to me and said he was taking over the table. I witness him do this to three of her tables. I myself did not tip him anything. He is extremely sneaky and rude. I went and found the young lady before I left and gave her 20 dollars and thanked her for her service. It was unfortunate how she was treated she told me this wasn't the first time he had done that either. This place has extremely poor management and I will NEVER return back to either of these restaurants. I have nothing against Muslims but I am aware of how they treat there women in there country and I can see that they still show no respect to women. The poor girl who was serving me said she can not just leave as much as she wants to because she is scared she will be unable to find another job.
