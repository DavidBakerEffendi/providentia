Visited here despite the reviews, my wife and I like to experience things for ourselves. Have to say we disagree with the general consensus on these reviews posted. Met a couple that are long time dining partners of ours, on their recommendation. Â  I had the skirt steak, tender and perfectly seasoned. Vegetables were fresh, not frozen. My wife had a burger and although it came undercooked initially, they happily took it back and was perfect when they returned it. Friends had the ribs and salmon, and also enjoyed their meals. Salad bar was well stocked and fresh as well. My birthday happens to be in the Month of February, and with a coupon supplied by our friends we received a complimentary bottle of champagne for my birthday. I would recommend giving this spot a try, we enjoyed the atmosphere and all the help was friendly and accommodating, very relaxed atmosphere.
