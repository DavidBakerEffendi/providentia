Looking for a good happy hour? Look no further! Barn Joo's is as good as it gets. Friendly service, lively atmosphere, great food, good prices and it's available every day of the week 4-7 PM! $1 oysters (delicious and shucked well) with their more than decent house white wine Korean fried chicken wings (among the best I've had) Spicy pork tacos They have other great deals on the HH menu, but just the above is reason enough for me.
