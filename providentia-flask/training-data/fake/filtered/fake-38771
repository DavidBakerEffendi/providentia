We've been to Imocha numerous times since it opened and have never been disappointed.  The drunken noodle is amazing.  We've also had a couple versions of the fried rice which were all very flavorful.  I love spicy food, and if you ask them to kick it up a notch you will break out into a sweat while you are eating.  All the more reason to top it off with one of the fried ice cream balls for dessert... they light it on fire at the table when it's served and it adds a nice toasty flavor to the crust. If you are a fan of hot wings, you have GOT to try these.  My favorite wings in town were at the Town Tavern before the current owner took over and changed the sauce to run-of-the-mill hot sauce and butter.  Since the owners of Imocha used to be part of the old TT staff I got my hopes up that they could replicate the old sauce.  We tried the wings a few times and offered some feedback, and I have to say the last time I got them they were PERFECT!  I will be ordering wings from here from now on for football munchies! I may get some tonight, as my mouth is watering just thinking about them!
