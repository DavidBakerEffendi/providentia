I live down the street from this place and often passed it meaning to try it some time. Well, now that I have, I'm kicking myself that I didn't discover it sooner. It's a pan-Asian deal with some interesting menu choices (Crawfish dumplings, anyone?)  and the best part is the prices. This is  gourmet-quality food for CHEAP. A beautiful salmon filet glazed with yummy miso sauce, served with rice ($2 extra for brown rice) and salad for a smidge more than $8! They have yummy chicken, pork, beef and vegetarian options, too. It's a little cramped inside the restaurant, so be warned, but if you're in the neighborhood, stop in and get takeout. If you're never in SoHo, well, for this restaurant, you should make a special trip.
