We visited the Happy Rooster a year ago and had a wonderful experience!  The food was great, wines were nice and our server Desiree was awesome.  We came back to Philly on business and thought we HAD to check out the Rooster again.  We were pleasantly surprised to see that Desiree was still working and she greeted us with a smile.....that's where the "happy" ended.  The lobster bisque was so salty, I couldn't eat it.  Big lumps of lobster meat, but chewy and totally un appealing!  My husband ordered the octopus salad, and the plate was swimming in black sooty juice, tasted like they hadn't cleaned their grill in a while.  Pure carbon flavor, yuk!  Desiree was kind enough to take both items off the bill and substituted with a fluffy light Gouda and spinach stuffed omelette.  At this point, I had lost my appetite, but my husband enjoyed the omelette.  Apparently the chef had changed from the last time we were here, totally disappointed!! I'd go back to see Desiree but not to eat, and not on a Monday.
