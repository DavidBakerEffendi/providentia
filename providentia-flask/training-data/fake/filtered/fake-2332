Slightly on the fence about this Halal Street Cart.  It was very affordable at $6.00 for a platter.  The food was fresh, but a bit insipid for my taste.  The worst part about it is the line!  Prepare to wait on line for 30 minutes at any point in the day.  Been there a few times and will go back once in a while if I'm hungry and in the area.  Overall it's good, but not worth the wait.
