My mom, brother and I ate here for the first time tonight and it was awesome! Our server Alex was very polite, funny, outgoing and attentive! He rocked. We got the steak tartar and prosciutto mozzarella for appetizers and both were large portions and delicious. The Filet Mignon, Dry Aged Steak au Poivre with Courvoisier Cream, and Seared Tenderloin with Butter Poached Lobster Tails are all excellent choices for an entree. The steaks were all cooked to each person's liking (one med-rare, one medium, and one med-well) while still being tender and juicy. Literally cut through my filet like butter. The sides were pretty great too! Sam's mashed potatoes, Au Gratin potatoes, and asparagus to be exact. Â  The ambiance inside Capital Grille is relaxed yet sophisticated. The tables are well lit, well spaced and large enough for multiple plates. The staff that we encountered tonight were all wonderful. I highly recommended this restaurant, you won't be disappointed!
