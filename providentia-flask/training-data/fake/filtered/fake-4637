We had a lovely dinner here. The owners stopped by each table to check on everyone and they were warm and kind and approachable, we felt very taken care of. There was an unfortunate thing with some Tanguy C. from Cambridge who walked in doing that entitled thing, awkwardly bewildered that as a walk in he has to wait for a table. In New York City. On Saturday night. At 8. With 12 people. But they handled it gracefully. Oh and the cocktails are muy good. And the atmosphere makes you feel like, "yea its saturday night and i'm out." so that was good too.
