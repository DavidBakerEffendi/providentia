Very nice place. Dining room was clean, service was great. Food was good, but afterward I realized I ordered the wrong item here. The pizzas the best! But little did I know so I got a sub. It was okay. Would be 5-star, but the bathrooms could be nicer. This place is probably perfect for take out, but meanwhile the dining room was nice as well.
