If you care for quality food, good taste, just decide to stay away from this place. Y'day I had terrible experience eating at this place. Food was pathetic to say the least!!!. Your money is not justified. Food is worst!!. This shop must realize one basic thing that customers come to have good food. There was a person who's rude and shows attitude when complained of served untasty, unindian, uncooked food. They sure will make your day go disapppointed!!!
