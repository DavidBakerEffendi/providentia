This past Saturday night I had the misfortune of going to Sally's, with another couple who asked us to join them.  I had never been to Sally's. The pizza was in fact excellent, But the two-hour wait to get in and the 1-hour wait for the pizza is unacceptable.  I don't really care that some of the other reviewers say that "it's part of the experience".  Nobody should ever have to deal with that experience.  Especially when there were several "special guests" who apparently had reservations and were free to just walk right in and take as much time as they wanted.  I will never return to Sally's.
