This place is definitely worth going to.  The menu items are reasonably priced, the quality of the food is high, they have an extensive wine list, and a great atmosphere.  I have yet to try something I did not like (personal favorites are the brussel sprouts salad and the gnocchi).  One complaint I do have is that the regular menu does not seem to change much.   The place can be busy at surprising times (Tuesday night, for example) but the service is always great, albeit a bit slow when they are busy.  Great for a date night, happy hour, or a night out with friends!
