I. LOVE. CANTINA.  I started coming here over 4 years ago when I was waitressing at a well know "opera" cafe in S.Philly.  We'd come by after work for drinks and food.  I love the atmosphere and the welcoming and extremely cool servers and bar tenders.  Their food is phenomenal - as is the fair at their Dos Segundos location, too.  You can sit inside or outside, great MARGARITAS!!!   When people ask me where to go for food and drinks in S.Philly, I tell them CANTINA.  By far my favorite in the city.
