The best Thai food in Central Jersey.  Love the shrimp and chicken Pad Thai, pot stickers, spring rolls and Thai tea. It's BYOB and they will open the bottle and provide wine glasses.  It's quaint decor with several nice tables. Takeout is very popular too. My family has been going their at least 1 or 2 times a month for almost 7 years. We think its the best by far and a great value.
