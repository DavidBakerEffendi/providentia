Awesome! You just can't go wrong at this place.  Had to wait a bit but the nice hostess gave us a couple of free glasses of vino while we were waiting for a table. The red snapper is finger lickin good!  One taste of the fried calamari and you'll think you died and went to heaven!  The ambience is nice and the place has got a warm and cozy vibe.  Definitely check out this restaurant.
