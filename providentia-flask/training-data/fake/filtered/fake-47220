I usually read reviews and think, that will never happen to me, but this place is not worth the risk. With horrible service and mediocre food at best, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY!! Once seated we waited forever to be greeted.  After 25 minutes we finally flagged down the waiter to take our order because we could not wait any longer.  During our meal when we occasionally saw our waiter we asked for more water or bread, he would acknowledge the request and never come back.  We either had to ask again or wait an unreasonable amount of time (30 minutes for more water). The salad and entree both took nearly an hour to come out and were not worth the wait. (we were there from 8pm-11pm) Worse than the food was the service, not friendly or attentive, and it was a quiet Thursday evening. We will never return!
