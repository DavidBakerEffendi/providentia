I have visited this restaurant many, many times of the years and my last visit was extremely disappointing.   It was not that busy and we waited for 15 minutes before our waiter came to the table.   On top of that, the sandwich that was ordered was not made like it normally was in the past and although I rarely complain, I felt I had to tell the waiter.   He want back to the kitchen and came back to tell us it had been made correctly.  It clearly was not.   There was actually bread on top of another piece of bread with a quarter size piece of cheese in between.  They would not make another one and the manager took off fifty cents for the slice of cheese  - when it seemed half of the sandwich was missing.   That was very poor business sense and I felt they were rude about it.   I do not plan on going back there anytime soon.
