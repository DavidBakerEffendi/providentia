Best ramen in the whole city! There is a wait if you come during peak hours and the wait can be as long as two hours. However, if you come alone, sometimes they can sneak you in with a very little wait. The pork buns are amazing and they have really good pork belly. The akamaru modern is so good and I usually get some extras like egg and pork belly with it.
