Classy place, authentic Italian cuisine, great atmosphere. Good service. Excellent menu. Small place, doesn't look like much from the outside b/c it's in a strip mall, but once you're inside you can see what they are trying to do, all the right touches in decor and music, ambiance, etc....it's byob too which is nice. I love the gnocchi sorrentina but their specials each week are always a good pick because they are different and always tasty. The margherita pizza is good too if you just want a quick bite. They do have takeout, but the sit down meal is worth it for their home made breads alone. I am not a salad lover but their house dressing makes me devour all the greens on my plate. A+++.
