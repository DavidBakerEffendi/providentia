Excellent, We had Thanksgiving here. It was so wonderful. The Food was awesome and the service was great. Oh yeah the place also had such a nice feel too. Can't say enough nice things about it. We were suppose to stay at an AirBnB at 407 Rugby Rd, Brooklyn, so we booked the Farm for our Thanksgiving Dinner. Unfortunately Rick Mueller the owner of what he calls Â "Artist's Ditmas Pk 5 bedroom house" is a dump. The place was unsafe and smelled, So we couldn't stay there and Rick kept our money. Luckily though it showed us the way to the Farm and that made it almost worth the terrible experience with Rick.
