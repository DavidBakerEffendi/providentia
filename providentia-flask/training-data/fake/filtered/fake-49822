A mixed meal experience. Most of my visits to M&S has been after Peter Luger's to get a Fernet. Damn Luger's and not having a digestif. Now that just doesn't make sense. So yeah the wife and I finally actually wanted to have a meal there, and food-wise it did not disappoint. Really nice briny oysters, a salad and then the roasted fish (forget which one!) Fun atmosphere. Unfortunately we sat right after a large table of 23 year olds having their group internship dinner. It took so long to actually get our food we were starting to get a bit antsy, which the waitstaff noticed and kept us placated. Luckily the meal was superb enough to make us overlook the wait. We assumed though that the placation would entail a dessert on the house (which was great, berry cobbler or some such thing) but they didn't comp which left a bit of a bad taste in our mouth. Overall, food is great but can be crowded and it is a tiny space. Don't bring your Midwestern relatives.
