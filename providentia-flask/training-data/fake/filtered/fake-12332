I visited about a week and a half ago on a Friday night with 4 other friends. We just happened to be walking by and peeked at the menu. A server who was walking in the door to start her shift invited us in, so we said why not. We went in just for a drink, so we were offered what I will call the "bar table." Kind of like the chef's table in the kitchen, but this was a small counter with 5 seats that basically constituted the bar. We all ordered different drinks, mine was the Sienna Palermo. It was a mix of charcoal infused vodka, Fernet, and some other lovely liquors. I must say it is my new favorite drink, borderline obsessed. We decided to order a few appetizers to share, which were equally amazing. Stylish d√©cor, relaxed modern atmosphere. I haven't been there for a full meal yet, but after my first visit, I will definitely return!
