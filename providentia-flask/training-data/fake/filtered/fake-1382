After having eaten here several times and meeting the owners, I really want Beehive Oven to succeed.  The owners seem like good people .... BUT..... the restaurant has a few issues.  First of all the location s*cks.  It may not be there fault (do to budget etc.) but THAT corner, in THAT building...it has a really negative vibe.  Could go into more detail here but I'll refrain.  They are trying to spruce it up but ultimately the location has a lot to be desired.  As far as the food.  Its good.  Its decent.  But one cant help comparing it to Pie's & Thigh's 2 blocks over.  My take is that they (Beehive) shouldn't have to tried to do the fancy/southern food thing.  Williamsburg has tons (too many) nice, fine dining, fusion establishments already.  If people want that there are plenty of places to go.  But if they want good ole fashioned southern food, home cooking (however you categorize it) there are very few options.  So therefore they (Beehive) should STICK TO THAT!  Don't try to make if fancy, just DO IT RIGHT!  Keep it simple.  That's why Pie's & Thigh's is so successful because they serve up what its meant to be.  Not something that's obviously trying too hard to be a new and contemporary take on southern fare etc.  Btw, the biscuits are kinda small. And like I mentioned before, the entrees are trying way too hard to be something different.  Also they don't transfer well into a takeout meal.  Did that once and it was a cold mess.  As far as atmosphere, its a little bright (at night) for my taste.  And the hours are posted outside the door in front but they don't seem to be accurate...or at least not yet.  ANYWAY, I feel bad for writing a lot of this because I like them and I want them to succeed.  I just figured I should be honest and hope that it helps them in the long run.
