First time there this evening after reading all the reviews on Yelp.   We regularly fly by this exit on our way to VT for skiing and decided to pull into a sit down place vs. subway (yak....no more).   This place is five minutes from the highway. The staff were great and treated my daughter like a star. Paper airplanes and as much soup as she could eat. Food was outstanding.   Hot pots, maki rolls, squid, and kimchi.......all great.   Will definitely come back.
