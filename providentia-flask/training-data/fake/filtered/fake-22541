Since I have the same last name DelRossi I figured I would stop and try it out. OMG! you thought Pats was bad. The meat was full grisly Fat. I picked what I could off of the meat but there was nothing left on the roll. Dam shame I really wanted it to good. Oh well back to Jim's the good news the place is nice and clean. Over priced too. Bad just bad.
