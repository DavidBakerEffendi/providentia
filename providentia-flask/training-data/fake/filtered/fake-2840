I travelled to Montclair today to try the restaurant  "Cuban Pete's " for lunch which was recommended to me by a Cuban customer of mine. I  invited my 79 year old uncle who is Cuban and a good eater.  I ordered the chicken breast he ordered the pork.  The rice and beans were decent , but the pork was dried out and salty,the chicken also dry and had no flavor. I am one that will rarely give a bad review, but this experience I had to share.
