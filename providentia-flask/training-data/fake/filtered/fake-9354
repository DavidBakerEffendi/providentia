Love this place. It's a fun local spot, a bit of a throwback to the more independent fast food places that used to be peppered around Northern New Jersey. You can go in for a quick bite or get delivery. You can tell the beef is fresh, not frozen--makes a huge difference! Can't go wrong with the cheeseburgers and fries, but if you're in the mood for something different, go for the buffalo chicken cheeseteak--it's amazing! Tip: follow them on Facebook for good offers. They're almost always running Facebook-exclusive offers that you have to mention to redeem.
