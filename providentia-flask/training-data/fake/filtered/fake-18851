Loved the home made hash and red potato homefries!!! Very yummy! Very much disliked my waitress! Served me over easy eggs that when I cut into them a teaspoon of raw egg white poured out. When I brought it to her, bc I couldn't get her attention she told me she has been a waitress for 17 years and that is what over easy is. I nicely responded that I've had over easy eggs all over the country for 35 years and their may be a very little bit around the yolk that isn't cooked, and I have never had so much white pour out from the outside rim. That over easy is white cooked and more runny yolk. She told me I was wrong and she wld put it in again and see what I got this time. So rude! ESP when I'm a waitress myself and wld never say that to anyone EVEN if they were wrong, which I'm not. The way an egg is cooked is how the yolk is prepared ! The white is always supposed to be cooked! Even with a sunny side up! It's cooked longer on one side to ensure the white is as cooked as can be! Couldn't get her attention for a refill on coffee. And after stacking the plates and pushing them to the edge of the table we still waited for 10 minutes for our check! I would have left $10 on the $28 (do it all the time) instead I left $3. I never do that! Never have I been treated so rudely when I was doing everything I could to ask for what I wanted in a tone that was as nice as possible!!
