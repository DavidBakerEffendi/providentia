After doing quite a bit of research, I decided to choose MAXFISH as the restaurant to host my sisters baby shower.  At first I was worried that I would not be able to afford this caliber of a restaurant, but soon felt at ease after speaking with the Manager.  I was very impressed with Brian who worked with me from the begining to come up with a menu that worked within my budget.  He was professional and creative and put my mind at ease with planning this special event.  The event was a huge success!  The room was set up beautifully and the menu was spectacular with five choices to please everyones palate.  Many of the guests commented on the delicious food!  The atmosphere was relaxing and the staff was very professional and attentive.  Overall, this experience was wonderful!  I highly recommend this restaurant for a great dinner and to host a special event.  We are looking forward to having our next event here.
