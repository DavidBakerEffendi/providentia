We got there for breakfast, ordered some eggs and coffee. The omelet was mediocre and clearly smaller than advertised "3 egg" portion (for $10.5, they could be more generous!). Toast was not included - I assume one is expected to get on of their "croissants" (those look like standard supermarket bakery, nothing fancy). We asked for American coffee and the drink we were served was impossible to drink even with a generous portion of milk - stale water with very bitter taste. Finally, this "coffee" appeared on our bill as $4/cup and were insisting this is what they charge for this drink. To be fair, they took it off the bill once we complained. Still, I'm not recommending this place to anyone.
