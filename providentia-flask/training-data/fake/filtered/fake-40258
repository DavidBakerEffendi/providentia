Been going here for years and years. AMAZING pizza which is always well worth the wait. Best NYC style pizza anywhere. The owner makes all the pizza himself and he's been doing it alone for years. Hope this guys lives forever cuz he makes awesome pizza. Perfect crust, tangy sauce and hot gooey cheese. Don't let the decor fool you, this place is a true diamond. Enjoy!
