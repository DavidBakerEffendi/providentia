My husband and I took our family and friends (group of 18) for dinner at Saigon Grill and everyone was pleased with the place, the staff, service, and the food.  The family pho was a hit (especially with a big group).  We love their spring rolls as well, but everyone's favorite's the seafood mix combo.  We will definitely keep on going back.
