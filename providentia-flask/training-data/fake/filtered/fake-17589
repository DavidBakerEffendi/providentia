Went to Sunday brunch yesterday with my sister, we had a reservation so our wait was only about 5mins or so.   There wasn't a huge line outside at all, but maybe that was because it was 1PM. About the Food : my sister had the Jane Benedict. It was generously portioned, perfectly seasoned. Beyond delicious, even included a side of home fries that were so good. I had the famous Vanilla Bean French toast, but while it was also generously portioned, I didn't find it as delicious as some of the previous reviews described it. Yeah it was fluffy, and tasty. But 18$ for an OKAY French toast?  Should've gone with the egg Benedict like my sister :( We had complimentary apple champagne that was very good. And our server David was so attentive and fun, makes me definitely wanna go back some day. Overall, pretty good place. Nice vibes. Very NYC.
