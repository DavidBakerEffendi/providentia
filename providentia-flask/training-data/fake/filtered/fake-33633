The food is decent however the restaurant is filthy. i am not the type to complain but had an issue with a take out order. i wan informed of the company policy of no to go orders. i found it to be understandable however after waiting 45 min to be seated having a few drinks and a meal i found it absurd. i even requested to have the meal brought to the table and it would be eaten there in front of the manager. He refused and stated i already said i wanted it to go and refused to serve me. I understand company policy but perhaps they should properly train management on dealing with the public. Â The mAnager on staff was rude,condescending,and not accommodating at all. after 15 years of dining here i will not return,additionally the bathrooms are a health hazard.mm
