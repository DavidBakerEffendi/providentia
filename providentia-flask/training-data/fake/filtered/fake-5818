Took my sister out for a birthday dinner here and it was definitely one of the best dining experiences I've had in NYC. If you enjoy wine then this is the place to go! The ambience is perfect for a fancy-ish wine and tapas dinner, the service is courteous and prompt, and the food was AMAZING. The owner was around and suggesting wine pairings as well which made the experience even better. Definitely going back next time I'm in the city!
