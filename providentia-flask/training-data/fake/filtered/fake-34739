For my husband and I, Sanford's is hands-down, our favorite joint in Astoria. Whether it is for breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner, late-night munchies, or just dessert, this restaurant offers excellent food any time of the day or night. The menu is extensive and the offerings are excellent for people who really appreciate food. From the Croque Madame and Florentine Frittata for breakfast, to the Butternut Squash Ravioli and Hangar Bistro Steak Salad for lunch, to the 3-Mushroom Truffle Risotto and Pork Osso Bucco for dinner, you cannot go wrong. There are so many things on the menu that everytime you visit you can experience something fantastic and new. This is a must try for not only those who live in Astoria but for anyone in the NYC area who wants an excellent meal. From the hubby and I, thumbs up!!!
