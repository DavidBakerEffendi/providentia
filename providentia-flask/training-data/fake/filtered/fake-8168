So I went to Yuca bar this past weekend and I was surprised to see a mixologist from Milk and Honey running the place. I'm not sure is Sasha Petraske is involved with Yuca bar or not but I know that it's going to get better with this guy there. I had a blast, the food was perfect, those ribs come right off the bone and are the best in the village. I am definitely coming over again when this mixologist is there. The service improved and my waitress was on point. I'd recommend this spot now more than ever.
