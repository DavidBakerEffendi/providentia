This place looks cool and the food is delicious. The waits are usually pretty long.  I remember getting a cheeseboard which was out of this world as appetizer.  I got sugar chicken wings which was so delicious. Was talking about it for weeks. The next time I went they didn't have it anymore but I hope they bring it back.   Another visit I got a turkey burger which was also delicious. Overall awesome place five stars.  You can't go wrong by going here.
