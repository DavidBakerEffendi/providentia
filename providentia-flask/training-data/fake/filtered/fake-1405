I admit, I've been missing the South lately (especially New Orleans), so Great Jones Cafe really hit the spot. Went here a month or so ago with a friend because we were both craving some Southern comfort food. We were not disappointed! THE FOOD: The cornbread they serve at Great Jones Cafe is worth the visit alone. Seriously. It was baked with a delicious glaze on top, and the portions were very generous (95 CENTS A PIECE). I had the gumbo and my friend had the pork (I think). Although the gumbo was definitely not EXACTLY like the gumbo I had in NOLA, it did a pretty good job. I loved that it was flavorful and had a bit of a kick. THE VENUE: Small and cozy, but well decorated and definitely not your typical Manhattan restaurant. When we went, it was raining a bit, and the atmosphere in the restaurant made it feel like you were somewhere else. THE SERVICE: The service was great! We were seated promptly, and our orders taken soon after. No complaints here. Overall, we had a pretty good experience at Great Jones Cafe. Will definitely be back again to try the Jambalaya!
