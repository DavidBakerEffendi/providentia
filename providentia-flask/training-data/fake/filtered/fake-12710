Dined a Lupa on Friday night with a group of 8. We were celebrating a birthday. We had the 6 course tasting menu and a selection of good red and white wines.The food was solid. There were kudos on each course. Two of the people in the party are chefs and the rest of us just really enjoy good food; and that's what we got. The meal was well paced, and the service was attentive. The team at Lupa did a really good job! Molte grazie!
