Unfortunately, I couldn't get past the bartenders saying "we have wifi, but we don't have the password" to try anything on the menu. Then when asked if a manager could provide the code, I was told that "they are not around and wouldn't give it out". Who doesn't have wifi for customers in 2014? Thank you and goodbye! I walked over to Papillon 25 next store and spent $50 on food and drinks as I worked from my laptop.
