We just ordered from super hero sub shop and the "hero" was a lot less than super. My boyfriend got a pastrami sub and a hot dog and I got a turkey sub. Pros- the bread was really fresh and I liked that they had a whole wheat option. That's where the pros stop Cons- Very little meat (literally 6 slices of thin cut turkey on a 9 inch sub is just ridiculous) Very little toppings Delivery time took over an hour and 1/2 within jersey city. Considering that our order was so small and consisted mostly of cold products (2 cold cut subs, a macaroni salad, and 1 hot dog) this is unacceptable Hot dog (the only thing hot we ordered) came cold We will definitely be ordering from somewhere else next time.
