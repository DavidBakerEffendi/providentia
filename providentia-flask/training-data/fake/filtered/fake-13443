The food here is somewhat better than average, which is the only thing Le Grainne Cafe has in its favor.  It was so loud that I got a headache and the service is nonexistent at best.  They are either understaffed or inept (or both), and it results in confusion and chaos at peak time.  After waiting a ridiculously long time for a table we finally sat down right next to a couple who was being yelled at by a waiter for sitting at a table.  The hostess had seated a person eating alone at a two person table, and wouldn't let the couple sit at a booth "meant for one person."  It was embarrassing seeing customers being treated that way and it made us all uncomfortable. Our food was fine, however it took over a half hour to get it after we ordered.  At that point we were so hungry we were about to eat our napkins. I honestly wouldn't recommend coming here to eat if service is important to you.  Either get takeout, or go someplace else.
