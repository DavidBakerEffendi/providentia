as a restaurant it is overrated, whatever wonderful service is raved about was not present when I went, my wife order a glass of wine with dinner and it never came,the price of a veal chop which was chewy was 45.00 and not worth a third of that. I have better dining in local diners. way overrated, and over priced, there are a lot better restaurants that are pizzerias than Â this,this must have a lot of friends who post
