probably the most authentic of the ramen joints in the city, minca is where you go when you need your carb and fat filling.  their broth is very rich and savory (except for the wahoo broth which is a little bit lighter) which goes well with the thick ramen noodles they serve.  the pork slices are always so soft and succulent that i am always tempted to order more the next time.   you can also get chili paste to go along with the noodles if you feel like something spicy.  homemade gyoza are also recommended -- skin are crispy and thin.  portions are big though, so you might end up not finishing your noodles if you have too many! they also go the extra step and warm the bowls when they are cooking the noodles so that the bowl doesn't cool the broth -- attention to small details like that makes minca's noodle-making an art!!
