My friends and I went to RJs for a drink on a Saturday night and had a horrible experience.  It wasn't that busy but the service was very slow and we had an extremely rude encounter with a bouncer there.  We were there for a bachelorette party and took a picture of the bride only to be yelled at by bouncer  who grabbed our drinks and proceeded to push my friends and I out the door.  We are NOT a rowdy bunch and to get kicked out and treated rudely for taking a picture is RIDICULOUS.   We used to like Rjs but we will definitely be taking our money elsewhere from now on.
