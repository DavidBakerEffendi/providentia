Unfortunately, the owners and employees of this restaurant are extremely dishonest. The food is actually quite good, but pay attention to your bill especially late at night. During lunch hours, they are legit. As the day progresses into night and bargoers start to populate the restaurant, the establishment will try to overcharge you, you will not easily find menus or prices clearly posted. If you go out of your way and ask about prices, they will size you up and then give you a price. I've seen this happen very many times. Always look at the menu, and always add up the numbers in your head if you go here. I've caught them many many times.
