This was a great find! An overdue and much welcomed addition to the neighborhood! Unique and delicious dishes, all local to the NY area. Even the wine! Since discovering this gem in Hells Kitchen I have been here several times, brunch and dinner. Consistently well prepared dishes. The staff provides friendly, attentive, and efficient service every time. I'll be back!
