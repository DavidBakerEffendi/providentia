I went to La Viola a few times over the summer while I was in Philly.  The food is very good and reasonably priced.  The atmosphere isn't super fancy, and the tables are small and close together, but none of that bothers me. The reason La Viola gets a 5 star rating for me is the service. My experience was SO amazing one night, it convinced me to write this review.  My boyfriend and I were having a late dinner, with reservations around 9:00.  It was a beautiful summer night, so we chose to sit outside.  Right as our dinner was almost over, I noticed it was starting to lightning, so my boyfriend ran inside to pay the quickly pay so we could leave before it started raining.  However, before he returned, it started violently raining. After a few minutes trapped in the rain (under an awning) I chose to dash into the restaurant.  My boyfriend and several others were just standing in the covered doorway, trying to figure out what to do.  After a few minutes of this, the man I presume to be the head waiter invited us back inside to sit at a table until it stopped raining.  We decided that while we were inside, we would order dessert, even though our dinner bill had already been settled. I had the coconut gelato, and it was delicious. Once we noticed it was starting to lighten up outside, we asked for our dessert bill. The hostess, who handles the bills, came over and told us our deserts were on the house because they were sorry for the inconvenience of the rain. It is rain. It wasn't their fault. When I took out money to place on the table anyhow, at least 3 waiters protested saying our dessert was on them because they just wanted us to have a good evening. I left them an extra tip anyhow. I will go back to La Viola the next time I am in the area.
