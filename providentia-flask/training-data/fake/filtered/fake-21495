Went on a Saturday night for a late dinner, the place was packed. Â Think it was all the locals (like us) checking out the new place in the neighborhood. Husband had the burger and I had the fish and chips. Very tasty and well cooked - not always the way when you're the last customers on a Saturday night. Good drinks and friendly staff.
