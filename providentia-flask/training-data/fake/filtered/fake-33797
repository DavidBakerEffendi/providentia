As good as Tex Mex gets!  My family and I have been going there since the placed opened, and the kids menu was $.99.  Endless, dynamite salsa and chips.  Beef Fajita's on the money, and two people can't finish the portion for 2 at about 12 bucks. Great appetizers, drinks are nice and the service is fine.  Lots of the critics I see, talk of the noise level or the wait time.  The place is BUSY, excellent, and inexpensive, that is a good thing for them  Secrets to beating the crowds?  Go early.  We go mon-fri before 5:30 and we go right in.  You can't do this on the weekend though.  Enjoy the country music, and try a bowl of Gumbo!!  YeeHaaa.
