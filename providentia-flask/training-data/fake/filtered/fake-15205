If you decide to go to Thursty Koala on Saturday night it's best to make a reservation because it gets busy very quickly and there is a good reson for this. I have crossed 2 bridges to get to this place and would do it again in a heartbeat. The lamb lollies are mouth-watering, the Coolangatta crostini is a real delight. as well as a herb citrus salmon. We had Pavlova and Lamington for dessert - Pavlova is very light and decadent, and Lamington is a heavier and sweeter dessert but both are very tasty. The staff and the chef are friendly, attentive and positive. The vibe is young and hip but not over-the-top. All in all I highly recommend this place and look forward to going there again.
