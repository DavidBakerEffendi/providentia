If I can score it no star, I will do so.  Unfortunately the system doesn't allow me to. Let me try to make it brief here.  First I couldn't even locate the restaurant/cafe because it was so tiny and had no sign outside (it was a dark winter early evening).  I thought it was part of the boutique of next store.  So I finally found it after walking up and down the block, sat down and ordered a bowl of chicken soba and a tofu appetizer (I forgot the exact names because I tried to forget this horrible experience!).  Later, the waitress delivered a small plate.  The plate was about the size of my palm (I am not exaggerating!).  There were 8/9 nail size mini bean curds (it was like tofu texture but more condensed), a few very thin shredded daikon and shiso leaves, and a few small particles of beans.  Initially I thought it was the topping for my tofu appetizer.  When my noodles arrived, I asked the waitress where was my tofu appetizer.  She pointed at the tiny palm-sized plate and said that was it.  I picked up the plate in surprise and asked, "Are you charging me this for $5?"  She said yes.  I said no more.  I was stunned and angry.  I knew $5 wasn't a lot of money.  But $5 for that tiny little thing was just way out of line!  I felt I was scammed, and ripped off.  So I finished my meal in a rush because I just wanted to get out of there.  The noodle was not good at all either.  The soup was watery and had no flavor.  It was a total nightmare.  I have been to many restaurants or cafes or stands, this would be my worst experience.  I positively definitely absolutely am not going back there again.
