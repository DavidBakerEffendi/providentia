The place is mediocre. The service was as bad as it gets! The guy at the register yells at you to place your order, and wants you to get out of his face as soon as you pay. I have tasted a lot of falafel in my life, and this was the worst ever. It was a lettuce sandwich with less than four falafel balls. Didn't fill me up at all and ended up crossing the street to Chipotle to get a burrito. I truly have no idea why it is rated so high here.
