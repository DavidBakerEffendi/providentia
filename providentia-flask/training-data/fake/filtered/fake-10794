This is the kind of place to try because of  the name and experience but not somewhere you'll be dying to come back to over and over. It looks like an upscale retro/funky diner. Service is excellent. The price is a bit overpriced but you're paying for a name so understandable. We ate the griddled cheese deluxe, bobby blue burger and beer battered onion rings with a Boylan creme soda. Grilled cheese: it tasted good but I think some flavor was lost because there was just so much packed in there, there wasn't any distinctive flavor. Really messy to eat. Burger: "good, nothing over the top wow. I'd be just as happy with a TGI Fridays burger" in my husbands words. Onion rings: ok. They're the big wide rings and were kinda mushy. I didn't really find any of the specialty sauces fit with the rings so I just stuck with ketchup. The sauces were ketchup, mustard, chipotle ketchup, burger sauce and jalapeño sauce. I guess they can be used on burger or sides. All and all if you're in the area it's fun to give it a shot and to try some bobby flay but it's not the kind of thing you'll crave if you live near by.
