Our 4th time here and each time It's more enjoyable. 3 1/2 hour meal each course more delicious than the next. Our waiter Matt was excellent helped us pair the wines with the courses My husband did the regular tasting and I did the vegetarian. He loved the scallop best and I thought the squash and fried green tomato were equally delicious. For dessert I loved the fruit plate and he tasted 3 sorbets. After the check when we were full to capacity They brought complimentary small Irresistible chocolates! Can't wait to go back!
