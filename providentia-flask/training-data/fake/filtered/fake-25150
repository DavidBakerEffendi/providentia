I was very pleasantly surprised when I happened upon this restaurant on Fairmount.  It was hard to decide among all of the tasty-sounding items on the menu.  The place is bustling; there's a hum of activity and conversation.  The staff is friendly and attentive. I've been twice.  The first time, I had the scallop ceviche and the krispy (their spelling) kale salad.  They were delicious--fresh and flavorful.  I returned and had the kale salad again, with a cheeseburger.  This time, the egg on the salad was undercooked.  The server said she comped the entire salad but she only took off $2.  I didn't balk at that, since I ate all of the kale and just left the egg behind (very easy to do when it's RAW).  The burger was delicious.  I didn't finish the hand-cut fries but they were tasty. I will give them another try.  There are many more menu items I want to taste.
