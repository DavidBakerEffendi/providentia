I came here with a friend recently on a whim. I can be incredibly picky about service, which my fiance and friends constantly give me a hard time about, but I was very pleased with the service here. We always had our glasses filled, and the food was perfectly paced. The Pork and Mango quesadillas were INCREDIBLE, the Caprese tower was amazing, and my Roasted pear and arugula salad was one of the best salads I've ever had. My friend had the burger and a side of vegetables and both were amazing (we sampled each others). My fiance and I are planning on testing out more dishes to determine if this is a winner for our rehearsal dinner!
