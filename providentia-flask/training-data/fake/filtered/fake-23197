We order out on a weekly basis and I thought I would give this place a try because we've been looking for a favorite burger joint. Worst take out experience EVER!! Placed our $50 order a little after 6pm. Called at 8 to find out what was holding up the delivery. They said it just left and would be here momentarily. Called again at 8:30 because still no food. They "looked into it" and discovered it was never made. At 9pm my 4 year old is still up an hour past his bedtime waiting for his dinner and I get a call that they want mue to pay $3 extra for mushrooms that GrubHub didn't charge for and the food has STILL not even left the restaurant!!!! The owner refused to speak to me. Never got to try the food because I told them if they expected me to pay for the mushrooms ($3 for mushrooms on a burger, besides!!) after waiting for 3 hours than they could just cancel the order. What a nightmare. With customer service like that they deserve to go out of business.
