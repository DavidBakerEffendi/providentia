amazing place to pick up a chicken and a couple of sides to go.  The chicken is incredibly juicy and clean-tasting. This place serves the best chicken in bk for the price (i don't care if your favorite spot puts truffles under the bird's armpits and caviar up its nostrils).  The mash with jalapeno puree and mac n cheese are both really good too. Also,  try some of the sauces they have.  I always get at least one extra just to try out.  Let's begin a chicken debate (rules: the bird cannot be fried OR cost $100).
