When I finally tried this place out at the suggestions of a few friends, I was disappointed. I had an Oreo adult milkshake which was probably the only thing I fairly enjoyed. The cheesesteak fries did not taste freshly cooked, barely had any steak, and therefore way overpriced ($12). The PYT burger (also $12) was bland and boring. Granted I didn't order a crazy burger, I figured I'd try a "classic" first because basics right? But since that wasn't satisfying I haven't been back to eat there. I sat at the bar and ordered with the bartender, no service complaints except that it was a bit slow even though it was not busy at all. A month ago I went back late-night for a few drinks and sat outside at one of the fire pits which didn't work. No one ever came over to take our order, we went inside to the bar for our drinks -- Maybe it's not customary for them to do so if you're not eating? I'm not sure. Overall, totally unimpressed with this place so I won't be back.
