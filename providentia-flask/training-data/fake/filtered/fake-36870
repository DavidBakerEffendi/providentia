Love this spot, happened on it a while back and have been back a few times. Last night tried the Fresh Past w/ Rabbit Ragu and it was amazing. They were busy but able to get us in w/in 1/2 hour at 8:00 on a beautiful Friday night. The hostess got us a couple drinks while we were waiting and kept us updated on the time, felt really well taken care of. Â Also loved the berries with some kind of balsamic sauce, definitely do with the the suggested cordial pairing awesome!. Need to get back to try the brunch menu.
