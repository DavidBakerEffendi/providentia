Let me say this for a start, I WOULD NEVER go back to that place even if you paid me. As soon as we pulled up to the parking you are notified that there is a $10 charge for a car. Then, $10 cover charge for a guy. ALL tables were reserved so the only free spot to sit was the couch. 10 minutes after being seated there we were notified that we MUST buy a bottle for $125 in order to sit there or we would have to move by the bar. REALLY!!! We order a bottle for $125( same bottle you can get for $30 from a liquor store), and surprise surprise, the $125 is now $162 because tax and $34 tip is added. Music was horrible. Mainly ghetto and latin at the end. Had a free twerking show right in front of us. Then, if it wasn't enough that the music and prices suck, you will be freezing if you are close to the windows. They are ALL wide open with a 60 degree weather outside. I had high hopes for that place but I would never even consider going back and I will make sure to warn people from going there. I have been going to clubs and bars for years and have never been so disappointed as with The Lobby.
