As many other reviewers have noted, the view from the main dinning room is fairly spectacular. We had the pleasure of dinning here on a Saturday night at peak time. This was both a pleasure and pain. The restaurant, and adjacent bar, were absolutely packed. So much, that it was difficult to find a place to stand at the bar. The food was very good, but not spectacular. My wife selected the salmon. The fish was cooked perfectly (seared on the outside and very rare on the inside). The sides were good, but no more than that. I had the special of the night. The meat was cooked very well, but I found that the dish was accompanied with a truffle oil sauce that was perhaps to over powering. Desert was very good. The pastries were original and tasty. The cheese platter was also good, but for the price should have come with a better assortment of bread (versus the standard toasted baguette slices). From a food perspective, I would have settled on 4 stars. What pulled the rating back to three stars was service. The restaurant didn't honor our reservation time (we were seated about 50 minutes after our reservation). Furthermore, we found very LONG spans of time between being seated, ordering, first course and main course. It was clear that the dinning room was understaffed relative to the number of seated patrons. In summary, this is a great place for a special occasion. The dinning room is great, people looked fantastic and once again the view was great. The food was yummy (4 / 5 stars) but service was really slow (a busy restaurant should not be a patrons concern - simply bring on more staff), which ultimately couldn't be overlooked. One last point - get dressed up. Â The pattrons looked great and you should too!
