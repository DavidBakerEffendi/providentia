FINALLY I found a burger that made my boyfriend smile- The Showstopper - a totally amazing combo of burger and grilled cheese sandwich!!!  I had a great blue cheese and chicken salad with sweet potato fries done nice and crisp!!  Great menu - can't wait to come back and try the pretzel dog and the Manchego delights!!!
