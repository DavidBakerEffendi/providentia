GREAT restaurant to eat at whether it's a casual dinner with a group of friends or an intimate date with a loved one.  Service is excellent and the food is superb.  What else can I say? My friend, my husband, and I ordered the zutto pork belly buns, gangnam style pork belly buns, zutto chili wings, an assortment of sushi, and the spicy miso ramen.  WOW, all of these dishes blew us away, especially the zutto pork belly buns.  My personal favorite was the gangnam style pork buns, as it had a nice kick to it.  The sushi was fresh.  The ramen had a pho-like taste, though it was much crisper and cleaner tasting than pho.   I've never gone back to the same restaurant twice after moving to NY (there's just too many good ones!), but THIS one...I can become a regular for.
