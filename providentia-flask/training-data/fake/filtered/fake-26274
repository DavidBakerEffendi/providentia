I went here for lunch, and for $12 I had soup, spring roll, and pad thai. The food was delicious, although please beware -- it is spicy. I was told the medium spicy was very spicy and they were right! I had to excuse myself from the table twice to cool myself off in the ladies room. And then I realized that this is place where the pervy owner had placed a video camera in the toilet! Yikes! And I think he was our server. What a freak!!! But I still like the food.
