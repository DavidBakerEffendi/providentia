All I can say is amazing!!! We were a little hesitant when we realized this restaurant was not in the middle of little Italy but it was so well worth the extra few steps. The service was amazing, the atmosphere was awesome but the food was unbelievable!!! Absolutely the best meal I have had in a long while. They accommodated 9 of us without problem (with reservations) I did change the time twice. We were celebrating my mothers birthday and they made it a night we will not soon forget! Thank you !!!
