My husband and I went here for our anniversary. The service was impeccable, the food was lovely, and the wait staff was wonderful. I will say the Lemondrop I ordered was quite strong, but the food made up for it. I had the spinach tortellini, which was delicious whilst my husband had the steak. We will certainly be coming back here over and over again. Well worth the price. We had an amazing time.
