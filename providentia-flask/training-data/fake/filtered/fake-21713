Every star fades eventually.  Joe Allen's has enjoyed a far longer run than the kitchy Broadway "flops" they proudly display on their wall, but has ended up a has-been just the same.  Even after its prime, there was a cool old-school vibe about the place... a New York Theatre Disrtict Version of L.A.'s Brown Derby.  Sadly, they have ended up just another tourist trap along Restaurant Row with uninspired food and shabby service.  There are far better places to dine in the neighborhood.
