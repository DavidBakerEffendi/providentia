Went to Ibiza last Friday because of a Living Social coupon.  Food was good, but service was terrible.  At first it was fine because the restaurant was not busy.  However, as business picked up, the service declined.  Waiters tried to take our plates before we were finished (more than once during the meal) and then at the end of our meal within seconds of finishing dessert, the hostess rudely asked us to leave because there were people waiting to be seated.  It was appalling and we will never return to this restaurant after being treated so poorly.
