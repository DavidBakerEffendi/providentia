This place was amazing: service, food, atmosphere, and price. We came to La Fourno in a rather sticky situation, needing a private area for a group of 25 and the owner Al was extremely accommodating On very short notice and a very limited budget, we were able to get a 3 course meal featuring antipasto, a choice of 3 entrees, and dessert with tea and coffee. Al himself offered to take care of a girl with dietary restrictions and followed up often to make sure we got the best experience possible. The servers were amazing and even sang happy birthday and gave a cannoli to a member of our group who's birthday was coming up. The food came out fast given the amount of people. The appetizers were beautifully plated and the pastries for dessert were fresh, warm, and absolutely delicious. My only concern was that the entrees were rather small (there were only 5 pieces of shrimp and some spinach for one of them) but this was understandable due to the price we were paying. Overall, it was a fabulous experience and I can definitely see us going back.
