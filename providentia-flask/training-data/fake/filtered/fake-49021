I visited this resturant and when we were fist seated thet=y seated near a protrudung a wall with no room to seat my wife asked to be seated at another table clearly the place was empty for good reason I had the salmon and my spouse had ship penne and both dishes were over salted that all we tasted was salt..... I ask for the check and paid w/ 100 dollor bill and was given 25 singles as part of my change with no explanation or apolgies. This resturants food is poor at best and the sevice is rude... I WOULD NOT SEND MY WORST ENEMY TO EAT AT THIS RESTURANT.
