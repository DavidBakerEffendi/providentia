Really enjoyed the clams fra diavollo appetizer portion.  Had to drink the leftover sauce with a spoon it was so good.  Salad great too.  We sat on the outdoor patio enjoying the unseasonably warm March spring day. I only wish the restrooms were cleaner, since that is never a good sign.  The granite vanities in ladies room were dirty.  I had to put down towels to protect my handbag.  The toilets smelled.  Just needs some attention to detail. I'd like to see this incarnation of the former Rusty Scupper make it.
