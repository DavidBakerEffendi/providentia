I went here today for the first with my mom.  I live in Philly, so we rarely see each other.  I wanted to sit and have a leisurely lunch with her,but that was ruined by the sheer rudeness of most of the staff.....very uninviting, staff made us feel like we were beggers on the corner, not welcomed customers....No greetings, no  smiles, no pleasant nods, requests for water, delayed, man marching past tables every 5 minutes made me feel like we were prisoners being watched.   Food was cold, mediocre, the only item that stood out was the friend plantains.  Everything else was below average.  This business won't last.  They have no customer service skills at all.   Will never go back.  Sorry....
