This has been hands down one of my worst dining experiences in Park Slope.  I've been here 3 times.  The first two times the food was thoroughly mediocre and the price was pretty high.  The last time, the food was just awful, including the salad.  IMHO it's pretty hard to make a bad salad, but Blue Ribbon managed it.  I kept going back because this place always gets great reviews and some of my friends like to go, but after my last experience, I'm never going again.  Not only was the food bad but the service was slow.  They brought out cold food intermittently, didn't want to answer basic questions about meals (my GF has a nut allergy and trying to find out if a dish had nuts in it was painful), and took forever.  (The bus boy filling up water glasses was great though).  I had the hanger steak and it was awful.  Started with a goat cheese salad which not only was terrible, but the portion was ludicrously small.   There were literally 4 small lettuce leafs on the plate.  My GF had some kind of pepper shrimp appetizer that she ate as an entree and even though it was small, she didn't bother finishing it.
