The food is very high quality and the service was pretty good but the NOISE was awful.  We couldn't hear the waitress and had to ask her over and over to repeat herself.  We couldn't hear each other and finally gave up trying to talk.  We asked to be moved and we were but the noise was just as bad. The table next to us was only about one foot away and I could hear everything they were saying even though they weren't talking loudly. It was so distressing that I don't think I want to go there again despite the good food.  There are many, quieter restaurants with equally good food in the Burlington area.
