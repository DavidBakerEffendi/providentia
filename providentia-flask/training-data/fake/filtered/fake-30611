This place SEEMS to be a nice place and the owner is nice but it's not what all these other reviews have it cracked up to be. There's nothing healthy about it so don't let all these other reviews of "healthy food" distort your judgement. I am a healthy freak and this comes no where close to healthy! Second they are WAY to pricey! Their chicken is overpriced! I bought one of their chicken entrees and it was thirteen dollars for two pieces of chicken over Israeli couscous! Thirteen dollars for a drumstick and a breast are you serious!?! The chicken sucked and had no qualities that it was described by Gilas son. Worse part is that all of these other reviews will probably make you want to go here but to all of you people who like to eat at least somewhat good food and don't want to regret spending to much money on food that your not even going to enjoy that much then DON"T EAT HERE! just saying
