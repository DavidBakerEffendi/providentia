I have been going to Get Fresh practically since it opened and I have to say I am, without a single doubt in my mind, obsessed!  The food is amazing--everything I've eaten there is delicious (brunch and dinner).  I have been at the restaurant during the day and have seen the vendors come in with fresh milk, vegetables, eggs, meat...amazing.  No big SYSCO trucks here.  It's great to go to a restaurant and know that what you're putting in your body hasn't been over-processed or tainted with something you can only make with chemicals and Bunsen burner.  Just pure, good food.  Which is especially important for those of you looking to stay healthy and find a place to bring the tiny-tots. And no, the waitresses DO NOT "all look alike."  Not a very nice thing to say about other people.  I WILL say that they are all pleasant, hard-working, and eager to make your dining experience the best it can be.  Same with the owner who greets customers at the door and checks in to make sure everyone is doing well. Regarding the food, everything is absolutely delicious, but I will suggest a few of my brunch favorites: the egg sandwich (love it with crispy bacon), the pancakes, the truffled eggs, the granola, and the turkey burger (oh my goodness it's amazing!).  For dinner (A $25 prix-fixe at this place?   A STEAL!): the scallops, the pork,  the beet salad, the chicken (yes, a place where the chicken is actually perfect), and the vegetarian platter.  But, like I said, everything is ridiculously good.  You can also BYOB or order it from the store down the street and they will bring it to you!  And now that the weather is nice, you can sit outside in the gorgeous space behind the restaurant! Here ends my long and honest review.  Five stars for Get Fresh!!
