Pros: 1. Great homey Italian pasta 2. David the server - incredible service Cons: outside of David, hit or miss service.  There is other great Italian restaurants to go to without the wait. We were quoted a 1.5 hour wait.  We end up waiting 3 hours to finally get a seat. There are dozens of other great restaurants around the corner we would go to had we known it would be an 11pm dinner rather than 9:30pm dinner.  We have to mention to the host that we waited double the time we were quoted and she ensured us we would get two free desserts.  Server comes to take our orders - no friendly or apologetic greeting.  Get our entrees and she is no where to be found.  Have to flag down other staff to refill waters or get something on the side.  David is the only one who brings refills or service and packs up our meals and offers more wine and brings a dessert on the house. I finally mention the lack of service and attentiveness to the manager who is originally apologetic.  After the talk -- no service still.  No acknowledgment from our original waitress, no acknowledgement of the other dessert on the house.  It takes me having to mention to a bus boy that we were ready for our check + having to physically walk back to the manager to say we want our check which is offensive after the experience we had. Long story short: great authentic Italian pasta. Not worth the wait if you are treated the way we were.  If David wasn't there, it would have been a front to back awful experience.  Will probably not go back and instead go to one of the other multiple amazing Italian places in Manhattan.
