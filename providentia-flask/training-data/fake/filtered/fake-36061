Food here is amazing. It is a bit pricey but is worth every cent. The place is very small and without reservation is hard to get a table on Friday and Saturday night. My personal favorite is hummus as an appetizer and I almost always order chicken as a main course. I am giving it four stars just for lack of the outdoor seating and the fact that the bar is too small, but when it comes to the quality of service and the food they deserve 6 stars.
