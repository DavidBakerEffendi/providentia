I've been to hundreds of pizza joints in NYC, and this is definitely in the top 5.  The pizza is cooked in a brick oven.  There aren't too many of those left in NYC.  Because of the brick oven, the pizza is very fresh.  It's not too oily and tastes amazing.  Everytime I go to NYC (and I go often), I always stop by here.  It's a bit on the pricey side for pizza (hence the 4 stars), and because the pizza is cooked using a brick oven, the wait time is rather long.  However, the final product is so good, it's well worth it.
