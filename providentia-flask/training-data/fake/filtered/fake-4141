Thank you for existing Double Windsor, I really mean that.  I feel lucky to have DW as my local.  The best thing for me about the bar is the staff, all the bartenders and kitchen staff are friendly and interesting (and easy on the eyes, uncalled for I know).  The owners seem like industry pros who know quality product as the beer selection is great and the food is also very good.  I love the pub style food service and the open and warm decor and set up of the place.  Keep on truckin' DW!
