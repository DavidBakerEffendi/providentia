Last night we ordered in a whole artichoke pizza. My son said it was the best. Not sure what happened! I was really looking forward to it but was very disappointed? I've seen the lines to get a slice and heard it was great. When did it change? It was the most disgusting tasting whatever ...I would not describe it as pizza. It was bland white sauce maybe undercooked? The flavor was pasty like a basic white sauce made with chicken stock and I had one leaf of artichoke on my slice.  About 3 hrs later I awoke with severe stomach pains and an intense headache. Then diarrhea.  What the ***k went wrong? So I got a bad pie? I make a to die for artichoke baked dip with tons of flavor and artichoke that's what I expected, not a poor version of béchamel and a leaf of actual artichoke. I will never eat it again or every order from there again.
