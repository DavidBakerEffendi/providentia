I think this place opened only a month ago, yet it seems like the hit of WH Center.  I have been in a few times now and the set up works great.  I was surprised to see how big it is inside. Beer selection is excellent.  I went with Murphy's since it was the monthly special.  Very crowded at night, so it took a bit to get the drink.  Its tough to hold a restaurant to a review with only a month of experience. Wings were excellent if you like the sweet sauce vs hot.  Nice a meaty.  I also tried the mussels.  Huge fan of those.  Great flavor and very tender. Free popcorn is a nice touch.  Does get a bit loud in the place, probably due to the ceiling.  Otherwise, great atmosphere.  I can't wait until things settle down in a little bit, so they can get in their groove.  MORE BANDS PLEASE.
