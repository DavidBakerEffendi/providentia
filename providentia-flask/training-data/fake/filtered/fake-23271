Had lunch here today with my husband and we're still talking about it, and how we  wish  we'd gone to 5 guys instead! People...don't believe the hype they're dishing here.   I ordered a burger with seared foie gras...HA! First  I had to peel off the HUGE piece of lettuce and lift off the HUNK of tomato just to find the sorry mangy piece, (who puts lettuce and tomato on a burger with foie gras!!??? that's crazy talk!) My first bite into the burger had me searching for salt....Burger Baby....SALT YOUR MEAT!!! Salt brings out natural flavors for crying out loud! and off course the salt didn't help any after the fact...I was NOT happy as I was looking forward to my first foie gras burger  :( .  I also ordered the duck fat fries, and when my husband compared them to his regular fries he thought there must have been some kind of mistake because they tasted like the same ho hum fries he had.  I could say so much more about this place but you know the saying, If you have nothing nice to say...blah blah blah. I will say that my meal alone came to $24 dollars...a burger with semi RAW foie gras...a hunk of bland beef , plain ol' fries and a glass of tap water cost me $24....really?? fool me once burger baby...fool me once.
