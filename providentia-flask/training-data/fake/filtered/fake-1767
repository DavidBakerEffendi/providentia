We came across this restaurant while trying to find another, and we were glad we popped in. The decor is great - dark, full of character. Food is excellent and reasonably priced, and the wine we were offered was perfect for the food we ordered. This is quite a new restaurant, but it's worth trying for the great location (near Tribeca Grand) and the welcoming staff and good food.
