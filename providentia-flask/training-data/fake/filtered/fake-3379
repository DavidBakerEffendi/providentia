So, the bartender was really nice. Beers were fairly priced, my honey comb negroni was awesome, the cupcakes were clutch, but my friend's Pimm's cup just wasn't good. At all. She ended up not feeling good and not wanting the alcohol anyway, and didn't complain and give the bartender a chance to fix it, but they could have easily gotten 4 or maybe even 5 stars if her drink hadn't been bad.
