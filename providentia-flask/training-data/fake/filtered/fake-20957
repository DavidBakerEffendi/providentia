The pizza is good, all right? But there should be a separate rating system on Yelp to denote when something is just too overrated. The pizza certainly deserves its four stars, but the experience of the place takes it down a notch. Main thing being that you'll wait forever with tourist families and over-zealous pizza religiosos to get in. If you come at the wrong time in the afternoon (think you're smart, eh?) then you'll catch the 2-hour downtime of the coal oven cleaning and you'll sit there without any table service (and be lucky you're sitting! People are just standing around outside rain or shine!). You know what? There's enough amazing pizza in this city to spare your family the hours of annoyance and just go get yourself a slice at any of the other fantastic 4+ star places -- dad will be grateful, mom will be grateful that dad's grateful, the kids couldn't care less, and grandpa wasn't going to understand anyway.
