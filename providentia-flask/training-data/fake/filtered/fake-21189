What a refreshing new restaurant! I work in the area, and have heard nothing but rave reviews so I decided to grab some dinner at the bar. The interior is beautiful and well thought out: rustic and modern and decorated with wildflowers galore. We were impressed by the extensive wine and whiskey offerings, abut I decided to try the Philadelphian, one of their specialty cocktails made with bourbon and brown sugar, champagne and chocolate bitters.... WOW. Best cocktail I have had in, well, ever. For dinner I had the Roasted Chicken, and will definitely be back for it. The chicken itself had perfectly crisp skin and moist meat, the grits were amazing and perfectly seasoned, as were the mushrooms. And the chocolate bourbon beignets.... heavenly. Try Cooperage out for yourselves.!
