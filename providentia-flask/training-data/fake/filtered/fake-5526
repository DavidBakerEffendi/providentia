I read that Veronica's kitchen was typically open until about 3 PM. After wanderning for a while looking for it (some sites say it's on front st. -- this seems to be outdated information, I found it on water st.) I was incredibly disappointed to see it closed up. This was a shame as I was excited to try it, so I poked my head around back and there were still two workers who seemed to be cleaning up. I asked if they were closed and they said they could try to throw something together for me. They didn't have any sides left but made some jerk chicken for me. They were incredibly friendly and seemed happy to help me rather than annoyed about making food after they thought they were done for the day. For $6 I got 3 pieces of jerk chicken on top of what seemed to be some sort of cabbage and carrot salad. The chicken was absolutely incredible, maybe the best I've ever had. Incredibly flavorful with a great crust, while the chicken itself was tender and falling off the bone. It had a great balance of heat and flavor.. Definitely my favorite place I ate at during my last trip to New York, and is my go-to recommendation when someone asks for food in the area
