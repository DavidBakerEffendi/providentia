I love this trendy place! I recently brought my boyfriend there for the first time and he was very pleased with it as well. We had a great waiter named James. He was very polite and made us feel very welcomed. I am allergic to everything and he was kind enough to literally go to the cooks to verify how the items I selected were prepared to prevent me having a reaction. He also gave us some great drink suggestions. Everything he said taste good was amazing!! When you go, ask for James!! He was able to manage Â a lot of tables and always walked by to check on us, something I noticed that many waiters do not do anymore! Dragonfly is just a great place to go, great atmosphere and the food is just irresistible!!
