This place gets 5 stars because of the efforts of it's manager. Well, that's not entirely true. The food was absolutely amazing. It was about a year and a half ago that my girlfriend and I went there for breakfast. The place was fairly crowded and we were seated at a table that did not have a great view. We saw one that was open by the window and asked a bus boy if we could be moved, he said that's fine, go ahead. We were re-seated and the waiter (looking flustered) took our drink order. Then we waited 20 minutes. Still no drinks, it was clear he forgot about us. We finally decided F**k this, let's get out of here. We told the hostess on our way out that we had ordered drinks 20 minutes ago and still hadn't seen them, then left the boat. We were probably 150 yards away from the boat when we heard 'excuse me! Sir, madame! Please wait!'  It was the manager jogging towards us in his suit and tie (and it was a hot day) He caught up with us and said 'please come back, I apologize, but I don't want you to leave here feeling anything but satisfaction.' We were on a meter but his persistence brought us back onto the boat. Our drinks were waiting for us and our order was taken immediately, although at this point we ordered it to go as we didn't want to get a parking ticket. Our entire order was there in under 7 minutes with an additional bonus of lobster bisque and something else I can't remember, and the manager comped the entire meal! Drinks and all! We took it to a park and had a wonderful picnic. To sum up: The manager of this place deserves a raise, I have never been so completely turned around in my opinion of a , And the food was some of the best I've ever had!  Kudos! PS sorry it took so long to write this review, I told myself I would do it the following day
