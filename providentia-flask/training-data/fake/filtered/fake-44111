This is one of the best bargains in NJ. The all you can eat sushi is a great value and it is all very fresh and tasty too. The owner (Jack) does a daily trip to the NYC fish market to personally select what will be served that day. I moved 45 minutes away and still take a monthly trip because it is worth it. Don't be afraid if you are not a big fan of sushi: they make a lot of cooked dishes like Shrimp or Chicken Teriyaki and many other Asian dishes. If you can avoid a Friday or Saturday night you will get much better service as the place is packed on weekends. If you must go on the weekend, try going before 6:30 or you will have to wait.
