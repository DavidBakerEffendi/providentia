I was in the area for a couple of days because I was visiting the law school there. I could not decide where to eat so I saw this place and decided to try it out. I love the side dishes more than the main dish that I got, which was the Chap Chae (Really don't know how to spell this). Â I want to go back for the cucumber kimchi though. I wish I could just order a bucket of those things and call it a day.
