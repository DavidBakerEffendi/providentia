I was visiting my friends this afternoon for Christmas, and they took me to this hibachi restaurant, before we reached there, I thought it is just like the ones I went before.  surprised me this place is amazing,  they have nice liquor bar, if you like to drink you can just sit on the liquor bar and order the sushi :) but we choose to sit on the hibachi table,  and watching hibachi chef performing theatrical hibachi artistry show, preparing food right before our eyes.  we also tried some items from sushi menu, the sushi are out of my expectation, they are fresh and delicateness. one more thing about the interior decor, they have the pond with fishes, beautiful I would definitely recommend my family and friends to this hibachi restaurant.
