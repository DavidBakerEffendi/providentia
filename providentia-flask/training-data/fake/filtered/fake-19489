Awful! I liked this place for dinner and drinks however I will never go here again! I've had the worst experience with attempting to have a private party here. I have called multiple times, sent emails and no response. I went in one morning to talk w someone and the manager spent a couple minutes talking to me and then said he could no longer stand there talking to me that he had things to do. So I took my business elsewhere and will never step foot in there again!
