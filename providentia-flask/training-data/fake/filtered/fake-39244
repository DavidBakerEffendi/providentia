The food was good and there was a lot of it! I'm used to small New York City portions and this was the first time in ages that I've taken leftovers home from a restaurant. The brownie and tiramisu desserts were really good. The biggest drawback at Galli is the noise level. We had to shout to have a conversation. The second biggest drawback is the single bathroom for both men and women - at one point there were 8 people on line. If you bring anyone over 40 here, make sure you have a flashlight app on your phone, because the restaurant does not provide enough light for aging eyes to see the menu. The food is a really good for this price level, and the service is fine too. I would come back on a weeknight when it's less crowded so as to avoid screaming over the noise and the long wait for the bathroom.
