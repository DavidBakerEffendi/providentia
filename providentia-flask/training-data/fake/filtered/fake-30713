I went in here for the first time this week and i was blown away. My friends and I came in to watch the Bball game and it was great. The service was wonderful , the food was to die for Much better then the burger king across the street. They even told us we could order a few beers for delivery from the liquor store up the street. We spent about two hours in there and the owner gave us a sample of alot of the things on the menu from wings, empanads, the sports fries, and sweet corn nuggets. All of it went great with those big juicy burgers. The Ball Hog is my favorite so far. This is my new Lunch spot.  Everyone should try it out,  you will fall in love.
