Took the family to Princeton to see what was new and interesting. We came upon the new patio dining area outside the Yankee Doodle Tap Room at the Nassau Inn and gave it a try. Lots of umbrellas and misting fans to keep things cool with comfortable seating. Service was enthuasiatic and attentive. It looked like a special menu for the outside and we ate a bit light going for appetizers and the excellent salads. Great humus presentation with nice flatbreads - good wings - very substantial and creative salads featuring interesting use of fruits and cheeses. We will definitely return - it will be a great people watching spot when the students return and the pace in town picks up. A great addition to a town that really lends itself to outside dining.
