Great pizza especially the margherita! Also tried their meatball sub, a pizzeria staple in my book, and it was also very good. Very clean place which makes the dine in option available when we're not in a rush. The only thing holding them back from 5 stars is that on a one occasion the person taking our order had an attitude with me on the phone when I was giving her special requests on one of the items I was ordering. I'm sure it was busy since it was a Friday night but no reason to get snappy with a customer. Otherwise, this place is my top choice for pizza and Italian food!
