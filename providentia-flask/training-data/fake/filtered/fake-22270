I came in on a Tuesday right when they opened. I was only one there so I can't comment on how crowded it gets. The interior was cozy and the owner was very friendly. I had the smoked salmon eggs benedict and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever eaten. The salmon looked like it had been smoked in house and was complemented beautifully by the pico de gallo and the adobo cream sauce. I have nothing but good things to say about this place.
