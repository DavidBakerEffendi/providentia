Was at the psychodramtheseries.com premier last night at in LES and Melt Shop was there serving the most amazing grilled cheese ever.   Loved the food and loved the staff. Then I find out that they donated all their tips to The AJ Project non profit that psychodrama supports.  Kudos to the staff and their kindness and support of The AJ Project and Psychodrama!
