Had dinner there this past Saturday with my husband and another couple. Food was fabulous, the service was outstanding. It was nice to be able to sit, relax and chat. Never rushed to leave, we sat, ate and chatted for well over and hour. Would highly recommend. Will definitely stay in town and eat there more often.
