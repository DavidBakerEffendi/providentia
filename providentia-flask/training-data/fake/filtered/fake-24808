The wine and beer selection is phenomenal.  However, the food is hit or miss.  Plain Wiener schnitzel is very bland, but if you order the Zigeunerschnitzel the sauce is very good.  The gulasch soup, Bavarian pretzle, Bratwurst, french fries and spaetzle are excellent, but the semmelknodle are the worst I've ever eaten-no flavor and a strange consistency.  The radi were tasty, but a bit limp.  This restaurant could be a truly great with just a few enhancements to the quality and flavor of the food.
