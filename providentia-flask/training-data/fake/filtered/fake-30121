Excellent price for delicious sandwiches, everything is so fresh! Â My first time here was last week, and its so close to work, I will def come again to try out so much more of their varied menu. This time i had the french cheese sandwich and it was a great treat. I am sure I need to come here more often to try out the rest of the menu, and I Will repair my review depending on that :)
