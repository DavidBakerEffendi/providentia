WOW! Amazing food and excellent serivce is a rare find these days but I found it here at Primo! On the road one day a few months  ago I passed primos on my way to work and noticed there slice and soda combo meal deal and decided to hit them up at lunch. When I came in i was promptly greated by the most friendly counter girl i have seen in a place in a long time .  The pizza case was full of so many things i couldnt at first  decide . I took the managers advise on the grandma pie slices and let me tell you im now addicted. Iv been going to primo  now  twice a week for lunch and  ordering in to my home almost every friday night. my kids love their pie's and my husband and i can not get enough of their penne vodka and shrimp franchase. Everytime i call Im greated by the most polite people and im treated as if im family . they have great deals great food and great service ! tripple threat place again a rare find these days!!
