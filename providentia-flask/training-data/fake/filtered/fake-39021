I went here last tuesday for lunch.  It was nice and quiet at the time I went, and the bartender/server was not only beautiful, but awesome! it was a plus.  She was the only one on, and was very helpful about helping me choose a wrap as it was my first time.  I ate the Philadelphia Jalapeño Cheese Steak on a Hoagie and it was DELICIOUS! I highly recommend this place not only for their service (recommend a girl named Renee for service if you can), but also for the food! Went back today and it was 5 dollar wraps on Mondays. She wasn't there, but still worth the while.
