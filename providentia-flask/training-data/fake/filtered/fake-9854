I took my wife to Marc Forgione in NYC for her birthday because we had such a great meal at his place at Revel in Atlantic City. Before dinner the waiter brought around some appetizer bites (can't remember what they were ... except they were great) compliments of the chef. And what followed was an unbelievably good meal. The steak and pork chops we ordered were both cooked perfectly and mouth-wateringly good. The apple pie with black pepper ice-cream was delicious. And best of all Marc himself was there and when the waiter told him it was my wife's birthday, he came out to give her his good wishes and was gracious enough to take a picture with her. Â Great food. Great place. Highly recommended.
