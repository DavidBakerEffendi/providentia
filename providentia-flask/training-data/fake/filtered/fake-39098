I ate her with during a girl's weekend away.  Having never been to NY AND have a food allergy, i was nervous about where we'd end up for dinner. I'm picky about restaraunts  and they absolutly did not disappoint.  Alfredo (our waitor) was curteous, friendly, prompt and didn't linger and pester us.  I had striped sea bass and the others in my party had pasta with seafood in it. All the food was fresh, perfectly cooked and full of flavor.   I'd drive back to NY just to eat here again!  Awesome.
