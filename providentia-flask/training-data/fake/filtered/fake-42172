the food at Traif was great, however we were told to have a drink at Shiksa before our table was ready. The hostess was SO RUDE and obnoxious that she should be reminded that she is behind the counter not in front...It put a real negative start to our evening. We have somewhat confusion with our bill (no ones fault, including the bar) and when she came racing down the street after us, more then once because she couldn't get the story correct, Â we gave her credit cards and all she can say was you don't expect me to take this back and fourth, don't you have cash...I told her no and she said she was run it back after awkward silence and her telling us that she is working and cant take the time to help out. She then took the card and did not return, only to be equally as rude to my wife when she had to go back to collect the card that she had no intention of returning, SHE SHOULD BE FIRED! however, the waitress at Traif was so fantastic and kept apologizing for the women's behavior and she would try to make up our bad experience. on a positive note traif was great, food awesome...3 stars because regardless if the food is good the hostess was horrible.
