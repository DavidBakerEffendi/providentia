The worst value in New York by a long shot,...and we have eaten everywhere (and consider Jean Georges at $150 a plate a tremendous value).   The pasta dishes are literally four or five spoonfuls; it was almost funny when they put the bowls in front of us (it reminded me of the Stonehedge scene in Spinal Tap).  The 8-ounce coke was $5.00.  A lesson in marketing and trendiness...charge us $18.00 for a bowl of air and call it reasonable.  Food was decent but in no way worth the aggravation of leaving hungry after spending $70.00 for two without wine.  Do not go there, plain and simple.  Choose any corner Italian eatery instead.
