The seafood here is excellent & so the service is very good. This place gets very crowded on the weekend, but with good reason. The Calamari appetizer (super fresh) Â is a favorite, but I wish they would stop putting in too many fried peppers. Pasta, chicken & seafood dishes are great- you really can't go wrong
