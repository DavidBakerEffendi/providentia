Okay, love it, BUT, somedays things go arey.  Loved the duck quesadillas, only like the substitute slider.  Taste is all sloppy Joe and ( where is the duck?) and undefined meat.  We ordered one burger medium, one medium rare - oops, guess the cook didn't read the order well enough. We will be back and hope for a better experience.
