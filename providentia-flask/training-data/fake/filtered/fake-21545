Went here for the first time today, and was not impressed. I had heard good things about Claire's prior to my first visit, so I decided to give it a try. When I walked in, I noticed the restaurant seemed a bit outdated and was not the cleanest place I have seen. The staff was friendly with the exception of the manager, who was actually rude to my mom and told her she was taking a long time to order!! The food was edible, I guess, but nothing I would want to eat again. I had the spinach and tomato quesadilla, which was made with a whole wheat wrap. I eat whole wheat wraps all the time and this one tasted like cardboard. I was disappointed because I felt like I could have made better food at home, and kind of wished I did eat at home or somewhere else. I didn't try any of the bakery items but the vegan desserts looked dried out and crumbly. I would not recommend.
