AMAZING!!!  My boyfriend took me here for valentines day and it was the most romantic dinner I've ever had.  From the driveway up to the restaurant to the ambiance inside, the atmosphere was completely unique and stunning.  We got sat in a great room, as there are many of them.  There was a fireplace with room for seating in front, for those that were luck enough to grab them.  The lighting was low and the view was that of a pond with bridges, greenery and sculptures.  We felt like we were in a different world.  The service and food was five star.  We had a carafe of amazing wine, one appetizer, two entres, one desert as well as two drinks from the bar while we waited and the bill was only $140.  Our entres were clean and fresh.  I could taste every ingrediant.  Looking foward to going back in the spring when everything is in bloom and we can take a nice walk around Grounds for Sculpture which the restaurant lies in the middle of.
