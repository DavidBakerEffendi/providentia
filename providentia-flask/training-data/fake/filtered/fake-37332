Noticed this place a few days ago (apparently it only opened about 2 months previously) and decided to stop in for a coffee and snack on a rainy afternoon. It was completely empty, which felt a little odd, but the coffee and pastry were both exquisite--an espresso and an almond croissant. I'm definitely planning on going back and bringing some people with me!
