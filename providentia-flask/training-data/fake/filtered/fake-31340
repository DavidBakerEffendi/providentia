I ate their on a trip to NYC. I, later, read an article on who the head chef was. Curtis Brown use to be a singer of one of the craziest rock bands out (not a good crazy). I saw him once play with his self and then wipe a guys head in the front row, then poured a beer on his head! He followed this up by trying to start a fight with everyone in the front row. He also cooked at this joint in Los Angeles and smoked weed in the back and was very rude to customers. I am disgusted that I ate food that his hands touched! And, by the way, it was way over priced for the type of food it is.
