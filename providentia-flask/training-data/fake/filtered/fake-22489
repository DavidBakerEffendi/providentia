Experience" 1 of 5 stars Reviewed February 6, 2014 NEW   We had reservations for Saturday Feb 1st 2014 I believe for 6:30 pm. Its an "ok" atmosphere, but with a lot of background noise. Starting with our waitress who very nicely putting it was an absolute "snot". I told her that I wanted one of the heartier items on the menu .. she "recommended the steak", when it came it was literally not more than 3 ounces.. I was very disappointed to say the least when I told her that she recommended this entrée and it was by no means hearty she said she would gladly get me more but charge it for another full price entrée, I asked to speak to someone , A very nice gentleman came out I believe who said he was the chef and I told him of my plight he said it was a 7 oz portion' but I felt it was not, he kindly offered to get me another one I said no, but one of my fellow diners had the "short ribs", and even though that was also small it was a heck of lot bigger than my entrée. So they brought me out a mini portion of that.. We like fine dining but I also like to have some food with my dinner ...The portions were terrible as well as the service.. we will NOT go back. by service we mean the rude waitress that we had Not worth it by any means   I believe our waitress's name was "Alex"   as previously mentioned  in other reviews.  You would think management would deal with someone like her with her poor service and "attitude" if they want to stay in business Thank you Visited February 2
