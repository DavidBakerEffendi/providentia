What an amazing experience! Without a doubt my friends and I had some of the best burgers we've ever had! And it didn't end there...the fresh cut fries and the huge crispy onion rings were to die for! One of my friends ordered the New York Style Dog and he said it was better then any hotdog he's had in NYC! They also have a full bar and a nice wine/craft beer on tap selection so we all enjoyed drinks with our meal. Our late lunch turned into happy hour and a really fun place for us all to hang out. Great after work crowd at the bar. The location is perfect, the staff is extremely friendly, the place is spotless and it looks really cool inside....plus they are all about being environmental friendly! You can build your own burgers and they have something for everyone including the Veggie Burger that my girlfriend loved, Shakes and a "Secret Menu". Bottom line is this is one of the best burger places in Philly and shouldn't be missed for lunch, dinner, happy hour or late night...they are open until 2am!! I'll definitely be coming back often!
