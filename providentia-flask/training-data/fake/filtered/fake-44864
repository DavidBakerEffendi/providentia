Unfortunately, there were a good number of quirks in our service and meal that kept this from being a good experience. First of all, we made a reservation, but were still asked to wait for 15 minutes. I understand that overbooking happens from time to time, but it's still annoying. More to the point, our food matched the generally disorganized service: it was definitely a rushed and messy ordeal. We had to send one plate back because the dish had not been washed properly. Ick! The ravioli was okay, but kind of heavy and it somehow had not been cooked evenly. The pizza was nothing special, though certainly not bad. We were gonna stick around for dessert but decided not to chance it and headed out. One thing's for certain, if you decide to bail on Emporio, there are plenty of other great places in LIttle Italy to check out!
