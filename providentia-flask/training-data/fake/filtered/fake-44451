I walked into this place not expecting much. This guy dan greeted me as soon as I walked in and helped me understand the menu. They use some sort of airplane theme for their food names. Anyways he was awesome, helped me out and recommended to me flavors to try. The wait is something to get used to but honestly, worth it. Food was great and he really knew what he was talking about. Was a great experience overall.
