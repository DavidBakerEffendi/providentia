I am a foodie.  I've traveled to well over 50 countries in my day and have tried some really amazing food at some really amazing restaurants.  I chose Tinto as I was looking for a relaxed atmosphere, with good reivews and good food....also, something fun.  I was taken back by this place.  The food was AMAZING, the atmohsphere was AMAZING, the service was AMAZING.  I highly reccommend this place.  The prices are not bad considering the quality of food you get.  Parking is ample as there are multiple garages and lots around the corner. Try this place out!
