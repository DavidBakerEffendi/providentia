Very accommodating and friendly service, as well as great food! When my friends and I arrived at Kelly's one recent Friday evening, we did not have a reservation and there was a fifteen minute wait. Not really a problem to us, but the staff went "above and beyond", and opened up the back room to give our party of eight a place to eat.  Staff was cheerful, and very helpful with menu questions.  (They also offered to take pictures for us, as well as try to track down a phone charger for a "dead" phone!) Food was wonderful and served in a timely manner!  Great food, friendly service and a good time, are traits of this wonderful restaurant! We have never been disappointed!
