What a great place! I love Thai food and everything was absolutely delicious, not just the food but the drinks too (I had a strawberry mojito)! I came with my husband and we had really lovely time. The atmosphere is soft and romantic. The staff is kind and helpful and makes you feel welcome. For the kind of service you get this place is an excellent value for money. Â Plus is located in one of the most lively neighbourhood...I'll definitely come again!
