It's a great little hole-in-the-wall place. The food was delicious, authentic (my friend who went to Japan could not stop raving about their katsudon and how every other place gets it wrong), and it came out quickly. The service was good, and the food was good, and I'd definitely go there again next time I'm in NYC.
