The ladies who staff the to go phone orders/counter are horribly rude.  I was practically just hung up on before I finished placing my order, because she obviously couldn't be bothered.  Every time I get takeout, which is often because it is convenient and the food is good, I am overly kind hoping that this will help.  Never does.  One day, I'm going to man up and stop tipping them.
