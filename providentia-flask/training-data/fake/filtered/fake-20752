pros: definitely great tasting food  A+ to that!  oh yeah BYOB was also a plus, and even if your date forgets to bring the bottle these guys will get you a bottle, just ask , asslol.  and the waiters were great.  now for the cons.. Cons:  this place is way to small, i personally think they should get rid of two or three tables, felt like i was eating with my elbows.   we spent about $80 bucks for an appetizers and two main course. must reserve!
