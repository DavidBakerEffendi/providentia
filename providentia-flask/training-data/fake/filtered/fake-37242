This place is as good as it gets.  The service here goes above and beyond anything I have experienced living in NYC for several years.  My wife and I eat here at least three times a month if not more and never once think about going to the other Houston's in the city...why ruin a good thing, or even take a chance.  My favorite food is the steak fillet and my wife's is the chicken salad, but the one item we can always agree on are the artichokes.  Whether you experience the dip with chips or the grilled plate you will not be disappointed.  (So now that I have written this review I think I am going to have to go there for dinner tonight).
