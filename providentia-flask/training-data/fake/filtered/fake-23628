My first time visiting New York I had dinner at The Breslin and had a terrible experience.  Nonetheless I had heard good things about The Spotted Pig, and I thought I would give April Bloomfield another shot since I know she is so respected.  We had no issues being seated, they actually even extended the lunch menu for us even though we were seated after 3 pm (the usual cutoff for lunch). We had the chicken liver toast, which was good, even though it's hard to get through that much liver sometimes.  My real problem was with the entrees. My girlfriend had a dish that was 16 dollars and literally consisted of about 6 thin slices of speck and about 6 or seven roman (tiny) artichoke hearts.  It was average at best. My 20 dollar burger was good, though the Roquefort was a little bit overpowering.  And though the shoestring fries were good, they did not make up for the price of the slightly above average burger.  My two other friends ordered Cuban sandwiches which they said were good, but a little dry.   Service was ok, though a bit Inattentive at times.  The atmosphere is very laid back, which was nice.  In the end though, the food disappointed and was overpriced.  I hate to say it, but this place defines overrated.
