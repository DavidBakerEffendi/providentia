If you like paying $14 for a draft beer and $25 for a SMALL plain burger, then you'll love this place.... It is there for the tourists that don't give a damn about prices or taste!  The name of the place is a ruse... The Farmhouse......  sky high prices in an old McDonalds fast food restaurant...  AVOID IT !!!
