This is a mixed review. I have had many good meals at Keepers and in my lifetime I can only think of one other time I bothered complaining about a meal. Last night I took my mother out for her 70th birthday. She had the Salmon and I had the Kielbasa. Hers was excellent and mine was not. It simply was not good. I had about 1/3 of it and decided I could not continue. Our waitress saw that I did not eat very much and asked if I was happy with it. I explained that it was just off and it was simply "not good". She came back a few minutes later and said she was "sorry for the Kielbasa and they would be taking my beer off the bill". Â Take my beer off the bill? That was the best part of the meal! Besides, its illegal to comp alcohol in Vermont. How about taking the awful Kielbasa off the bill? Even without my main coarse the bill was well over $100 for 2 so I am still scratching my head about the decision in the kitchen to offer the drink as compensation for a terrible dish. I wanted to just forget about the experience but I drove by a burning tire on my way home from work today and it reminded me of the meal so here I am on Yelp. The dish should have been comped. It left a very strange message to comp the drink instead. The Keepers I have known for the last 6 years would never think of doing this.
