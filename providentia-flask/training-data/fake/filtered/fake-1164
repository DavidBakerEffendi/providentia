Another of our must-do stops. Particularly in the fall/winter when they have the punkin' waffles. Waits can be long, especially on the weekends, and worth it. I was excited for the brunch menu. For $17 you get a bunch dish and a drink of your choice. However, all the dishes they are known for are super sweet - Nutella maple syrup powdered sugar French toast or pumpkin waffles. Was feeling more savory so I got the Penny Egg sandwich instead on the a la carte menu. Definitely planning on coming back for some breakfast meals and probably some more pies.
