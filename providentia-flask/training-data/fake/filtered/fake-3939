Came here with some friends last night, and had a really great time. We got seated in the garden as requested. The whole restaurant is very charming and intimate. The food was amazing and great service over all. Our waitress made some excellent recommendations. We shared the carciofi, fried burratta, and shrimps for apps. Our mains were just as delicious, we ordered their fish special, truffle fettuccini, lamb pappardelle, and steak. The chocolate soufle for dessert was the perfect ending to our meal. We plan on coming back for more!
