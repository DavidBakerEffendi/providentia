A bad Tex-Mex place. The guacamole had a weird light green color and was watery; the steak burrito didn't have any flavor. It's more of a fast food place. We were there on a Tuesday evening and it was empty; the only guests came in for take-out orders. It was also pretty cold in the dining area. The place was clean; service was friendly. Won't go again.
