We were there tonight for the first time. Nice place, pleasant ambience. The hostess checked for availability like the place was over crowded. Half of the place was empty... The waiter was professional. I had a burger with fries. The burger was perfect. The fries were too tick and salty. I could not eat them. My husband had short ribs. Nice presentation but again too salty. He could not enjoy it. We asked to speak to the chef but he never came to our table. The bill was almost $90. I do not think we will be frequent guests.Sad!!! It is good to see new business in our town.
