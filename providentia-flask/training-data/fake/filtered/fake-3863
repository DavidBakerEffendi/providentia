I'm loathe to write a review about this place as I don't want more people to find out about it.   We didn't have a phone number, and just showed up per a friend's recommendation.  We were sat at the bar, after about a 15 minute wait, and was entertained by an AWESOME mixologist/bartender.  We had some of the best drinks possible.  Food was very creative and simply very good.  Service was spectacular, as there are very few seats in this small place.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
