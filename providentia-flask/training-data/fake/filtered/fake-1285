We've had there my husband's birthday party. They offer a special menu for parties... First, we all had the family style Italian Garden Salad. Then we've got Penne al Vodka, which was absolutely delicious! As a main course we had to choose one of the entrees: chicken, veal or fish. I ordered fish: Tilapia Oreganata and my husband had Veal Marsala. My fish was outstanding! and my husband loved his veal dish. They allowed us to bring our own birthday cake and wine. Service was fast and very friendly! We would recommend this place to anyone to celebrate their special events and we will be definitely back!
