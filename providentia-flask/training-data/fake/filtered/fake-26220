Great place for sushi. The design of the interior is superb. I love the environment of the place, with the friendly staff and cool music. Even though the prices were a bit high, the food was totally worth it. You can't go wrong with the chef's suggestions b/c he is awesome! Cons: The communal table format...was difficult not to overhear people sitting 1 feet away from you. But I guess it goes with the whole vibe of the place. Definitely give it a try! It won't disappoint.
