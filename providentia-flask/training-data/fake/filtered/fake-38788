I've been going to Jerri's for at least 12 years now and it's the definitiion of dependable. The breakfast is always great (regardless of what you get), the staff always keeps your cup full and it's dirt cheap. Daily specials keep things from getting boring, and you can always expect a smile. Â The omelettes are particularly good.
