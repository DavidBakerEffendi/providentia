The regualr cheese slice is massive and very tasty but the crust is a bit  thick and doughy The artichoke slice is really good too but in a greasy sort of fast food way.  It tastes a bit like Campbells cream of mushrom soup slathered on a pizza crust.   Artichoke is good but not thrilling.   Joe's in the West Village is still my favorite Manhattan slice joint.
