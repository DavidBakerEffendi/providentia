We went to Estia a few evenings ago to celebrate our son's birthday and although we have dined at Estia awhile ago we forgot how amazingly relaxing and beautiful this restaurant is, it transcends you to the feel of  being in a a town somewhere in  Greece. Aside from the ambiance the food was absolutely delicious and the bonus of the whole experience was our server, Brenna. We are avid frequenters of restaurants and value supererior service equally when dining. Brenna had all of us "at hello" the moment she approached our table.  We were welcomed with such warmth and professionalism. Her approach to reviewing the menu, honesty with recommendations and complete attention to making sure we had an amazing dining experience was absolutely outstanding. Infact, we all agreed, a party of 6 that evening, she was the best server we have ever experienced. Brenna you are the greatest!!!!
