Most of the time the waiters play stupid and don't bring the change back assuming is their tip, every time I go there they take the extra money, I finally complain to the waiter, and he told me gee it is only $3.79 dollar more not the end of the world, yes I said on top of the 20% I'm leaving, I ask the tip back and will never go there again, it happen 3 times and I'm out.
