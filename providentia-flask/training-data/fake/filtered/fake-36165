I'm not a guy who would usually order food from a truck-- but the Taqueria has changed my mind.  The tacos are fresh and delicious each and every time.  The Taqueria is without a doubt the best thing that has happened to lunch in Newark.   I usually order the chicken tacos simply prepared that come with tons of flavor.  A nice piece of lime to squeeze on each one and fresh pico-- how can you go wrong.   Try this place- you will come back again and again.
