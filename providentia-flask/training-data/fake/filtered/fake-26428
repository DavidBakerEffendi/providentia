Decided to finally try Parc for lunch today since my friend was visiting from out of town and she wanted to explore Rittenhouse Sq! It definitely lived up to the hype! Our server, Tiffany, was very pleasant and knowledgeable and made out experience there truly enjoyable. I will definitely be back again.
