Here's the skinny on Reservoir: The pizza is good, but the entrees - not so much. Stick with the pizza and you'll be happy. The pies are small, but good. DO NOT order delivery. Eat in or (even better) pick up - for some reason, the pizza does not travel well in the delivery person's car. If you live in or near South Orange and don't want to travel to Arturos for pizza (and also want to save a bit of money), this is a solid choice.
