Chicken parm sandwich gave me issues after word, wife said her vodka penne tatsed like velveta... complained they didnt care, offer refund, or even a replacement. They have a sign outside their window that says "Theres a difference between us and a chain let us prove it to you." Well at a chain a replacement would have been offered so all they proved is that they suck. NEVER again Three Brothers.
