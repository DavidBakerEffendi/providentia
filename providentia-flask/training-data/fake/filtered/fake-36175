I have been going here since they opened. The food omg, why cook they get it so right. The owner who is always there is wonderful. The staff is great. Hey check it out ask for Rick the bartender tell him gail sent you. You won't be sorry.Plus trust me if your from the area you will see where your friends eat. Always nice to run into old friends . Great lunch special try it you'll love it....Try the Mango salad but don't eat it all leave some for me..
