This is probably my favorite restaurant in Boerum Hill.  The menu isn't extensive, but everything I have had there was FANTASTIC.  My husband loves their cocktails, particularly the "New Rider." The ambiance is very relaxing, although they get VERY busy during prime hours.  So either get there right when they open, or prepare to wait on a weekend evening.   I believe they take reservations only for parties of 6 or more.  You can also call ahead and ask them to put you on the waiting list.  If that's your plan, definitely consider calling 40 minutes in advance on a Friday or Saturday night!  Oh, we have gone on the early side before and there were quite a few families there.  There really isn't much room for strollers and the like.
