I know some people love this place but I don't get the enthusiasm. The food is average. Definitely nothing to get excited about. The service was atrocious last as my friend and I were essentially thrown out while I was still drinking my coffee because they had another reservation. Better plan to eat quick and move on. This isn't the place to catch up with a friend.
