I planned to have an extremely casual gathering at a. kitchen of wedding guests the morning after my wedding... but during the CRAZINESS of wedding planning, I completely forgot to call the restaurant and notify them of the extra business!!! I called the morning of an they were extremely accommodating. The food was great, a very diverse brunch menu. I had the shrimp and grits which was very tasty. During warm weather they have the front open glass doors open, so pretty! My guests raved about the location. Definitely a great place for brunch!
