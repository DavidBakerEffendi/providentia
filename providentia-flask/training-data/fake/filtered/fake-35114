I went here on a Friday night with some friends. At first, the service was average: they were quite understaffed. It wasn't too crowded as it was a rainy night, but we felt ignored after we got our initial drinks. There were no wait staff ready to take our food orders, and yet there wasn't enough of a crowd to excuse such lack of attention. The bartender was helpful when my friend finally decided to go to the bar to order drinks (we gave up on getting food). Still, my first impression found Dark Horse to be a bit lacking.
