I wouldn't go back to this restaurant if they paid me.  This was one of the worst experiences I've ever had dining in all my years living in Manhattan.  We arrived at 8:30 for an 8:15 reservation (calling ahead as a courtesy to alert the restaurant) and were told that our table wasn't ready yet, not that they'd given it away.  We were told to wait at the bar, which only had rail alcohol and we'd be seated shortly.  After checking back w/ the front desk a few times finally at 9:10 I asked to speak to the manager who tried to walk by me to ignore the issue.  Keep in mind that there had been two or three four tops open for the last ten mins.  long story short; I've never been spoken to like this EVER.  Never has a host raised is voice to me, flailing his arms...His name is Eric and I plan on boycotting ALL of his restaurants.  He kept calling me "dude" like I was 17 years old, have some respect, other patrons at the bar were mortified and had thought we were friends getting into a fight.  There are way too many good restaurants in the city (and the Hamptons) to throw away money to get abused.  Word to the wise, take $100/person out of your wallet and just burn it now.  You'll get more out of it.
