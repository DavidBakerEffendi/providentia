Very unique food at reasonable prices. The signature dishes were excellent. We had andhra mirchi bhaji, chicken 65, chicken chettinad and biryani. All the food was made fresh and very tasty. The Naan's were also very fresh. The food is spicy so if you want lesser spice please inform the chef. Plan to visit again and also order catering from there.
