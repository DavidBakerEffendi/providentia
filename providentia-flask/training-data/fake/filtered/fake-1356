I have been here at least half a dozen times, however never for brunch, the menu changes quite often which is great because i tend to get stuck in routine at my favorite restaurants.  Anyway I especially enjoyed the 2 rabbit dishes, i've never had rabbit before and I was pleasantly surprised!  When i can swing it I always get the Wag-yu steak, they have some secrete way of cooking it that the chef tried to explain to me but I'm no foodie so i cant tell you what it was.  The "Ants on a log" desert is probably my favorite of all time, its just so friggin clever!  The rest of the menu is really creative and fun and I have never been totally disappointed in anything i ordered, I would always recommend the salumi plate for starters! I think the food is quite unique even for brooklyn, and the booze selection is quite good (I don't drink wine!).  DON'T TELL ANYONE! but sometimes on the weekends they have a free DIY S'mores bar by the fire pit in the back yard, hardly anyone ever ventures back there, but its a super sweet treat to end any meal! especially if anyone in your group smokes...lol.  My only gripe about this place is that they don't have a burger on the menu, ever! and I'm pretty sure they take credit cards now.
