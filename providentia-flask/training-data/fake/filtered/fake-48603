I love ramen noodles. I was a bit hesitant to try a ramen restaurant since it would be way cheaper to make one at home, but I went along with it because my friend wanted some. This place was packed and busy. The wait time was 30 minutes and we actually waited while we looked at the menu. Pretty much knew what we wanted while we waited. We got lucky with the seating because we sat right in front of the kitchen. Got a great view of the kitchen staff in action.
