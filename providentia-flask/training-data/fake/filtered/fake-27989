Food was ok and worse part was the long wait for appetizer and entree. Took them 30mins to get the foodout! I had to remind them.  So what if they had a bad day-fine.  One customer complained about the same issue bit the owner just refused to void the receipt that the customer didn't wanna pay.  Makes matter worse, he said "I don't care, go go go". Everyone was listening and this guy wasn't paying attention in the modern day a person like me is armed with an iPhone and yelp.   Good luck to this business!  BAD customer service.
