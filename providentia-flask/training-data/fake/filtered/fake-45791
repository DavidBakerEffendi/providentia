A friend and I went into Max Fish on Friday July 11. We sat at the bar and we ordered a couple of beers to start while we looked at the menu to order dinner. I ordered a Harp lager on draft and the keg must have kicked halfway through the pour. Now, in my experience most bartenders would offer you the beer that's been poured while they tap the new keg. This wasn't the case this time. No big deal. The waitress, ( and I say that because she clearly was not a bar tender) left half of the beer under the tap and told me it was going to be a few minutes. Ok, fine. She got a real bartender to help her (this woman was making drinks towards the back of the bar and clearly already had her hands full) Then after the better part of 5 minutes she proceeds to top off the half beer left on the bar and pass it to me. Maybe she had never poured a beer before because she over poured the beer passed it to me and quickly turned away. Quick enough not to see the foamy mess cascade over my glass and all over the bar. I grabbed the drip rag from under the taps and cleaned it myself. After we finished our beers we asked for our check and went somewhere else for dinner. The staff, save this woman, was and is usually very professional and courteous. It was really too bad. Maybe she was new or a sub for someone else but a busy Friday evening at the bar was a poor place to put her. It was really too bad. I give three stars only because my past experiences have been good. This one wasn't. I'll probably be back because one bad experience could have just been an off night.
