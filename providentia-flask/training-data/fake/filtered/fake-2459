I will be typing about the Big Ass Biscuit with Gravy from the Khyber Pass pub. I really like the biscuit because it is really is huge so if you are really hungry go there. The biscuit is firm but not that hard. The gravy though is the best part of this dish. There are little pieces of meat inside the gravy so after I finish the main part that is a biscuit Â I get my spoon and just eat the gravy off my spoon. So if you are in Old City you should go to the Khyber Pass and eat a Big Ass Biscuit with Gravy! Looking for more awesome food Agent G.
