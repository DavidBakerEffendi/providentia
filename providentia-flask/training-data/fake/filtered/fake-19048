I went in on a pretty quiet afternoon for a late lunch with some friends from town. The decor is not bad, wooden chairs and tables, some booths, a very worn look, but its meant to look like that. The tables however were not meant for more than 2. We were a party of 3 and space was scarce. The menu is a single page and quite frankly nothing special. Pricing is not that great either, which is the my main plight with The Smith... no real bang for your buck. I ordered two appetizers, fried calamari and a seafood platter, nothing special here. My entree however, a salmon salad, was delicious, and it was a huge portion, but it was more salad than salmon and that's a real bummer since it cost me $17. A nice casual lunch spot, but it isn't going to be a regular for me.
