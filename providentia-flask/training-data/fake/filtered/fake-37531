Came here for dinner with the in-laws. As soon as we walked in with two children, they scurried us into the "sapphire room" which was clearly for groups with children even though the restaurant was practically empty and remained so during our dinner. Really? That might have worked 20 years ago, but I found it insulting. I have taken my children into some of the best restaurants worldwide and never received a greeting like that. The place is in a strip mall for crying out loud. The food and service was average. I think they are relying on their former clientele, which is the 65+ crowd, to keep them afloat. Good luck!
