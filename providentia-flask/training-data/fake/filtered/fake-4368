I have come to bluebird tavern since first few weeks they opened. The first half year to 1 year was excellent but the food taste start to degrade. Unfortunately tonight was all time low for me. I was dining with my wife and I had the NY strip. First A little bit about me, I am the type who can compensate Â service or presentation quality as long as the food taste fantastic. For $36 NY strip, I really expect at least edible with mediocre if not best taste. Unfortunately it was not to be. The NY strip was really tough even though it was medium rare. I could not swallow the meat and ended up exercising my jaw whole night chewing the tough meat. I informed the waiter it was tough and they offer me complimentary desert. Again it was just too late. I am not trying to write this review in bitterness but more on disappointment because we used to rave on bluebird tavern with our friends. I hope they can improve.
