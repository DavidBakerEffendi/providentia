This restaurant serves the most delicious Lebanese food I have ever had - it's better than Mamouns in New Haven hands down.  We love it so much, we had Ali cater our wedding of 150 people.  We had a wonderful menu, with so many choices for both vegetarians and meat eaters alike.  Ali was so attentive and did everything he could to make it a wonderful wedding.  But most importantly, the food was delicious - I did not hear any complaints at all, and actually received a ton of compliments on how fantastic it all was.  Definitely check this place out!!!
