not a great steak,  one of the worse.  i cant believe people wait in lone for it.  .  they dont chop up the meat so its in big chunk form like frozen steak ums.  im guessing the food bugdet goes to the bright lighting and the gmc hummer parked out front then to actual good steak.      as for the spek english or die sign.   all the people i know that english is their 2nd or 3rd language never want to not speak english when they are purchasing something.  its odd that geno's came across this so much they had to put up a sign.
