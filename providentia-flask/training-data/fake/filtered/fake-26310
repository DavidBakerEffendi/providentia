I made my way back to Crepes du Nord last night. Had my favorite crepe with shrimp and split the beef short rib and split the lingonberry sweet crepet.. I love the smell of butta and sugar. I LOVE CREPES! The place is quite romantic, too bad the downside is the tight space. I'll definitely take a date there for some canoodling.! Now...I just need to find a date who's willing to split 2 entrees and 1 dessert or TWO!. Side note: the area in the back is a completely different restaurant..LOL. Both restaurants share the same kitchen area.
