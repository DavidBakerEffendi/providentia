I hate this place. I've never been so mistreated at a restaurant in my entire life.  I was shocked by the rude, unprofessional and dark atmosphere of this place. One manager, Christine, was very friendly. However that was overshadowed by a pompous, egotistical manager named Sean.  He clearly does not understand the business of customer service, and the phrase "the customer is always right" means nothing to him. I don't believe I did anything to justify the poor treatment I received from him. I'm sure the food is great, but my friends and I literally got up and left before we even ate because of how rude the service was. If you enjoy good service and polite people I don't suggest going here. Ever.
