Excellent service and great food.  My husband and I came here shortly before a movie so we decided to eat at the bar.  There was a woman serving at the bar  and we explained to her that we were short on time and asked her if she thought we would have enough time to eat - she said yes and was very nice and accommodating.   Since we were in a rush we split a Bacon cheddar cheeseburger with fries and ordered drinks.  The food came out just in time and it was delicious.
