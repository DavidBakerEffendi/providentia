I'm addicted to this venue!!! Not only has it become my favorite destination for dinner with family....it's the perfect atmosphere for fun with friends. So I'm still a fan of this place and I just wanted to mention how yummy their pork bun with kimchi special was. And I heard from a friend that they had a lamb burger at J&N's recently. I can't wait to see what's next! Got to finally meet the owner...very human and genuinely cares about his customers...the place has a number of frequent flyers. So I was sad to see a less than positive review recently...I almost took it personally. I guess you can't please everyone...although it seems Jack & Nellie's can please the majority.
