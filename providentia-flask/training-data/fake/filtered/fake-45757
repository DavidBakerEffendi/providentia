Vegetarian pannie was wonderful. Fries were very tasty. Black bean soup was very good. Was offered a complimentary glass of wine but refused due to driving home after lunch , but a very nice touch. I sat outside and it was very pleasant. Wait service was attentive. Only negative thing I had was the ketchup was not Heinz and didn't taste very good.I would defiantly go ther again.
