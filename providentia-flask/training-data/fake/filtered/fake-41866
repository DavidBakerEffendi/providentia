Our family of five went for a late afternoon/early dinner (2pm). We called ahead for a reservation as we heard they are always booked. The hostess said they were booked but graciously added us anyway. This restaurant is in the heart of the theater district directly across the the Barrymore theater. The restaurant is just the right size NY restaurant with exposed brick and light hardwood floors. I knew the minute they brought the bread to the table that we were in for a treat. It was the best I've tasted outside of Italy. Dipped in olive oil and balsamic... Perfection. Our server MJ was simply fantastic! He was funny and engaging and greeted everyone at the table individually including our two Tweens. My mother couldn't decide between the seafood risotto and the spinach raviolis so MJ split the dishes and brought her half of each!  I tried the risotto and it was the best I've had outside of Sardegna. He  talked me out of the veal piccata and into the veal martini: lightly Parmesan encrusted perfectly sautéd over linguine. There is no "kids menu" but that didn't stop MJ.  He took their "special order" and the kids we're thrilled!   The cannoli and caramel flan for dessert were house made and even the vanilla ice cream the kids got was delicious.   We met one of the owners on duty on our way out. Class act! This was our first time here but we were treated by all staff as if we were their weekly local patrons.  If you are looking for excellent Italian food this is your place. We will definitely be back.
