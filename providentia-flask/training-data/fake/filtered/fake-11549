I don't know what the other guy was talking about, but I come here all the time and I love this place! Â I thought the food and service was very good! I especially enjoyed the food that I ordered. I usually go during lunch hours, so the food was really cheap and affordable. All under 10 bucks. IT was cooked relatively fast too. Anyways, I'll continue to come to this place because personally, I love this cute place.
