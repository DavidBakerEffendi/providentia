It seems to be considered as a "hipster" hangout and popular with a certain crowd..  But food is not all that, at all...  On top of it all, while the wait staff is nice, the servers behind the counter is another story.  They are always female, and always with an entitled attitude.  Above all, the staff does not pay attention and not only let loitering go on on the steps of the residential apartment upstairs, some of them actually join in an put plates, drinks, and cigs on the steps. blocking residents.  When asked to move when you are carrying laundry or garbage, patrons and staff BOTH give you such an attitude that you think they are your landlord or employer!  RUDE and crowd with an attitude.  I LIVE upstairs and used to try to support their business, but never again.  If you care about the behavior of an establishment and value kind, neighborly, and respectful behavior of any business, boycott this place.  Don't go.
