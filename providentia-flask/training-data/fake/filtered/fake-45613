I recently went to this restaurant again for the first time since it changed names/ownership. I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The bar is rustic and fun with lots of TVs and live music offerings. The food was tasty -- I had mozzarella sticks and ravioli with mushrooms. (Best mozz. sticks I have had in years.) I was there again today and saw the spread for Sunday brunch. I can't wait to try that! I think I found my new favorite restaurant and it is right around the corner from my house.
