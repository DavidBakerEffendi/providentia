Went with my wife. She had the steak salad and I had the Kangeroo burger with goat cheese. It was good. She liked the steak, but was not blown-away by it. The goat cheese really complimented the meat and the fries were terrific. But just like ostrich or bison, I would rather have beef, which is tastier because of greater fat and cheaper. The first glass of Reisling had to be sent Â back because it was slightly oxidized. Service was slow, and the waitress forgot my appetizer, blue cheese and figs, which was why I ordered the Reisling to begin with. Ther beers and wines were not expensive. The burger came to $16 which was not worth it.
