Manager was rude and condescending.  We ordered some whiskies and he poured not even a full shot, and we were charged for an "up" drink which is supposed to be 1.5 ounces according to them.  When I complained, he acted annoyed and then demonstrated what a shot looks like in a glass by pouring one in front of me (as if I were an idiot) and then just proved my point since it looked like more than we'd gotten earlier.  He obviously does not respect his customers and doesn't mind ripping people off.   I'm never going back
