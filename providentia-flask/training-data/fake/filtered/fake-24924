This place is AMAZING. I am vegan and was so thrilled to discover a cruelty-free, delicious, environmentally conscious place in the suburbs. The food is fantastic and the vibe is great (i.e., not "suburban"!) . This is a stellar example of how vegan does not mean flavor depravation. I would love if they opened more and more of these. They told me they will be adding more pastry/dessert items to the menu, which would be great -- as would salads. LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. Please spread the word.
