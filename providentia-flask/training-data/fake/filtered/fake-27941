I went to MEAL with my husband and we loved it! I got the special, which was three petite filet medallions all topped with something different. I think my husband got a burger. The mac and cheese appetizer was hands down, the best I've ever had. We're planning to go back for our anniversary. I highly recommend MEAL!
