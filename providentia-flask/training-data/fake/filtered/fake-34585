What can I say about this unique concept. What an interesting place. The place reminds me of an indian chipotle with the modern colors and setup. Now on to the main event... the food was terrific. I have spent a lot of time in NYC and London and I can safely say Philly Chutney does Indian food proud.  we had the Chef Special #14 and #3 Masal deluxe which were both winners. The chef special is a spicy dosa that the chef makes with traditional southern indian spices which adds a kick.  The masala deluxe was out of this world with spinach. :-) we also had a few apetizers which were quite different from your nornal indian apetizers. Idli was very good - especially with a unique flavor. Best if the manchurain gobi. Loved it - kinda of a sweet savory dish. Two thumbs up for Philly Chutney!
