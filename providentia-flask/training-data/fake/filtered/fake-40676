Went due too all the hype.  I thought is was good, but there is much better elsewhere.  ie. parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan.  Waiter service wan't bad.  They had a full bar, which I enjoyed a few drinks with my dinner.  I went during the week, so wait wasn't bad.  Overall, enjoyed it, but rather go to another pizza place.  It is on the better side of many Manhattan pizza places, but there is better.
