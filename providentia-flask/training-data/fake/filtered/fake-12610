We had heared a lot about Cafe Talya. and we wanted to go there but we were told wrong about adress. The correct address is "Avenida Padre Antonio Jose dos Anjos, 297 - Brooklin - Sao Paulo - RS - Brazil - 04563-000", just two blocks from Avenida Santo Amaro. There used to be a bakery and patisserie on the same address. We went there last 29th of april and it was a monday, so it was very quiet, some 3 tables inside and another outside, just beside us. Price is fair, everything (temakis) I choose were all but tasty and extremely fresh. Like when one goes to a sushi & sashimi restaurant, one can see them preparing / assembling the pieces at the counter. I drank made in Brazil sake, and then a soft drink. Not expensive, there are some 4 or 5 parking positions just in front of the restaurant. Quiet environment, cozy atmosphere. Staff is not wonderful, but proficient and polite. Definitely enjoyed and intend to go there again on my next work / business trip.
