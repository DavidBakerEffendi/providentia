I love Bove's, especially the lasagna, which is easily the best I have ever eaten. And no, to respond to one of the other reviewers, I am neither a native Vermonter nor a college kid, if that makes any difference. The highest praise I can pay to any Italian restaurant is this: I took my sister here promising her the best lasagna she had ever eaten, and she agreed with me, even after having eaten at every Italian restaurant throughout Southern California at every price range. She's much pickier than I am, so it takes a lot to impress her.
