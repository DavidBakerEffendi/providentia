Pizza is one of those personal preference things. Everyone likes it a different way and will never please everyone. Thin, thick etc. Heard raves about this place. Written up in NYT and I live a mile from it. Just don't get it though,  one of the worst pizzas we've had in long time. To be fair we went 5 times and tried 5 different ones. With toppings it's a tad better. Its the dough, tasteless, not well done. Can't recall last time my pizza wilted over like a piece of cloth....weak. Thin should be crisp not flimsy. All that said,  many many customers love it so judge for yourself. The "ball o' mozzarella" with oil is awesome and the salads are good and worth going just for that, without ordering pizza. Nice friendly staff, tight seating. Nomad's still our fav....it's the dough.
