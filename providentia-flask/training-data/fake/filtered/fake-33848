I've been frequenting Bedouin Tent on a semi-regular basis for over 7 years, and I love it. FRESH, FRESH, FRESH food and pita made to order. Several years ago they renovated the back patio and it was a great decision. The service is quick and they are incredibly friendly. They are so consistently good after all these years. I've eaten at other Egyptian places in Brooklyn (Tut Cafe In Brooklyn Heights and Olive Vine on 7th, to name a few) and they are miserable by comparison. Definitely share a baklava with your dinner companion.
