My partner and I haven't  had much extra money to dine out lately and decided to have a night of it and try the Yardley Inn.  We had driven past the place on so many occasions and never stopped before.  Well, were were beyond surprised. The staff were  very attentive and over-the-top!  Service was exceptional, but the food was a major stand out. We started our dinner with the mussels; probably the best mussels we've ever had in our life.  They flavors were so perfectly balanced and amazing!  From the cilantro to the hazelnuts- a complete work of art! We chose salads for our second course, and they were both brilliant.  The margarita salad was perfectly balanced, and the wedge was delightful and not overbearing. Our salads were delicious and perfect. Our main entrees were the Pork paprikash over mustard spaetzle, and I chose the scallops.  The pork melted in your mouth and the scallops were cooked to perfection.  Both dishes were amazing and the portions were more than adequate!  The red cabbage served with the scallops was something I could have eaten all night! We closed the evening by sharing a creme brulee, which in one taste was sublime and fresh! We would highly recommend this establishment to anyone, and will be returning!
