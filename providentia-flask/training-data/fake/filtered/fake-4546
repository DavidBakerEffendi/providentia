The food is great. HOWEVER, rude rude rude hostesses.  Our name was skipped, which was an accident and happens sometime. After 30 minutes, and several parties who came in after us, my boyfriend asked about it. The hostess replied with "I called you and you didn't answer."  Which did not happen. When we were finally called and sat down, we waited another 30 minutes for a server to greet us (without water). We wont be back.  Green Eggs is not the only (or best) show in town...
