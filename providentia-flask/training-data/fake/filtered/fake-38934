Me and a couple friends went here last nite for dinner/drinks.   We asked the hostess if we could be seated outside and she was very hesistant.  Even though they had 3 open tables and we had 5 people with us.    Our waitress was super friendly.  We commented on how good the salsa was, so she gave us some to go.  Unfortunately the buritto I ordered was very bland and small for $10 bucks.  I ended up putting the extra salsa she gave us on it.   If I did come back it would be for happy hour and I would just order the unlimited chips/salsa.
