Great place, food is good, service is great, and the beer selection has something for everyone.  Also the pricing is right on the mark for what you get, I would recomend this place to anyone that asks, and will return.  Plus there is a pay lot right across the street, so unlike most bars in the city you actually can find a place to park, and don't have to walk a mile to get to the bar.
