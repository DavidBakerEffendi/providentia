I used to come here occasionally with my friends but after dining there tonight for the first time in a while, I don't plan on going back. The food is still delicious, but the prices have gone up significantly within the past year, and the service today was sub-par. The cha-an set (basically a prix fixe) used to be $19 and tea was free. Now its $23 plus an additional $5 for the tea = $28 total. (I know restaurants are hurting during this recession, but a $9 price hike in half a year really turns me off). We had to keep on reminding the waitress to refill our teapot, which was never a problem before. To add to the insult, after paying $50 for a $45.5 meal ($4.5 tip), she came up to me and said "You must have misunderstood. This is only a 10% tip. If there was a problem with the service, let us know, but we expected a $7 tip so please add 2 or 3 more dollars". This was the first time I've been scolded by a waiter who automatically expects a 15% tip regardless of the service. It really annoyed me, and that's what prompted me to write this review.
