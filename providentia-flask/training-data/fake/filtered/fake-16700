This place is new so I will be back to give it a second chance. However, I did want to put my experience out there. The first thing I noticed was how incredibly loud it was.  I got used to it but it is definitely not a good place to go if you want to have a nice talk with someone. The food itself was pretty terrible. I had the market BLT fish sandwich while my friend had the porchetta.  Mine consisted of poorly battered fish, sad lettuce and ONE piece of bacon on a buttered roll.  There was no aioli, or any sauce of any kind.  It did not taste like anything.  Absolutely nothing. My friend didn't fare much better.  We did tell the waitress and she kindly brought us pickled mayonnaise. Unfortunately, it tasted neither of mayonnaise or of pickles. The server did take one sandwich off of the bill which was nice. She did, however, bring our bill with the coaster that said "If you can't afford to tip, you can't afford to drink in a bar. Go to the liquor store." They need to get rid of these, they are not cute.   The menu doesn't work with the neighborhood in my eyes. It was too pretentious and the prices too high. This neighborhood has struggled with attracting and keeping restaurants.  This place needs some tasty, accessible food. Unless "The Industry" makes some serious changes it won't be sustainable.
