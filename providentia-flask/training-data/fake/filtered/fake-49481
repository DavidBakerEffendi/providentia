This is one of my top 3 top favorite Mexican restaurants in the city. Their smoked corn soup is out of this world along with their super Â (or something like that) nachos, along with their many types of guacamole. I would advise a reservation as they are quite busy and are also a great spot for after work drinks. The decorum is very fun!
