This place is awesome!  Amazing atmosphere! I came on their grand opening, and the food and service were fantastic. It's a huge and exquisite restaurant with the full bar.  I got a glass of free cocktail were Superb!!! The hibachi chef was fun and highly skilled. The sushi was exceptional high quality, fresh and special.  Overall, i was pleased in the restaurant and will definitely going back tonight with my friends.
