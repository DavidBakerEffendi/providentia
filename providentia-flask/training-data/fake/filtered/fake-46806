Welcoming....10!   Staff, ALL of them.....10!   Chef, AMAZING, NICE, GRACIOUS, TALENTED, 12!!  The food taste and quality was wonderful!!!!  For 4 ladies if Italian heritage our meals from appetizer to dessert were sooooo fresh and delicious....and while the menus had a few basic meals, most of the plates were a creative and successful mix!!!!   There are many Italian restaurants in the area, and while their ambiance may be more formal, there isn't one that equals the talent of the chef and what he served to us Friday night!!!  I could go on and on about each plate, yet will just say....We WILL be back, and often!!!! Il pasto era molto, molto bene!  Grazie Mille!
