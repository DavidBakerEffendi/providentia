This is easily one of the best restaurants in Montclair. We always get the meat sampler and are never disappointed with the quality of the food! Â The hibiscus tea is also delicious. It's the perfect place to grab food before or after heading to the movies or the Wellmont. We have also brought our 2-year-old for lunch and she enjoyed sharing with us as well!
