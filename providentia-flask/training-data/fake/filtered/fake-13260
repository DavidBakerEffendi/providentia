As I used to live in Montclair -- and now live in Clifton -- I've been going to Tinga's for years. The food is very good, price is fair and the service used to be very good. However, I will only do takeout now because the service has eroded over the past couple of years. You'll be lucky if you can get the kids that work there to get off their phones to seat you, serve you or process your payment. So overall, if you're looking for affordable, quality Mexican, then do takeout. But don't sit in because it'll just make you mad. Highly recommend the chicken and steak quesadilla and my wife likes the Mexican Chicken Wrap.
