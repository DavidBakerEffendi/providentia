Absolutely Fabulous ALL Around.. Great atmosphere, especially dining in the rear Glass Solarium Dining Room .... Even gives off a romantic vibe under candlelight lit tables...Food to say the least is fantastic, especially the brick oven pizza, calamari, gluten free pasta choices and scrumptious daily specials! A gem of Soho!
