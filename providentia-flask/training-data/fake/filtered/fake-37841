This would have been a cool spot and based on other reviews and some photos I thought maybe we would have enjoyed it more. Some of the service staff was very kind but others not so much. I saw the chef get angry with one of the wait staff but it didn't seem warranted. Not really sure what was going on but it kind of put a bad taste in my mouth. That said, the duck was solid. I wish I had more to say but I feel like Blu could have taken another step. It doesn't seem like people are happy working there. If the employees aren't happy with the place why should I be? In my experience it's the owners job to take care of the people working around him/her.
