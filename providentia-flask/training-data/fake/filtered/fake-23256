Went to Ofrenda Restaurant (next to the Duplex on 7th Ave & W. 4th) this morning for brunch. It was awesome - the food was really unique and amazing. They are still 'getting into the groove', since the restaurant recently opened - but have a little patience while they figure it out - it is DEFINITELY worth it. The chef is very talented, and very friendly. We look forward to going for dinner very soon.
