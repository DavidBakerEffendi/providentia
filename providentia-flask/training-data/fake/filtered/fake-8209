OMG, the food in this place is amazing. It was hard to choose as to what i had to try but I finally settled for churrasco with mashed plaintains and a side order of yuca fries, which I never had. Â The food took a little long to come out but it was worth the wait. We were sat by the funny manager Kelvin or Calvin who made my group feel welcomed. Later on he passed by to make sure that everything was going well. My waitress Julia would help pour some more sangria into our glasses, thank God because that was a big heavy pitcher. She was also sweet and on point with her service. I was completely impressed with this place. My weekend was complete this week and now I will go back again in hope of one day trying everything on the menu. I really recommend this spot, its the best in the east village with a nice view to Thomson SQ Park.
