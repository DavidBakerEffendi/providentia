went there for dinner one night when they had a special on a few downtown restaurants. the food was delicious and reasonably priced for the quality we recieved. the waiter offered me an amazing beer and for the life of me i can not remember what it is called, but it was amazing. my date had a margarita and she thoroughly enjoyed it. the only down side is i didnt get to go on another date with her!
