My boyfriend and I accepted  a new years invitation from a friend to join a group of 13 people at Le Barricou for dinner. We were seated about 45 minutes late (reservation for 9pm) and informed the only dinner option was a pre-fixe menu. This was not mentioned on their website which I had checked out before arriving. Having had a late lunch,  sick with a cold, and being a vegetarian the pre-fixe menu did not sound appetizing. Our waitress was at first accommodating saying she would ask the manager if we could instead order some appetizers or small plates. Upon returning from her talk with the manager she informed us we HAD to have the pre-fixe and even if we did not eat it our party would be charged the $35 each for our dinners. In a party of 15 only 3 people did not want the full dinner and we ALL were ordering plenty of cocktails--This was the most absurd thing I've ever experienced. The restaurant had PLENTY of available tables so we definitely were not holding up service by not eating and we all ordered more than $35 in drinks. Drinks, I might add, that took forever to arrive. Finally, when our party was eating dessert one of our party found a wire in his chocolate mousse. The organizer of our party complained and was told they don't even make the dessert in-house. Basically this is singly the very WORST and rudest dining experience I've ever had in Brooklyn. I would never recommend this restaurant. A french restaurant that can't even make mousse? Please...
