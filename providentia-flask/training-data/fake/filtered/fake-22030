Awesome! What a great find in Philly!! It is a bit crowded but well worth it, everything we tried was amazing!! I loved the Indian food and our son tried his first alligator here. Even if you don't have cash they have an ATM. I would strongly recommend touring the whole market first so you can then choose your favorites and enjoy!
