The service was good, even though the servers were the most knowledgable about the menu. Â Ordered, hyderabadi dum biryani chicken and mirchi ka salan, some pakora etc. The food was not to my mark. Felt a lot of spices/masala masking the actual taste of the items. Hyderabadi Dum Biryani was hopeless and gave me instant heart-burn. Pakoras seemed to have been re-fried couple of times and was way too oily. - I would not go back unless management or cook changes.
