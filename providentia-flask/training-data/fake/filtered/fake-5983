I have been here a few times now but only twice for dinner and once for a snack on the roof. The spot itself is fun albeit kind of quirky (I get a kick out of walking through the Urban Outfitters just to make my way up to the top for a drink or some food). When I first heard of this place I couldn't get my head around how they would separate it from the store; the space itself solves the noise problem I can't stand in most restaurants. The dinning hall is perched up above the store where one simply becomes secluded from the retail space so much so that you forget where you are (there are separations and lighting -I can't remember exactly how it's done but its effective and pretty). What is great about this is that in a structural space so big, yet shared, the temptation to fill the space with more seats is confined (because of the urban outfitters that we are floating above) allowing all tables to have conversations without it ever feeling boisterous. I kind of love that. It feels so civil and completely missing from other popular places in this town. Then there is the food; again quirky but always really good. e.g. bacon wrapped Matzah balls and onions in a chocolate desert. - oh yeah the first time I went we were so pleased by everything so much so that I couldn't be bothered to decide on a single desert so we just ordered "all of the deserts." This was a smart thing to do.
