Good cookies and cakes but the staff should be a bit more attentive. Â The other day I went in to buy a cake. A woman came out from the back, looked at me standing there, picked up a broom, and started sweeping. Approx. one minute later, another woman was passing by and asked me if I needed assistance. On a scale of one to ten, I'd give the food an eight and for service, around five. By the way as I was leaving, the same woman who was sweeping, was assisting a customer. She did not wash her hands!
