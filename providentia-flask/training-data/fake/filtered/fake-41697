I don't know what planet these other reviewers are on but I couldn't disagree more. First, the place is so dark you can barely see in front of you.  When I complained that I couldn't read the small font on the menu, I was told that is what the candle on the table is for (by Paulie himself). The bathroom latch almost ripped my finger off when I tried to unlock it ....the design of this place is not customer friendly and the pizza is nothing special  ....
