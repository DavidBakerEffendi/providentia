Ordered a few signature rolls for take-out as well as some tuna sashimi.  Rolls were unique and delicious (Mango Mingo & Million Dollar rolls).  Sashimi was easily of the best quality I've had in this area.   I would definitely recommend to eat in as they did a really nice job remodeling the place (ambient lighting, wood floors, etc).  Staff was courteous and even offered us water while we waited for our food to be ready.   Hard to find if you are not familiar with the area (located in residential neighborhood 30 seconds off of Rt 1).   ninjasushinj.com for an easier to read menu.
