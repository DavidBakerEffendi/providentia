I went to misconduct for the first time in a year the other day and was blown away by the positive changes!  The reason I quit coming here was the rude bartenders and un attentive servers.  there never seemed to be any organization on the floor.  Well, that has all changed!  There is an obvious positive management presence on the floor and behind the bar now.  I saw a manager on the floor directing service and clearing plates and basically doing what needed to be done.  It was nice to see a bar like this with that presence.  It makes all the difference in the world.  The service staff is very friendly and accommodating.  The bartenders are friendly and knowledgeable.  The manager approached my table and asked how everything was and I told him it was amazing!  I was not lying.  Great food, great service, finally a great management presence and one of the better whiskey selections for a bar of its kind.  I would recommend this place to anyone.
