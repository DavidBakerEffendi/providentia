When I moved to Park Slope 6 years ago I was fit and skinny. Now I am a little less...and part of the problem is that I have been going to Bonnie's something like twice a month.  I love this place.  The atmosphere is great and they make my favorite burger in the city. It has a very particular flavor and it might get you a while to get used to it but once you are you are hooked for life and will be craving one when you least expect it. The fries and the chipotle mayo are the icing on the cake.  I don't even want to start taking about the wings! Hell yeah!
