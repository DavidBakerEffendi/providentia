This is not Italian food... at all.  If it were, the ingredients would be fresh, the meats would be tender, and the pasta would be al dente.  Yelp, you did me wrong on this one!  Service is rude as well with the runner pulling attitude when I asked him to come back with the main after I had finished the appetizer.  The only thing going for it is that it is somewhat cheap.  With so many great restaurants in the city, avoid.
