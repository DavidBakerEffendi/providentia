My son recommended this restaurant. He loves it.  We were visiting from ou tof state.  It was beautifully decorated, and the service was very good. My husband loved the salmon, and the other three of us ordered the mezze vegetarian platters.  They were stunningly presented, in sections divided by nice lemon slices,  and all of the choices in the platter  were delicous. The red lentil soup was wonderful, and the baklava and halva for dessert was excellent. This was a wonderful NY experience!
