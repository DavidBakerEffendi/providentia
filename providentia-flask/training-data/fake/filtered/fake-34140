I have eaten at the Bistro Mediterranean many times, both for dinner and lunch, and each time I have had wonderful food, great service and a very great atmosphere. The lunch and dinner menus are different, but both have an outstanding selection of food, I have never once been disappointed by anything that I've ordered, and have tried many different things on their impressive menus. The service is very friendly and personable, and they take great care of their customers. Â I have to disagree with one of the ratings, the deserts that I have tried there have been delicious, as well as the dinners. In fact their Scallops over risotto with a champagne lobster sauce is one of the best meals I have ever had anywhere. Give them a try, you won't be disppointed!
