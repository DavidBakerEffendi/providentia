One of America's great restaurants.  You will have a wonderful, transporting meal here. At the same time it's all about making you feel comfortable--utterly no pretension.  Scrimp and save to eat in the real dining room.  The tavern area is nice enough and a bargain but it's worth it to spring for the whole experience. Since the meal is dictated by the market, you won't find the same thing offered week to week.  I had an amazing fresh pea soup with fried oyster and a radish salad that were perfection.
