Celebrated are 1st year anniversary as husband and wife here last Dec.. I've heard about the long line and the waiting game here before you finally be able to get your table and luckly we try this during winter and we avoided the long line. Service is fast.. Pizza are delicioso! and they serve my favorite Stewart Rootbeer which is seldom sell in any local grocery store in New York. So I guess if you want to avoid the hassle of falling in line better try this pizzeria on winter.
