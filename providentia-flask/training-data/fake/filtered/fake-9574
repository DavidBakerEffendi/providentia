Just left here and had pretty neglectful service. Normally we have the lady with the bangs who is friendly and attentive, but today that was not the case. At first I was letting the servicers slide because they were busy, however when it began to slow down and I saw the two girls stop and talk multiple times, stand around and space out and blatantly walk by our table ignoring us then I got mad. Not only was our order wrong, but no one ever came over to ask how everything was. We went our entire meal without drinks and mine never came with a buiscuit, which are delicious and one of the main things that makes me want to go in there. Oh, and because no one ever came by to fill our waters or ask how we were doing, I never got one. When the waitress came to drop off our check, and I was dying of thirst, she threw it down without a word and walked away. No one said "thank you" or "bye" as we were leaving, not even our waitress who rung us out. Even though at this point there were multiple tables open and plenty of time for them to try and save face. Ill be goin to Fitzwater Cafe for now on.
