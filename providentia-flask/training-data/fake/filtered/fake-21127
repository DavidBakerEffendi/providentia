I feel compelled to respond to the negative review, this place is an excellent Chinese Take Out place - not only for the food, but they are so kind and friendly here. Â I did not get the impression that Chef Chan was ever touted or reviewed as a new age trendy Asian Fusion Restaurant which seems to be what another reviewer was expecting. I am not sure what the reviewer meant by "ghetto", it is Chinese Take Out on a main road...again, not sure why anything else would have been expected.
