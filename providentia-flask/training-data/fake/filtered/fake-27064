I have eaten here twice. The service is really good. The food and beverages on the other hand were not worth the money. The "fresh squeezed juice" has a funny sour fruit and seltzer taste. I tried the orange, grapefruit, and lemon aid. All three had the same strange seltzer and sour juice flavor. The scallops were pretty good, but very expensive for what you get. I Â will not eat here ever again. This is in no way a reflection of the serving staff. They are excellent.
