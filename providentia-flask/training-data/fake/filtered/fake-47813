This place blew me away. A friend was coming into town and wanted to check out a band called blind pilot. We went down early to get some food and drinks. They had PBC Kenzinger on tap for $3 and other beers were relatively priced. I got the avocado and shrimp which was light and had some fresh salsa. My hombre got a swordfish skewer which came with gyro-ish toppings. The only bad part was that a guy playing pool started eating our food when we stepped out for a minute. The venue upstairs was unique to other places I've been too. We watched the bands from the balcony which has its own bar with all beers on tap. Really a great set-up to see a show.
