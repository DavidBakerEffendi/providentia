Underwhelmed from an expectation standpoint. The reviews about the food being overrated are true. Nevermind the money you pay, I do agree with it being overpriced. However, if you leave that out the food is at best mediocre and at worst bad. The Mac 'n cheese was totally lackluster and I expected a lot from the description. Burger was ok. Salad was not good. And the presentation left a lot to be desired. The one thing they get right is the ambience, but that only takes you so far. Unless they are trying to say that the food quality is that superior, it's really hard to understand the appeal.
