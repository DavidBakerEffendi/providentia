Bella's was everything I expected. I had heard so many good reviews from my friends, so I decided to try it today. I went with my fiancee.The wait was not that long and the waitress got to our table almost immediately asking if she could bring us some drinks . We got the white Sangria and it was very refreshing! We ordered the ciabatta on the special menu, and asked the waitress for another recommendation.  She recommended the crepes stuffed with mascarpone, nectarines, cherries with lemon sauce. The crepes were out of this world, and the flavor combination was purely amazing. My fiancee loved the benedict style ciabatta, the homefries were perfectly seasoned as well. The service was great, our waitress constantly checked on us and made sure we had everything we needed. The food took a little longer than expected, but to be fair the place was packed, and the kitchen was tiny.  I would definitely recommend this place!
