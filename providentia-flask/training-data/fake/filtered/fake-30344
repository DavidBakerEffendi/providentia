I'm a regular at Saraghina and their food is PHENOMENAL! Very fresh and flavorful, yet not too rich. Chef Simone is fantastic! All staff are nice and friendly, in particular Elisabetta. Decor is quite cool, with all reclaimed/repurposed pieces. Very vibrant atmosphere. Definitely a gem in Brooklyn and BEST pizza in NYC! The only con... it's cash only! they don't take ANY credit cards, which is why I don't give 5 stars.
