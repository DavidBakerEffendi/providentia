Super Clean and tastefully decorated. Went and tried all the empanadas, sandwiches de miga and pizza. One word- OUTSTANDING !!! But to me could be dangerous, seeing Im only ten minutes away and empanadas are my weakness... Took all the food to my folks house for their Anniversary - to hear my Dad say- OMG the empanadas are the way my Abuela use to make- well it says it ALL!! The miga sandwiches were better than a Cafe in Buenos Aires! And the pizza... Brings me back home!! Gus ( Gustavo) was friendly, genuine and down to earth!! We spoke for some time and made me feel that we had known each other for years!! Like my best friend! That and the spectacular food, well , I will be gaining a few extra pounds. A side note: Â As I left I dropped my credit card in the parking lot, his next door business neighbor brought it in to Gus and he called me right away to let me know he had it. That tells me - REALLY GOOD PEOPLE!! So , EXCELLENT FOOD, EXCELLENT PEOPLE, AND EXCELLENT LOCAL... NO WONDER I FELL IN LOVE WITH THE PLACE. Don't miss it!!! VAMOS ARGENTINA CARAJO!!!
