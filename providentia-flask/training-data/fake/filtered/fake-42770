I was in Hendrickson's for lunch last week.  The restaurant had a very bad odor.  I don't know if it was the sewer but thats what it smelled like.  I ordered the steak sandwich, it was so buttery and overcooked that I could not eat it.  I ordered dessert and it tasted awful, like it was old.  At least the bartender (I think his name was Chuck) made good drinks.  That was a plus.  I've been in there for dinner a few times and it was just ok.  Some of the bartenders and servers are nice and some of them are rude. I think most of the nice servers are gone, but the rude bartenders are still there.  One talks about how bad the place is all the time.  I think that is so funny to have someone work there that dosen't even like it there.  Anyway, like I said the food sucks, but the drinks are good, when you get them from one of the good bartenders (3 out of 5 ain't bad).
