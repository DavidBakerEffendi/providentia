If you are looking for a good dessert at the market and you happen to love cupcakes then I would really recommend that you try Flying Monkey Patisserie. The cupcakes there are just amazing! I live in NY and I visit philly every few months and always have to pick up some cupcakes from this place. The frosting is amazing and the cake itself is moist and just delicious. Great combination. My personal favorite is the Pink Rose, a cupcake that is made with either poundcake or chocolate cake and then topped with raspberry buttercream. So good!
