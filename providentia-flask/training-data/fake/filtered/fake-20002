I FRIGGIN LOVE BUDDAKAN!! I've been there about 5 times, the most recent time was this past Friday for Restaurant Week. My word they ALWAYS get it right. Firstly, the atmosphere/ambiance is fabulous. It is dimly lit but decorated in a tasteful, zen style centered around a giant, golden Buddah. The food is always fresh and yummy. This was my first time coming during Restaurant Week so I decided to partake in their special menu. I had the Yellowtail Sashimi for an appetizer. Yummy and briny. You can taste the capers, but it's not overwhelming. For the entree I had the Short Rib Chow Fun. I love their normal Sizzling Short Rib dish, so I was really excited about trying this new iteration of their amazing, fork tender short rib. It was unctuous and soothing. Such a comfort food. For dessert I didn't deviate from the script. I got what I always get: Dip Sum Donuts. ERMAGERD! They are the best little pillows of joy on the planet. They come with three dipping sauces: chocolate ganache, ginger cream cheese and blackberry jam. Since I'm not a big fan of chocolate, I always opt for an extra helping of ginger cream cheese in lieu of the ganache. I would honestly come to Buddakan just for those dern donuts, but I highly enjoy my whole meal every time I go. Some of my favorite dishes, other than my obvious love for those Dip Sum Donuts, are: Lamb Chops Sizzling Short Rib Five Spice Duck Breast (the spoonbread pudding that comes with it is heavenly) Peking Duck Buns (YUMMM) It's a great place for a nice night out on a date or a group of people. I definitely recommend getting a pitcher of the Zengria for the table.
