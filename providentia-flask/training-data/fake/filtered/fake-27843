DiFara in brooklyn is probably the gold standard when it comes to pizza for both sicilian and neapolitan styles.  The place is a dive and I don't know how he does it.  I believe it's the combination of the three types of cheeses he uses and well as the sauce and dough.  I would give him 5 stars, however, the wait/service and the decor is not good.
