I had the split sandwich--roast pork and the other half was a cheesesteak. both were awesome. this place might be the stereotype for the " Yo Philly! How yous doin?" crowd...it's noisy and crowded and the staff yells at each other...if you're willing to adjust to the atmosphere Â the food is worth it.
