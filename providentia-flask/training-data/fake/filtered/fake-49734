big fan of taboon on west side. especially the sabeech which is only available for brunch on sundays. was excited to hear about sabeech all day on this express versions menu. BUT I am now home sick having thrown up twice. I knew from the first bite that it was not good. they swap the hummus for a disgusting cloying sweet mango sauce. we also had a pulled pork to share. incredibly dry. textures and sauce all wrong. too much bread. im really disappointed and not feeling well right now. someone tell ownership you never name an item the same thing and then vastly change the prep. oh and rethink that disgusting mango sauce. also your cashier never told me the sandwiches came with chips and your menu doesn't indicate that either so I paid an extra 3.50 for chips I didn't eat. they were too greasy. really grossed out right now.
