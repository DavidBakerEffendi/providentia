I created my Yelp account in order to give Gaia a five-star review.  The food is too delicious, the entire staff is too friendly, and the prices are too reasonable not to add extra praise to their already glowing reputation.     Gaia is so good it might put Yelp out of business because there's no longer a need to search around for a place to eat.  The perfect answer is always Gaia.
