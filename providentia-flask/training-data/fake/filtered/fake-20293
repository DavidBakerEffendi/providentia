The pizza is great, authentic, and delicious. Slightly pricey for the quality of food, but just low enough for me to splurge on it. I come here with my Italian husband whenever we are too lazy to make our own pizza and are crazy some good eats. The place gets a little over crowded and busy (make a reservation) and they are CASH ONLY (make sure to go to an ATM before getting there) Additionally, the service varies greatly. Sometimes it is a pleasure having someone talk you order, other times a disaster.
