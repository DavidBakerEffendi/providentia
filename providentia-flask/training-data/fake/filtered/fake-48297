I visited Pat's for the first time (from NY) today (7/26/14 @ 2:30pm) and I am sorry to say that I had a horrible experience..It wasn't so much the cheesesteak but it was the "punk lanky soda jerk" and boy was he a real "jerk" As I walked over to order our beverages, I was discussing (with my wife) what drinks we should get as well as for our son..as we were discussing, he took it upon himself to make the drinks we were deciding on and when I told him that not the drinks we wanted, he got this nasty attitude like we were inconveniencing him...he was unprofessional and the owners should really keep an eye on this punk because that attitude could get him fired!
