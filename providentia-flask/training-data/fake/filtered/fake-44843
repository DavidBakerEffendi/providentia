2 years so far and going strong, yes, of course i like this place ;)  The prices are great and there is a wide range of healthier non pizza place food, the people that work there are the nicest people and their outdoor area is great for a date on a nice warm night with some candle light and a bottle or 2 (byob - wine store 2 minutes away)  Brunches are always busy and the hustle and bustle really make you feel part of the city to get your day going on a Sat. or Sunday, that and the never disappointing La Colombe Coffee refills that keep a'coming!  Sure there is room for improvement, and we look forward to watching this place evolve!
