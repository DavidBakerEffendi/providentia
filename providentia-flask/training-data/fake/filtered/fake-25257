I've lived in the neighborhood for over a year- and this cafe is the best thing (food-wise!) that has happened to this area.  The sandwich combos are great, my personal favorite being the Monkey Biz, interesting tea flavors, and a really clean/fresh dining space.  Also, the owner Jen is really nice- always a plus!
