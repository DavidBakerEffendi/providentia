I love Westville at their other locations, but our meal was completely ruined by the rudeness of the manager.  One friend and I came for dinner and were seated at a table for two.  A few min later, another friend called and decided to come join us for dinner.  There was a table for 3 next to us that was filled by only 2 girls, and they offered us the extra chair for our  friend.  The waitress came over, brought our newly arrived friend a menu and then took her order.  A while later, the manager came over and proceeded to lecture us on how it was "against the rules" to have a party of 3 seated at a table for 2 because we were making the table next to us very uncomfortable.  (In fact, the other table offered us the chair and jumped in to defend us to the manager.)  I see his point, but honestly, we were already seated so it's not necessary to say anything more than "please don't do this again" rather than going on for over a minute in a rude and condescending manner.  All of us felt as though our dinner was ruined and won't be coming back. My advice: skip this location and stick with the West or East Village...
