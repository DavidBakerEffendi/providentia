Was greeted & seated by a friendly hostess..waiter & other waiters were great..everyone of them helped clear something off my table...food was ok..nothing made me say..wow this is the best Italian meal ever...I left this place feeling hungry..for $125 tab this should never happen..portion size was small..for $11 glass of wine id prefer to have it filled 3/4 rather than 1/4..should have gotten a Subway $5 foot long next door...would have saved $120 & actually felt as if i ate something...
