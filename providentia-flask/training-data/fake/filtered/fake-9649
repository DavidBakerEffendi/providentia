Admittedly I've only eaten the signature "Red Onion" sandwich, but it's so damn delicious I've never wanted to try anything else. So far as I can tell the sandwich is mayonnaise, smoked turkey, granny smith apples, red onions, bacon and smoked Gruyere cheese between a bread of your choice (I usually choose French or Sourdough) toasted in the oven for a few minutes. It phenomenal and if you're ever in Burlington you've got to try it. If you expect an accommodating and attentive staff you might be put off by the employees. They're often forgetful, not keen on making recommendations, and generally not terribly interested in the customer beyond making the food he or she asks for. You may note the Nantucket Nectars are stored in a soda machine, and the sodas are stored in a Nantucket Nectars machine--when I asked an employee why he responded, "We thought it would be funny." That sort of epitomizes them. In any event, the food is a bit pricey, as you are only getting a sandwich (no sides or drink included or anything), but as far as I'm concerned totally worth it. All in all the quality of the food is all that matters to me, and it is some of the best.
