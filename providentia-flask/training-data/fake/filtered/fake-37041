Great food a bit on the pricey side but taking into consideration location, I can understand. Their service is ok along with delivery takes a bit long. Placed an order once they messed it up 3 times! Never got an apology not once, or anything for the numerousmistakes. This place is so busy they feel they don't need to be apologetic. They really lucky their food is really good!
