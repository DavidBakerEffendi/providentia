The one star is not for the cake but for the insensitive 800 number people who work for them. Ordered a cake for someone's Birthday with a message. Cake arrived the day before the party and no message with it. I was told to put it in the refrigerator for the next day and sometimes they deliver early... No message so the birthday surprise was asking and calling everyone to find out who sent it. It was a mess for the party a day old cake without the card and the surprise was ruined... Thanks Jr. Invoice number for the order was 817963 they can look it up Â and know who wrote this. Should stick with Pro Flowers, or Sherri never had a problem with them.
