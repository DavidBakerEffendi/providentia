Too many GOOD diners around the area to try this one again.  Started with no greeting, then my waitress slopped my boring onion soup down as she was talking to a coworker spilling it into the saucer.   Finished my dry tuna salad sandwich, no refill, no check so I walked up to the cash register and asked to pay.  Hope she spends the $1 tip towards deodorant.
