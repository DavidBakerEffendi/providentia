Sorry, lame Cuban Sandwich for a Saturday night. Ya gotta press it and ya should not use crappy sliced deli meat. A waiting line to the door of mostly hungry transplants yet lots of available seating. Seems like the place is run by girls instead of trained owner operators. The LEE piece is amazing.
