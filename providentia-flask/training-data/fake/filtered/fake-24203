Great Soul Food and a great price! Went one night because it was near our hotel. The staff was exceptional despite it being close to closing time. I went back the next day to try their breakfast and was not let down. They had a great selection of the usual dishes and a couple of uniques items. I had the savory spinach pancakes with ricotta cheese which was really tasty. The only thing I would like to see improved are their operating hours, as they close pretty early. (7:00pm)
