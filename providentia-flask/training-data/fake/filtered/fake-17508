I recently went there with friends. Overall, the food was good and I would def go again. However, the menu is a little overwhelming and not very organized. Same goes for the sake and (very limited) wine/cocktail list. Pay attention when ordering because the prices add up. Overall I would go again. The service was pleasant AND when I left my wallet there, I was called and everything returned promptly. They get an extra star for that!
