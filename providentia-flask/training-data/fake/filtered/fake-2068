I tried to snag a table on a Weds. night without a reservation and of course the place was jammed, so for New Years Eve we made reservations about three weeks in advance. The place was full again but we got seated right at our reservation time and it was perfect from there. The ricotta crostini was light and delicious, the pumpkin angolotti a little sweet but yummy, and the scallops were absolute heaven. And then there was dessert (do not pass it up--the dessert chef is fabulous!). The whole time the servers were attentive but not invasive, and there was complimentary champagne at midnight. It was the best way to ring in the New Year...much better than freezing our butts off in Times Square!
