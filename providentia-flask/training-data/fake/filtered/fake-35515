When I'm in the mood for delicious french toast and crispy bacon, the Star Diner is the place to go! My daughter really enjoys their tapioca pudding along with the vegetable quesadilla. Â The kids roast turkey was her favorite before she went vegetarian. The service is great and I never have to wait long for my food. I highly recommend.
