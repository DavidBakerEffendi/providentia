Only come here if you're looking to wait fifteen minutes for one of the three bartenders that actually seems to be working. Honestly the guy bartender that was on tonight blatantly stared at me while polishing dirty wine glasses while the girl was taking at least four orders at a time during a late night rush. As a server, I give the benefit of the doubt on a ton of situations, and always tip twenty percent, as I did tonight even though I not only waited fifteen minutes for two beers but then was told that I needed to finish them by the door. Being respectful I did and after about ten minutes (it was 12:45) I had a quarter of my beer left and the bouncer starts berating my friend and I to chug our beers and "please get the fuck out." I felt so disrespected, especially when I closed out and there were still five or six people sitting at the far end of the bar not being asked to leave let alone drink their drinks by the door. Bar was a place that I went to regularly and my experience tonight proves that they clearly don't care whether you come back or not. I would recommend everyone to check out places that actually have a welcoming staff and basic understanding of hospitality and the service industry.
