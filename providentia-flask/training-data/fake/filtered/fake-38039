My wife and I were in NYC on our honeymoon.  We had walked up and down Amsterdam and settled on checking out Jacob's Pickles.  We are from Portland, OR and found most of the NY beer scene to be a little underwhelming compared to the Pacific Northwest.  Intrigued by the Biscuits, Pickles, Beer sign out front we gave it a shot.  The tap list was great, we were in a little too late for food but had a pickled veggie assortment and some beef jerky.  My wife asked Samson (the bartender) if he was into mixology.  He replied with a pretty confident "yes".  She amazed at the cocktail he came up with for her.  We had a great time!  Great atmosphere, great snacks, great beer, and Samson was a great bartender.  Super friendly and gave us some ideas for other places to check out in the area.  When we visit NYC again we will definitely be back.
