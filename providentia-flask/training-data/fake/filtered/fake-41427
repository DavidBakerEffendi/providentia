Great food. Great room. Great chef. Great menu, Great food, Great portions. Apparently the chef previously cooked at two of the best spots in The Village - the food was way better than I thought it would be.  The caliber of the food and chef is high.   What a treat. Bloody Mary made from puréed tomatoes not juice or mix out of a can, defiantly worth the price.   It was clean and friendly and priced well. The bathroom is probably the cleanest in all of Williamsburg.  Highly recommend this place.  Nice job Graham and Joe - Ill be back.
