I love this place.  This is a serious no B.S. Itlaian restaurant.  If you want spaghetti and meatballs or Manicotti or whatever don't bother. BUT If you want distinctly Italian food made with fresh veggies and high quality ingredients - and a KILLER wine list - you have to check it out.  The menu will be vaguely familiar, but whatever you order know this:  It will redefine that dish for you.   I've been there a couple of times with my wife and of all the restaurants in St. George, this one is actually well worth the price.  They constantly give you free stuff - little appetizers and antipasto - whether you order it or not.   You get the feeling that these people would commit suicide if they found out someone left the place with any space left in the tummy at all!!  And the food isn't that heavy - lots of fresh mediterranean flavors, but without that feeling of a ten pound ball of pasta and cheese in your stomach. One thing - I think they stopped taking credit cards - cash only - and they are closed Mondays and Tuesdays.  (DAMMIT)  But the experience is well worth it - everytime.
