Asking for tap water with your meal yields the answer "we don't have tap water."  How does a restaurant not have tap water?  If you'd like any kind of liquid to chase your chicken down with, it's going to come in the most environmentally and financially wasteful form of hydration known to man: A single serving plastic container.   Pretty good chicken, but the prices are steep considering entrees come with nothing but a hunk o'chicken, not even a piece of bread is included.
