First time dining at Sandra's. Wonderful atmosphere, friendly staff. I got the sweet and spicy chicken and my girlfriend got the blackened fish. We shared the dishes and both of them were delicious, along with all of the sides. I would recommend Sandra's to anyone looking for that home cooked taste that fills you up and keeps you raving about it for days.
