I've ordered from Candela's a few times, and just keep going back for more. The food is great! The deliveries are always on time, and they've never gotten an order wrong yet. Will certainly continue going there. The only thing I wasn't a fan of so far was their vodka sauce, which I found was a bit bland, and I think their garlic bread needs some work, but other then that, love the place!
