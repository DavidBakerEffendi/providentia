4.4 Stars Short: Nice folks, great and creative dog on a superb roll, wish there were more side dishes. Less Short: I went to Hot Diggity for the first time, thanks to a great offer on LevelUp ($6 off your first purchase). 'Desert Dog' + Soda for $8, perfectly reasonable. The bun was really good (chewier and more substantial than a normal roll), the dog itself was really good (thin and long, crisped nicely), and the toppings were very good (pinto beans, tortilla strips [which fell out constantly], green salsa [which could have had more kick], chopped onion and tomato). The pinto beans worked with the tomato and onion to give the impression of a fresh tasting, less messy, less fatty chilli. Recommended. Also, the guys behind the counter were very nice. Only criticism: give us at least one not-french-fry side dish. I mean, look: I LOVE fries. And I've heard good things about their's. But I'm already eating a hot dog, which, for me, is somewhat guilt inducing. Give me a side of stewed greens, or succotash, or something as a side dish option that isn't even worse for me than the dog. Aside from that, great spot for a workday lunch. I'll be back.
