I live locally and this was my third or fourth visit to the Skinny Pancake.  The concept is a good one and on previous visits the food was decent, but yesterday was awful BECAUSE OF THE SERVICE.  I'd taken my husband there since he'd never been. Here's what happened: We ordered a crepe for him, and fries and salad for me. His crepe came out first. Our server said my order would be right out. 10 mins later -nothing. I told hubby to go ahead and eat. I went inside to refill my water glass and our server was sweeping the floor and I see no food waiting in the kitchen area. ?  More waiting. The fries came out next, and they were good, but the server (a different young lady) says 'they are still working on your salad.' (this was the skinny salad: mesclun greens, apple, chevre, and tomatoes!) 3 or 4 times she came out to tend to other customers and continued to tell me they were 'still working' on my salad.'  Approx 30 mins after arrival, and halfway through my fries, my salad arrived. My husband had long since finished his crepe. (I'm giving all this detail so if the owner reads this review he will know what my experience was like.). Obviously there was a problem, but it was not busy..so I don't know what it was.  Noticed that customers across from us had problems with their order, too.   I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, since there are so many other really good choices, with really good service. Editing addtion:  The location is wonderful and outdoor seating really nice on a glorious summer day.....I didn't want to leave this with nothing good said about the place.
