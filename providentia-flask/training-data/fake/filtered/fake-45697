Yoshi restaurant is a great place.  The sushi / sashimi are always fresh and service is quick and upbeat.  I love the Philadelphia roll and PIA roll, and the miso soup has that extra smoky flavor I look for.  Servings are big, and the price is very reasonable for the quality.  You will be pleasantly surprised!
