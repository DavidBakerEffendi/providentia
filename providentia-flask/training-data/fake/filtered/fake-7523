Grrrrreat food !! everything i've tried was amazing. A friend of mine took me to this 'Temple' as one of the reviewers worte :D. I had the chalumi salad, which i had before somewhere else, but wasn't as good as this one. It had just the right amount Â of dressing and the divine grilled cheese was just the perfect addition (too bad I don't live in the city.... I get craving from just by describing it ). Anyway, lets leave the salad aside for a second . I also had an Artichoke blend hummus (yes you can blend your hummus with different suggesting - so cool!) and it was so very tasty, warm and fresh. THEY BAKE THEIR OWN PITOT , imagine dipping the soft Pita in a fresh hummus - should I say more ? Besides their tasty food the place is well designed and you can tell they put a lot of thought into it especially all their tables and counter that are decorated with real (I was told by the owner ) Chick peas, it's insane If you are looking for an upgrade in what you already know about Hummus and Falafel , this is it - try it , I did and l will go back for more.
