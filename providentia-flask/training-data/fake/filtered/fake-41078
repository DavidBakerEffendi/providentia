I've been there twice already and I can't wait to go back for more! The pizzas are so filling and delicious. I'm in love with the meatballs. The tomato and mozzarella salad is great (the peppers are so tasty). I haven't had to wait for a table and the setting is great as well. Definitely my favorite place to go for pizza when I'm in the city!
