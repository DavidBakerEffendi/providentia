An unlimited supply of delicious sushi for a decent price. The sashimi isn't that fresh, but the specialty rolls and appetizers are incredible. You can get pretty much anything you want at a Japanese/Korean restaurant here with the sushi buffet combo. The only thing that sucks is the long wait time.
