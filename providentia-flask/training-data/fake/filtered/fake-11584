Overall good experience-great attentive staff.  Menu was not what we were used to in a mexican restaurant- a la carte.  We paid for chips and salsa, diappointing.  The Paloma was is an excellent drink choice.  Halibut tacos were very good, but I could have eaten twice the portion. If you are looking for a traditional mexican restaurant this is not the spot.
