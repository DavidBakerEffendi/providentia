The food was decent once it finally arrived. After ordering it was almost an hour before we saw even our waitress again. After ordering for a second time they never actually placed our order and couldn't even find it. The waitress at the end of the night assumed all of the change was her tip and never brought back our change to the table.. just a receipt.  Considering how bad the service was I guess it's the only way she was going to get a good tip. Would not go back again. The food wasn't worth the aggravation.  There are better all you can eat sushi places. And I'd gladly pay more for r a better experience.
