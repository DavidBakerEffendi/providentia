My family and I were on our way back from a long road-trip.  Tired and very hungry we stopped in for the first time.  Everything from the appetizers to the deserts was amazing!  Wow...what a total gem. The staff welcomed us like family.  You just don't find this anymore!  Bring your favorite bottle of wine and someone you love - you won't be disappointed!
