Was kind of turned off about 5 minutes after walking in and three large dogs walk in and head right into the kitchen. I am a dog lover and own a rather large dog but do feel it is sanitary to have a dog in the store or even worse the kitchen. The food was mediocre at best, and for the prices they charge you would expect a clean sanitary eating environment, not a dirty dingy place. I wish I could attach a picture so you can see how disgustingly dirty the ketchup bottle was on our table.
