I tried this place because it's literally a block from my apartment and I'm always looking for new places to eat on my day off. I had the beef tacos, which were very tasty but incredibly overpriced. You get two tiny tacos for $6 and after eating them I was just as hungry as before I ate them. Also, I was the only person in the place and when I made my to go order the guy at the counter seemed annoyed that I interrupted his coffee drinking time. Conclusion: Overpriced hipster taco joint, won't be getting my money again probably.
