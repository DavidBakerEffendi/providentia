I noticed Villalobos when I was walking to shop on Church Street and was so excited to come back because it looked so cute. I love the rustic decor, it's a nice change from the typical spots in the area. My husband and I shared the sea urchin guacamole to start- it was fresh and something I haven't had before. We really enjoyed our main course tacos. The menu is mix and match which I love because I can never decide on just one! We both had the short rib taco, the "tinga" chicken taco, then my husband had the pork belly and I had the vegetable Â taco. They were all the delicious. The vegetable taco was actually my favorite- super flavorful with just the right amount of spice. My husband loved the pork belly, and we both really enjoyed the rest. We would definitely recommend Villalobos for a fun date night, or for a group dinner. We'll be going back with friends!
