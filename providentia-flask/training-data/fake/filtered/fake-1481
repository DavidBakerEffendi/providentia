Wayne location. I had heard good things about this place - fresh locally grown food, vegan options, gluten free etc. I was disappointed and hungry when I left. I ordered the swordfish special for $29. It was a small boring piece of fish with a portion of fat. It was a pretty display but nothing for the palate. 2 cooked grape tomatoes, several raw mini squash, 2 cut halves of some orange root vegetable (can't imagine what; too hard to eat), one tiny cut roasted potato, about 1 Tsp carrot/parsnip puree (tasty), some green stringy garnish (like limp spinach or broccoli rabe). On the good side, nice atmosphere, adequate though not friendly service, good parking, "main line" clientele. Â Maybe a good place for drinks. Expensive. Delicious roll and butter which I had to ask them not to take away....good thing as I would have left even hungrier. I will try it for lunch sometime.
