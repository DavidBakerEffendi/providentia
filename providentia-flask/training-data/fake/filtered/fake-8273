I've been to several of Tria's locations in Philly and am a big fan, but this was my first time at their Taproom. I'd say the beer was good and the food was quite tasty (the wings with the green chile sauce are awesome). However, their ipad beer menu system is a total pain. You have to click on each individual beer before a new window opens up where you can see it's price, size and additional information about it. Â You only get one of these menus per table, so it takes a while to go through the beers and then place your order. I wish I'd been able to just scan a normal menu that listed prices that were easy to see because not everyone wants to spend $9 on 11 oz pour of a lager. The wine list can only be accessed from the homepage, so make sure not to miss it!
