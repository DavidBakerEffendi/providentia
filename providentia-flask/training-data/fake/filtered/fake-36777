I honestly don't understand where the hate is coming from for this place. This easily makes the top ten of best restaurants I have ever eaten at. Here are my favorites: dry fried green beans, mock eel, and Buddha's sesame beef, with coconut gelato for dessert. If you order nothing else, get the Buddha's sesame beef. It is vegetarian, but meat eaters and vegetarians alike can enjoy it. The seitan is cooked unlike anything I've had before and is flavored perfectly. I'm not sure why this place is labeled "chinese", I would describe it more as Asian fusion. It's a great place for a special occasion (especially since it is on the pricey side). The family style serving is great, because you get to try some of everything. Best food in Burlington, try this place!
