The place was crowded, with tables right on top of one another. But that was OK, I expected that in Montclair. It's big though, so it was also noisy. The food was pricey but decent. My real issue was the service which was terrible. The waiter was rude and he rushed us. And we had to ask for forks, of all things. Twice.
