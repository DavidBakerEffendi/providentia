Williamsburg was in need for a great felafel place . Thanks to Kabob Shack it has arrived.  They make the most delicious felafels in town., but it doesn't stop there. The food is always  made fresh.  They have good homemade  fries with special dipping sauces.  that are absolutely addictive.  The Pita sandwiches both chicken and Beef are also good.  If that isn't enough,  your food is prepared by  friendly staff. The atmosphere is small and relaxing.  The prices are so reasonable.   Any dish is under $10.  The Felafels are $3.   They stay open late for the weekend crowd looking for a great snack. They also support  local artist.  I'm please to have this new gem in my neighborhood.
