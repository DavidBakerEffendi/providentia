Great baba ganoush. (however you spell that)  It's just a little place without much seating room and the line is kind of long but I guess that's a sign that it's good lol.  The bread pocket thingies they use are really good too. The portion I got was kind of small but I think I ordered the small one.  So the small one is small, get the big one if you're hungry.
