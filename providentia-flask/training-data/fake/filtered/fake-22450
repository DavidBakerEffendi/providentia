On our way home from the city Sunday morning we made a stop at Queens Comfort for brunch . First of all this place has a really cool vibe, from the decor with the giant movie screen to the DJ everything screams cool and cozy . I have a pet peeve with small coffee cups and was happy to get a REAL coffee MUG . We couldn't decide what to get because there was so much that looked great so we just ordered a bunch of different items and all shared.  Fried Green Tomatoes which I have always wanted to try and they were so awesome  ,Chicken & Waffles sounds like such a odd combo but its a definite must try  . I love, love The Perfect Storm - it's smoked  Salmon & Hash Brown, Arugula, Poached Egg, Hollandaise - YUM . Oh and can't forget the disco Tot's !  . Don't try to be on a diet here you will miss out on all the fun. It's comfort food but with a funky fantastic twist. Just be aware its BYOB ( we made mimosa's ) and Cash only before you go so your prepared.
