My daughter brought me here for my birthday dinner. She has been here several times before and has always had spectacular meals and she really wanted to impress me. Â I drove from Boston where I work as a chef and it was wonderful! Our waiter was wonderful. He truly knew the menu items and was able to answer questions and give recommendations based on our responses. In fact, his descriptions of the specials made us want to have one of everything. We opted for the mussels in coconut milk and basil and the grilled asparagus. Yum! The mussels were tender, flavorful and made it to Italy by way of Thailand or Vietnam. I will be trying very hard to replicate that dish in the near future. The asparagus were perfectly crisp with the most delicate vinaigrette and shaved cheese on top. Just perfect. After much deliberation, we finally settled on the grilled lamb with figs and the crayfish risotto. Seriously, each was cooked to perfection. The lamb was so perfectly tender and flavorful with plenty leftover for another meal. The risotto was loaded with crayfish, creamy and perfectly seasoned with enough for another meal as well. We decided to split the apple cinnamon tart. It was delicious and was still too large a serving for the two of us to finish. We enjoyed a 1/2 bottle of wine with our meal. By Boston standards this was a very modestly priced dinner. I was reading the reviews that were complaining about the expensive prices. Come to Boston and then you'll have something to complain about! I can't wait to return.
