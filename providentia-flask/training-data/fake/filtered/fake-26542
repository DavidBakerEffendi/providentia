went their on a date, the atmosphere was not what i had envisioned,  Im not one to use my hands when eating, unless it ribs, corn on the cob and such, and that might have been the reason of my 2 stars.  The service was nice, and friendly, BUT the quality, and here again it may have been me, wasnt to my liking either. I will not be going back
