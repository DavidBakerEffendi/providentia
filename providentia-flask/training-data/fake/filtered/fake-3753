Ive been to this restaurant twice and got the same thing both times. The first time I was in love, very yummy I got the stuffed calms and the arugula salad with goat cheese instead of blue cheese, the salad dressing was perfectly dressed and the lobster bisque was great as well! The second time was only alright the stuffed calms had to much garlic and salt. The salad didn't pop to me this time... I wasn't that satisfied.. Â I think its time to try something new on the menu. But the place is great and the service was good, the hostess was awkward though.
