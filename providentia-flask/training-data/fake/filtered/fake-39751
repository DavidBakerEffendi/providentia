Some people go to restaurants for the food, some for the ambiance, some for the drinks, etc... As we would say in the theater world - Talula's Garden is a triple threat. Fist off, the food is very elegant, but most of all - delicious. There are a few dishes I like more than others (the lamb, halibut and the duck are my favs) and the cocktails are fresh and fun. Try the beekeeper if you love ginger!!!! The decor is bright and cheery - the garden looks more like something you would find in the south - complete with metal loungers, two of them are the same ones my grandparent's have in Alabama. But the real reason I am writing this review is for the service. The hosts are friendly - although I never heard so many people say 'super' so many times in 2 minutes - and the servers, runners and bussers are all polite and helpful. I particularly would like to mention Marissa. My wife and I have been in and have had her serve us twice now. She is such a breath of fresh air from the other servers we have come into contact with in the city. Some never give their name and make the service so impersonal, but this girl makes us feel very welcome and excited to be there, and really makes an effort to find out our personal likes and dislikes so she can guide us to dishes and cheese that we will truly enjoy. She even remembers what we had the previous times we were there. All of the staff has very good menu knowledge of the food, cheese, and wine, and Marissa has given some wine pairings that I wasn't too sure about at first, but totally loved in the end. That's great service. So go for the food, cheese, drinks, etc... you will be very happy. But the warm and genuine staff makes this place stand out from the other restaurants in the city.
