This place is truly the last of its kind. The corned beef, pastrami are pickled on the premises. Expect an oversize sandwich when you place your order. We had the number 5, pastrami always on the bottom, then corned beef topped with coleslaw on Jewish Rye. Then we had Jewish penicillin "Matzoh Ball Soup" . The chicken broth and noodle are like old time chicken soup. The knish is obviously home made and very tasty, try it with their mustard. Enjoy their complimentary pickles and make sure you wash all this down with a DR. Browns soda. My favorite is the celery soda.
