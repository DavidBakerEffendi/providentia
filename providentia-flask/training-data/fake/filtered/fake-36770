Absolutely the best pizza and beer in town.  High quality, very tasty house brewed beers on tap with a plethora of other worldly brews to choose from.  The pizza specials are always offering an incredible variety of local products, as well as a few standby traditional types.  Service is fast and friendly.  Quite affordable too.  A great place for both family and friend outings.
