Harvest Table is a GREAT organic food eatery in downtown Newark. The food is always fresh and delicious. The smoothies are incredible. The vibe of the place is great, welcoming, the walls lined with the masterpieces of local artists. They also host events: open mics, lectures, food tastings. The owner, Carissa, is sweet as can be. She always has some new treat she's concocted on hand. She's very helpful to suggest the right menu for anyone with food allergies and concerns. It is TRULY a gem to a rapidly reviving city. Thanks Harvest Table!!!
