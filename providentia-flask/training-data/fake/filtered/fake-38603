New Years Eve! I went there last night with my girlfriend & some friends. $75 cover for open bar & buffet food. The place seemed empty! If I found out there was over 50 people I would be shocked. The buffet was good, nothing high scale but my stomach was satisfied. The open bar was a joke! Every single drink was watered down & shots were not allowed. Choices were watery drinks or beer & I was not in the mood to take advantage of $75+tip worth of beer. The service was good but have no idea how it would have been if there were more than 2 people ordering drinks at a time. In the end we had a good night just because of our group making the best of it but I would not recommend going here for New Years Eve.
