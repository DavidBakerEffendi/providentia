Alright, here is the deal..... Great Pizza! Great Atmosphere! Great People! Great Bar! These people spared no expense in building this restaurant. I can't think of another place where you can go for unreal pizza and also have top shelf sprits, wine and also watch a game. This is no joke, if you have a family you enter the main entrance and sit in a nice friendly atmosphere. If you are going there on a date go to the bar room and have a blast. Great music and super attention to detail. Looking forward to getting snowed in at Grimaldi's one night this winter. P.S. The art work is also unreal. I can't imagine how much time it took to put this all tougher. It blows any other place away in the area. Enjoy!
