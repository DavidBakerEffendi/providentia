When you walk in, you are reminded of an old school saloon or watering hole.  A little dank and musty, standing room only and noisy.  The line is usually pretty long to get a table, but well worth the wait.  I think the menu has four items.  The best is the cheeseburger, possibly the best cheeseburger in the city.  It is grilled to perfection and served on a paper plate.   A no frills place, but a great burger.  And reasonable as well.
