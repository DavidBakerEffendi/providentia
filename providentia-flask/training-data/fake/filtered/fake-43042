A past reviewer asks why there are so many bad reviews for Fedora Cafe. Freya H., let me enlighten you. When you enter the cafe, and the employees stand around and talk with each other instead of seating you or even coming to the counter, that's a bad start. When you have to actually approach them to ask for a menu, and you're treated as if you were interrupting something, that's kind of another strike against you. When you observe one of the employees pushing down on the muffins in the case with their bare fingers to see how fresh they are, well, that kind of turns your stomach. But when you see one of the chefs in the kitchen dip their finger into a pot to taste whatever they were cooking, and then dip it in again, and THEN do the same thing, with the same licked fingers, into a SECOND pot, well Freya H., THAT is why there are so many negative reviews of this place. Not only will we not be coming back, but I'm thinking of calling the Board of Health.
