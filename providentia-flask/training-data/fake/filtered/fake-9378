When you're in New York City, make do with what the NYC people do!  Go out with friends and have fun for the entire night.  Go to this place called the Little Owl and expect to be not so little when you get out of the restaurant.  I had the best Lamb Chops in the city and I would really recommend that you have the same thing.  Bring your friends along too so you won't waste your NYC experience.
