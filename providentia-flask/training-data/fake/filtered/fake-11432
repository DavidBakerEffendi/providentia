I love the place The products are fresh and flavorful. Specially the Sauces they are delicious!! The pizza its all right, I guess that I feel it could be better because I am used to the American pizza which is not exactly the same as in Italy. But the place is cool. If you don't have anything to do in the week and you love food, this is your place.
