This is one of our favorite restaurants! Kenny the owner and his wife are personable and the sushi is always fresh and delicious. Great food and reasonable prices! Great for a business lunch or family dinner! My family gives it 5 stars because we always have a delicious meal and good time and visit several times a week! We love Mizu - thank you for coming to West Windsor!
