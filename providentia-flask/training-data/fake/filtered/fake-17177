I am a regular customer of Bombay Talk and love eating their during my visit to Iselin from northern NJ. But on Father'sday i had really really bad experience. I went with my friends and 16 month old daughter. My daughter eat food their and spitt up little bit. Mosty on her clothes and little on the floor. I asked the service boy to provide big roll of napkins to put on floor but to my surprise owner JHANVI MEHTA walked to me asked to clean the floor even we were not finished eating. She told us that their team won't clean this and it's not their policy. I have never experience or seen such attitute from an owner and such arguments from famous resturant. Really hopeless policy which is not written anywhere but in a resutarant where they charge heavy service charge even if you are a two people. Writing this review so customers who are going with their lovely little kids be prepared for this policy and carry stuffs to clean teh floor.
