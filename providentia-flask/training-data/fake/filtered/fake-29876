Don't order take-out if you plan on using the coupons from the magazine coupon mailer. I placed a larger order, assuming I could use the $5 or $10 off coupon. The coupon only indicated "dinner only" but not that it had to be dine-in (some other coupons DID indicate that so I figured this one was for dine-in or carry-out). When I picked up my food, the woman told me that I couldn't use either coupon, that they were for dine-in only and that the magazine had misprinted the coupons. Well that wasn't my fault! And I likely would have ordered from somewhere else had I known I would pay the full amount of the bill. Very disappointing - and we typically like the food but customer service is often bad! This time was no different!!!
