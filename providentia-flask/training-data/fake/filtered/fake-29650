I like Jimmy's - it's not a bad spot. I would take a friend there for lunch, or suggest it to a colleague. It's just that today they kept us waiting for our food for a half an hour, and there was this hugely thick piece of chicken skin with hair on it attached to my friend's Â chicken and waffles plate. The coffee was like three bucks each (!!!!)...it just wasn't great. It was horrible, but we both felt like we don't want to go back there for a while.
