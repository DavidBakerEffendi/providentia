I've been coming here since it opened, a year and a half now? And I have to say Beco has the most consistently good brunch I've had in a restaurant,  period. The proprietary blend Bloodies are a knockout (i know for a while they were using Stoli as the house Vodka I wonder if they still are) I started with the Empanadas last time I came in and it was delicious, lightly crisp and with a lot of that homemade chimichurri on them I was a ship being wheeled out to the pad. I usually get the steak and eggs (nice price @ 12) but this last time I got the choose your own fillings herb omelet and my girlfriend got the scone and eggs and that came with a lip smacking little dish of Portuguese sausage on the side - get it! My omelet was awesome and the portions were plentiful. Coffee - lynchpin of a brunch is a standout here - good and strong/cafe con leche style. On a side note this place has aged well it has a nicely comfortable broken in quality like a seasoned baseball mitt now. I wish I lived closer it's a great asset for any hood. Saúde!
