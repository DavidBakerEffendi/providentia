Ordered (for delivery) the medium Veggie Delight and the Friday's special (Sausage, green pepper and onion sandwich + fries + soda). First time ordering. Food was mediocre. The sauce and cheese weren't bad but I wasn't really a fan of the regular crust. The sandwich quality was lower than that of the average food truck, in terms of bread and meat quality. Anyway this was probably my own fault for ordering this sandwich over a popular item. I also think that the pizza was grossly overpriced. The ingredients didn't taste like they were premium or anything out of the ordinary so why am I paying $19 for a medium pizza? (I only chose it because I thought the flavors would compensate, based on previous reviews, or that they were using nonstandard sizes). What really irked me was that they advertise fast delivery AND they told me the pizza would arrive in 35 minutes...yet it took exactly 1 hour and 15 minutes! I can understand that they might have been busy since it was a Friday night but would they not have adjusted for that in their estimate? To top it off they forgot to bring me my soda. So all in all not a great first impression. Don't think I'll be dining here again unless someone begs me to.
