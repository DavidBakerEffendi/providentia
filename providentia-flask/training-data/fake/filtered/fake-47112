This was an absolutely amazing meal. My boyfriend and weren't incredibly hungry so we split the set price menu special, which comes with a starter and an entree. We got the beef tartar. It was so good! Just the right combination of textures. The pork chop was next and it was so tender! I've never had it so tender before. It was well paired with brussel sprouts and an apple mustard. Great service too! Highly recommended.
