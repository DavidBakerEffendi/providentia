What an amazing meal and experience we had there!  Ambiance is great--hard to explain but you do walk by the open kitchen on your way in which is innovative and cool, and such a small kitchen that still produces such incredible food!  Made a reservation and the table was all ready--lovely, bright yellow, very welcoming decor and right away you know you're in for a special evening.  We had the entire staff of four assisting us throughout the evening, which is so good to keep everything moving.  Brought our own bottle of wine, which the first waiter opened as he told us the evening's specials, and we were off!   We had a veal dish which was fantastic, their gnocchi in an asiago and thyme cream sauce, also wonderful, some kind of shredded duck and pasta which again, was innovative and delicious and some of their own homemade pasta in an eggplant tomato sauce...all delectable.  Dessert was a combo of canolis and caramel gelato and when someone leaked the news that it was our wedding anniversary celebration, they added a candle and beautifully written "Happy Anniversary" on the plate in caramel creme! Prices were very reasonable, service excellent, a little long between appetizers and entrees, but they had a very large party ahead of us but it didn't matter--you don't want to rush though dinner there--it's very relaxing and puts you and keeps you in a good mood the whole time...Can you tell that we really enjoyed it!  Worth a trip down Broad Street---you will NOT be disappointed!
