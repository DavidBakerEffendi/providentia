I went here for the first time with a friend, and I have never gone to another soul food restaurant since then. When people are looking for a good place to eat i always recommend them here. It is the best soul food in New Haven. The ambiance is amazing and the staff is super friendly. Sabrina is AMAZING! She is so nice and is so accommodating. If you're looking for good food, a friendly staff and a nice environment this is where you need to go.
