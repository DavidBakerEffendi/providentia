Although I have been here in the past an enjoyed it, I had a horrible experience this past weekend. The female bartender was completely disinterested, rude and preoccupied with talking to her friend at the bar. When my husband asked if they had happy hour she mockingly responded "we never have happy hour." (Well, it says you do on this site). Then, when he asked if he could see a wine list as he was unable to see the board in the dark, she acted as if we were fools for asking such a question. I do hope management reads this post as I have always enjoyed it here and hope that this experience isn't mimicked in the future. With so many other great places in the neighborhood, I am not certain I will return.
