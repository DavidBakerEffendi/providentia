This place rules but I think they recently changed their chips to some much cheaper, tasteless version and it really annoyed me. I'll still give them a good rating because I like them a lot and their prices are reasonable. But come on dudes. Don't skimp on the small stuff! I hope you read these reviews and care about what your loyal customers think about stuff like this.
