DOUBLE CHECK YOUR TAKE OUT ORDER!!!   They're always screwing it up!  Usually they put in the wrong order and it's a pain driving back from your house to get it replaced.  I spoke to the Manager, Ricky, about this and told him this has happened 3 times in the past and I usu. go to their Bridgewater location since their service is much better.  I gave him another chance after 3 years and they messed up!  He seems like a nice guy but he doesn't seem to have much control over the kitchen or the attitude of his staff (they're one step up from a food kiosk in a mall).  Bottom line is that for a take out order that can run between 40 to 80 bucks, this is UNACCEPTABLE!!.   FOOD IS GOOD BUT GO TO BRIDGEWATER IF YOU WANT GOOD TAKE OUT & TABLESIDE SERVICE & POLITE STAFF AND A GOOD DINING EXPERIENCE!!!!
