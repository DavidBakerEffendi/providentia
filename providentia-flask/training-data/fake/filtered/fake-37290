I may never cook again. I live within a block of this place, and I only today discovered the food here. I bought some moussaka, greek salad, stuffed peppers and baklava for dinner. All were very, very good. Seriously, if you live nearby, don't even bother going to seamlessweb. Prices are unbeatable, the food is delicious and wholesome.
