Possibly the best Italian food I've ever eaten! After living in Italy, it's been hard to find great Italian food and I have to say, Trecolori goes above and beyond! My boyfriend and I went before seeing a play last December and have been back about 4 times! Staff is so nice and welcoming, food came in good timing and was delicious! Can't wait to go back and eat the puttanesca dish!!!
