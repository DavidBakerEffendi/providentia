This was the worst  most incompetent restaurant experience I have ever had. They managed to ruin our daughter''s family graduation dinner by booking us a table at 7:15 and failiing to serve ANY food for two hours. They finally brought a pathetic small plate of pizza at 9:15 (which we hadn't ordered) and brought appetizers at 9:30. After being told that our dinner order had been "put in" at 9:30, and looking at the several other tables that were still without food, we finally left, hungry. And by the way, the appetizers were overpriced and  tasteless and the owners were obnoxious. DO NOT EAT HERE! This is one "old-fashioned" Italian restaurant that really ought to hang it up.
