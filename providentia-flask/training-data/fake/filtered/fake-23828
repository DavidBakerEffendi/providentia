It worth a wait. The restaurant's outside appearance is decorated by a cute little spotted pig and plants. The indoor ambiance is great. You can see a lot of young and trendy people there. You can smell truffle oil from shoestring fried (most ordered items!) Highly recommend the liver toast and pickles!
