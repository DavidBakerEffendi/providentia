I grew up outside of Philly but never had the chance to have a Pat's cheesesteak. About three weeks ago I finally did try one. I was very disappointed and surprised. After all these years of waiting, it was not that great. The roll was okay but there wasn't much meat and we couldn't taste the onions. I was with three other people and they felt the same. It was an okay sandwich; nothing to brag about. For the price they charge, it was not worth it. I would never recommend this place. I don't understand all the hype over these cheesesteaks. Although not in the Philadelphia area, we prefer a sandwich place called Panino's located on North Cedar Crest Blvd in Allentown, PA Â They know how to make an outstanding cheesesteak. They use a roll with flavor and do not skimp on the meat.
