I never do this but my dining experience at Zahav was just so amazing. As me and my family started to get hungry strolling Old City we ended up at Zahav. I must say walking into this restaurant I wasn't sure what to expect, I never been there. My server was very knowledgeable (Okon?) he helped me and my family find things that weren't too off-the-wall and they were delicious! the turkish hummus and the haloumi cheese were probably my favorite dishes of the night, but everything was great, Expect to try things that are full of flavor but different.... Leaving the restaurant I chatted with the hostess for a little bit while our server got our jackets, She was very sweet and definitely made Zahav a great ending to our night, I cant wait to come back. BRAVO ZAHAV!
