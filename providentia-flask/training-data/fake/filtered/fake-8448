The staff was amazing, sat us right away and immediately accommodated our need for alcohol. Bottomless bellinis for a great price with multiple mixers. The benedict dishes were fantastic, and the tater tots hit the spot! The manager, Stephen, was very friendly, and came by several times to make sure all of our needs were met. He even complimented my t-shirt, which scored major points. Love this place and would come back repeatedly, if for nothing than the tater tots and the service! Heart Stephen long time.
