We had greatly anticpated our evening at Scarpetta, but left disappointed.  Once seated we were met with a waiter (Russel) who didn't seem like he had the time of day for us.  In our party of 2, one of us wanted the Chef's tasting menu, we were told, with some degree of gruff, absolutely not, it's for the entire table or not at all.  Since I personally was the one not having it, I said, "I am completely fine with enjoying my wine while he is served", we were still told NO!  So, what I want you to take away from this is that we were told we could not order what we wanted!  UMMMM.  This, just by the way, is not our first experience in an upscale place, but unlike this place, other places we have enjoyed made us fill like we were their special guests for the evening, not here, we were made to fill uncomfortable.  There are too many options out there for great Italian, with great atmosphere and enjoyable service, so my recommendation would be to try another place, not Scarpetta!
