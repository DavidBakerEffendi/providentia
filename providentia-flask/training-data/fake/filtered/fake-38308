The soft shelled crab po boy deserves 10 stars!  This is a delightful place with fabulous food and friendly servers - what more could you ask?  Great drinks and my favorite southern desert, bread pudding?  Yep, they are great also.  I didn't ask, but I'm guessing this would be THE place to watch the Kentucky Derby next spring, sip a mint julep, and enjoy the best po boy you've ever had.  I'm in!
