I should title this review "the front of the ship", as in "the back of the bus." I have wanted to go to the Moshulu for a long time, because I've heard good things about the food and service and also because I'm interested in the ship and its history. The food and service were terrific, but there was one major problem. When we were seated, the hostess took us to the back left room in the dining area, which is actually toward the bow of the ship. My companion, who is black and has experienced being put in the corner in many restaurants, thought we were sent to this inconspicuous area because we are an interracial couple.  She said, could we sit at another table, next to where we were seated but not in the back room.  The hostess explained that they have to seat tables in a way that will balance the number of parties each of the servers is helping.  However, within three minutes, the table we had asked for was filled, I believe by two or three white men.  I was skeptical about what my companion said, or should I say naive.  The waiter asked if we wanted to speak with the manager, but we didn't (we should have). When we were seated, another interracial couple was seated in the back room, and within short order two additional black couples were seated there, where there may be eight or ten tables. In fairness, when I went to the men's room, I found that there were a couple of black couples seated elsewhere. Needless to say, this experience ruined our evening at the Moshulu.  The restaurant needs to do something about what seems to be a discriminatory policy, whether it is or not. Maynard R
