Love this place! My friends and I came here on a Tuesday evening. We had never been here but heard about it so we stopped in after seeing a show down the street. The decor is AMAZING! To die for! The food was delicious, too! I had the Shapards Pie and it was the perfect comfort food for the cold weather we've been having. The service was great, too. Very friendly staff. Whether you live in the city or are just visiting, I would HIGHLY recommend stopping into this place! It's a true hidden gem!
