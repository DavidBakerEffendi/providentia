I love Brooklyn Commune. It is such a gathering place for KWT. The friendly, open vibe encourages everything from CSA distributions to family style theme dinners to local activist efforts to freelancers to mommy groups. There is so much to love, including: -delicious coffee ($2 for a small Stumptown...yum) -very healthy, tasty, seasonal menu with creative options for carnivores, vegetarians and vegans -friendly, professional service, which counts for a lot for me -low key, open, airy, "linger as long as you like" atmosphere -large bathroom with a changing table -BYO policy, and with Juice Box next door I am ashamed to admit I have never taken advantage! I will say that some menu items, like small cookies, are pretty expensive for what they are, and that I have been disappointed in the soups. But this place is a cornerstone of the neighborhood, and I hope they will be here for many years to come.
