Went for dinner tonight with son and daughter in law. Waitress was the worst I have ever had. Brought their pizza 15 minutes before my eggplant parm sandwich. When we could catch her to ask about the sandwich, which wasn't easy, she said "the kitchen will ring a bell when yours is ready". She never came back to see if we needed anything, such as drink refills, or if anything was ok. My son, who has been a server, was aghast at her attitude. Food was so so, but we have never been treated so rudely anywhere else, and I live in Manhattan and eat out often. Avoid this place like the plague, we surely will.
