VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!! Chris Painter shame on you!!!. The food was extremely over priced and tasted fair at best, portions where very tiny... I had scallops and it basically amounted to the serving size of a table spoon!!! Drinks tasted good but "the fall of Rum" had little to no run in it. The only good thing I could say was our server was very good. I WOULD NOT EVER GO HERE AGAIN AND WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE ELSE TO EITHER. The cost was an average $110 per person in our party of seven.
