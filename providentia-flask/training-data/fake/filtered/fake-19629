I have been to many Thai restaurants and go for Thai often and I have to say Thai Ping was by far the absolute worst Thai food I have ever eaten. I was leery of going after reading many bad and mediocre reviews but it was close to a friends home so we decided to give it a shot. NEVER again...it was just that bad.
