The hilarious name is in stark contrast to the serious eats in this lovely restaurant. I was there yesterday and shared a selection of dishes, one more intriguing than the next. Drunken Shrimp...amazing. Duck Lettuce wraps...delectable. Thai Esquites with sweet corn...addictive. The decor is also compelling, the paintings really do complement the sensual nature of this titillating food. Well played Madam and Sir:)
