This place is such a gem! My favorite italian eatery in all of NY. Food is delicious and is served fresh from the oven. Service is great...although it can take a bit at busiest hours. Prices are very reasonable and the ambiance is absolutely a joy. Feels like home! A great place for a date or family dinner!!
