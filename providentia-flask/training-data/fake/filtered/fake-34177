I've never written a review anywhere before but I would like to warn everyone about the type of people that run this establishment. This is by far the WORST customer service that I've ever experienced in NYC. The reservationist is extremely RUDE and will belittle you if you ask for any assistance. Yasuda BEWARE of the individuals handling your phone lines because they do not have the slightest idea how to deal with your guests.
