It will depend on what you get. I got the egg and chicken roll which was great but my husband got the kebab roll which is a definite no no. Cute pictures on the wall depicting the menu and old indian movie posters. Small seating area, kind of hot to sit inside the summers (even tho have ac) but not bad. Don't go for a main meal - use as a place to snack and go and you will not be disappointed. Prices are great ! 20 bucks for 2 people -can't be beat.
