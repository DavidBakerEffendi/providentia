I visted Zio a few weeks ago. My daughter was running in the Phily Marathon and we were staying at the Marriott Downtown and the concierge recommended this place for pizza. Â Being a native New Yorker, I'm an admitted "pizza snob" but I know that Philly has some really good pizza. Well, we all were pleased. The regular cheese pizza was very good (the sauce I thought, was lacking something) but I loved the white pie, full of garlic and ricotta. If she runs Philly again next year, we're going back.
