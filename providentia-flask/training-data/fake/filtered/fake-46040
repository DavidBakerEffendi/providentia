We went to MP Taverna Saturday night for dinner.  The place was very busy and we were late for our reservation, however, we were seated right away.  I was pleasantly surprised that as busy as they were, the service was quick and efficient - 5 stars for service.  The food was very good.  Octopus salad definitely gets 5 stars!  I had grilled branzino and it was good (even though I like olives, it was a little too heavy for me on the olives, I would rather prefer to get a few more of those fingerling potatoes the dish comes with).  We also ordered bulgar salad, which was simply delightful, lots of flavor and complexity.  Another entree was fusilli, which was cooked perfectly, but was rather simple.  For desert we split creme brulee, which the only way I can describe it is "loaded creme brulee," as it was topped with fresh berries, kanafeh shreds and sprinkled with powdered sugar.  I'm very particular with my creme brulee and the custard wasn't set right for my taste.  Overall, the ambiance, service, and food are very good.  We will definitely be back to try more dishes on their menu.
