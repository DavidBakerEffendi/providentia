THE MOST PRETENTIOUS BURGER IN THE WORLD!  This place lives off nothing but hype.  Imagine unseasoned meatloaf in between two cheap slices of toast paired with a slather of acme cheese sauce out of a  10# can.  If that is  up your ally go but bring a book because your going to be there for a long time!  Oh and also bring SALT, and other condiments because the burgers lack flavor,texture, and anything other than the name on the sign!
