Pizza is alright. Not really sure whats so famous about it... The buffalo was on the top of my list here. ****They have a 15 buck minimum for credit and debt cards... and when i informed him that per their merchant agreement they really weren't suposed to do that, he responded by telling me that he doesn't care if they take his credit cards away because it costs too much per slice. So i told him that maybe he should raise the price of the pizza per slice.... and he said he couldn't do that. Overall i felt like the policys for their customers were lacking the most. They all just came off as kinda stupid. And for a pizza place that is only so-so, i thought that they shouldn't be so anti-consumer. I dont like being taken advantage of... and it seams like that's what they're comfortable doing to their customers.
