Being a fan of Marea since its opening, I was very eager to try the new Michael White's place. I knew that the experience would not be comparable, Osteria Morini being much more casual. I had a lovely evening but not a great one. The place is designed to look like an Italian osteria but it actually looks like an Italian restaurant at Disneyland. Way too artificial... But nobody goes to an Italian restaurant for the decor. Everyone goes there for the food... The food was comforting and delicious. Not very creative or inventive. Simply well executed and the perfect place to enjoy a great plate of pasta with friends. We started with a charcuterie plate, the croquettes and the skewers. Very nicely presented. We ordered every single type of pasta on the menu for our table and were not disapointed. They were all cooked to perfection and absolutely to die for. Nothing will never come close to the octopus and bone marrow fusilli at Marea but these paste were just great... The torta we had for dessert was disapointing. Service was very professional but not very friendly. It did not matter. We had a very nice evening and I will definitely be back. Just because this is one of the best pasta place in the city.
