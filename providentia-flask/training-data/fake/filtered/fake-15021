Disappointingly inconsistent at best. Been getting take-out lunch weekly and typically the grilled shrimp wrap. Only once in a great while it's good. I'll ask for the spinach wrap tortilla and get plain. I'll ask for a little dressing and its soaked to the bone. Today's dressing consisted of a river of only olive oil, and again asked for just a little dressing which is supposed to be a lemon vinaigrette. The young gentleman who typically answers the phone has an attitude and is rude, and talks over you -- give me the impression he's being bothered by answering the phone. Went back to complain in person and received nothing more than an "oh well" attitude. Angelos is pricey, but I don't mind paying extra for consistency and a quality meal, although dealing with both attitude placing an order, and receiving inconsistent meals, I am done with Angelos in Lake Hiawatha.
