Wish I could give this a three and a half.  The fries are bangin'.  I suggest the mango chutney and the pesto.  The crowds are fratty.  Don't go there on any day that starts with an S, or an F, or any day which anyone might choose to take off of work for a celebratory reason.   Just sayin. The crowd during halloween went around the block.  Yikes.
