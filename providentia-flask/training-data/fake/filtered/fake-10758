Worst food we have fasted in whole world. I just visited my desi friends in NJ. I am the fan of the Shalimar chain of restaurant in CA, however when we got-in there we know that this is not the same chain. We tried this and ordered mutton korma, chicken Kabab and cholay. The food was so tasteless as some novice has cooking inside. There is no proper mixed of spices and salt. Please don't waste your time and money on this low grade tasteless and degrade restaurant.
