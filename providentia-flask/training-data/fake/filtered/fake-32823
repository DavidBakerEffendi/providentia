I LOVE AREPAS CAFE!  Not only is the food great - my special favorites are Guanesa Tropical, Camarones and the Domino - but there are lots of gluten free options - that aren't salad :)  The food always tastes fresh and the atmosphere is laid back.  Very reasonably priced too- a great place to take your friends and order a Happy Hour pitcher of Sangria!
