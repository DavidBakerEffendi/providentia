Well a crowded jasmiine rice just spells disaster i guess. Im ussually not the one to complain about presentation but it looked liked the food was slopped on my plate and microwaved. Found a couple of bones in the chicken and cartiledge that was just tough. Mussles in the curry sauce that were not open, sent it back. Not to mention i couldnt stomach the food i got down..appetizers were good though.. and that carrot Â string ball that is on every plate is kinda just a waste didnt know if i should eat it or what.
