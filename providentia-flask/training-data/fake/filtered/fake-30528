I have never felt more unwelcome at a place when I went here with a friend. He was so excited to take me here as a visitor to the area, and when we were seated that was the end of our service. We sat patiently waiting for the waitress to come over, and 18 minutes later we decided to go else where. I understand if restaurants are busy, but we were one of 6 tables of people in the place. Â Best part was watching the waitress set silverware up at tables around us, and wait on two tables of people that came in long after us. I have never left before this was a first. We loved the thank you have a great day we were told when we walked out the door....rude. I will never attempt to go back to this place in future visits.
