Always love coming here especially having drinks and dinner in the bar area.Love the salmon here. It's amazing. Love the kale and Quinoa salad. What makes the meal special is the service. Our server Mark was very attentive and had a great personality. He was very knowledgeable about choosing wines and various menu items. All great choices. He is why you come back. You can get great food anywhere. It's the service that is the most important part of the meal.
