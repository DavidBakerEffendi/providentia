Excellent fresh fish! I have had dinner here more than a few times and I can say it doesn't come any fresher than this. Ideal place for sushi, also excellent Korean food if one is looking beyond their sushi menu. It's BYOB, so I can bring my favorite sake which makes it even better. Very reasonable prices and good service, laid back but attentive. Do not miss.
