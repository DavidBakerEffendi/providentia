I love the hijiki salad here!  Everything Ive ever gotten here rocks and I love the laidback vibe.  There is also WIFI here which is very convenient.  I only give it 4 instead of 5 stars because i think they could work a bit on the ambiance.  In the daytime the outdoor patio is great but inside is a bit dark and dreary.
