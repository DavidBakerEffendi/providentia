Stumbled upon this bar today while searching for something quick to eat before the parking meter ran out and I loved it.  The grilled cheese and tomato soup was SO GOOD.  I'll definitely be coming back for that again.  They also had some pretty tasty beers on tap and our waitress/bartender was really sweet and had a bubbly personality.
