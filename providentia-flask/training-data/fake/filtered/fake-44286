Eat here or you'll be sorry. Order off the secret Chinese menu for the top dawg stuff, also really good General Tso's relative to everybody else I guess. Good value, friendly friendly owner. Loves kids- high schoolers, college students the whole shebang, Try looks sketchy but has a heart of gold, a veritable Hunchback of Notre Dame of a restaurant, except with less dying.
