As someone who ate a lot of Cuban food in Miami for 12 years, I find that this place satisfies that craving for a solid cuban sandwich, vaca frita, flan, croquetas, and many other traditional Cuban dishes. The service was also very warm and inviting. Also, they serve a mean cup of cafecito. We noticed the side coffee window as we left - looking forward to coming back and sitting there when the weather gets warmer.
