I genuinely wish I could give Talk of the Town even more stars!  5 doesn't seem like enough for the food and service we received.  My first time at Talk of the Town was when they first opened and it was relatively empty so the owner spent a great deal of time with us guiding us on our order.  I just went for the second time this past weekend and I'm happy to say that the owner still spent as much time with us and was just as charming and friendly as when the place first opened.  The big difference was that this time the place was practically packed!   Try the chole bhatura for sure.  You know when you've had it at other places and your fingers end up a greasy mess?  Not with these bhaturas!  And the owner suggested a special dessert for us--Raabdi--which had a delicious pudding-like consistency and was clearly homemade.  Also highly recommended--the aloo masala fries (yum!) and the samosas (classic).   A sit down lunch for four with appetizers and dessert came out to just around $10 a person... you can't beat that!  (Of course, I had to add a few extra dollars to order a chole bhatura to go... yes it's THAT good). If you are within a half hour drive of this place, DO IT.  It's totally worth it!
