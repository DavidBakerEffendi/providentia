This is my favorite Thai restaurant.  The owner is very friendly and always accommodating to our table.  I would say it's more of a home style place in regards to the dishes and spices.  Most Thai places I've been to offer the same generic dishes and overload them with spice to the point where I can't even taste anything.  If you do like it that hot, then Spice II will be able to help you out, but generally they use just the right amount. We have been coming here since the owner was running Spice in Bloomfield.  We have tried other places, but always end up coming back to Sheree's. It's BYOB like most Montclair spots.
