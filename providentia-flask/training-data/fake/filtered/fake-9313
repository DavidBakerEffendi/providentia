I ordered 50 sticks of chicken barbecue for New Year's Eve.  On their online menu, it is $2.00 a stick, but when I ordered they didn't inform that the price had changed.  When I picked it up, they charged me $3.00 a stick, saying that the online menu was "old".  I had no choice but to take it since guests were expecting it.  I used to like this restaurant and have brought many friends here.  I'm not going to do that any more.
