Writing along with others who went there the other night.  Normally, I don't like to say negative things about a business, I try and find something good to say. But, I did not like the way we were treated. Wait staff is rude, plain and simple- from the hostess to the server. My oysters tasted "off" and had to be sent back, other dishes we tried were bland and unappealing and our server was not nice at all. I dine out in Montclair all the time, and there are many other restaurants far better than this place in the area. One thing, the place looks nice, but who cares when you pay over $ 70 per person for dinner and it is an unsatisfying expereince ?  WE spoke to the hostess on the way out about what we experienced and her response was "sorry, we usually don't get complaints"   however, after reading all the reviews for this place, that could not be farther from the truth.  I will never walk in there again, and based on our group's after dinner converstation, neither will the other 4 people I was with...just an awful experience.
