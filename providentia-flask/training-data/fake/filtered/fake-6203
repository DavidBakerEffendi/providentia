I may be a minority in saying this but on an order delivery on 1/25/13 I waited two hours for a delivery. When the food finally showed. it was cold and I refused to take it. Who in their right mind would take a delivery when the food they ordered, was cold. To their defense, it was lightly snowing so. I did take that into consideration, Two hours.....Come on! I ordered from them in the past and their food is decent!! But, screw me twice..................I think not   Anyhow, the BRUNO OWNER called to ask way I refused the delivery and after stating my displeasure he said " Montclair State University is off our delivery list" So, to all of you fellow MSU alumni, Please keep this in mind when you need to order pizza from BRUNO'S, that there are many within the range of MSU that is just as good  or better. BRUNO'S GETS A BIG FAT THUMBS DOWN FROM ME and its not because of the late delivery but because of the way he treats the customers......NO RESPECT and HOW CAN SOMEONE RUN A BUSINESS LIKE THAT ? REALLY!!!!!!!!!!!
