A fellow employee brought some seafood chili to work to share at lunch with the rest of the gang and it was an instant hit.  Everyone wanted to know where he got it and the answer was Stowe's. So, I decided to stop by with some friends today for lunch. First of all I was impressed by the extensive menu. If you want fish and chips, you have your choice of haddock, cod, sole, salmon, tuna, swordfish or tilapia. Or choose fried clams, shrimp, oysters, scallops, or calamari (called "squid" on the menu, but I prefer to call them calamari). I ordered the New England Clam Chowder - so rich and creamy, the hot buttery lobster roll, and a seafood stuffed clam, all of which were very good. On the way out I grabbed two pints of their amazing seafood chili to take home. Beverages are various bottled sodas, Snapple tea and water.  You are not allowed to bring your own beverage. I'm already planning my next visit. I'm going to try the stuffed scallop, stuffed shrimp, stuffed sole and a crab cake. So, my advice is, if you decide to stop by for lunch or dinner, don't leave without picking up a pint or two of the seafood chili to go. You can't get it anywhere else.
