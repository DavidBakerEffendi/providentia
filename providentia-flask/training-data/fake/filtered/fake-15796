I was actually quite disappointed with my overall experience at Grimaldi's on Friday night. We were actually going to dine at the one in Manhattan, but we were recommended to visit this location instead. I am a huge lover of pizza, and have eaten really great pizza  all around the world. I had really high expectations of Grimaldi's, but unfortunately my expectations were not met when I dined there with a good friend on Friday night. We arrived at Grimaldi's at 5pm, and we were lucky to be seated straight away. My good friend ordered the pizza, with tomato, pepperoni, olives, mushrooms, and cheese. The pizza was really good, and I now wished I had ordered pizza instead. I decided to order the calzone, especially when I discovered they had ricotta on the menu. The calzone was generous in size, but it lacked flavor, and tomato sauce. I assumed as a standard it would come with tomato sauce and cheese. It came with the cheese, but not with the tomato sauce. On asking, the waiter brought me some tomato sauce on the side. I ordered my calzone with ricotta, olives and ham. To be honest all I could taste in my calzone was the ricotta. I was disappointed. I would have to say it was one of the worst calzones that I have ever eaten :(  My reason for rating it a 2. The service was average. The ambience and atmosphere was great. The choice of music was perfect - I felt like I was in Italy. My friend and I had a lovely catch-up, and on the whole it was a really great night. My recommendation - skip the calzone, and go with the standard pie/ pizza :). Ask for a table upstairs - the atmosphere and view is so much better!!
