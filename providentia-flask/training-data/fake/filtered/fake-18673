Been here at least 4 times and have yet to be disappointed.  I especially enjoy their season menus and really can't recall anything I didn't like.  One thing I love about Danny Meyer restaurants is the BYO policy.  As a wine person, the ability to bring my own wines for a $20 corkage in NYC is just awesome.  Would highly recommend this restaurant any time of year.  I can't imagine anyone being disappointed.
