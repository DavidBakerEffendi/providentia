It was for the last 5 years my favorite place to eat in Newark NJ, that is until today. I went there last night, like i do several times a year, and upon arrival i was told that if i wanted a table at the bar one was about to vacant and if i wanted to wait maybe 15 or 20 m i could have that table, i agreed and waited, after 40 m of waiting another waiter came and asked what i wanted and i told him that i was waiting for that table, which he answered that the table i had been waiting for the past 40 m was after all reserved. I was completely furious and he told that wasn't is fault and that was nothing he could do. I left and told him that they never would see me or my $$$ again. I advise everybody that wants to do there to make sure upon arrival that they really have a table waiting for them. VERY BAD MANAGEMENT.
