We went to Plyos on a Saturday night and had a 9:45pm reservation. We got there and were asked to wait as our table wasn't ready yet. Unfortunately we weren't seated until 10:45pm, but fortunately because of good company and a bottle of wine while we waited, we weren't phased by this delay. The restaurant staff was very apologetic while we waited, which was nice to see. Once we were seated the staff went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and again very apologetic for the wait.  The timing of our food was perfect. We ordered the meatballs, octopus and mousakka as appetizers, all of which were great. The Mousakka being our favorite. For dinner, our entrees included the stripe bass (average), lamb chops (delicious), and the shrimp and scallop pasta (good).  The lamb chops were definitely the favorite item of the night! It happened to be my birthday so I was surprised with a round of dessert options and dessert wine compliments of the restaurant! DELICIOUS!! The service was top notch and the atmosphere is perfect. I would definitely go back and recommend it to others as well.
