Forget about the noise.  What is going on with the air freshener ?  The second you open the front door it chases you in to the dining room, and stays for dinner.  What are they trying to cover up?  There were 8 of us, so we tried almost all of the appetizers, except the oysters, none of us had gotten our shots.  Not impressed with the bland lobster slidders, the spring rolls could have been from Costco, and the sliced beets looked like they came straight from the can.   The service was tragic, they tried to rush our main course, even after we said we needed more time.     With all the great places to eat in Montclair, why is this town lacking a good seafood place.  Never again.
