I love this place SPICE END. I am in love with this place and CHICKEN BIRYANI i have been eating at this place since they open. i dont believe some of the yelpers that its only one or two piece of CHICKEN because all the time i have to say less chicken. i think they are serving finest BIRYANI IN PHILADELPHIA. AND ALSO GREAT MANAGEMENT very polite cashier and all the staff...please give them fair rating!!!
