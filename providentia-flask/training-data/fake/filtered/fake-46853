The first time I found them at WF, they only had the strawberry flavored ones.Thanksgiving to make sure I could find a marshmallow company that didn't have animal gelatin in their products because some of my guests were vegan.Sara's marshmallows are simply the most decedent you will ever have. And on top of that they are vegan.It was absolutely delicious and I would gladly buy from her again in the near future.
