This is the worst place to order from. The service is horrible and they do not know how to take orders. I ordered one thing and received a completely different order. Not only that but when I called to inform them of it the lady on the phone was rude and screamed then hung up. I am sorry but that is definitely not the way you do business and they need to take a class on how to talk to customers.
