I was at Adobe Blues last night and the service was horrible. There was a new manager I have not seen before and he was really biased against my group of friends. We waited an hour and half his accuse was that he did not know we wanted to wait after we had been there forty-five minutes so anyone taking friends to Adobe Blues that are all black or Hispanic you might get stereotyped!  Be aware they will try to make you feel as uncomfortable as possible to prompt you to leave. I knew what was going on and did not want to leave after we waited for so long! In my type of job it entails going to many business meetings at restaurants and bringing my new friends to Adobe Blues was a total embarrassment. After we waited so long they gave us the tiniest table and we saw the other group of five (all white) who arrived after after us get a table double the size! I thought after having a new President that is Black things would change! Ironically this is a Tex Mex place which means it has Latin food too and as a Latina I was not welcomed to a restaurant that serves Latin food! When I go out to a bar.restaurant is to have a good time with my friends and feel like I enjoyed myself,  Adobe Blues made me feel really bad last night!
