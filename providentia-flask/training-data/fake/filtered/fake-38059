The food at this spot is great. When you walk in, you are immediately greeted by the owner or one of the staff. They offer samples of their food to new customers and if you've been there before and want to try something new, they will give you a sample. They are friendly and accommodating. You walk in hungry, but you leave with a full belly and new friends. Check it out! This is definitely a hidden jewel in Hillside!
