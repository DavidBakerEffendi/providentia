This is Jamaican / Island food. Â I'm an Island Girl 100%, and this food was GOOD. I had the jerk chicken and my husband had the escovitch fish (today it was tilapia) and everything was very well prepared, delicious and fresh. They are very new in the neighborhood, just opened last week, and according to the staff (all family) they are still working out the kinks, but the food is already there. Go try it!
