The pizza is good, but the dough tastes a bit too commercial / chainlike for my tasted. Â It is also an expensive pizza, but unlike Michaelangelo's, you won't have leftovers to bring home due to the sparse toppings and thin crust. It is a fine option if you don't want to drive across New Haven to reach Modern or Pepe's, but it can't compete with the New Haven Apizza.
