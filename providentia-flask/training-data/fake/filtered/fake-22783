We stopped in for lunch while visiting Hartford. This place had a great patio for our group of ten. We all enjoyed our cocktails and they had a good assortment of options for everyone. The flatbread that was brought out was a nice start and the kids enjoyed it as well. I ordered the stone pie (a pizza without sauce) and it was very good. Everyone at the table was happy with their choices. I would definitely recommend this place if you are nearby.
