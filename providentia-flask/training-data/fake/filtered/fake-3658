Had Brunch here on a Sunday, and I expected to wait an eternity. Based on all the recommendations from friends, though, I had a feeling it would be worth any wait. Ended up getting a table for two in about 15 minutes, after being told around 45 minutes. The hostess and bartenders were very friendly and welcoming anyway, which only helped a star in case of any following misfortunes. The ambiance made me feel like I just woke up in a big, comfy bed at a five star hotel after a deep, much needed sleep. Very cozy. I'm not a bloody mary fan whatsoever, but they looked awesome here. Food came out super quick, wasn't overpriced, and was incredible. I'm a sucker for CB Hash, so I went with the short rib hash. Possibly the best breakfast I've had. ever. My girlfriend had the scramble with lox, green onion which was awesome as well. Will be back for sure until I try the entire brunch menu, and then I'll be back again.
