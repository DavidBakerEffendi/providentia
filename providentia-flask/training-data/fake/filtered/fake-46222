$15 a bowl of ramen. The soup is delicious, but there are only two measly thin pieces of meat for toppings unless you pay for more. The noodles are scrumptious and you can get extra refills of them. You probably can only have two extra servings of noodles though because they require you to have enough soup to hold the noodles. The way they seat people is very inefficient. We waited for 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours. We had a party of three and that took forever to seat because they wouldn't let you sit at a four-seater table if you had three people. You had to wait until exactly only three seats were available, which took FOREVER. Also, the hostess was giving special seating treatment to some of her friends that came in to eat there.
