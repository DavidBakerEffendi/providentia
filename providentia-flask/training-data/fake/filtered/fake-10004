Dee lish, plus outstanding service! There is a pleasant living-room style waiting area where the hostess takes your name, and if there's a long wait you can play Uno or read the paper, both of which are provided. We were seated within 5 minutes, and for our first trip here, my friend and I decided to share the signature stuffed French toast and the barking chihuahua breakfast burrito. The mammoth stuffed challah was amazing- we had to bring some home, even though we were tempted to keep stuffing in the bananas and cream! The marinara on the side of the burrito was such a delicious surprise, and everything stayed together in the tight burrito- you could taste each of the fresh ingredients. The kitchen delivered everything already split  onto two plates each for us, which was a very nice bonus!  We had the best of both worlds- savory and sweet, along with hot steaming coffee. The staff were so friendly and helpful- they showed us where to find the bathroom, refilled our water and coffee, and brought extra napkins without being asked. The owner heard it was our first time there and stopped by to say hello and inquire about our meals! It was a gorgeous fall Saturday; the Italian market was in full swing and the restaurant was pleasantly bustling. Next time we will bring a bottle of champagne and order a carafe of orange juice to be extra festive. The prices were so reasonable; I can't wait to go back and try two more dishes!
