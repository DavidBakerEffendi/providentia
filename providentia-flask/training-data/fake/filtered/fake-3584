Good, pricey food with papercuts!!  The food was good - really satisfying - fried chicken and waffles was great. Burger was delicious. Pecan sundae, delish. Ambiance great. They accomodate the early kid crowd really well. Two things left me kind of feeling like 'eh, it was good but...' And those two things were 1. price - through down way too much for what we got - it's great to get sold food, but man, so pricey. $18 for fried chicken is hard to swallow (but went down great). But I guess that can be written off to living in this area, an area where burritos are about $9...so what can you do. My second negative is kind of side note - but the paper that they cover the table top is  a serious paper cut causer! I got one and this morning (day after) we noticed our 7 month old had a paper cut on her hand. This is an easy fix...question is...will they?
