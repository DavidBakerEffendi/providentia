The waitress was one of the worse that we have ever had! I asked for a cup of hot water for tea and she never brought sugar or a spoon or cream or lemon. Thank god for the bus boy! Then the meal came and the fries were cold, we complained and it was like she cooked them herself. She brought us hot fries but did not apologize, nor did she ask if we wanted another beer, or drink or if we wanted a dessert. But when we left the check she did run over to see if we left a tip. She did not deserve one. Was she talking too much! Don't know, but the people at the next table were complaining too. Where was she? She was never around! Think twice.
