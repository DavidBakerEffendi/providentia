I am so flabbergasted by my meal that the only way I will feel better is to either throw up or to write and dissuade others from ordering brunch at Tartine. My husband and I should have fled when they presented us orange juice before menus, effectively locking us into their Tuesday afternoon brunch (apparently lunch doesn't start until Wednesday). But the place was sunny and picturesque, so despite our better judgment and the diner next to us leaning over to confide that he was disappointed, we decided to try it. Besides, I'd already sipped my orange juice. The grilled salmon sandwich that was recommended to me arrived-smelling fishy and cold-on stale, chalky bread. My husband's French toast was perplexing in its distaste: hardened triangles with sludgy centers. There was runny, cheesy Hollandaise everywhere on both plates. We only ate a few bites of each dish, but that was enough to ruin our appetites and our afternoons; hours later it's still sitting ominously in my stomach. The best part of the meal was the walk home-or maybe that tricky orange juice. We were so duped!
