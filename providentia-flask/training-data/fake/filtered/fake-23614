We ate here after hearing good reviews from friends. After waiting an hour and a half, the food was just mediocre, the tables were uncomfortable an crammed together.  You sit on low bar stools with no back to them so not the most comfortable chairs.  The staff was young, rude, and arrogant.   The dirty martinis were pink with kalamata olive juice...while a good thought in theory they were disgusting and we felt sick after drinking a few sips of them.  The waitress didn't warn us about the unique flavor and when I went to ask to speak to a manager, the host dressed in a T shirt and sneakers (who was no more than 20 years old) claimed to be the one in charge.  He was joined by a waiter who argued with me and said the martinis made them famous on TV....not the attitude I was hoping to receive.  I wasn't looking for money back, just warning him that the servers should explain that the drink is not what you expect.
