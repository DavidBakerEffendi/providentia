My husband took me here because he always passes it on his was to work & wanted to try it out. It's a 15 minute drive from where we live. Anyway, we walked in & the host sounded robotic & seem like he didn't want to be there. We knew everything would go down hill after that lovely greeting. The interior look dated,& the bathroom was ok. The waitress had a similar personality as the host.  Whatever happened to service with a smile? She DIDN'T know  what sides came with what on the menu (heck, she didn't know what was on the menu period), the side of veggies you only had 2 choices (green beans & corn (which aren't vegetables technically)), & the food have NO flavor whatsoever (even if u add salt & pepper to it). If I wanted ding-ding food, I would've stayed home!
