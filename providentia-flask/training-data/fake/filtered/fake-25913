The food was ok (took forever to come out) and our waitress was good. However, at one point, it was taking forever for her to bring our drinks. I looked around and noticed our waitress waiting at the end of the bar for our drinks while the guy and girl bartender were in their own little world, paying no attention to the waitress waiting. This went on for awhile. She finally got our drinks and when she brought them over, I joked about her lighting a fire under the bartenders, to which she replied, "I wish I could, but they're the managers." Â LOL! I would have given four stars, but unfortunately the "managers" kept me from doing so.
