Holy cow. Breakfast that hits the spot for $3 a pop. An atmosphere that brings you back to the 40's. Located right in the middle of bustling New Haven. What a way to start your day! The breakfast here is incredible. The portions are HUGE and the prices are tiny. I had two eggs, home fries, and toast for just $3, and that was enough to fill me. If you've got a bigger belly (or someone to share a meal with), you could also try the omelets or pancakes that they make. Those looked excellent as well. And the atmosphere really makes this place awesome. Just take a peek inside and you'll get a little '40s nostalgia. It's just awesome. I haven't been to a place like this in too long. Overall, this is definitely an awesome breakfast spot if you happen to be in the New Haven area.
