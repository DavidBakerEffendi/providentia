As Far as Thai food goes this is the best I've had in the city so far. The price is perfect, although it can get really crowded its always well worth the wait when you get seated. Try the Pad thai or the spicy noodles and can you believe its under Ten bucks. Joya is always at the top of my list to bring friends when they visit.
