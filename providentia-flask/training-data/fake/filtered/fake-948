I love Ibiza! I have been going since they opened and I never been disappointed. Every dish I have tried I've liked even if it didn't sound like something that I would. The chefs here really know what they're doing. The drinks are very good and they do have a large selection of wine as well. Some of my favorites dishes are the grilled pork loin over toast, the braised short ribs are the best and I always have to get the potato and onion omelet. Surprisingly good was the anchovies on toast. I ordered it once and it was good...if you like anchovies. :) I would definitely recommend visiting this place. It's definitely good to have a small group to share the appetizers...also gives you an excuse to order and try more!
