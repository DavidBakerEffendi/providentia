The food is decent.  The staff are rude, particularly the female waitress (who thinks she owns the place). Called in an order today with the female.  When I arrived home, I realized the order was wrong.  Called to complain and spoke to another staff.  The female called my home phone back and argued with me about the order.  When I told her about the importance of good customer service in a business,she told me she did not care and to not come back.  The owner NEEDS to ---as stated in other reviews-- FIRE the staff.
