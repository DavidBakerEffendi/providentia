This week was very intense for us, our only few minutes and comfort was hanging out a bit on their pizza and beer... we are new fans of this pizza joint, and they will be on our to go menu for sure on regular bases. I notice especially that it seems very fresh not like in some other places which is all good but you see that it is more of a pre-rep kina made few hours ago. If you're in this area give it a try and enjoy.
