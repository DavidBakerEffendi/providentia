The food here is * amazing* especially for the price. I especially enjoyed that I ordered a lamb burger medium rare and it actually came to the table medium rare.  So many places mess that up these days.  The suace on the lamb burger was also quite good.  I found myself wishing I had more of it to put on something!  The fries that come with the sandwiches are excellently cooked and plentiful. I came with a few friends and tried their food as well, and all of the food was just as good.  The only slight miss for me was the Mango Gazpacho.  It was OK, but I could have done with a little more mango flavor and/or a little less of the herb that was in it. Overall, though, I've been travelling around the country for a couple of months now, eating amazing food wherever I can find it....and this place offers the best food I've had so far.  They're new, and I hope they find the success they so richly deserve!
