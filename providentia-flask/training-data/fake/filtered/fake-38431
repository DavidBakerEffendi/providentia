Good place to break a long drive with a pretty broad selection of foods.  Headed to the CheeseBoy because a bowl of chili is my favorite travel food (doesn't involve bread, has protein an veggies -- really, what more could you want?).  Alas, this CheeseBoy has removed chili from its menu -- so this is my plea: plea-se restore it to the menu! Kudos however to a good-humored and friendly staff (on duty Monday, Aug 11 at 2pm).  That greatly helped cushion my disappointment.
