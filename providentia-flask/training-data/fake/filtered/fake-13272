Funny name but serious Thai cuisine.  I was there for dinner last night with some friends.  I had tom yum goong (sp?) which i ALWAYS have at thai restaurants so that I can compare t all the different thai restaurants on the basis of this one soup.  Not the most scientific system but it works for me.  Theirs was pretty good which for me, says a lot.  Nice kick to it, perfectly lemony, nice meaty shrimp. We ordered pad thai (of course) green curry veggies with tofu and the snapper fillet- so amazingly good!  I don't like to go on and on so I'll just say thai obriens: funny name but really good thai food, serene atmosphere, super sweet staff- they treat you like family.  Plus I discovered  at the last minute, a sports bar in a whole other room WITH nintendo wii for those of us who were to cheap to buy our own at home.  I didn't have time to hang out at the bar so I can't comment on the scene.  Seemed like a chill neighborhood vibe.  Food was awesome tho.  I hope they stick around.  We need some decent thai food around here.
