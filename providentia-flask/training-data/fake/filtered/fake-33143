What a great local eatery.  I love the casual elegant vibe.  It can get a bit crowded (depending on day/time) but it never feels uncomfortable.  The wait staff are lovely and the food selections are endless. I particularly love that they can accommodate different dietary restrictions.  My sister is gluten-free and my boyfriend is vegan.  I'm neither, but I we can all eat there, together, and eat well.   Try their Asian-Marinated tofu, the garlic mashed sweet potatoes, and any of their desserts... YUM!
