Simply the best! We are world travelers and have been here 3 times in the past week. Great views, great food, potent drinks but the people who work here are what makes this place a stand out. What are you waiting for? If you want an amazing view of the east river and the empire state building and amazing food eat here!!!!! Ellen Howse
