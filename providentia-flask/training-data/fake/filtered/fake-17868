I went in on a Saturday night which was probably a mistake to begin with. The service itself was sub-par. Many of the workers were just standing there. The restaurant is small to begin with so they started spilling over to where the customers eat. I would say that the overall attitude was unprofessional. Someone made a mistake and next thing you know, they were yelling at each other...in front of customers!! Most of the problems stemmed from orders being all over the place. Â I could hear some of the dine-in customers complaining about the service. The people on line became agitated because of the wait...honestly, I felt like I was on some hidden Food Network show. So after about a good 30-40 minute wait for our food, the owner, I presume, introduced himself to us and handed our food. I've had better Mediterranean food in New Brunswick. I ordered mixed shawarma sandwich and was disappointed that it was overcooked and dry. Here's my two cents on what can be improved: -Add another cash register, one for dine-in and one for take-out/phone orders -Less staff members who can do more (less is better!) -When there is some discrepancy going on, DON'T YELL AT EACH OTHER. -Have a systematic way of billing. Table 5 requested their check and didn't receive for another 20 minutes. -knowledgeable people working the cash register because whoever worked Saturday did not have a clue (I understand if she was training). Maybe I'll come back once the quality of service picks up.
