This place was fantastic! I had the chicken V-something. (unfortunately Spanish is not my strong point) It was stuffed with cheese and prepared with mushrooms and zuccini in a delicious dark sauce. The mushrooms were especially delicious and incredibly moist. The atmosphere was intimate, if a little crowded (I almost felt like I was on top of my dinner companions), with soft, dim lighting. I also had the coco mojito which was amazing! Everyone agreed it was the best drink at the table. The service was quick and the waiter was nice and hospitable. Would definately recommend this place!
