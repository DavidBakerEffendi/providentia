5 stars: heck yes - you get it, brunch at The Smith! Everything about this place is spot on. Good location, trendy crowd, everyone is obviously hungover and seeking help via food. The wait can be KIND OF really long. I highly recommend at least calling ahead (because it's so difficult to do so via iphones) and making a reservation. It will decrease your wait about 15 mins. The food is amazing. Honestly, here I've only ever gotten the classic eggs benedict. And I wouldn't want it any other way. It's so perfect and every other time I have the dish - it does not compare to the smith : / Sooo besides the fact that they have NEVER actually had strawberry mimosas when I've been there, the extremely high noise level and the confusing bathrooms in the basement (beware, they are gender neutral), you will absolutely love the smith!
