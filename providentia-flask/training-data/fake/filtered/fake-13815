I was dragged to come here with my boyfriend and his friends recently, and I honestly enjoy light beers so I wasn't too bummed when I walked in. Stating the obvious when I say they have a crazy selection, but the bar itself isn't really a place I would ever bring my girlfriends. First of all, I had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to even tell me what to do when I pick out a beer from the fridge. Seems a little unorganized since I drank my first beer out of the bottle, and then once I opened my second beer someone came and grabbed it out of my hand. How the hell was I supposed to know you can't drink from the bottle? When a cocktail waitress pointed out the owner I would have never guessed it was the owner, but realized it made sense why the place was so unorganized (in my opinion). He was enjoying beer after beer, and it was actually comical to my boyfriend and his friends saying that we could probably get free beers out of him if we told him the bar was great. Once I went over to him, thinking he would be super friendly being the owner, I could barely understand the words that came out of his mouth. There wasn't many people in the bar so maybe he got drunk on a slow night, but we were all very weirded out by the whole situation and how the bar was ran, especially since we are in the business as well. I don't think I would recommend this place other than for take out.
