I work nearby and like to visit new restaurants and lunch spots in the area. I met my girlfriend here after work yesterday and we enjoyed making ourselves pretty much what was a buffet of appetizers and salads, they were all very good. She really enjoyed the cocktails and I enjoyed a few beers from Italy, Greece and an American IPA I hadn't heard of before. With very good food, friendly and quick service and a comfortable ambiance, I have no problem recommending this restaurant to anyone for pretty much any occasion.
