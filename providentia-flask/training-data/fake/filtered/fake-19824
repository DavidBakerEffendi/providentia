Guru Palace is one of the best tasting cuisine in New Jersey. I have the best experience with the people serving the owner and more all the delicious food, which is not available anywhere in new jersey. It is a friendly atmosphere. My friend had her husband 50th birthday party and it was the best we ever had. Try it and it will never be a regret. that is my personal experience.
