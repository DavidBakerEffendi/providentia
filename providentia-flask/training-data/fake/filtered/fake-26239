What a cute little enclave in Bushwick! I had such a wonderful time there and the sushi was absolutely delicious. We got the Party Bomb Platter; I've never had anything like it! Soooooo goood. The sushi bombs are presented differently than the rolls; They're shaped like half circles and the fish on top. The presentation here is top notch. Please also try the steak!; it melts in your mouth. It's a little expensive but worth it. The seating is wooden benches and the lighting is 'different', not dark but it has sort of a red/yellow color. Young adults having good conversations, what you'd expect in Bushwick.
