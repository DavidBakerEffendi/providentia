Absolutely the best Lobster roll I have ever had. I lived in the North East and New England for several years and I never thought that the best lobster roll would come from a restaurant in Philly. The prices are reasonable and the food was spectacular. When I went I also had the crab soup, which was one of the best seafood soups I've consumed. So all around great!
