The food at The Bluebird Tavern is fresh, well-prepared and delicious.  I understand that some reviewers are put off by the rather slow service, but this is not uncommon in such establishments and did not bother me.  But when I was charged $22.00 for two vodka-tonics - more than the cost of the meal itself - I was incensed.  This is nothing more than gouging, and I felt ripped off.  You can get away with this in NY or LA, but this is Burlington, VT, for God's sake.  Needless to say, I won't return.  It's not worth it, and I don't happen to like being fleeced.
