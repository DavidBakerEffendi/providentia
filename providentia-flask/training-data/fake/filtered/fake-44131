Recently my husband and I, along with another couple visited Fogo de Chao for dinner. When I pay $70+ per person, I expect to have a pleasant and relaxing experience. This restaurant did not deliver. The meat and the salad bar were delicious. However, there is more to a restaurant than the food. The place is huge, very loud, and very busy although only half the tables were full. It felt more like an airport cafeteria than a nice restaurant despite the white table cloths. There was no ambiance, no mood. The music was so low that was not audible. The waiters are constantly rushing all over the place and they do not look at the color of the circle, but offer meat even if you have turned yours to the red. We felt very rushed. Because you do not have one but many waiters and they do not communicate well among themselves; you have to repeat yourself and you are constantly interrupted. My friend was asked 5 times in less than 5 minutes if he wants another drink. The fillet minion came once and then never again for an hour until I specifically asked for it. The moment we said that we would like the check, the table was cleared from everything - food, water, drinks in less than 1 min. I have never before seen anything like that. My perception was that their objective was to get us out of there as fast as possible although there were many free tables and no people waiting to be seated. If all you want is to stuff yourself with meat (and cheese and other delicious foods) then you may like this place, but if for the price you expect to have a pleasant experience, then definitely not. Â Oh, and the valet was very slow - that was the only relaxed part of the restaurant.
