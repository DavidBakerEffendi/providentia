Pros - Food is good. I ordered the chicken pai thai and my friend order the beef pad see you. It was super delicious. It is very cheap as well. The waiteress is nice and gave us water refill. The environment feels pretty chilling. Con - Waiting for over an hour to be seated. The host was an a--hole because I asked him like only 2 times like every 30 mins how much longer do we need to wait. In the beginning, he said only 30 mins when we came in so we waited then time passed and he gave US an attitude for asking a general question. He was like you ALREADY asked Â 10 times...I was like @__@ this is my 2nd time and what's up with the attitude. I believe in customer service so if I'M THE CUSTOMER I should have the right to ask a question and HOPE for a proper attitude. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closing at 11pm and we were seated at 10:15pm. That gives us only half an hour to eat. Very disappointed!!! Overall, I wish the customer service was equally as good as the food.
