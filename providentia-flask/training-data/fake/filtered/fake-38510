So we have been anticipating a trip to A. Kitchen as we were looking to enjoy Bryan Sikora's food once again.  We were wholly disappointed that while his name is still listed on the website, he apparently hasn't been employed there for 2 months.  Sadly, the food did show the lack of his direction, it was one dimensional at best, no depth.  The Mushroom tart was much too peppery.  We also found the restaurant much too loud with too many hard surfaces.  When I asked for another glass of the same wine I already had, by name, I was given the wrong wine, twice.
