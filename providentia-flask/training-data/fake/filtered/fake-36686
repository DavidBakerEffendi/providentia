My husband and I have been going here for about 3 years. The food is good--burgers of the week are a little crazy sometimes (We got the Ellios burger one time, it was eh.) but the brunch menu is my favorite! The adult shakes are super yummy but I have to agree that the food quality has decreased since they have said they will be franchising. The service is OK--nothing spectacular. The server will come to your table about twice--to take your order and then take your money. Good luck trying to get their attention any other time. I'll be back soon and will hope they start taking these reviews seriously!
