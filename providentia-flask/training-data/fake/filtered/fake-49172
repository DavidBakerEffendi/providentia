Let me start off by saying I do enjoy the food here. It's amazing and always cooked to perfection. My wife and I come in quite often because this is her favorite place. We have never had a problem until last weekend. We had the worst service of our life's. Our server said his name was jay. He was un-attentive, rude, and very slow. We asked him how he felt about a certain dish and he said he had no idea what it tastes like in a very pushy way. How do you work at a restaurant and not know the food, isn't that the basics of being a server? To top it off as we left we saw him at the host stand, and my wife over heard him talking to another server, bad mouthing the restaurant. As I stated we love this place and the food. The service is usually very good but this time it completely turned us off. We will be back of course but we hope this server problem is fixed by then, if not we will not hesitate to request a different server.
