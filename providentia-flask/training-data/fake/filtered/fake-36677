I'm a business traveler who comes to Philly every other month.  My team and I have dined at this place several times (at least four) in the past year, solely because of its location relative to where we work and stay. The staff has never been friendly to us, as a group of black males, requesting to be seated.  Not hostile, just not friendly either.  The food has been average at best and not edible at its worst. The service has never been anything above average, but then it's never been below average. After seeing a customer full credit card receipt posted for the world see and reading the comments by the owner I can say that I will never set foot in the place again and it has been added to the non-reimbursable list for the use of company charge cards so doubt that anyone from my company will either. The management of this company has shown a complete disregard for their customer's privacy and payment information.  I have advised VISA International of this violations of their merchant agreement. Best of luck in the future, you'll need it to stay in business.
