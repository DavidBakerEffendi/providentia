last trip to NY, took some rookies with me...  what was one of the things they wanted to do?  instead of club / bar / lounge hopping, they wanted to do pizza hopping...  officially, I'm pizza'ed out until at least, 2011, I'm not even kidding with you...   knowing full well how ridiculous the lines were going to be at grimaldi's, on the way over, I called and placed a to-go order...  yes, i'm that incredibly intelligent, or I'm that incredibly obsessed with food i know how to plan ahead...  once we arrived, sure enough, even though it had started to rain, there was an insane line outside...  secretly, deep down inside, grimaldi's has never been my favorite pizza spot, but i didn't want to ruin it for the others who have never tried it...  don't get me wrong, their pies are amazing, easily in my top 3 favorite, not just in NY but the continental united states of America...  (okay fine, and Canada as well)   ingredients still fresh, dough cooked to perfection, I can see how it would be peoples #1 favorite pizza in NY, it's just not mine...  there's just something missing, can't quite put my finger on it, it's just a smidge off of my personal favorite...  again, please, don't get me wrong, I inhaled the slices like the world was coming to an end, their pizza is amazing, and you owe it to yourselves to give it a shot, it's just not my favorite pizza is all I'm saying...   so while we were outside devouring the pizza, every single person in the group all agreed that it was the second best pizza they had in NY, and not one of them could articulate exactly what made the other place slightly better, albeit, not by very much...   this review isn't quite fair to grimaldi's though, because i do want people to try their pizza because as they say, different stroke for different folks...  maybe this will be your favorite pie...
