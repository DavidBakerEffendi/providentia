I'd say it's worth waiting in line with the tourists for! Be sure to bring cash & certainly come ravenously hungry. Even if there's only two or three of you, get the large size pizza because there's something superior in texture about it (I can't really explain it). I suggest getting the meatball, ricotta, & spinach pizza. They will let you do half & half combos if you want to try another kind, too. Also, don't eat it like a sissy. Go in for it, fold it, be messy, lick your fingers. Â They have a wonderful house salad as well!
