I have recently had a bad business experience with Oaxaca Kitchen.  I ran an alternative night for them last month that went well- I thought the bar did a nice job with offering deals, etc although the service was slow, everyone had a great time.  This month was much different.  We had our party booked over a month before with confirmation and the manager told me 30 mins before my party that he booked another party.  When I asked him how that would affect us, he said it would not.  So we came in (around 40 people) and ate dinner and were spending money at his bar.  Then when he knew the other party was coming in, he just cut everyone off without telling me and told 40 + people to leave his bar (we were supposed to stay until close).  Instead he stopped our party two and a half hours early and told us we were done.  We had to find another place to go.  To top it off, the four out of seven meals came out wrong, the bartender was horrible (made drinks incorrect and severly slow), and we all felt very disrespected.
