This afternoon arriving from work, I found a pamphlet from this, new for me, Japanese restaurant. I tried a simple delivery order to see how it could be. First, the well mannered delivery person spent more than 45 mins. to arrived with the order. The food was cold, and I have to use the microwave to "warm up" my dinner. Second, my order was a vegetable dumplings (6) that were fare, but those were very minimalist. With this I have a teriyaki chicken that came with (miso soup in a little container very short), plus I asked for brown rice (I pay an extra dollar) that it came with the order, it was honestly short, Â so short than not even a third of the little cup was full! The chicken (10 little slices) on top of Asian veggies, little bigger than the size of ten cigarettes, was tasty but rubbery. And third, I have to cook French fries, and prepared a "real salad", to get a real dinner. These two orders, "dumplings" and "chicken teriyaki" cost me $20.15, I did the math and they charged 12% of taxes under that total. I considered for this amount of money, the food was very scarce. Conclusion, For the $20+dollars, in other Asian restaurants I have more food, hot (in temperature) faster and abundant, with a similar order. And this was my first and last experience, with this business, sorry! P.S. And, I apologize for my "accent"!
