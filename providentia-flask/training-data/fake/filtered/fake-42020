There are tons of pizza places in the passiac valley area. When I moved here almost 3 years ago I began trying the pizza places and in the area and stopped when I found Sopranos. It is personally my favorite. Not too thin, not too cheesy. I like the Grama's Pizza which is one size, rectangle and cut square. It reminds me of pizza from my home state of Rhode Island. The bruchetta appitizer is also very good. All CC's accepted here, and the staff is friendly. I have found the delivery a bit slow on occasion, but never any problems.
