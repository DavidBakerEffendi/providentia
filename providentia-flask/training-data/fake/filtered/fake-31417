Was ordered pizza with several toppings, arrived with toppings only on half of it. Call to pizzeria, handed phone to delivery guy to confirm faulty pizza pie. Rude manager told that pie was good when he packed it, and I have an option to pay full price or stay hungry. I'm not going to be back there after such experience.
