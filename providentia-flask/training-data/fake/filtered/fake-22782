I was pretty good food. I figured it would have been better for the price and the hype. I guess ut just seemed that they tried too hard to be "out there." Like, I wanted creme brulee as my dessert, but they didn't have vanilla like a regular place, it was corn chex flavored or something. I just thought that was weird. Still good food just... different.
