My friend and I stumbled upon this place while strolling the neighborhood and decided to try it out. The quiche and salad lunch was delicious and exactly what we were looking for. The service was very friendly and helpful. The dining room had a nice atmosphere. I only wish they had fountain drinks instead of cans... I will definitely return!
