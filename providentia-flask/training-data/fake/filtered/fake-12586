I've never been asked to leave a table before -- in many years of dining out.  After 2 hours, our server asked us to leave, to make room for another reservation.  We had not even ordered dessert.  The service had been slow, so we were not lingering obsessively.  The food was excellent, but ruined by the rudeness of being asked to vacate our table.
