I was craving for some Cuban food so one of my friends suggested me this restaurant. I drove 20 miles to this place and it was totally worth it. The interior d√©cor is great and the food is just amazing. I got Vaca Frita and it was done so nicely. The sauce was simply the best. I am planning to go there more often. Now you know the next time you want to try some Cuban food where to go !!!!!
