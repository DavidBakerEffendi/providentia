Harissa falafel on whole wheat = delectable. I could actually eat Taim every single night if possible but I don't want to risk getting sick of it. Their food is not only delicious, but also good for you and cheap! And, the staff is quick and efficient, making it the perfect place to grab something on the go. Only two downsides are that they don't take credit cards and the space is teeny tiny so there is always someone running into you.
