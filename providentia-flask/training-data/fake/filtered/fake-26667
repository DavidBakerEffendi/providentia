Dough is simplyAWESOME!!!  I have eaten at Dough three times for lunch and once for dinner and I can't stop raving about this place.  The service is great!  The waitstaff are pleasant, helpful and enthusiastic about the restaurant and the food.  I consider myself a pizza connoisseur and this pizza is AWESOME! Most certainly a top 10 in my opinion.  The ingredients are high quality and fresh. I also place great value on the farm to table approach.  But what is most notable about the pizza (my favorite is the margharita), is that it is really light, the crust is "airy" and after eating it I don't feel full, heavy or like a glutton.  Imagine eating an individual pizza pie but feeling like you had a small piece of salmon and steamed vegetables.  That has been my experience each time.  Dough has a large table up front that is somewhat separate, which accomodates a large party and gives a bit of privacy.  They also have a separate room that could be used for a private event and a cozy outdoor patio.  I highly recommend this restaurant!!  Check it out!!
