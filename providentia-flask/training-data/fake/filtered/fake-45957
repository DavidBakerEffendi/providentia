My husband and I USED to LOVE Tops Diner for their delicious food but they are LIARS and have horrible service!  Our business is in Newark, we order from them about once a week or so.  I always rave about them to everyone in Newark.  And I am so mad at them right now.... This literally all happened within the past hour.... I called, placed an order for 2 goat cheese spinach salad (my husband's favorite, he always orders this and usually he makes the call orders, I decided to get the same), 1 with candied walnuts, 1 without and dressing on the side.  I called back and requested grilled chicken to be added on both.  Few mins. later, my husband picked up the order and when he arrived to our place of business, we realized both salads have bacon.  We don't/can't eat bacon.  I admit it was my fault because I didn't read their menu, I just called and asked for the salad because he always orders that salad, so I never knew that they usually put bacon on it.  So I called, was transferred to a woman.  I explained I didn't realize the order comes with bacon and we can't eat bacon.  She said it's fine, just bring both salads and we'll make another 2 for you without bacon.  I told her it would take some time before my husband can come back, but the salads are untouched, she said take your time.  About 20-30 mins. pass and my husband returns with with the 2 salads.... and she won't DO AS SHE SAID and give him 2 new salads without cost OR take the salads and give him his money back because I admitted it was my fault..... SORRY FOR BEING HONEST lady!!!!  And THANK YOU FOR BEING A LIAR AND TAKING BACK WHAT YOU SAID!!!!!! YOU CAN'T PROMISE A CUSTOMER SOMETHING AND THEN GO BACK ON YOUR WORD.... YOU ARE SO CHEAP!!  I WILL NEVER EVER ORDER FROM YOU GUYS EVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!
