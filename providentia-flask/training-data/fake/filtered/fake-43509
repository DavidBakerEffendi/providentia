I am very happy with the food in this restraurant and the service has been great. the owner has taken time to greet everyone and ask about the food. I go there about 5 to 6 days and family and friends has gone and love it .There pork, steak and fish is all good Â and they give you a nice size Flan. In all if you like cuban food this is the place to go..
