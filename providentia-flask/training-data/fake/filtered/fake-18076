I have frequented this restaurant for several years, while working in the area.   Having visited many Italian restaurants in North, Central and South Jersey, this one is my favorite by far. The food is always delicious and it consistently has the best service of any restaurant of any kind that I have visited.  A great spot for a business lunch but it is so good that my wife and I don't hesitate to drive an hour to go there for dinner.  The prices can't be beat and they even offer half price bottles of wine.  Unequivocally the best overall value around.
