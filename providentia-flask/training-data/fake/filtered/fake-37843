I had been hearing a lot of good things about this restaurant and wanting to try it for a while.  I finally got there the other day with my wife.  We had a reservation for a sunday night (wasnt necessary).  The hostess\Server was not only not friendly but outright rude.  I noticed she was this way with the other 2 or 3 tables as well.  I found the decor dark and depressing.  This set the tone for the evening.  I had the shrimp appetizer and my wife had the seafood dumplings.  I found my shrimp sitting in a pool of vanilla sauce which was so overpowering it made the dish virtually unedible.  My wife's seafood dumplings were covered in a foam (Wow, how creative this guy must be a good chef) it was mediocre at best, and the flavors really didnt work that well together.  For entrees I had the Hanger steak and my wife had the Chicken breast.  I know they are more known for seafood here but to be honest nothing on the menu really jumped out at us as something we wanted so we settled on those two.  The menu was definitely uninspiring.  The entrees were decent and definitely better than the appetizers.  The steak and chicken were both cooked well.  Overall though in that price range there are a million other restaurants out there with much better food and a much friendlier staff.  Dont bother going here as it's mediocre food at best with a snobby staff and dreary decor.  Tip for the chef, Skip the foams and worry about the flavor.
