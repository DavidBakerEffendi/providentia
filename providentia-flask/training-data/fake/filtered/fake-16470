Went w/another couple Friday night and enjoyed it all - especially our waitress Maja.  What a sweet charmer she is, providing great service, laughter and relaxation.  With only an early reservation available, we were able to enjoy a very leisurely dinner and ended up staying for an extra glass of wine. Wellfleet Oysters were terrific, salads great, the fish and chips only so-so.  Great place - if you get Maja as a sever, it will add to the enjoyment.
