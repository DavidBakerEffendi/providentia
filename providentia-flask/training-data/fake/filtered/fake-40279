What can I say that hasn't already been written? It takes time to forget how long I have to wait for these delicious pies but the first bite answers why I do it again. Let me also add a mea culpa to the person who walked out to feed the meter while I grabbed his pie. In my defense I was really hungry. I ran to my car and polished the pie off in a matter of minutes with a friend. Please tell me where I can find the asbestos gloves, which look so lifelike, that Dom uses!
