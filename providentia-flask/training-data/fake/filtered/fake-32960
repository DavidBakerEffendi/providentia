My hubby and I were scouring Newark in 2011, looking for a good, but different place to hang out on a Thursday, and ran across a wine bar off Ferry Street in the Ironbound section of Newark. Ironbound is opulent in Spanish, Portuguese, Brazilian, and Peruvian commercial spaces offering a historical footprint of the Latin immigrants. Mompou has open, brick decor and the crowded place drew us in. There were trendy yuppies and buppies fresh out of work enjoying good eats and a great drink. The Pinto Noir was to die for, and the tapas were very good, and satisfying. And the other thing that made me jump for joy was the acoustic guitar player who sang everything from John Mayer to Lauryn Hill. She was cool and had a nice voice. Speed up six months later, we go again and I get slight food poisoning. I barfed all night after our little date. Bummer. I couldn't touch Mompou for almost 2 years. I went back about 2 months ago and its all good. At first, I just ordered dessert, but it was decadent. Since, I've gone back twice and ordered some great tapas. I suggest and visit and not to take out. When they are busy its difficult.
