Wow! Just had another fantastic meal at Kanella!!! While normally I stick to my fish filet of the day that I swear by (most recently its been a fantastic skate), I just tried the stuffed calamari that the waiter highly recommended. Oh he was so right: succulent and tender, filled with feta, pine nuts, rice, peperonata, and more....was simply divine. As always service was great, and the chef even came by to check on how things were, so lovely and hospitable! This is such a warm and pleasant restaurant, can't wait for my next visit!
