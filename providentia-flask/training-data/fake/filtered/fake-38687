Simply perfect!!! This was my first trip to New York so I did not know what to expect.  I did not want a tourist trap at Time Square but rather a unique type of upscale and laid back atmosphere.  L'Artusi nailed it with this place.  From the background music to the semi open kitchen where I could see the cooks preparing perfection, this place had it all. I cook for lots of people all the time and come from a family of chefs so I know good food and service.  This place was great.  From the time we arrived to the time we left I never had to find anyone to help or "serve" me. We tried at least 4 different entrees, 3 appetizers and two desserts.  I wish I could remember the names of them but I do distinctly remember a fried egg on top of an entree and brussels sprouts for and appetizer.  I don't really care for brussels sprouts however, these were amazing and like nothing I have ever tasted. I will definitely come here as often as I am in New York and look forward to telling everyone I know about this place. Special thanks to Mr. Williams (I think he may be a manager) for food and wine suggestions as well as great presence of mind to feel out what we would like.  Anyone that goes for the first time should be sure to  ask for him.  I can't wait to go back!
