Went there for lunch.  Very nice inside.  Service was good. But the menu redefines "limited", very little selection.  The food was very mediocre.  The turkey sandwich was served cold, instead of warming the meat to bring out the flavors and a host of other things that could have improved the banality of a turkey sandwich,  $13, but I do not mind paying more, if  the food is worth it.  It has to say to me, hey you cannot do better at home. I looked around at other dishes, none looked bad but none looked great either.  This is a farm to table restaurant I believe.  I don't really care how my food gets to the restaurant, only how it tastes.    Bloody Mary was also underwhelming. Overall I was underwhelmed. It has potential, but needs a new chef or something.
