My husband and I couldn't be more overjoyed to find this place on our way up North last weekend. We made a special trip coming back just to stop there, we were also expecting a lot and we were not disappointed! Great, intelligent, upbeat employees serving thoughtfully sourced and prepared truly healthy food. It's an honor!
