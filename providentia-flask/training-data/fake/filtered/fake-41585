The food was great, the service was pretty good, but what won me over was their energy to right a wrong. A cup of red sauce got knocked over next to me and splashed up on my dress. They got me seltzer and a rag, and bought my table another round of drinks immediately. I have had similar experiences in other restaurants and at Fish they took care of me far better then any other place. Yes, the world is clumsy with me. :) I will be back there again soon. They gave me a great 1st impression, and the food was really good.
