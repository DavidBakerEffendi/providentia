Reading the reviews for this place Â simply restores my belief that New Yorkers are the nicest people on this planet. To give this place more than one star is generous beyond belief Got there and I was promptly informed that more than half the menu items were missing in action. Alas the sandwich I ordered should have joined its friends. This tiny sausage sandwich, accompanied with grossly overpriced and bland mac and cheese, was at best disappointing and at its worst anorexic in substance and taste. I highly recommend that everyone should visit Morgans, but under no circumstances enter the premises.
