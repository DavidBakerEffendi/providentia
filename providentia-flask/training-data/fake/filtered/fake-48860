This was our second visit to the Bainbridge Street Barrel House, the first visit we liked it very much, the service was good and the food was excellent. Our second visit however was not even close to the first and has convinced us not to return again even though it is in our neighborhood. This second visit was all around horrible.....we were seated very quickly but then had to wait 20 minutes for a waiter to even approach us, many walked by without the slightest nod our way. When we did have a waiter come over he asked if we had been approached by a server yet. After informing him we had not he reluctantly said "Well I guess I'll take your order", well thanks alot!!! Due to the fact we waited 20 minutes to see a server we were ready to order, we ordered drinks and food to get everything moving.....moving was very slow and it took another 20 minutes to get our drinks (iced tea and a hot tea...really). We sat and sat and sat and sat while many tables that had been seated after us decided to leave due to no service. 25 minutes later after receiving our appetizer we thought it was going to improve...no luck! 15 more minutes until the food arrived after our waiter apologized and said he would have the manager come over. Meals arrived were finished check paid and no manager to be seen or heard of.     Overall the lack of attention by a manager and the very slow service in the dining area will cause us not to return again. With all of the other great restaurants in the city you need to set yourself apart and this set itself apart with it lack of service and poor management.
