"The food was excellent, the atmosphere great. Our server, Glenn was the best we've had in New York. Sebastian kept me in bread and butter all night! Water was always full. We've been here 5 days and this was the best."   Finish your review       Copyright  2012 Yelp Inc., 706 Mission Street, San Francisco, CA 94103, U.S.A.
