Sadly, I would say that the concierge service is really bringing down this place. How can you have a reservation at 7 and s still 7:30 and we were not seated? In the meantime, we were four people waiting and they had four tables seated before us.even we reminded them...couple of times.when we reminded, again the concierge, that four people that came AFTER us were seated befire, she started to argue with me and tell me they are busy and is nothing she can do. I asked to talk to the owner, she told me they are both really busy. This is a repetitive pattern at this restaurant and, even table service is always very good, and food very good, except some pastas, I feel this is a huge downside. Time is very precious for all of us, and to make reservations and constantly wait at leat half hour, topped with rudeness of the concierge, is not the way we want to spend the money for a nice, relaxed dinner.actually, this really ruined our night, and my parents as well, that we were trying to take them out for a nice dinner. Not sure if we will go back.
