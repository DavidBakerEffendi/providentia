We are two vegetarians who had a delightful dinner for two at da Legna. The food was very good, the service friendly and the atmosphere unrushed. i am a big fan of Modern Apizza, but the two places are not the same. In addition to a LOT of pizza choices, there is an extensive selection of salads and an equally large menu of genuinely delicious-sounding small plates. We tried two salads and a Margherita pizza. It was hard to choose the salad and just as hard to let the small plates go, but it had to be done. We couldn't eat everything on the menu after all, so we bravely chose. The salads were delicious! Mine was butter lettuce, shaved fennel, polenta "toast" and caramelized pear goat cheese with citrus vinaigrette (on the side, a I requested.) My husband's was spinach with blackened tofu and a warm maple vinaigrette. The pizza was excellent as well. We'll definitely be coming back here.
