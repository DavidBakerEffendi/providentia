My dad told me about this place, he raved about it as a must-visit when in NYC so much to the point that everytime I called him during the duration of my stay he asked me if I had gone yet. It was a cold Thursday night and this place was to the brim with people. I ate at La Pizza and Pasta and carbo-loaded as if I was getting ready to run a marathon--bad idea. I had no room for anything else but everything else looked so good. I continued to eat, but only with my eyes as I explored the rest of the market place. I didn't even get to try any of the stuff my dad recommended. Eataly has everything you need, broken down in sections so you have your meats, your fish, your cheese, your bread, your vegetables, alcohol, etc. all neatly arranged like sow. But, every section looks a lot like the last [play twilight zone music]--so prepare for the possibility of getting lost, or wear one of those whistle detectors in case your friends lose sight of you and may need to track you down. I can honestly say that my only gripe at the moment was when I unintentionally left my blackberry in a bathroom stall, only to realize that I had left it inside upon exiting the market place. So of course, I try to run back inside through the same exact doors I just exited, only to be rejected by the door-man-security-guy. Seriously, dude? You didn't see the frantic in my face? All I wanted was my phone back and this guy made me literally run around to the main entrance on the other side. Luckily, my phone was ringing as I ran into the powder room. Otherwise, his crotch would have had one serious encounter with my foot! You don't ever get in between a person and their crackberry, never, ever, ever... EVERRRRRRR.
