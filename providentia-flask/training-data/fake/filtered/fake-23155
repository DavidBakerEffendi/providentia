My husband and I took my Mother In Law  to this so called "steakhouse" for her Birthday, and we never had such a horrible steak !   Not only was the the steak like shoe leather, the service was horrible as well, and there weren't many people there . I can think of several other places to go to grab a great steak, such as La Cibeles @ 123 Ridge Rd in Lyndhurst, or The Crows Nest on Rt 17, Steak and Ale in Mahwah.  But never again we spend money for a crappy meal &  crappy service at the  Alexus Steakhouse.
