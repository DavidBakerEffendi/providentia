Was on my way to 77 Warren and stopped here first and never left. Called all my friends and they met me here instead. We got a booth where we could pick the basketball game we wanted to watch, on a TV in our booth! The food was awesome, the drinks great and the waitress Ann was super duper friendly. Really felt at home here. Would recommend to all looking for a great place to hang and watch some games.
