I went here recently to have a drink with my friend after work. I don't think I'll be going back again any time soon. They have a nice wine selection, but I wasn't crazy about the service. The bartender was cute, but rude. Sarcastic and slow don't make a very good combination. Let's just say there are plenty of other place in SOHO to enjoy, why waste your time on something so-so?
