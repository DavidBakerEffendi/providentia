I have lived here for years and yet to get taste any food better that Sonu Da dhaba. It makes me feel like I am in India. The buffet prices are reasonable compared to all the other restaurant. It is always best to ask before eating and not after eating.. This is America not any other country. They will be more than willing to tell u the price of the buffet. And for most restaurant business, weekend starts on Friday to Sunday. And also, public holidays.
