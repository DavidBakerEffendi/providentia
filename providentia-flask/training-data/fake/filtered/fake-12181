I have been three different times. As a vegetarian, it has very appealing options. HOWEVER, the waiters and "chefs" are stuck up to the point of almost being rude...here are specs. 1) today, I ordered the $16 eggplant teriyaki roll. Not only is it is the same size as the other rolls, there was NO eggplant at all--let alone Japanese eggplant in it as the menu says. I pointed this out to my kind waitress, but the "chefs" insisted it was made correctly.  :( :( 2) On my second visit,  I received an spicy eggplant roll instead of a "voompah" (crcunhy eggplant and cream cheese, etc). I pointed this out to the waitress, who told me: "you ordered that AND  voompah"...........I  had not. 3) On my first visit, i had the "very hungry inch worm". Even though all the rolls were cold, I was impressed. The salad is VERY good, and the tokyo fro is pretty good too. However, the chefs added BROCCOLI to a roll instead of BARLEY!!! wtf? 4) The "rice" is not a good idea. I t worksokay for some vegetarian rolls, but it's is NOT sushi rice. It is hard, dry, and too overwhelming. 5) Their picked ginger is SUPERB, but the "soy" sauce is just terrible. It's "light" and ponzu/citrusy. As with the rice, you should have the choice of getting normal, or the "miya's version" 6) On two of the three times I have been there, It was 2+ hours to get in and out. I WOULD go back, but only for the rolls under $10 that  I KNOW that i like. This is because these combos of flavors are unique and very good....WHEN THEY HAVE THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS AND YOU CAN EAT IN LESS THAT 2.5 HOURS!!!!!! ps: I think some of the mix up in ingredients is a language barrier. (The chef's every time i have been are latino. And at another sushi restaurant in New Haven (Samurai),  thrice, a waiter has brought me yam tempura instead of inari...) BUT,  if some is paying $16 for food, it should at least have  the right things in it, yeah??  Moreover, they should take it back and FIX IT!!!!
