Just finished eating at this local gathering. We got there at half hour before dinner. So we had a few drinks ks and apps. The waitress was as cold as this March day Â we ordered guacomle which was De lush. I ordered a cheese burger for dinner. It was good. Well....until I found a hair. Bought waitress over and she acted like it was an everyday occurrence. Wow. Really sister. Are you kidding me. Anyway. Never plan on coming back. Hey mgt... get with the times. Friendly service and good food should not be the thing of the past.
