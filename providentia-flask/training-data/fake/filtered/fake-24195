I dined at this establishment for the first time on Sunday. I went expecting there to be a wait, given church had just let out. So, patiently I waited to be seated and finally I get to order. Unfortunately, our food took over an hour to arrive at our table. Patrons all around us were being served as well as those that had come in after us. I was very frustrated but also very hungry. The food was okay but the salt in my mouth made it taste bitter. When I was leaving and spoke to Vonda, a gentleman at the cash register and the waitress about the situation, Vonda became very defensive and dismissive. I thought a little apology could have gone a long way. This probably is a great Soul food restaurant but unfortunately I will never know, as I will not be returning.
