Flies, black ones and. Small fruit flys on the wall. Stay away if you like coke products, cuz they only have Pepsi.   the iced tea is nasty and has never seen a real tea leaf. Honestly, how much money can possibly be saved  by pissing off a patron with a big swallow of  artificial tea.     The pizza was okay.
