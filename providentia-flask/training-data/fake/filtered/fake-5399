OVERPRICED!! MEDIOCRE food!!! They essentially offer a modified prix fix menu. I have dined at all types of restaurants from Le Bernadine (always ranked no. 1 by Zagats) to simple diners.   Hands down this has been one off my worst experiences because it pained me to pay so much for pedestrian food. There is nothing fine about there food. baby portions (portions are  the size of your palm)and price is astronomical for what is offered.  I could deal with miniature portions for fine cuisine and this is far from fine! It is very pedestrian.   Because it is overpriced doesn't make it good.   Restaurant is actually run down.. Carpets dirty and run down decor. Kitchen looked dirty since you get to walk passed it to use ladies room.    One positive is service was good.   I could've saved $150 for two people and grabbed a slice of pizza and been happier!!
