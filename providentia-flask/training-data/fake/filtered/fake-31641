I normally wouldn't do this...when I find a restaurant this good in my neighborhood, the last thing I want to do is alert the general public, but alas, I want to make sure this place gets the support it deserves and thus I'm letting the cat out of the bag. There is literally nothing to dislike about this establishment.  If you're at all familiar with Il Mulino then you know what to expect. The food is excellent, the service is top notch and the setting is quiet and enjoyable.  The chicken parm will make you take your leftovers to your mama's house and slap her for not being able to make a dish so tasty. And don't get me started on dessert and coffee.  I'll just say, leave room, you won't regret it. So come on LIC, lets get this place on the map where it belongs.
