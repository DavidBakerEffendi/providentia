I don't get to frequent the Great Wazu often, but when I do, I always end up getting the same sandwich - turkey sloppy joe!  It is one of my all time favorites that I can remember from being a kid.  The staff is super friendly and they always recognzie their customers.  There is usally a line, but it moves pretty quickly and convenient to get lunch on the go.
