STICKER SHOCK!!!!!! Three of us came to try the new place down the street for lunch last week.  We had: two Duck Empanadas and two Korean Beef Barbecue Empanadas @ $7.00 each, two Chicken Sausage specials with onions and peppers, described as served on a nice big fresh baked roll, which turned out to be a plain hotdog bun at $12.00 each and a Chicken Panini on soggy multi grain with a tasteless pesto sauce $13.00, three seven ounce drinks in kitchy bottles @ $ 3.00 each for a total of $74.00.  We left shocked, disapointed and hungry!  I told the owner I thought it terrribly expensive for a very average lunch.  I rate this establishment R.P.V.T. (really poor value - tasteless)   By: AJBP (a Jew, Black and Puerto Rican:)
