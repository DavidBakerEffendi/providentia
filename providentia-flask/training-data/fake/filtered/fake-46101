My friend just LOVES this place and I see why.  The sushi is very fresh.  She says the sushi chef goes into the city every morning to get the fresh fish.  The fish is as fresh and melts in your mouth like Tomoe in the city, located on Thompson Street.  Small place but super delicious fish.  Well, this place had the same fish!   Anyway, I like to eat big portions and the portions were tiny.  I had the chirashi instead of my usual Sushi lunch, and it was very good, but too small.  For lunch, it cost $20 which is quite high.  The place is so tiny that there were already a bunch of people waiting for us to leave as soon as we were done.  I would like to go again, just not when I'm starving for lunch.
