Great food, great service, and a great atmosphere.  I recently dined here and had a great experience.  I had the gnocchi con gamberetti and the vitello alla milanese.  You could tell everything was made with the freshest ingredients. Despite being very very busy, our service was prompt and very accommodating.  I recommend making a reservation in advance.  Please support this up and coming restaurant, and make it a staple in the Yardley community!
