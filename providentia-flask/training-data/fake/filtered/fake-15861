A "super sake selection" and a "great happy hour" make this piscatory pair in the Western Addition and South Beach "excellent" "for a big group" looking for a "hip and happening" scene, but the "inventive" menu of sushi (some of it "on the spicy side") also satisfies afishionados; those "on a budget" say it's "a bit overpriced for what you are getting", but most are still lured in by the "delicious fish" and "good" crowd. Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.
