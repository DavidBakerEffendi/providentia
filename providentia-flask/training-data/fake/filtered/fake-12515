Sandwich was delicious, delivery was quick, and I had plenty of food. The only reason it isn't five stars is that the sandwich was not quite as amazing as the menu led me to believe, and some of the pieces of mango in the fruit salad were quite hard. Would definitely order from here again, though! Those small downsides don't take away from how delicious it was.
