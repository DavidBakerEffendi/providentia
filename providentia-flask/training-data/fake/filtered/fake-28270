My husband and I went for lunch there yesterday.  We have been several times in the past but yesterday, during peak hours, the dining room was so loud due to the dishwashers and busboys clearing and washing plates, glasses and silverware that we literally COULD NOT carry on a conversation.  I truly couldn't believe the racket going on.  The staff didn't seem to care one bit, they are always busy and couldn't have cared less if they lost us as customers, which they have.  Yes, the food is good, but how can you enjoy anything when you can't even carry on a conversation?  Won't be returning, that is for sure.
