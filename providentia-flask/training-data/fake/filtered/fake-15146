Went here with some friends. a chicken salad was 15$. and my friend steak dish was a couple dollars more. the portions are not huge though, so this isn't the place you go to pig out like a king. But two people can have a great meal for under 40$ as long as they dont order alcohol. The food was amazing. i tried my friend's dishes and everything tasted unique and different. but most importantly it was fresh. The chicken was juicy, the kale salad was crisp, and the steak was perfectly cooked. I honestly couldn't find a fault with the food. This place doesn't bother with complex fancy foods. they make simple + good tasting foods really well. it doesn't get simpler then steak over greens with some sweet potato fritters, or Chicken and kale salad with cheese and anchovies and dressing. the pleasure is in simple food prepared and cooked really well. The head chief knows what he's doing and it seems the owners are committed to getting fresh ingredients and produce. To me 12$ to 20$ for a freshly cooked delicious meal is worth it.
