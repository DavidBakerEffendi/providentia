Briskett was outstanding, the ribs, only so-so. I love dry rub, but theirs is quite bland. Properly cooked and good cuts of pork with little gristle, though. The staff is lovely, the ambience zero. The place is tiny, and so crammed with tables that had the place been full, you would have literally been elbow to elbow with your fellow diners, and to get out, the table would have to be pulled out to allow egress. It was a little pricey as well. Soon, as people have said, there will be a line here, but I won't be in that number, I can't imagine ever going there to eat again, but would consider them for takeout.
