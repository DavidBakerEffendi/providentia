tonight was my second time there. its quiet on sunday afternoons/evenings (i have not been there anytime else) the crepes are awesome. i like the choice(s) Â of alcohol. but the "do everything" bartender/waitress is freaking awesome !!! ( give her a raise) (and if she's the owner....even better !!! --good for you !) and she has zero attitude. sweetheart personality. gorgeous eyes. not to mention the tats. definately will be going back. 5 stars from me. definately a nice spot to chill out and relax. if your on a date or with friends or even family, well on sunday....
