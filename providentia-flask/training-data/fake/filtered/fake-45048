I dined here with a friend for the soft opening.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  The food was fresh and tasty.  So happy to finally have some authentic Mexican food in the neighborhood. The atmosphere was also very cool.  I felt like I was somewhere between a European and a tropical locale.   The owner seems to be maintaining the same high quality standard as its sister restaurant, Cafe Henri. There are too many overpriced, average looking restaurants with mediocre food, in LIC.  Casa Enrique is a refreshing change.
