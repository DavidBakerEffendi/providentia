Sitar has great service, reasonable prices, and very tasty food. The servers are friendly and personable, and remember you if you go in a couple times. The crispy bread they bring out before appetizers is always great, food comes out very quickly and they offer free refills of rice and a 10% student discount. Â I personally love the saag paneer, the chicken tikka masala, and the lamb korma. It's definitely the best indian in New Haven.
