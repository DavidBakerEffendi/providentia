Upon entering I used the bathroom and saw the cook use the urinal and leave without washing his hands. then I tried to get a table for two and told I could not be seated until my wife was with me. It was 5 pm. the place was empty. Now the place will be less 2 more people. Now don't be mislead I go there 3 times a month so they know me by sight. I will never return. this is not the first time this place has me mad.
