I wanted to like this place, I really did. I read all the reviews and it sounded great, so maybe expectations were high, but I don't think I'll go back. our first issue was not being served immediately, even though there were people who came after we did who gave their orders before we even got menus.  We had to flag a waitress to finally get a menu. But that isn't the reason for the low rating, as you never know what staffing is like on a particular day, and our waitress was lovely once we got her attention.  It was the lackluster food.   I ordered a breakfast burrito, which was almost inedible. It consisted of watery, unseasoned and crumbly scambled eggs with some token veggies in a fairly dry tortilla., and a smattering of cheese somewhere, but very bland. The only seasoning consisted of side sauces, and I have to say there was a chipotle sauce that was delicious and nicely spicy, but they should have integrated spices  or even a little salt or pepper or herbs into the base product.  If you douse the crumbly mess with the sauce, it's a little tasty, but just not integrated.   Call me old fashioned, but food should be seasoned properly and not require heavy dousing with condiments to make it edible. I only ate about a third of it that was it. My friend ordered the one thing that might be a specialty, the lemon ricotta pancakes. I shared bites of that, and it was indeed nice, if not as awesome as reviews would lead you to believe. If I were to go again, I'd order that and skip any kind of egg dish. The other issue is the comfort factor. Yes, the industrial thing looks nice but the small, hard metal chairs that squeek on the floor were simply uncomfortable.
