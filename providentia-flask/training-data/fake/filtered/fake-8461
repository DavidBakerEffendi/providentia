Last night I had one of the worst dining experiences of my life! I had been traveling for the last few weeks for work therefore eating every meal in restaurants and feeling the weight of my patience closing in on me as I watch our incompetent server avoid our questions and leave us waiting on the simplest request. Even though my food was good I couldn't enjoy it. I was bothered the whole night. I, of course, spoke to a manager on the way out and resolve to never dine there again. This afternoon in my office, on my lunch break I thought I'd take the time to write a review about an exceptional restaurant. I never read or write reviews but now believe good places deserve praise. I am writing about FORK. I was there about 2 weeks ago with a party of 9 business associates. The restaurant is small so I remembered being a little nervous we wouldn't be comfortable but our table was nice. Immediately a lovely young woman came up to introduce herself and take our beverage order. Candis was our server and she was excellent. She answered all questions we had, went over signature dishes, described the food for each end of the table and made suggestions for a delicious meat and cheese plate to get us started while we figured out what we wanted to eat. We never had to find her or refill our own wine glass. (In fact it became a running joke to see how quickly she refilled the glasses) After the meat and cheese came our individual plates. I had a salad first followed by the bass. Every bite was beyond satisfying. What started out as a quick meal after a conference turned into a lovely evening of dining. To sum up this review: FORK PHILADELPHIA, 5 stars. Hopefully this helps someone who is looking for a place to relax with great food and service.
