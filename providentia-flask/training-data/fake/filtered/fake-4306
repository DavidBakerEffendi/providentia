Apr 27, 2012  Went to diner last night with 3 other people. Portions very small  with a limited  & pricy menu.  All entrees were warm, not hot when we were served. We are frequent restaurant goers in the City. Service was fine.  The restaurant was cold, we asked several times can the heat be turned up.  When it came time to pay the check we gave the waiter our  $ 100 Little Fish gift card which was rejected. The waitier & the owner refused the card saying this is a new owner &   they cannot honor the gift card. The owner said he did not get the money when the card was purchased  therefore the card could not be used by us. .  We talked & argued with the owner but to no avail.  We were disappointed  in the entire evening  & will not return to the restaurant.
