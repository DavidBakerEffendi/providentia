The atmosphere is nice, but the food was mediocre - especially given the prices (for Brooklyn). I've had similar - but much better - food at other places like Saul. I had scallops with tiny shrimps - the scallops and shrimp both seemed a tad undercooked - the dish was OK but bland and there was a lot of butter. My friend had salmon and loved it; others in my group ordered pork chops and said one was cooked perfectly, the other overcooked. The thing that soured me on the experience was our bizarre waiter. It took us over 2 1/2 hours to eat. The waiter kept eavesdropping, interrupting, telling long-winded and sometimes inappropriate stories,  lectured us on table etiquette (which was not necessary) and implied that my table was "getting trashed" (we had one bottle of wine and I believe 1 beer between five people - that works out to less that one alcoholic beverage per person). I actually found this waiter so odd that I called the manager and mentioned it.   Between the mediocre, somewhat pricey food, and the bizarre waiter, I can't say I would rush back to this place. I'd much rather go to so many of the similarly priced but better places in Brooklyn like Lunetta, Saul, the Good Fork, and so on.
