I can't believe the raves for this place. Not good BBQ. mediocre at best, no smoke, small portions, high prices. The pickle and the root beer were excellent. Burnt ends, pulled pork, brisket, pork belly, beans, mac n cheese. beans and cole slaw too sweet...corn bread was pale and tasteless...brisket dry, pork belly tough, pulled pork sweet...and NO SMOKE! Â I don't get it...has anyone had real BBQ?
