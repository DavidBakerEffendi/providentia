Went in on a Saturday night. Had the brisket, pulled pork, and ribs, then creamy slaw and baked beans. The ribs were really good, as were the sides, but the pork was just ok and the brisket was so dry I couldn't eat it. It actually had the texture of dried out white meat chicken, even though it was from the fatty end. Overall, very disappointed. Wouldn't make the trip back, would rather wait at Dino BBQ.
