Get atmosphere and superior service. I was not rushed out after our meal which is unusual in today's restaurants. I was welcomed by the owner and seated immediately. The food was above average and the drinks were not watered down. I highly recommend this restaurant to all visitors and native New Yorkers alike. Bravo!
