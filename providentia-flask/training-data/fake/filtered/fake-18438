If traveling to Tijuana just to grab a burrito isn't your style, you'll be happy to know you can get both the authentic taste and same slight fear for your life by visiting Philly's own Jose's Tacos. Located on a deserted strip of 10th Street, next to the train tracks, Jose's crumbling structure is the definition of "hole in the wall". But don't be put off by the facade, for inside lies the best cheap Mexican food in Philly. It's simple and delicious. The grilled fish burrito is as good as any I've had in Cali or Mexico. Fish you say? Yes, fish, you can thank me later. The staff is pleasant and everything is made to order. If you live outside the delivery area just ask nicely and tip well, they can be convinced. In a city with lots of good upscale Mexican, Jose's is a shining hole on a hill to those craving a cheap and cheerful burrito.
