I ordered "torinegi-don". It is served with "onsen-egg". It was worst chicken-don I have ever eaten in my life. It tastes just only Sake. I can not taste any chicken,but Sake. I complained about it. But waitress answered me "This is Mirin taste not Sake." I am Japanese, I know what the difference of taste and smell between Sake and Mirin. I am sure that is Sake. And also my family business in Japan is Sake store and Sake factory. They can not fool me. Even they must not fool customer like that way. If always they serve like that, they must explain that "It serves with mixing of Sake." or change the name itself as "Sake-don with chicken and onion". Sake has strong taste like destroy all any other flavors. Specially, this meal was sprinkled with uncooked Sake. Or, they have just abused me( I am just one customer.) by that way, haven't they? I want to tell you all  that  In Japan, we don't have any meal sprinkled by uncooked Sake to destroy flavor. If any Japanese restaurant served meal with full of smell of Sake, it means to hide any other unwelcome taste from it.
