Best secret coffeeshop in the area. Better than Gregory's, Starbucks, Argo, or whatever else is around here. Quiet -- since it's still a secret, there are always seats, and very little noise. Awesome staff -- very friendly and great service. Amazing Iced Coffee -- best I have had in the area and my go-to whenever I need a pick-me-up. The iced coffee is so good here I made this Yelp account just to review.
