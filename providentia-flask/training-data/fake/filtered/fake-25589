It is ok place to order pick up or delivery. Dining in however is completely different story. After waiting to be seated for couple of minutes we just chose the  table and sat down.  More time has passed and our waitress appeared. We were not given a menu, she just asked if we know what we want. Since we ordered pizza by the slice it was no  big deal. But then she disappeared again for a very long time and my friend went to the counter to ask about the order. There were 3 hungry  kids with us. When she came again she had pizzas for only 2 kids and my friend and she asked if we want a check already!!!. some time passed and she came back again with the 3d kid order. I have ordered slice of white pizza and she forgot to put that one in! Not coming back to eat in for sure!
