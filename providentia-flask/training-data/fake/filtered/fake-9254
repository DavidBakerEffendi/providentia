Awesome pizza!  I ordered a cheese steak pizza and another time I had a buffalo chicken pizza.  Both were really good!  The topping proportion was perfect and everything was really delicious.  I also think that their dough is what separates them from other pizza places - it has a great texture and taste.  The interior design is really nice too - I'll be back!
