I am not from NJ. I am on a business trip from California. My friend recommended me and the excellent reviews. The best Indian food I ever had. The buffet excelled in taste and quality. The Thai dishes were authentic and tempted me to buy a portion for the evening. I had the onion naan too for the dinner. Was very soft and tasty. thank you citrus. I found my place in jersey... I will be back. The service was good too.....
