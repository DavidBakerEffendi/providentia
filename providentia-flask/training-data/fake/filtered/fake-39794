So we have very few places that deliver by our company & unfortunately Angelo's is one of the only deli's that does deliver. They are cheap & I guess the saying is true - "you get what you pay for..." Their food is bland and subpar at best. The only reason we would order from them was when everyone in our office forgot to bring lunch & we are to busy to go out. Every time I've ordered it takes their drivers 45mins-1 hour to deliver, even just for a salad. The drivers are scary looking and the girl on the phone writes your CC # in full w/ exp on the receipt for anyone to see. Now - the reason I actually took time to write this review is as follows: I have always tipped the drivers 20% or more when we have ordered except for today. I'm running a company & I was in a rush but even so I still tipped the driver. The manager of the restaurant proceeded to call me up and scream at me about the amount of my tip I had given the driver. NEVER in my life have I experienced such disrespect over a tip she did not agree with...Now I also managed a multi-million dollar restaurant in the past and I would never dream of confronting a customer about a tip!!!! Etiquette 101! Business 101!! And I have experienced customer not tipping on expensive tabs as well. That's their business. I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN.
