This was a very amazing experience. I have been missing really good Japanese food since living in Tokyo and Japanese food in NYC is always hit or miss. This place was defiantly a hit. At first I was a little baffled by the menu they display outside of the restaurant because many of the dishes I have never heard of before even in my adventures in Tokyo. I sat down in the restaurant with two friends: one who lived in Tokyo with me and another who was not as much of an adventurous eater. The Sake selection was pretty awesome. The prices were good and the sake was delicious. We wound up ordering about three different kinds. The menu had so many delicious looking options. We ordered the seared yellowtail, the simmered yellowtail and daikon dish, salmon, and a tamago yakisoba dish. They were all amazing. My less then adventurous friend enjoyed all of the dishes. He complimented on all of them "wow" and "yum!" The food was very fresh and the prices were very reasonable for the quality. I definitely missed food like that! The atmosphere was very inviting and warm. The staff was amazing. The food took a little bit longer then other restaurants but any real foodie knows quality takes time and the food was definitely hot and fresh. We laughed the night away very comfortably. It is not often that a place has such good food, awesome drinks, and nice atmosphere that you forget where you are and just enjoy the night! I recommend this place to anyone foodie or picky eater. It is worth it!
