This is some of the best broth I have ever had in my life. Whenever I come down with a bad cold, I use a visit to Pho Ha as my remedy. The broth is dark, flavorful, complex and soothing. I can tell its been brewing back there for hours if not days. I never need to add hot sauce or hoysin sauce. The beef is always fresh and so tender. I love to add additional lime (aside bean sprouts and cilantro) for a more citrusy flavor, but the pho is really perfect as is. Certainly isn't the most beautiful decor, but they get your order out to you really quickly and you end up devouring this bowl of goodness within minutes.
