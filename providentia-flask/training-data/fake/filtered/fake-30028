I have been to this restaurant at Princeton last Friday with friends and family. Neat and clean, nicely decorated/spacious, friendly staff. The food was just awesome. Hara Bhara Kebab, Dahi and Bhel Puri Â and Chicken Lollipop were great appetizers. We tried Chicken, Veg Biryani, Shrimp in hot garlic sauce, Malai Kofta, Manchuria etc., Surprised with the large quantity - couldn't finish all, ended with packing some food. Ice cream and a variety of Bengali mithai was a great way of finishing the dinner. Can't wait to do another gettogether at this place. Strongly recommend for all food lovers.
