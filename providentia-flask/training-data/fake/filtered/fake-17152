Wow has this place gone down hill!  I had eaten here a number of times, but tonight was the kicker.  We arrived and were seated at our table, only to wait about 15 minutes for a waitress to come to our table.  We asked the bus boy (while waiting) if we could have some peanuts (because we did not get the rolls the hostess normally gives you when you are seated- got them myself).  the busboy proceeds to take a bucket of half eaten peanuts (with broken shells on top) from another table and plops them on ours.  Finally the waitress comes, and goes into a 5 minute shpeel about her life etc.  we order drinks, which take another 15 minutes to come.  Finally dinner arrives, we ordered 2 steaks medium rare, they were so rare they could have walked off the table,  husband sends it back, only to have the waitress bring it back saying that the cook did not agree that it was rare, it must be the lighting?  REALLY.?  We ate what we could and ran out of there.  Bottom line-  Food- o.k.  Service-  BAD.  Lost a customer tonight.
