Yay!  I was stuck out of town when I found out my niece was getting married soon in NYC and I wanted to have the family over.  I had had a few great meals at Petisco so I made a panic call to them from the road for catering.  They COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER!  They made great suggestions, showed up exactly on time with wonderful food that was exactly right, set it up seamlessly and then came back and made all the (empty) dishes disappear.  Tremendously appreciative of your hospitality, professionalism and wonderful food: thanks!!
