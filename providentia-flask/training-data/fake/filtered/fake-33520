Have eaten here several times for lunch and love the food and service.  I have always felt like family, and the prices are quite reasonable!  Today I had them cater a lunch for 15, and it was fabulous!  Lovingly prepared with fresh ingredients.  Specially recommended:  all their Middle Eastern cuisine, especially the lamb, falafel/hummus wrap, and babaganoush, and their fries.  YUM.
