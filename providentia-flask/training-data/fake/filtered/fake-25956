Really like this place. I prefer the brasserie style bar area, more informal yet definitely New York modern. Sit at the bar with the bartender Chris, good guy. He steered me to the short rib burger spectacular Napa red wine lunch special. They were both outstanding. Â He thought it might be the best lunch deal in town. Having now eaten it I agree.
