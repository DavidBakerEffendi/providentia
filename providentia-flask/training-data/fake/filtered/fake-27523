Maybe my expectations were too high when I first went to this restaurant, but I was a bit disappointed with the service. The food is very good, but a bit pricey for the amount. The place is soooooooo small (you feel that you are cramped in a small elevator, but not a room) and the decor is too cheap for the prices they charge and the level of service they provide. The wine list is not adequate too. Besides, we ordered a wine form the list and they didn't want to open the bottle just for 2 glasses, though it was priced as per glass. Maybe I will come back once more just for the food experience.
