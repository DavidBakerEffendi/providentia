Manhattan Books Store  150 Chambers st   everybody pl be careful if u want to buy textbook form the Manhattan Books Store. If u buy the new textbook that comes with the access code, most of the access code does't match or totally wrong. The stuff there was so nice to help you when u bought books, but after u went back to ask about the problem of the access code, none of them was willing to assist you. They will tell that  is none of their business and the buyer has the responsible to figure out what was the problem.  As well as u don't expect to get a refund because it is impossible. so EVERYBODY   don't go there. DON'T !!!!!  DON'T!!!!!!   DON'T!!!!!!!
