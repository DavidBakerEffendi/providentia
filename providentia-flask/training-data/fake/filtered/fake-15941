I 'm visiting a friend of mine in New York and we end up in this Italian gem in Nolita by chance,the place is cute and cozy,my friend looked the review on yelp and were excelent. i didn't know yelp since in europe we use tripadvisor to see review online. All review in both ways were very positive,we had an amazing dinner,we started with timballo di zucchine and burrata mozzarella so fresh and tasty,we than had spaghetti bottarga,very unusual to find this particular dish in New York and pizza diavola crispy and light.yammy. Tiramisu here is a must. 5 stars can not express enough my experience here. What a Piacere Thanks I'll be back soon.
