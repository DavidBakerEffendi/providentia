Great place.  Been here several times and always good.  Fish cooked right, fried chicken always good, ribeye even though 1/2in thick was cooked to order (med rare), good oysters, and great staff.  One of the best American Bistros in the city.  I almost hate to rate so high because of potentially drawing more of a crowd but I feel that I owe it to the owner (or GM) who was so accommodating.  Especially since it was prime dinner time and we had a baby, which isn't always the case at other places in the city.  Keep it up!
