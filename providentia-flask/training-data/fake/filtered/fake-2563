Pros: Great atmosphere, perfect for groups. We went there to celebrate my birthday and it was wonderful. We got a table in the candlelit courtyard that reminds you of a little village in Spain. The cheeses are delicious. There is such a wide selection of very good wines, I was amazed. Cons: Not all the dishes are good. I ordered gnocchi and they were very heavy and drowning in cream. It lacked some refinement. Another con is the staff. One of the hostesses and the waitresses were so rude and inefficient. I was quite surprised when the (tall) hostess said angrily: "move your stuff from the chair!". No please, no thank you, not even a look. Just because I had put a bouquet of flowers on the empty chair next to me. But we didn't let it ruin our dinner. I definitely recommend it as the place itself and the cheeses/wines are great! I was very happy with the evening. A very nice birthday dinner! One more thing: the place gets very crowded, very fast, so call ahead to make a reservation. And they have a Nutella cake...;-) Went there on 9/30/2010
