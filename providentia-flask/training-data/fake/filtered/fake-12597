O brother.... Would have rather went to Wegmen's. Sorry guys. There was so much rice (which was not good quality sushi rice) in each roll we ordered we were full by the 2nd one. It was almost like they wanted to mask the fish (which was VERY eh...) Service was very friendly, decor was pleasant (a little too bright inside)... Amateur rolling of each roll. The sushi and sashimi was both of very minimal standards.
