I love love love this place. My husband and I usually order burgers from here once a week. He orders his well  done and I order mine medium. It's always perfect, but yesterday when he got home with our food, we realized they reversed them, and mine was well done and my husbands was medium. I called them and asked if  we could bring his burger back and have them cook it for a few more minutes. To my surprise, we got 2 new burgers AND our money back! Now that's what I call customer service! We may have to up our weekly order to twice a week!
