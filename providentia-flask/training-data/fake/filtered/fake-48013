keep it simple is the name of a good burger.It would get five stars except for the Bathrooms need a facelift and the servers need a class in how to polite and say thank you ! Besides that the burger is juicy ,perfect size probably 7/8 ounces on a regular bun with regular cheese but i just ozzes flavour.. Bartender Jeff is great always has cool music on ...
