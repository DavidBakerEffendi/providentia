Stella 34 Trattoria - Early evening, midweek dining, moderately priced for tourists, bill includes suggested 18 or 20 percent gratuity including alcohol. Cocktails: FRAGOLI SMASH chunky fruit, more chew than drink, LIMONCELLO MOJITO missing limoncello, both smart, fresh and tasty if you sip before the glass full of ice begins to melt. Starter: CALAMARI crisp, hot with fried bits of pickled pepper, we like. Pizza: Classic MARGHERITA thin crust, just seconds in the oven, perfect, hard to get wrong, would have benefited from a warmed plate. Special: Rotisserie pork with smokey, crisp skin complemented by sharp broccoli rabe. Sweet Closer: Sheep's milk ricotta cheesecake, very light custard slice, cheesecake not. Lemon Genovese original recipe with a dollop of Vivoli Il Gelato, yum. Menu heavy on the Naples experience and intimidating to a regular person. Dining room staff are capable, if robotic, and were unable to answer simple questions about ingredients or make suggestions. Clean airy atmosphere, chairs hard to take for the length of the meal.
