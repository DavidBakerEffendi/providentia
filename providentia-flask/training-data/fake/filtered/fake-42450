Be very careful if you are considering Palma for a private event.  We recently went to check out their "Carriage House" for an upcoming rehearsal dinner the night before our son's wedding.  In fairness, we did not have an appointment and just popped in on them.  When we were told that the person in charge was too busy to show us the space, we could not complain.  In her place, we were assigned a very knowledgeable -seeming young man.  It immediately became apparent that the carriage house would not be big enough for our party of 34. The gentleman then suggested the garden room which the carriage house connects to.  The garden room is lovely, and we were intrigued.  He told us that the minimum would be an $85.00 a head for a prix fixe meal, plus drinks, and a $500.00 fee for the room.  The room fee seemed low to us, but he stuck to it, even when I said, "I'm glad to hear it is not $5000.00."  We made one final attempt to deal with Jessica, the person in charge, but we were told that she was too busy to deal with us at that moment.  No problem.  We emailed her our request and were told flat out that the space was not available on Friday nights.  When we appealed, we were told that the price on a week night for the garden is $12000.00, plus food and drinks.  On a Friday night, the price would be $18-20,000.00.  Who are they kidding?  Palma is an okay restaurant. It is not Per Se.  Even so, though, if you are going to show potential customers around, you need to have at least the basic information.  $20,000,00 instead of $500.00?  Give me a break.  There are far better places at more reasonable prices to hold an event, and they are not all involved in bait and switch.
