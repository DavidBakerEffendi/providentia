Robertas was a fantastic experience. I usually don't treat myself to so many calories but omg it was so so worth it I don't even feel bad. Loved the Cheeses Christ... lol. The food speaks for itself: innovative tastes, top-top-notch ingredients, expert preparation. Believe the hype !!!!!!!!!!!!! ;P
