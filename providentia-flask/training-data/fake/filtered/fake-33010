Just had a very nice Thai New Year dinner at Ratchada. The atmosphere is always very soft and relaxing. It is my refuge from the mean streets of the city. I was reluctant to write a review until Jib, the owner, asked me too. I would hate to see one of my favorite places get too popular. But I also want to see it do well. The fish appetizer had a very nice texture and matched well with the dipping sauce. The tulip dumplings were a perfect combination of soft skin and tasty filling. They also had a very tasty sauce. I liked the Lao curry. It was the only one listed as not spicy. Spice and me are not friends, so I was happy to eat nice veggies and chicken and not have a mouth on fire. Others might prefer the spicier choices. I had a nice coconut icecream for dessert. The perfect ending to a nice dinner. Jib came out and schmoozed a bit and took a picture with me. I exchanged pleasantries and left my refuge, back to the reality that is Philly.
