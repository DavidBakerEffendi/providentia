My husband and I celebrated our 37th Wedding Anniversary at Colicchio & Sons Tap Room.  We had an amazing time.  Our table was intimate with a nice view.  The food and service were excellent and exceeded our expectations.  The restaurant included on the top or our menu "Happy Anniversary Ann & Steven."  They gave us a special complimentary dessert and a special drink to celebrate as well.   Several people from the restaurant staff came to our table to wish us a happy anniversary.  At the end of our meal, before we left, they gave us a copy of our special menu to take home, neatly folded in an envelope.  They also included muffins for our next day's breakfast.   They made us feel very special!  I highly recommend this restaurant especially for a special occasion.
