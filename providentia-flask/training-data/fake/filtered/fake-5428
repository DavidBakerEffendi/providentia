If you're in the mood for a burger and you're in the area, don't miss it. Friends of mine who really don't like burgers have been converted after eating here - their burgers are just really tasty and they deserve all the praise. The bar is slightly let down by a not-great selection of beers but they have all the usuals on tap. The outdoor area is lovely (even in the winter when they have heaters out there).
