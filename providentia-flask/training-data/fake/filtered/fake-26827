We love Dos Toros. Infinitely better than Chipotle or any other Mexican style Taqueria NYC has to offer. Ingredients look, smell, and most importantly taste fresh which can be hard to come by dealing with NYC fast food. Stef comes here everyday for lunch orders the chicken plato with guacamole V gets the bean burrito in pinto or black variety - the consistency of this place is unrivaled. Dos Toros just missed out on five stars but it easily gets overcrowded with few seating options and on occasion the staff neglects to strain the beans before serving them in the plato leaving it too soggy to enjoy fully.
