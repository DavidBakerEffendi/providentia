I've heard a lot of great things about Talula's Garden so I decided to check it out. My friends and I had a reservation for Friday at 7pm, there was three of us. We walked in and it was packed. We decided to wait a little longer than our reservation time so that we didn't get seated in the bar area. We did have a drink at the bar. The bartenders were friendly, made recommendations, and most importantly made the drinks well. If you didn't have a seat the space was quite crowded and you were constantly doing a little dance to get out of the servers way. We ordered the abstract and their version of a margarita. We waited about another 10-15 minutes at the bar before we were seated. We were seated near the back of the restaurant. Which I don't mind because I like to be able to see what is going on around me. We were greeted and given water. Our server although visibly busy did not seem perturbed when greeting us and discussing the menu. He made solid recommendations on appetizers as well as entrees. We had the Winter Cauliflower Ravioli's as well as a Cheeseboard for apps. For dinner we went with the Seared Day Boat Scallops, Pan Roasted Chicken, and Gnocchi. The food was cooked perfectly and everything was delicious. The food did take a little long to come to the table. However, understandably so since it was a busy night. We also had dessert to share the Chocolate Parade and the Baklava. Overall the experience was great. It is a little pricey but the food and drinks are consistent and well worth the spend. I'd like to visit again in the summer to sit outside.
