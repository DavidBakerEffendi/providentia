I had the fried chicken chunks with plantins as an appetizer the serving size was more then enough for all 4 of us. I had yellow rice with beans charbroiled steak, my kids had chicken stew and husband had roast pork. The food was amazing, the prices were great. The restaurant was a family style friendly staff. It was a very nice evening out with the kids at a great restaurant. Highly recommend to anyone visiting the Clifton area. I will certaintly be back!
