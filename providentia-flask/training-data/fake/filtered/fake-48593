Ramen Nazis, Pretentious Staff. Look, the food is fine and only slightly overpriced, but here's our Â experience: My 70 yr old father asked to use their bathroom at 4:45pm while we were waiting in line for them to open at 5pm. Despite the restaurant having active staff and doors open, they refused and made him WAIT to use the bathroom. When they opened, he rushed into the bathroom while we waited in line for a table. We were told all persons must be present before seating, even though he was in THEIR restroom! He wouldn't have needed to rush in if they'd been HUMAN BEINGS and let him in early! Let all the others behind us in line in, like we had tried to scam their system. These Caucasian staffers are pretentiously following rigid "Japanese rules" to maintain some sort of SCHTICK of the place and losing site of common sense and HUMANITY. What a joke.
