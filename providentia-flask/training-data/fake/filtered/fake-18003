Left this post once, but doesn't look like its here anymore. We were eating here, when midway through the meal, my dad started developing stomach pains. This was dinner, and he hasn't eaten anything since noon, and when I brought this up to the manager, she said, "it couldn't possibly be our fault". On top of that, the food was pretty awful. Tastes like glorified, flavorless cafeteria food.
