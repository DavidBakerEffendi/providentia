After the Liberty Bell and self-guided mural tour our group of 4 decided to take an open table at Zavino's. It looked inviting and with the mild afternoon temps were accommodating for an outside table. SomePrimitivo, Malbec, peach sangria, and strawberry basil lemonade started us off right. We ordered the tasting board with assorted cheese, chacuterie, and roasted peppers. All this was accompanied by puffy bread triangles and blackberry jam, mustard, and guava paste. I decided on eggplant parm and I was not disappointed! Â We also sampled the gnocchi, roasted brussel sprouts, spinach salad, and meatballs. There was something for all of us and the staff was happy and friendly.
