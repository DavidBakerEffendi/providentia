From the moment you walk in the ambiance is amazing. The restaurant is clean, chic and comfortable. The food was delicious and the staff was accommodating and knowledgeable. Being of European decent, I'm particularly picky about Mediterranean cuisine and have high standards, which were all met and surpassed here. I've been to many "Mediterranean" restaurants before but this one definitely lives up to it's name! I highly recommend this establishment if you're looking for fresh food with a pleasurable atmosphere.
