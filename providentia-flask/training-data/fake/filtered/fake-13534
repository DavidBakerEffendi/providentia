I ate here on a Saturday afternoon with my wife and kid. It was a great experience all around. The dishes were very good. Sorry I don't do taste blow-by-blow but suffice to say we all cleaned our plates and loved it. The service was quick and smart despite it being a bit busy - not full capacity, but still, lots of customers. I had a beer & my wife had a cocktail - again, they nailed it! The ambiance is a nice chilled-out vintage look and feel. I will likely come back here with guests from out of town or for a beer at the bar with my buddies
