I stayed in Philly for the last week... I sampled cheese steaks with my colleagues throughout the city. In all honesty, this was the worst. I paid 9 bucks for chewy steak and an off tasting cheese whiz. My friend (a Philly  native) describes this as a tourist trap.  I agree.  The best cheese steak I had was in a little shop off Market Street that cost about 5 bucks. Disappointed indeed. BTW.. Food Network and Travel Channel... if these are your recommendations, rest assured that I will not take your advice again.
