Ordered a Large Sausage Onions and Peppers Pie.  Pizza came to $25 plus tip for delivery.  $30 pizza seems a bit steep to me but I decided to try it since the Colchester location is pretty good. Girl who took the order put me on hold 3 times and took my order twice before she got it right.  Was told pizza would arrive in 30 minutes, we are now at 1 hour and 30 minutes with no dinner.  I called the Burlington location and was told "the driver is out there somewhere so it must be on it's way". Honestly there are better pizza's out there for $15 dollars and they deliver on time.  This is the worst in Burlington.  Will not order again.
