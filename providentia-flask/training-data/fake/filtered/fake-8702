I've been to El Camino Real three times and the food and service have just been ok. Mostly it was a backup choice if DOS SEGUNDOS up the street had a long wait for a table. I went to El Camino Real during the sunday brunch with all my roomies and my roomie's parents. We all shared the fried pickle chips, buttermilk vidalia onion rings, tex cobb salad and for my entree I ordered a chorizo burrito and s'mores bread pudding for dessert. Shortly afterwards I had THE WORST FOOD POISONING IN MY LIFE. I was stuck in the bathroom for 2 days straight and was eventually HOSPITALIZED. I despise El Camino Real and I spit on the ground every time I walk past it now. Stay far away!
