Lucali's calzones are the best I have ever had - and their brick oven pizza is among the best I've eaten -- I live in the Bronx where there is no shortage of great pizza, but Lucali's is very much worth the trek to Carroll Gardens, and even having to wait out in the cold too as my friends and I did yesterday.  If you want an excellent thin crust brick oven pizza and a rather large but substantially cheesy (in the literal, ricotta sense) calzone you must dine at Lucali's -- it is all they do, pizza and calzones -- so keep that in mind.  The owner is a great guy as well, and has very nice waitstaff.  Keep in mind the wait time to get in could be long - an hour or more in better weather than it was yesterday near zero temperature.
