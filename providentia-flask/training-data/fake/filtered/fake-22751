I have been coming to this place on a weekly basis since they have opened. The owners are super friendly and you can tell they take pride in presenting their heritage through their food. They use all fresh ingredients and herbs that create an authentic Tunisian delight. The tea is unique in flavor that offer compliments of fresh mint and is a must have for any tea lover. The food is delicious and surprisingly its actually healthy which is always an added bonus. Try the grilled chicken escapole.
