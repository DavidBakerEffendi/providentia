Try the 'Corned Beef, Pastrami, Swiss and Coleslaw on Rye' (club sandwich):  perfect, thinly sliced sandwich meats, generously stacked on rye bread, with coleslaw and russian salad dressing.  Roast Beef Club sandwich was good, but meat on the drier side (I prefer rare).  Mac & Cheese was comforting and good.  Definitely returning.
