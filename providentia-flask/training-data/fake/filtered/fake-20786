WOW is all I have to say.  My husband and I went here to celebrate our anniversary, and were so impressed.  From the rich, goat cheese tartlet (who knew goat cheese and dough could taste so magnificent?) to the pork tenderloin and cassoulet (the little duck and bacon surprises at the bottom of the bowl were the pieces de resistance), to the iles flotante - I felt like I was back in France, only better.  We will definitely go back -- can't wait to try the mussels which smelled divine (from the table next to us) and the escargots.  A real treasure!
