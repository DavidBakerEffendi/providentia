You'll need an Iron Stomach to dine with this Iron Chef! After many years we thought we found the perfect NYE restaruant. Last year we were thrilled so we made reservations for a second celebration. Everything was perfect, same table, same great waiter. Then the entree was delivered, we choose the $65 per person roasted chicken. Unfortunately the chicken was served raw at the bone. When brought to the attention of the waiter we were told the chicken is prepared in vacuum bags ans roasted to the perfect temp and was safe to eat. We chose not to eat the red meat. At 2am the meal and food poisoning tool effect. Aside from the salmonella, the busboy who delivered our cutlery had a poorly wrapped hand wound. A source of contamination as well. I will make reservations elsewhere next year. I am concerned about the safe serve training of the staff!
