Best Dumplings Ever..  I had a first date here, and might I say it was the best!  It was $5 for the two of us, which included 2 bottles of water.  We each got 8 dumplings, mine vegetarian, and split a sesame pancake.  I have told many of this fabulous place - a hidden gem in NYC.  The guy is great and actually remembers you!!
