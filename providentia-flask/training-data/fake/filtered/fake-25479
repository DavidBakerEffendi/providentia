Love this place! Wait Staff was friendly, timely and the food was fab! Appreciated that the Waitress was so honest @ suggested favorites (which we took her up on). They made fantastic Mojitos, and I had to fight off my companeros from eating all my yummy camarones. We stayed and really enjoyed the atmosphere (simple, small, friendly) and just ate and sipped our drinks. They even sent over a complementary Flan for us to share . . . (I suppose we did really stay awhile . . . it may have been a bribe for us to leave ;-) Quaint ~ good amiance ~ great food! We''ll be back!
