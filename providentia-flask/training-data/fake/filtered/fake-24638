AMAZING!! Best sushi in Philly. The rolls are small and nicely proportioned - not those outrageously huge rolls that you get at Raw or Unmai and can barely fit into your mouth. Although the environment is small, the owner or manager is great and tries to make it as comfortable as possible for you. He is also very friendly and gets to know his customers!!
