Five of us ate at Basso56 last night expecting a more than decent meal as a result of reviews on yelp, chowhound and even Zagat.  Our experience was profoundly disappointing and confusing.  In fact disillusioned.  Some did warn us that is was a tourist place not worthy of true foodies.  I should have listened.  My first clue that this was not going to be what I expected was when the waiter, a perfectly gracious guy, asked where we were from and was taken aback a bit when we said UWS and the Village.  So here goes.  The drinks were quite good. the barata tasty.  Except for one main dish, a special wild mushroom ravioli, the food was disappointing at any price.  Some inedible. If you want good pasta go to   Lupa, Cacio e pepe, Apiary, Gotham just to name a few.
