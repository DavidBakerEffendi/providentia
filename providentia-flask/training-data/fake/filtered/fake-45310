I've eaten at Rizzuto's once, about six months ago, and it has taken this long to not become nauseous thinking about my meal. I really hope it was an off day for them. I had the sweet potato tortellini. It was drowned in sage butter, the vegetables were spongy and tasteless. This meal ranks as the worst "Italian" meal I've eaten at a restaurant and as a side point: the meal should have been called "sweet potato tortelloni" due to the size. Outside of the meal, the service and decor was excellent and the wine list was comprehensive. Hopefully, it's improved since...
