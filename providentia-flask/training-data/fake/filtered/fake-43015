Went in for dinner last night. The sushi and service was great. All of the food that was served from the kitchen was served on ice cold plates. My espresso cup was so cold that the espresso was not drinkable by the time it reached the table. Â The dessert was also ice cold when we got it. Not sure why everything was served on freezing cold plates but it doesn't make the food enjoyable.
