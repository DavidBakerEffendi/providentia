This place is an absolute hidden gem. I've been to so many restaurants throughout the city. Everything was amazing. The service was excellent. The spices we're perfect. I can't wait to return. I had the avocado salad, tibi chicken with cabbage and collard greens, for desert we had apple pie with vanilla ice cream. It's very cozy and intimate. I loved it so much.
