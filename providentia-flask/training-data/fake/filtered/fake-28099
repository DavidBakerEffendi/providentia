Have eaten/drank here thrice now and enjoyed it each time.   Burgers, fries and shakes are not my typical favorites but I can't really resist at this place.   I took some friends there last Sunday and everyone was like "Bobby, why do you keep mentioning the burgers? Get over it!" but when they actually bit into their burgers I swear they all said it was the best they ever had.  I'm not exaggerating at all.   I was in a fat-girl kinda mood so I had a milkshake with Patron in it (SOOOO good) and the Grilled Cheese which was simply amazing.  In short, everyone loved it, and I was so glad to find another place to go for Sunday eatin'. Plus its at the piazza which is so cute I can't stand it.
