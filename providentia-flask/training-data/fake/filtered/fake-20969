Having eaten here at least a dozen times in the past twelve months, this is my goto place on a cold or rainy day.  Nothing feels as good as a hearty beef broth with chili oil and noodles.   I'm a huge fan of their Shanghai noodles with tender beef and big Wontons.  In fact, I think it's the best chinese beef noodles I've had in the city.  The wonton are the size of large dumplings and the beef is tender and full of flavor.  The other dishes served here are fine, but the star attraction will always be the beef noodles.   My only gripe with the restaurant is the wait staff.  Inattentive, lazy and depressing; no wonder they wear colorful hawaiian shirts to even out their sour attitudes. A note to those that's been going to Wonton Garden's for a while.  You might notice that their noodle soup bowls for have gotten smaller.  It's still more than enough to stuff you, but it definitely less than before.
