So this douchenozzle Joie from DE can just bite my ISH, cuz he (clearly) cannot tell shitfood that he is used to eating from premium authentic cuccina italiana. What a dumbshit! This is the best pizza place on the entire goddamn East coast, ya gotta fly all the way to Piemonte to find pizza this good. Wat? Never saw a REAL (not NJ Italian) Italian pizza? Your loss. Sorry, I am just venting because of this "zero" brain Joie blowie review. This is AWESOME food, trust me, I go to Italy every damn year, and OP is LEGIT, B!
