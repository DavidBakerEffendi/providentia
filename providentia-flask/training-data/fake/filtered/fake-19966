It was my first time going to Buddakan with my girl, not that I have been there before -_-. The Place was great.  The lights, the decorations, the huge Buddha was indefinably interesting and unique. The bartenders, hosts, and waiters where very pleasant and friendly. I thought   they were even watching me eat because every time my plate was cleared by the time I put the fork on it someone was taking the plate from me(serious face)...anyway... The appetizer was delicious.  we had the Scallops spring rolls (STOP) not enough food for starters. Then we had the Sea bass which it was amazing it melt in my mouth (good stuff) The waitress mention that we had to order sides because they didn't came with the food. It makes me wonder who the hell just order fish and no sides.  -_- (scam artist) She also said the sides where good enough for 2 people (two people on a diet may be) My girl wanted to eat the whole thing but she was trying to be nice to me (I love you baby)lol Overall, it was good, not so crazy about it. I think I'll come back again but it is a little over price for my taste.
