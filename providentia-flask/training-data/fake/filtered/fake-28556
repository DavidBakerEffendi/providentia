We were seated, looked at the menu, knew what we wanted to order and it took them easily 10 minutes to get us. The whole time, we sat with our menus closed, obviously ready to order. Then it took another 25 minutes to actually get our food. Two chicken and rice dishes cost $26. Overpriced and slow service means I take my business elsewhere.
