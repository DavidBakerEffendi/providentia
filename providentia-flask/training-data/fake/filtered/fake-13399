Love love love this place! My first time write review on yelp... Maybe I will regret it later. I want to keep this place secret. Anyway I've eaten here wice on weekend. Very simple authentic japanese breakfast. Miso soup, brown rice, grilled fish and small sides.really yummy! I can eat this kind of food everyday! I recommend to go there early in the morning. It is getting crowded after 12... The same as other restaurants around burg. Food comes pretty quick tho. Â Service is really good! A Cute japanese waitress name Yoko remembered that I don't eat blue fish and ordered cold tea last time. She brought me ice tea without asking and recommended white fish instead of blue fish! How nice is that?! She made me feel like I'm a regular customer. You know what? I will be a regular! Yuji was really sweet too. He came out to chat with me and my friend while waiting for seat. Can't wait for next trip to Okonomi this weekend!
