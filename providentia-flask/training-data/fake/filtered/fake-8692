We had a large party here and spent nearly 1K. The service was horrendous and the wait staff was simply rude. I was reminded, even before the waiter even took our orders, that another party was coming in two hours and we couldn't exceed that time! First, I dine out very often in Philadelphia and am not one to loiter after dinner... I have NEVER in any restaurant I've ever eaten in been told what time another party was coming. I also rarely complain and give the restaurant the benefit of the doubt but I can hands down say I've never had a worse experience with service in Philadelphia. The food was pretty good but I couldn't get out of there fast enough... forced or at my own will
