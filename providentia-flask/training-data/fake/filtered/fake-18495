Has definitely fallen to catering to the casually dressed tourist and bar trade even when meals are priced at levels comparable to some of the  finest restaurants in NYC. Having arrived a bit early my party was confined to a small waiting area with no opportunity for drink service. Fought for attention and service at the bar and returned with hands full while the unobliging management staff looked on. Dinner service was spotty; choices a bit I'll-conceived and generally not satisfying.  If you frequent class NYC dining spots you dont need this kind of abuse. Plenty of other choices for fine dining. I'll go back there for a burger and beer as I understand the bar menu is more reasonable and more in line with expectations.
