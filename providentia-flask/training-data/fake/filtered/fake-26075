I admit it- I am a breakfast junkie. i've been eating breakfast out in town since the 70's. I really like this place. the best item on their menu, IMHO, is the Challah Bread french toast. Â The standard order is three pieces, but that is too much for me, so i order two pieces. Coffee is good, waitstaff is pleasant. I've added this place to my mix of breakfast places, which includes Lotties, Kens, and the Glastonbury Coffee shop.
