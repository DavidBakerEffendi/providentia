The atmosphere is different and very trendy.  We didn't wait very long, maybe 5 minutes.  The hostess pointed to the table and told us to go ahead and seat ourselves.  She neglected to tell our waitress that we were there.  We sat there for 10 minutes before my boyfriend went to ask if they knew we were there.  The waitress came right over.  We had the House Specialty which is the Mashed Potato and bacon pizza.  It was less than exciting and tasted exactly how it sounds, mashed potatoes and bacon on crust, kind of dry and bland.  We sat for about 15 minutes before anyone finally noticed that we might be done.  Our drinks were empty and we had stopped eating.  Another server came over to attend to us and we asked for the check and a box.  She picked up the pizza tray and dumped it into the box.  First time I have only tipped 15% in years and I shouldn't have tipped that much.  I might go back to see if their other pizzas are any good and maybe sit at the bar.  It won't be my first choice for awhile.  The mashed potato pizza isn't that great.  The servers need a uniform so that people can tell who they are and they need some training in customer service.  Their tips might get better.
