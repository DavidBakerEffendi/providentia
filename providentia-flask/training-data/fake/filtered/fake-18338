I was in Burlington from San Francisco to visit family for pre-holiday gatherings.  I've never used yelp before but after talking with my sister-in-law about a great time I had in Burlington, she suggested that I write a review, so I am! While in Burlington, my family went shopping and my brother and I decided to try a local restaurant, "The Scuffer Steak and Ale House."  (I don't know what a scuffer is).  We were greeted by a nice bartender who we found out later was named Amber.  We sat at the bar and browsed the menu.  Now, we have good beers in San Fran, and this place had almost 20 beers from the area so I couldn't wait to try a couple.  I asked Amber for a beer to try and she suggested a local organic (I don't care about organic things) beer called "Wolavers IPA."  Wow,  What a beer!  I love hoppy beers and this was great.  I chatted with her for a little bit about the area and decided to try New England Clam Chowder.  The soup was excellent, creamy, with lots of clams, perfect in my eyes.  I finished my beer and decided to try a sample board of beer.  On it I ordered, Switchback Porter, Wolavers Coffee, Otter River Black IPA, and of course I had to get the Anchor Steam Christmas Ale (my favorite San Fran brewery).  We had a great time talking with Amber we decided to stay for a meal so I ordered The French Dip and my brother ordered the rusty steak sandwich.  We loved it, food was excellent and sweet potato fries were great, and we were stuffed. This was a great experience.  The atmosphere, the food, the beer, and the bartender made my midday lunch a great time.  I would highly recommend the Scuffer Steak and Ale House to anyone.  I will be back next year.
