We stopped by after dropping off my niece a few towns over. Not knowing the area ,we took a chance. I'm so glad we did. The bangers and mash were off the chain good, and I had the steak pie. Everything was super fresh, and I was delighted to wash it down with a Belhaven Ale - my absolute favorite beer, and they have a full line of bellhaven on tap. Rustic charm, friendly staff, and a game of futbol on the Tele. Do not miss out on this stop that is sure to be a new favorite.
