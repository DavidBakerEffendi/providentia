I went last night with my husband, and we used a living social deal. Our waiter was Josh. You walked in and could tell that it was a very family friendly business. My husband and I each ordered the chicken pram, and we ordered a third entree, the shrimp scampi, to split. Josh totally warned us not to..and we should've listened. The portions were HUGE!! The food was authentic and tasty. We live in Brooklyn,,and we were out here for our anniversary. We will definitely be coming back. Thanks, Josh!
