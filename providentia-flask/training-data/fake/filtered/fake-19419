Tchoup Shop catered our wedding and it was totally great. We had a big party with a a diverse guest list and everyone loved the food- from picky kids to food snobs to tough traditionalists. Simon worked super hard to make sure we were happy and his team was friendly and tight. If you are getting hitched, you should keep this dude in mind.
