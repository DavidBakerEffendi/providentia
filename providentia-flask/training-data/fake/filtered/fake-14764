First time to this place and we opted to sit outside.  Our waitress was so nice.  We had the artichoke tempura and it was a unique tasting app, very light and not over greasy. Than the main dishes came out.  He order the Prime Rib special at 22 oz. OMG you don't know what 22 oz of meat looks like till its in front of your face.  But it was amazing and nothing was left of it. I ordered the Roasted Pear and Warm Goat Cheese salad with chicken.  It was nice and warm and delicious.  I eat slow so my goat cheese started to cool down and crumbled as I cut into it.  But the combination is so tasty and filling. Definitely returning to this place. Oh and I used a 15% off coupon!!!  The only thing that doesn't work is their bread and oil in the beginning.  Bread is dense and cold and their style of pouring oil doesn't do it for me.  I would rather have had no bread on the table or maybe warm bread and butter.... but that just fills you up for no reason.
