First time dining at Handys and it was a great experience. The seating was interesting but made the atmosphere great. Once seated all of the employees were very helpful and polite. I ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and they were spot on. I also checked in and got my free cookie without a problem. And to top it all off were were given candy for Halloween. Great place. great food. Coming back again soon. :)
