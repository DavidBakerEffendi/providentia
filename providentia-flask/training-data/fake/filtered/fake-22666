I do not want to call myself a pizza connoisseur, but I have had my share of slices. The Island has a few reputable names when it comes to pizza; Lee's, Joe & Pat's, Ciro's and of course Denino's. I love their Garbage Pie, its fantastic. The crust is thin and crispy but not flimsy. Their other menu options are equally as appetizing. The fried calamari and buffalo wings are some of my favorite to order when I'm with a few buddies. In the summer its a great place to bring the family because after dinner you can take the kids right across the street for some Ices. This place is a STAPLE for Staten Island pizza.
