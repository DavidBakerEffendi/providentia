My experience at pumpkin was OK. Not a 5 star restaurant by any means. Food was decent but make sure you get there early in the night. They tend to run out of everything by 8:00pm. They lack in many areas of service(slow, no bread, repetitive requests of silverware, and they offer no cappuccino).   Presentation of food was impressive. I wouldn't recommend coming here If you are trying to stuff your face. Location is great however it is extraordinarily cramped inside.  this place could be amazing if its customer service was at par with its cuisine.  Sorry but i give them 2 out of 5 based off of overall experience.
