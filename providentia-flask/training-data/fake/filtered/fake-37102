Went there for our anniversary dinner.  There were 4 of us at the table.  We had the special which was the giant scallops.  The scallops were excellent BUT that was the only thing that I could say was excellent.  I was not happy with our service/waiter/side choices. The waiter was not very helpful and borderline rude and nonexistent.  The scallops came with mashed potatoes and fried spinach.  First of all, mashed potatoes with scallops?  Whoever thought of that menu?  Two mushy whites? The waiter told us there were no substitutions when I asked for a baked potato instead of mashed.  I've never heard of that in any restaurant I've been to.  I felt like I was in mamma's kitchen - no substitutions!  He then told me there would be a $4.50 charge for substituting the potato.  When I gawked, he told me he would substitute roasted potatoes, which I finally agreed to. Next, the FRIED spinach that came with it was the worst thing I have ever tasted, crispy and hard to pick up with a fork.  Maybe I'm old school but what a way to ruin spinach!  I can't believe this is even on their menu.   Also, dinner was quite expensive.  I will not return anytime soon unless there is a wedding as I've heard good things about weddings and parties though where the choices are pre-picked.  I guess that's their forte as dinner was a disappointment.
