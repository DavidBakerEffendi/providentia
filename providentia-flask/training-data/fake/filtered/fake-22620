My family and I went to a midweek dinner and were very disappointed. Although not busy the waiter ignored us most of the time and started to argue when my mom found her salmon dish burnt. Aparently their salmon comes with a black crust. In addition we were charged for every soda refill and no one ever even apologiezed for the slow service or burnt items. All in all we felt very uncomfortable and will never return.
