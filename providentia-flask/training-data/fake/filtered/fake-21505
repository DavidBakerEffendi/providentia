I was with my girlfriend who has no idea what this new 1792 bourbon is. Supposedly the word on the trendy streets of Tribeca, is that at Ward III , 1792 is newly launched as a small craft bourbon. Trust me, my girlfriend usually likes wine. I had to drag her to this mixology spot that I happen to find exquisite.   The bartenders took the 1792 and ran with it.  Their wizardry in mixology allowed my girlfriend to be happy in 5 minutes. They created a cocktail with 1792 for her specific palate.  She is so picky, but enjoyed the caramel butter scotch flavors in this artsy rendition of an old fashion   Thank you Ward III for broadening my girlfriends horizon and explaining how I can make an Old Fashioned Cocktail of 1792 Bourbon at home.   Wonderful evening and pretty educational for an after 9pm whiskey tasting. I hope they continue with the this type of cool atmosphere of mixology, leading the trend of craft cocktails.
