Stangely located on a dark street in an old strip club. I was not expecting too much as we drove up. The Flashing "Open" neon sign giving it a wierd vibe. The decor was nice, the sparsely decorated dark interior again reminded me that this once was a strip joint. Service: our server did not like that we ordered bottled water, she went away and didn't come back. Sent other very nice server who was patient and friendly. The Indian Host/Server who came over to explain dishes was friendly but could not explain what one perperation was , instead stating that it was kinda like chicken65. Food: Nothing to write home about, it was decent, same dishes with fancier names have been served at Indo- Chinese restaurants up and down the East Coast. The Hakka noodles had almost no flavor, the burnt garlic rice had a after taste, the cauliflower Manchurian was ok, the spicy chicken in garlic sauce was very good. We opted out of dessert, since instead if having dessert on the menu they had it in a flip card on the table, it didn't look beckoning at all. All in all its a decent place to eat, but the staff needs to learn whats on the menu, the location is not the best as it sits a stone throws away from the seedy part of Trenton.
