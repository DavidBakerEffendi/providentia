Came here for the first time the other day. What an awesome bar/restaurant. The food was incredible. The bartender was really nice too and informative. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because I thought it was a little too expensive for what it was. My burger was 12 bucks and my drink was $11.50. Go figure. But again, the food was great.
