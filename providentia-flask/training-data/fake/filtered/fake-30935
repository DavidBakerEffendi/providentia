I went to Delmonico's for the first time last week with friends who had been there before and loved it.  It's a great place for a good meal, great atmosphere, without breaking the bank.  My favorite app was the crab trio and the petite filet was amazing.  I liked that the salad was served and was included in the meal and do not think it was representative of Olive Garden as another user commented.  The staff was friendly and I definitely look forward to coming back again.
