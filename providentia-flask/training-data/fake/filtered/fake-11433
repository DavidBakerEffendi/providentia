hey everybody, I went there yesterday even after reading every negative review. Guess what, we went at 12:30pm and walked right in, we had a fabulous macchiato at the coffee bar which gave us the boost to start and we were not disappointed. Ok, there was somewhat of a crowd but I felt it added to the atmosphere. We looked over the great array of coffees and desserts, but decided to save that for later.  The best part was walking around the marketplace after buying a fantastic glass of wine, the longer we walked around drinking, the more relaxed we felt and kept adding to our shopping basket. We had a short wait for the Pesce restaurant. We had excellent apps consisitng of little neck clams and a crudo fish app of salmon, skate, and skipfish, super sauce with all the fishes. We shared a misto fritti platter which was great too.  We even saw a celeb flash by, it was Fonzie, aka Henry Winkler, we don't miss a trick.  We headed to the desserts to cap off our great lunch, we had tiramisu and panna cotta, heavenly!!!  So time to check out at the register, quick and easy and $100.00 later, but you know what we had a great time, and the time passed so quickly, three hours.  I will definitely be back to try the wine bar/cheese sampling area, everything looked so fresh.  Please don't hesitate to go! I can't wait to go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!
