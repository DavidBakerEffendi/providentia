3 Visits...This is how they went. Visit 1: Great Burger, they are cash only but I got over it. Visit 2: The place was packed, were greeted with menus that looked like they had been used as napkins. Visit 3: Server auto grated my padded check, then argued that they donate to charity and so I should consider correcting it.
