Absolutely love the food but appealed by the fact that I've ordered multiple times Delievery. All of the sudden they will no longer Deliever to me as I am a quater of a block past canal. It would be no problem if I had never received Delievery before. Manager was very rude and did not want to solve the problem. Very upset with the service and management.
