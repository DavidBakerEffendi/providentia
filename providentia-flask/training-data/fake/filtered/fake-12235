I've gone to co jones frequently for years and years.  We walked in last night and everything was different...the staff (no more Karl), no more TV and red sox Yankees fun, no more quirky restaurant, no more happy hour anything, no more bud Lights (when I said you don't have Bud Light anymore?  The bartender looked at me like I was an idiot), uummm and apparently no more old menu which all the reviews say the new one sucks too!!  Not ho mention the clump of hair and no clean knives (read other reviews)  Plus the floor is dangerously slippery....nice touch if you wana sue!  Never ever will go back!
