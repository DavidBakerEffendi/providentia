We have been going to this restaurant regularly for over 7 years and have never been disappointed. The food is fantastic, the service is always friendly and attentive, and the price is spectacular. My husband's favorite is the barbecued tuna over curried noodles. I have tried to make my way through the menu and I've never been disappointed. The Nam Sod appetizer is our favorite. We love that it's a BYOB and that on date night they let us take our time and never rush us. Highly recommend!!!
