We went to this restaurant to have a birthday celebration and without hesitation we can say that is is the worse service we ever had. The waiter, Victor was rude, did not help us at all, we had to call him everytime we needed something, His demeanor was the worse we ever came across. The food was NOT the best,and price does not agree with its quality and flavor also the order that we placed was incomplete as Victor forgot about it. This will be our last time at this place! Avoid this place at all cost!
