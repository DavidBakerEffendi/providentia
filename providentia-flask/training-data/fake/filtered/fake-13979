We were originally looking at other restaurants in close proximity, but they were all way too loud and didn't feel right when we walked in. Anyway. As soon as we walked into Barbuzzo we knew we had found the location we were looking for that evening. The menu looked good and the very friendly and competent staff made us feel very welcome. We shared a salad and a pizza - both fabulous choices. Prepped well, presented well and very delicious. It was a pleasure dining here.
