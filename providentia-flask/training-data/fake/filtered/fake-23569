well well well, after waiting over a week i finnally tried the SPOT. I WENT TO 33& ARCH on a mon. no truck, tues no truck, so i called and he said that the truck would be at 33rd & market on thurs. so i went for the 3rd time coming from delco and after 20 mins of looking for a parking spot i finally get to the window and order a cheese steak w prov, & onions salt & pepper, i didnt want to ruin it with any condiments. so i get back to my car and decided to eat it while it was still hot so i could form a honest opinion....so i opened it and for $8.50 it was very small, it was tasty, but for the price it was just a little more than average. so i decided to come back that fri. and try the burger, this time he was at 33rd & arch so i double park behind the truck, order a SPOT BURGER, SO AT $7 im thinking "this better be good" and again it was just ok, a little dry. i dont see how the avg. student could afford this more than once a week. i would eat there again, im just not in such a rush as i was
