Hudson Clearwater is New York's best kept secret.  A place where the pursuit of perfection was the only goal in mind and it shows.  I am tough critic, for my favorite restaurants in city are Gramercy Tavern and The Modern.  And finally, the god's must have answered my prayers and put a quality restaurant with reasonable prices near my residence. My favorite entrée is the crispy duck breast, an incredible experience.  Tender, moist, and not too rich, an anomaly.  There is nothing like it. My second favorite is the black seabass which I would describe as bold, yet mild. A delicious conundrum of the palate. And the lush potato cauliflower gratin will leave you breathless and wanting more.  For dessert, the apple tarte tatin.  This intricate little creation is to die for.  I am sure they have a special secret ingredient for this number. It has to be a teaspoon of sin because anything that tastes that good must be illegal.  On my last visit, I needed something to warm me up before my walk home and I indulged in one of their tantalizing cocktails, the Hot Stone Fence. This well played concoction gave the regular "Hot Tottie" a run for his money.  Simply delicious and I made it home without a shiver. The atmosphere is stellar and the service impeccable.  Due to my frequent visits I have been lucky enough to get to know the owners and they couldn't be more hospitable to myself and my guests each time we dine. This place is a rare gem in Manhattan.  A restaurant with an incredibly polished menu, beautiful design and a focus on quality food and ambiance.
