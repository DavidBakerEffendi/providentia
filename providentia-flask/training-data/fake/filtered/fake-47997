Dining at Our House Bistro is always a delight! The food is delicious and plentiful (often enough for several meals). My husband and I have made a weekend habit of trying the multitude of creative, filling mac and cheese entrees. Further, my one suggestion for this restaurant is in the interest of keeping it in business: lessen portion sizes along with prices. I have read many reviews featuring unhappy Our House customers complaining about the high prices and large portions. It may be wise to give the unhappy customers less to complain about while leaving the happy customers wanting more. That said, my husband and I truly adore the food and atmosphere of Our House. The service is always impecable and has improved over the few years we've been dining here. In fact, last friday we were particularly pleased with our waitress, Sarah, as she was incredibly attentive and brought to our table a sense of calm (impressive within the busy restaurant.) We are also continually impressed with the weekend hostess, a sociable, young-looking brunette, who seems to posses an uncanny ability to quote our wait time. On several occasions, we've returned to the restaurant after the duration of our wait to find our table just opening up. Amazing! Every restaurant has its faults, but Our House Bistro more than makes up for these with its wonderful food and service. Five stars!
