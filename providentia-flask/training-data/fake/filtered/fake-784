I recently moved to Crown Heights. Unfortunately in my 3-block radius there are no Delis. One day I dared to venture a few blocks further to Washington St. and found where they are hiding all the foodie goodness :P. Tom's always has a line in front of it in the mornings. But don't be scared. It is only a 5-10 minute wait. And get this, while you're waiting you are served - FREE coffee! - FREE oranges - FREE sausage The staff is very friendly. The prices are very fair (regular diner prices). I went here 3 times so far with my friends, and every time I received the best of service and amazing food. - The french fries have a very interesting texture to them. - Large selection of omelets. - All waffles/pancakes come with 3 types of flavored button (cinammon, strawberry, and I couldn't quite tell what the 3rd one was) The decor is very vintage. The walls are plastered with newspaper articles and famous people's autographs thanking Gus (the owner) for the amazing food and service. The only bad things is they don't accept credit cards (cries that he doesn't get his 3% LivingSocial points). But hey, it's worth it :) Also the bathroom occasionally has a wait
