BEWARE: Bad Management has Taken Over I have been to Sushi Yasuda a number of times, all for lunch, and enjoyed the fresh quality sushi.   I am disturbed, however, by the treatment we received the last time we went for lunch.  Like so many other times we have been there, we ordered the sushi lunch special.  We told our waitress, and the sushi chef.   However, when the bill came, they charged us for a la carte, which was more than twice the price of the special.  When we tried to explain, the manager was extremely rude.  He wouldn't allow us to speak, and kept threatening us that the sushi chef would have to pay for the mistake.   I have never seen this "manager" before, but I think he needs to be taught some manners on how to treat customers.  He was so rude I may never go back.  I heard that the ownership was changing hands - I hope this isn't a sign of the future.
