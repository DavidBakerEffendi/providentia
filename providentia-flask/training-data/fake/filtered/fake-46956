Had breakfast there.  Service was slow and server seemed to have an attitude.   Took a very ling time to take our order and when our food came things were missing.  Difficult to get the servers attention,  perhaps having Danny Meyers in the restaurant was too distracting for him. Food was soso.  Won't rush back.
