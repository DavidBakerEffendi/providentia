There are no words to describe dining experience at The Sea Fire Grill. Starting with front door and ending with the guys who take away your "shiny licked" plates. The food gets you to the heaven and service makes you feel royal. Special thank you to Albanian waiter Besfort( hope I spelled it right), manager Aron and of course the chef;)))
