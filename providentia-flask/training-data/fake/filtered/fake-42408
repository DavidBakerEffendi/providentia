it was my first time going to this restaurant. one of my co-workers has been coming here and suggested it. i wasn't expecting much but this place is delicious! the guacamole appetizer was really good. i couldn't stop eating them. the fajita was delicious. my friend had a fish taco and i'm not usually a fan of fish tacos but this was actually pretty good. the place is kind of small, i guess i can say it's cozy... good mexican food.
