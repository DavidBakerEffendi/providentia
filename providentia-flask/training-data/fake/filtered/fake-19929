I wish I discovered this place a while back! Â A unique rustic setting gives this place an amazing atmosphere - a casual but elegant setting with great food. I had the octopus and the short ribs, and both were amazing. My friends also all enjoyed all their food with the flatbread and the schnitzel standing out. It was a busy mid week night but the service was great, efficient and on point. They then suggested we have a drink at The Third Man which is another gem!
