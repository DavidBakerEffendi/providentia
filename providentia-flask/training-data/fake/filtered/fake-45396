SoCo's food is orgasmic! I had the blackened salmon, the mac and cheese and the wild strawberry moonshine. My boyfriend had the buttermilk fried chicken with the Mojito drink and we were so impressed with the food. I loved it so much that I was so tempted to lick my fingers! The ambiance was wonderful and the dj played all the r&b/neo-soul hits. I would reccomend Soco to everyone!
