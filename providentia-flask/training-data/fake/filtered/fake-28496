Biggest problem ?????? Anybody? Anybody? The bar stools, these things are brutal on your bottom. The drinks are good with a large selection of beers and a full bar. Food is pretty good, nice to snack on if your drinking. The meatballs are my favorite. I had the short rib burger and it was OK not good but not bad, fries were soggy. Services was good and the atmosphere is nice. I would suggest going in for a beer and seeing what you think. Bring a cushion.
