I agree with previous reviewers that the service here is only okay. However, the food is terrific and comes out shockingly fast (which is great if you're famished and can't be served fast enough, but not so good on those evenings you're hoping to relax and linger). I usually end up ordering the vegetarian meze sampler because it's so good; some of the meat dishes are tempting but overpriced. It's a good standby to have nearby.
