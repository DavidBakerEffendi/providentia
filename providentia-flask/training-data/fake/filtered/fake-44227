What Can I say......I LOVE those mobile Mexican Food Vans!!! I feel it is much authentic to most restaurants.....Im not saying that Mexican restaurants are not good....dont get me wrong...but sometimes they are too much "Americanized"...The same happens with many restaurant types such as Indian, Thai, etc. I've tried many of those vans. This is the best so far. Probably because I was so hungry! LOL....in any event...dont miss it. NOTE: it can be really spicy....as real Mexican food. Enjoy!
