consistently great, fresh  food and cheap. Fun to sit with others who appreciate the food,  price and people from all over the world. once you try it you dont want to go anywhere else. 14th st is just as good and the  people interaction is starting as the place gets busier and busier. I wish she would open  other locations  --- Brooklyn maybe?? Thanks for your years of quality food  and pleasant staff
