I ate lunch at Max Brenner today and had just a so-so experience.  First of all, our waitress didn't visit our table until a good 20 minutes had past.  The managers noticed and did their best to fix the situation, but still no apology from the waitress once she did appear.  The food was pretty good, but I don't think it was worth the price.  I had the roasted tomato pizza.  I liked it, but for the price I'd rather grab a pizza at Du Jour over on Broad St.  My companion had a burger that he also liked.  I was surprised that he didn't get more fries.  Again, for the price plus $2 I could have gone to Butcher and Singer for a superior burger, too many fries, and great service.  Dessert was delicious, so good I couldn't even tell you how much it cost.  We split an Ivory Heart.  Amazing.  In the future I would go here just for dessert and hope I don't get the same waitress.
