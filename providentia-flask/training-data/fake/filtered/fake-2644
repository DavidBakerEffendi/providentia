The BEST rice bowl i have ever had by a long shot - I ordered shrimp bowl with rice. it was sweet, salty, spicy and ooooh so good. My taste buds were literally having a dance in my mouth. Thanks Chef! Â My daughter had a veggie bowl with salad and enjoyed hers just as much. You have to try this food.
