Have been going to the is restaurant for years.  It has totally gone down hill.  What you see is what you get as far as food, ambience, staff and location.  The food was just average and way over priced. The ambience has not changed in over 20 years that I have been going there.  Well the staff is much like the neighborhood, inner city and low class.  Will do just about anything for a tip.
