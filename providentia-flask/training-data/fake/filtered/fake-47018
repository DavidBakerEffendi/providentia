Someone said "served by Chinese speaking people." well, yes, there is a significant population of ethnically Chinese people in Malaysia, and so the food represented here is of that population- its like Chinese meets Malay meets Indian.  Most of the wait staff is from Malaysia and speak several dialects of Chinese and Malay if you asked them (although it might be years since they may have spoken it.)   This is my FAVORITE place to eat- and I have noticed the huge crowds of Penn students.  Go away Penn students.  No one wants you and your byo drunken yelling and taking up 80% of the restaurant.   Having been to Malaysia and eaten many times with my extended Malaysian family, I can tell you that the fast service and quick clearing of tables is just how they do it.  You run in, you eat, and then everyone jumps up suddenly and Im like what just happened!?  Dont take offense, its cultural! :)
