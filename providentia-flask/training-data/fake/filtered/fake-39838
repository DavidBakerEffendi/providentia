What a truly wonderful spot.  The service was top notch (he even took the wrapper from my opened up my chopsticks), the decor is warm and inviting, and the food was excellent.  I had the house recommended noddle soup with roasted pork, broccoli rabe, and lump crab meat.  Everything was light, but filling for a bowl of soup and I found myself spooning the left over broth in at the end.  On top of it all, the prices were more than reasonable and the menu has something for everyone.  I will definitely be back.
