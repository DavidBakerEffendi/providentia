I went to Landmarc with a couple of girlfriends for lunch this week.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich, with roasted peppers, caramelized onions, and smoked mozzarella.  It was great food, with fair service (our waiter was being trained at the time of our visit). Unfortunately, like many places in Tribeca, the fare was overpriced.  Potions were generous, but $15 for a grilled chicken sandwich is a little rich for my blood.   An overall pleasing experience
