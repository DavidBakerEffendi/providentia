I only tried their Cuban sandwich since it was "voted best in NYC" and had really high expectations of it. However, it wasn't as great as I thought it would be and I was kind of disappointed. This place was kind of missable, even though it was on the corner. There wasn't any big signs and I didn't see it, until my friend pointed it out for me. This place gets crowded most of the time and they had no fans/AC. They leave the door open, but I guess the heat was bearable? I might come again, just for the famous Mexican Corn. However, their menu is decently priced especially around this area in the city.
