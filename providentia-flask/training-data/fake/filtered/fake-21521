Thank you, Thank you Michael, Abdul & Kenneth! I had the pleasure of attending their soft launch on Tuesday and was beyond impressed.   From their well thought out drink menu, to their hospitable nature, to their hilarious house rules, these guys have definitely created a gem in TriBeca. Attention ladies! They have these cool rotating hooks for your handbags at the bar.  What a cool feature!  Usually my handbag hits my leg the whole night- with this feature you can have your handbag rest to the left or right of your leg versus the front.   Oh and my favorite house rule:  Respect our neighbors and the neighborhood.   In other words- if you are douchey, please do not come here and be loud and obnoxious.   Last tip- be sure to try the Moroccan Martini! Now if I could only find a place like this in San Francisco.
