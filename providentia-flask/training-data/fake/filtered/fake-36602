I love this place. Their Meatloaf sandwich is incredible -- the seafood is incredible, full of flavour (better than the fish, which is also really good). The are just perfect, and the hummus is amazing. it is great that leftovers work perfectly (I heat them the next day, and they keep well). This is also the NICEST man (owner?) in the world. He walks you to the door when you are done, and checks in with you all the time to make sure you are happy. The other day, we sent a relative to pick up 3 orders, and he didn't have cash with him -- the owner sent him home with the food, without paying (we went back right after and paid!). I have been going here for months now. Their Meatballs with Mash is fantastic, as is the chive. Next time, be sure you try it,
