We went for my husband's 50th bday. It was a surprise for him. I picked this place because I needed something close to the airport as my son flew in that night.  What a gem! They were fantastic with my family that came from MA, NJ, VA.  The place is small but boy did they deliver with amazing food!  For apps we had eggplant parm so good, grilled calamari with a seasoned olive oil to dip (never had it grilled) really delicious, mussels also a big hit!   The lobster ravioli, and chicken parm were amazing.  I ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi in an asiago thyme sauce OMG was that the best gnocchi I ever had.  They melted in my mouth.  I made everyone taste it!  They let me bring a cake and its BYOB!!
