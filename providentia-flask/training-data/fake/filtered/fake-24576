Love this restaurant! Awesome place to go with family because the portions are huge - just the way I like it :) The wait can be kind of crazy even if you have reservations. Be prepared to eat and drink lots. The last time I went with a group of 15 we only ordered 4 dishes and there were still a good amount of left over food. Not a very intimate place to have dinner, it can be kind of loud and hectic depending on what nights you go.
