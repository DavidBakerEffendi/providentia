A friend and I met here for lunch, and OMG...I'm offically hooked.  We sat outside on the patio and it was adorable.  I think during the warmer months, sitting on the patio with a bottle of wine (BYOB...can't beat that!) would be a perfect date night.  My friend had the pear ravioli and I had the gnocchi bolognese and both were delicious.  I live locally so I am just looking for an excuse to go back asap.
