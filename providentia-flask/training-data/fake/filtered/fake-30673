This place used to be amazing, but the menu change from a few months ago still leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  This used to be our go-to place in the neighborhood for drinks and great, inexpensive food, but so many of our favorite food items were taken away. The new menu is smaller and less of the typical bar-fare everyone loved here.  Service has been shaky the past few times I was here as well, when this never used to be a problem.  For instance, my friend and I only ordered 2 things to share - the nachos with chili and wings in hot sauce. Instead we got nachos with chicken and the wings with bbq sauce. We told our waitress and got no apologies or offering to fix the situation. Finally I asked for a little chili on the side for the nachos, and when it finally arrived 15 minutes later we had eaten most of the nachos anyway.  Bummer. Still giving this place 3 stars because it's still a great place for drinks.  Great beer selection and casual, friendly atmosphere.  I love sitting at a table outside and having some unique craft beers with friends.
