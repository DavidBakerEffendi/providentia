I have been coming to Bella since it's original location on Bloomfield Ave. in Clifton where we used to wait on line for an hour to get in standing in a narrow hallway..well it's long moved out of that location and many will say that the quality of the food has gone way down. That may be true to a certain degree but Bella still has the best Italian food hands down. The Chicken Scarpiello is the best I have ever had, either on or off the bone. I am also a fan of the Chicken Francaise. The salad you get before the entreee is simple but flavorful. I do miss the old servers, most of them are gone. We used to have Coco serve us who was with them for years and years and she is gone. When we go out for Italian it's BELLA OR BUST. In my opinion it is the only Italian worth spending my hard earned money.
