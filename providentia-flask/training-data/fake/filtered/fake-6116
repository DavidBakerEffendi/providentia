We were on our way out for pizza with our 3 and 5 year old but plans changed and we ended up at Daltos, a favorite for their chicken parm and penne vodka.  As always great meal and exceptional service.  One of the owners went out of his way to get apple juice for my 3 year old at the store around the corner.  How do I know he bought it for my son?  I went to the store to buy my son a drink but didn't have to because the owner was there buying it. Make sure you call ahead for a weekend reservation buts Tuesday night was open for a very hungry family.
