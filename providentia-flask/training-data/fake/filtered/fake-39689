I have been going here with my parents since I was a little kid. This is the best and most authentic Malaysian restaurant you will find in NYC. I have ate in numerous other restaurants, and nothing is as outstanding or taste as good as this restaurant. Anyone that is into Malaysian cuisine, this is a must try!
