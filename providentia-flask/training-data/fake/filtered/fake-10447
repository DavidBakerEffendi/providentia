I've been here a couple times for drinks, and once for a craft Sunday which was kind of fun, but my review is mainly to post about the food. I decided to try the vegan burger on a Wednesday night since it was the weekly special and it was probably one of the best vegan burgers I've ever had. Add a side of tots and it was a delicious greasy meal. Now that I know about it I have to control myself from stopping by every week. One negative point is that you can't get the special prices if you do take-out so expect to pay full price if you're not planning on eating there. Not really sure what the reasoning is behind that. As a bar, the atmosphere downstairs is a little too bright for my taste but I tend to like anything that resembles a dive bar to be a little more dark and divey. I'll go back and try more food items in the future I'm sure, but in terms of a drinking place it's not necessarily where I would choose to go first. It would be really great if they added more couches and lounging areas downstairs so it felt a little more comfortable and eliminated some of the tables and chairs, but since I haven't been there on peak nights maybe all of those are needed. All in all it's a good place for vegan and non-vegan bar food options but not the true drinking dive bar that I'm searching for in this city.
