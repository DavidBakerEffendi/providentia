Simple, clean and elegant food. . .they really pay attention to the details.  I have been there several times, often by myself but sometimes with a boatload of friends, and I have yet to been disappointed.  The roast pork/broccoli rabe sandwich is the bomb!  My friend loved her arugula, grilled peach salad. . . the proscuitto really was a nice salty contrast to the sweetness of the peaches. All in all, a great addition to the neighborhood and if they get some beer in house, I might have to change my address.
