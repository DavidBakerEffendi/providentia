This place is an amusement park of fresh sushi being made on the spot (I'm assuming only during peak hours though).  The food is all pretty damn good too.   Some bland dishes here and there but that's the downside of buffets, generally. Also, as others have said, most of the food isn't labeled, which I can deal with as an adventurous eater, but I'd like to know some of what I'm diving in to.
