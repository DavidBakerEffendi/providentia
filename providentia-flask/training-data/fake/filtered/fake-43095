The food was decent, but being of Indian descent, not anything extraordinary.  But, my main turnoff there was that we saw rodents...yes, 2 mice in the dining room upstairs running from one side to another.  This was about a year ago - maybe they have fixed the problem since then, but I will not be returning.
