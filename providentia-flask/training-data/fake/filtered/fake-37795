Just came back from Rybread on Fairmount and N23 st. FANTASTIC! If you're looking for the alternative sandwich in philadelphia, this place has got it. The approach as a restaurant is creative/inspiring. Friendly staff, short wait in a longish line... Yes, I will be going back often, although I wish I were paying less, but hey... I bet the employees and owners say that about their favorite restaurants so its no cause for a mark down. Five stars all the way, I will be going back soon.
