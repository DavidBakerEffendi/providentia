The first time I heard about Mama Mary's was from several co-workers; they'd been many times before and constantly raved about the food and service! I finally had the opportunity to experience their food when I was in charge of finding a local restaurant to cater a regional conference I was organizing....and it was great! There were about 30 people at the conference and the catfish, cornbread and mac & cheese all went fast and were a hit with everyone in attendance (which included people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds)! The staff at the restaurant was very patient with us in organizing the payment for catering. I would definitely recommend them for all of your New Haven area catering needs! I've been the restaurant three or four times and the service and food have been great each and every time! I've never waited more than 15 minutes for my meal, even when coming in during the weekend. The food has always been hot and flavorful, with portions large enough to have some to take home along with a slice from one of Sabrina's desserts!
