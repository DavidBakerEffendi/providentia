Come here every time I'm in the city.  Even when I wasn't originally planning anything near Prince.  Always the same thing too.  Cafe con leche, roast pork, and  sweet plantains.  For how far away from Cuba NY really is, I love how authentic they keep the menu.  The service is excellent, and they have always been very nice.  Just do not go if you are claustrophobic or do not like noise as there is a lot of that.  But if you like a good time with friends and good food, this is your place.
