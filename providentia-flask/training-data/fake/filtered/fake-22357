Cool diner atmosphere - Certainly unusual for a Lao/Thai place! The waitress here had no problem identifying vegan options, which I appreciated. I settled on egg-less Pad Thai, whereas my Mom opted for the yellow curry with shrimp. The food came out quickly, but I found the flavors of my dish to be under-whelming for the price we paid. The tofu was very squishy. My mom enjoyed her dish, however, so maybe it's just not the best place to go for a vegetarian meal! Overall, this isn't my favorite place for Thai food in the area, but it was alright. They do have a wonderful little garden growing out back. I wonder if they grow some of their ingredients there?
