Service was bad. All the servers were a young kids playing with each other. The mini appetizer was good, however, the pabellon was very plane. Needed way more seasoning and salt. The black beans are sweet, which in my opinion it was a big shock (and I am from Vzla). If they've been salty it would've been much better. I was very excited to eat here but left a very disappointed.
