I was looking forward to trying a Babaganoush Falafel sandwich. Some of my friends from the office walked over 10 blocks to find the Crisp truck - after walking in the smoldering hot weather and not finding the truck, they decided to go into the Crisp rest. on 40th St. From what they told me, they encountered a very unpleasant, uncooperative and dismissive employee by the name of Ian. He was Â offensive and completely lacking customer service skills. They ordered crisps and falafel sandwiches, but Ian ended up giving them falafel burgers. When they brought it up to his attention, instead of apologizing for his mistake and rectifying the situation, he became very dismissive and argumentative. One of the workers there realized what was happening and wanted to re-do everything the right way, as initially ordered, however, Ian jumped in and aggressively stopped the process. Although shocked and very disappointed, my friends tried to calmly explain to him once again that it was his mistake and that he misunderstood the orders - he simply refused to listen to them. cumstomer satisfaction was clearly not on his priority list.. Needless to say, my friends are very unhappy with today's experience and so am I. They brought me back something I did not order, but what Ian decided to give me... a very small burger (instead of a falafel sandwich).. It had very little Babaganoush that one could barely even taste it and it was so small that I now have to go buy something else to eat - it was the size of a snack... Way to go, Ian!!! We will never again come to Crisp because of you. I hope you did your manager and Crisp owners very proud today.. Hungry and hugely disappointed
