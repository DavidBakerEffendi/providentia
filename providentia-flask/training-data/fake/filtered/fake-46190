Wow, it's jam packed all the time!! However, my friend recommended this place, the ambiance is good and the food is okay. I had the Akamaru modern ramen..it really swills my palate! The broth was flavorful and really hot - which is what I like about my soup. I looked like an idiot, though, I think I burned my tongue and I kept on blowing on it LOL!
