Went to Matthew's for my mother-in-law's birthday and was very pleased. The food was excellent so was the atmosphere. Met matthew the owner a very friendly person and so was his staff. The meal from appetizers to dessert was excellent, the service was first class. My mother-in-law who is Italian is very fussy about Italian food was very pleased with everything and she can be very hard to please, she loved the sauce which she said was very well made and had a lot of flavor. We left Matthew's very pleased with everything and have every intention of going back in the near future.
