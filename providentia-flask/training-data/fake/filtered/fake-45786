Last night my husband and I along with another couple decided to try Max Fish in Glastonbury for the first time - we were mortified! While the attention to our reservation was overly thorough (two phone calls and an email that day), both the meal and the atmosphere were disappointing. The appetizers (mussels, Greek salad, Caesar salad, mix salad) were OK but the entrees - the stars of the show - were very disappointing. The poached fish was the worst. Our friend eats fish most of the time and was puzzled by the whole meal. It was a soggy soup of overdone vegetables and some drowned trout finally located at the bottom of the bowl. The "San Francisco" cioppino wasn't San Francisco style at all. It was more like a bouillabaisse - no pasta and no spicy zing. It was just a pile of seafood with nothing to give it character. The black cod with honey mustard was satisfactory but the amount of bok choy, chewy and thick, was unbecoming to the rest of the dish. The pan seared scallops were certainly tasty but not overwhelming in amount. As to the atmosphere, the noise was highly intrusive. Perhaps noise is something the Max group cultivates to give the feeling of great popularity but restaurant sounds need to be properly harnessed to provide both quiet and social settings. Clatter and chatter might be fine for the Shark Bar area but we sought an intimate dining experience and were mightily disappointed. In closing, you need to provide quality product not just window dressing if you want repeat business. We never mind paying the premium for sophisticated eating but this was poor performance. We will not return.
