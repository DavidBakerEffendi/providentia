Ordered the family platter: Roast duck, calamari in black bean sauce and the pork chops. Everything was sitting in a puddle of grease. The calamari was pure rubber. The waitstaff is obnoxious. They tried to overcharge us $10 and were condescending when we pointed it out. They never gave us our soup either. I can't find a good Chinese restaurant in the Parsippany area but this one is by far the worst. SKIP IT!
