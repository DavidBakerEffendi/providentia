This past Saturday night I went to the Stone Terrace for a holiday get together and I was impressed beyond my wildest imagination.  The food was "Outstanding"!!! I was very impressed with the new design of the bar, restaurant, and banquet rooms, being I am and was familiar with this facility for quite a many years.  Service was right on, it seems as if our servers understood our every need.   I cannot say enough about how good an experience it was and should you need a catering hall for an event or some food to eat or drink, I definitely recommend going to the Stone Terrace! Good Luck John & Joe, you have done a wonderful job, keep going!!
