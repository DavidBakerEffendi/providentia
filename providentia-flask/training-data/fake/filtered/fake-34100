My husband & I went to this restaurant for our anniversary. Both of us wanted to try the restaurant, saw good reviews. I called to make a reservation for 7:00 was told they could do 6:30 or 8:00, so we took 6:30. Â When we got to the restaurant there were alot of empty tables, through our entire time there, not sure why we could have came at 7:00. When we were seated the wine glass was dirty. Someone gave us the menu, waiter came a few minutes later, and took our drink order. We waited for 25 minutes for him to take our dinner selection. We ordered Tapas, and entrees. After awhile one Tapas was brought out, we expected the other to come shortly, but it never did, then our entrees were brought out. My husband ordered the Paella,very disappointed, the seafood was burnt and fishy tasting. We asked someone to have our waiter come over, since we really never saw him after we ordered. He came and took back the dish. After we told him we never received the 2nd Tapas, a few minutes later here it comes, had this been sitting there the entire time. Not a good experience for us I would not recommend this to anyone, very bad service and the food was not what we expected.
