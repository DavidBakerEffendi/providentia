Zinc trys to hard to be inventive, with their food falling short under their high prices. Not only was the food terrible, the staff was incrediably rude, not only to me but to one another. I could see and hear some heavy set woman (who i believe to be the head chef) screaming at our waiter. Soon after, another lady (who appeared to be the owner or manager) was repremanding him right in front of our table; when he was the the best thing from our experience at Zinc. There is a time and place to repremand and set rules, and it should not be done in front of or in the durration of you guest's dinner. If this is the way this establishment is run, may I please suggest getting a enclosed kitchen. No one wants to be part of your resaturant's drama or be made to feel uncomfortable when they are paying good money to relax and enjoy themselves. Viewers, please save yourself the trouble and do not go to zinc, unless you want to sit in a room colorized by a somber, modern, depression of tasteless hosility. This was by far my worst New Haven, CT restaurant experience and the biggest waste of money to date.
