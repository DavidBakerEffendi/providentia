An absolute must for those who love hot and spicy or vegetarian cuisine.  The menu selection is mainly vegetarian although meat and seafood dishes are available as well.  A great restaurant for a meal with the family or a romantic dinner for two.  The wait staff are very helpful and order can be customized for those selections that you want extra spice or none at all.  They have a varied wine list, although anything more than five selections is varied to this novice, full bar and a lounge area for meeting for cocktails before a get together.   I have been there on three separate occasions and have always had a very pleasant dining experience.  Reservations are a must, call early for special events like Valentines day, as even bad weather will not keep the faithful away from this gem.
