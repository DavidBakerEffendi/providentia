I will never order or go to this diner again.  I went with my husband and son.  The server was overwhelmed with just 3 tables.  She took her time to take our order.  When she brought the water glasses there was a fly in mine, she said it was a coffee ground.  I was starving so I stayed and I ordered the steak and there was a hair on the plate.  The server told the manager and he never came over, they did take it off the bill but gave no apology.  Worst service I had ever seen in Bayonne.
