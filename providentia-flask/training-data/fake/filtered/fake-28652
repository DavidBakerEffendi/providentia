Food is great but service us horrific.  Called an order in at 6:00 requesting pickup at 7:00.  Dinner for one so not too difficult.  Arrived a bit early and fine that food wasn't ready.  However far from happy when I didn't get my food until 7:18.  Got home and the free dessert for aggravation was there but not my soup.  I called and asked that they use their restaurant can to drive the 1.2 miles and drop it off, was told that they don't deliver.  Told the that since it was not close to the first time their take out was wrong, they could keep my soup money and lose my business.  They did.
