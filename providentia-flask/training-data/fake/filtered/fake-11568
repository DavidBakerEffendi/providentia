I was very excited about this new Japanese izakaya style restaurant around my neighbor and decided to try  for the first time. Are those ratings for real or were they there drunk?  The fried chicken with eggplant $7.99 was soggy, greasy with NO flavor...drenched in saltier than salt soy sauce with scallions.  There was no flavor to this easy dish but plain salty. I can cook better than this at home. a small bottle of sake ($9.99) I ordered hot was served lukewarm. It was same temperature even after I asked the server to warm it up more.  I guess his 1 minute microwave didn't do the job. Considering not many customers in the store the service was very slow. I seldom get disappointed by Japanese eatery but this place is a major disappointment.
