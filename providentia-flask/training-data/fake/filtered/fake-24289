Went with my boyfriend and friend because I was attrached to the interior everytime I walked by. Its very dark and cozy, with cute decorations and would make a good place for a date. Our waiter was brand new so he was a huge dud, and had 0 idea what he was talking about...for example, when we ordered fries and wings as an appetizer and only the wings came out, I asked him for the fries, and he had no idea what I was talking about and said they didnt have fries on the menu (when there clearly was). Besides the waiter's first day stupidies, the food was very good. The wings were crispy and came with a spicy dipping sauce. I got the papaya noodle pad thai, which is not on the online menu. Originially, our waiter messed up my papaya pad thai with my bf's regular pad thai and we almost could not tell which was which by taste alone. Each pad thai was excellent. My friend got the pork rice and loved it as well. Portions were on the smaller size, and if those increased, for the prices, I would definitely return again and again.
