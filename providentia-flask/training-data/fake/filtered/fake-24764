To start, this place is not very big,  but upon arriving with my group of 7, they were very accommodating for us! The wait was around 20-30 mins, but we had a drink at Von (right next door)  while we waited! and the hostess went in there to let us know the table was ready! Then the meal: they were on point with their service, calamari was the best I ever had, and the pasta was incredible. I had the lamb chop special,  which was perfect. I will def come back, but maybe with a date instead. :) PS: YOU NEED TO GET DESSERT
