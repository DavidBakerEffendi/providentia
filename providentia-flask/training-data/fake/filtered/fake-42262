Very bad customer services. If you don't speak the dialect as the owner does, never bother to order food at Prosperity, you will not get serve and respectfully as the local residents who shares the same background as the owner. I went there three times only, but the services I received are getting worse every time. Not only my wonton soup is missing a wonton, it was a bowl of clear broth with no scallion to light up the taste at all. The third and last time I went (which happened to be today,) I was waiting on this line and when it was finally my turn, these two new walk-in came, and they just cut the line and told the guy what they want in their home dialect. The owner and his assistant started packing and bagging for these late comers. And I was standing there looking at the owner confronting him that him just let people skipped a line. He looked me back but didn't bother to make a response, all he was doing was gave me a glance or two and kept packing his order. I was very disappointed of their services. There are three more places in Chinatown I could get good dumplings beside this crept place, like Dumpling House located on Eldridge St too. Will not recommend this place.
