Food is good but quality and service varies with how busy.  Prices are a bit high since they moved to Totowa as they lost their liquor license, it's BYO now.  Have been patron for quite a while but when asked to reserve a table(it was our anniversary) the answer was we only take reservations for parties of 8 or larger??   My wife and I have found an alternate restaurant in the area and have made Nicola's our 2nd if not our 3rd choice for Italian dining.
