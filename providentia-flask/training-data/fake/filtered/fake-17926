My husband and I went there for Valentine's Day yesterday and the food and service were amazing. We had a reservation and we did not wait to be seated for no longer than 5 minutes even though we were 15 minutes early for the reservation. We had the pan seared scallops and roasted red beets for the appetizer and they were very good. The risotto special with crabmeat, truffle oil and mushrooms and the linguine special with shrimp and crabmeat for the main course were phenomenal. We did not have room for dessert but they still gave us fried zeppolis on the house at the end. They cleared our plates quickly and had our glasses full all the time. All in all this place is exceptional!!!! We will definitely come back.
