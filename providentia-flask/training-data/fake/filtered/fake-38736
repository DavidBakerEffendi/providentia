Accidentally came across this restaurant walking back to our hotel after having a great (fun) meal. No name on the building or the door - just a FORK. Looked at the menu and was captivated. Thankfully my bosses though it would be a good choice, and off we went! I have never in my life SAVORED every mouthful of food as I did tonight. Perfectly delightful! Everything I ate was a culinary pleasure! I have only a few complaints - seating was TIGHT...I was becoming very friendly with the person who chair was up against mine. Two, the noise level - they need a couple more "barriers" to keep the noise level down. Service was great. Ambiance and decor was great. Just an overall memorable dinner.
