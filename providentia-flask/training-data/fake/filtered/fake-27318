Loved it! Dinner at Park Avenue Tavern was a great experience. The food, drinks, ambience and service were all top notch. The highlights were the pork chop and tuna nicoise. Our server Matthew made excellent recommendations - we enjoyed the wine suggestion and every dish was exactly as described. He was also really fun. We also enjoyed a drink at the bar while we waited for our friends, and the bartender Lee was lovely and mixed a fine drink.
