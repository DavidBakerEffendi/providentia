2nd Story is a great addition to Old City.  The beers stack up to any of the more established Philadelphia area microbrews and the food and atmosphere make the overall experience that much more enjoyable. I recommend the Evolve IPA, but you can't really go wrong with any of their house beers.  The beer flights are a good value and nice option for trying the rotating taps.   Although I prefer to stick with the house beers, I was glad to see the menu included specialty cocktails, other micro-brews and familiar imports.  You can go with a crowd and feel confident that even the non beer drinkers will enjoy their experience. As far as the food, my wife and I both ordered the 2nd Story burger and we were both pleased.  We felt like the quality of the food matched the quality of the beers.
