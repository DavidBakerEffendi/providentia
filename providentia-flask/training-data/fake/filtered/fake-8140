Overall, this is a nice joint, but the SERVICE WAS AWFUL. Food: We had the veggie arepas and quesadilla.  Both were excellent, though the portions were a bit small.  Unlike most Mexican food I've had, these dishes were light and complex, not heavy handed.  The beer and drinks list was also good, as were the chips/guac. Service: Our server took forever to come to us to take our order, then left halfway through the order because she became impatient with us.  Then, she didn't come back until the end of the meal, even though we needed more drinks, etc..  I had to ask the bus boy to help us several times.   The food was great, but the service was so bad I won't go back.
