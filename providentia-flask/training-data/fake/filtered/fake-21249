Great addition to the ethnic options in Sunset Park. The Turkish meatballs are sublime, and everything is very fresh and not the least bit greasy. The place is small, but cozy, and the owner Murat is incredibly welcoming. You feel like you're having dinner at the house of a friend who happens to be a great cook. Bonus: everything is incredibly cheap, with no one dish hitting the double digits.
