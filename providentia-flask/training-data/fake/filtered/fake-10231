I have NEVER had a bad time at Bar - it's also the first place I bring out-of-towners to experience the best things New Haven has to offer. First and foremost, the pizza is just delicious.  But it's also my favorite place to party come Friday/Saturday night.  $2 wells/domestics from 10pm-11pm, and $2 pizza slices from 11pm-closing...get silly early in the night and then sober up with great food and dancing for the next 3 hours until the drive home! Also, no cover before ~9/9:30 on the weekends and free coat check.  Win all around!  Nothing comes close to Bar in all of New Haven.
