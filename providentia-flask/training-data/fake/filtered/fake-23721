After reading a blog which stated the Spotted Pig was one not to miss, I made plans to visit. It was a Wednesday night and heaving! Best to arrive early and get yourself a table/spot at the bar before the place gets extremely busy. They don't take recommendations so it's a case of pitching up and chancing your luck. I was very lucky the host got me a spot at the bar and made sure I was looked after, I think she took pity on me as I was travelling alone, I ordered the burger which was incredible and a few cocktails, very reasonably priced too! I will definitely visit again when I return to New York.
