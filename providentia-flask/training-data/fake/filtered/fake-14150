I only made a yelp account so I could give this restaurant five stars.  I have tried nearly everything on their lunch special menu and have never been disappointed.  I especially love their gyu don lunch box and sushi rolls.  The prices are great, and they have special discounts for Jefferson students and faculty.   The service is what makes this place stand out from any other restaurant I have ever been to.  The owner is so friendly to all his guests and personally thanks them for coming.  Every once in a while he'll whip up an extra ice cream or kimchee fries for his customers.  For my friend's birthday, he not only bought happy birthday balloons as table centerpieces, but also handed out four plates of kimchee fries on the house.  FOUR PLATES.  The waiters/waitresses are all very courteous as well.   This is definitely one of the best sushi/japanese places around town, especially for their lunch specials (although their specialty rolls are heavenly as well). I highly recommend it!
