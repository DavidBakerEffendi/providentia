I am pleased to have an opportunity to write about a business I have found to provide high quality service at all levels.  Cravings provides DELICIOUS food! and GREAT service.  Over the years, I have ordered from finger foods to cold/hot lunches to dinner.  I have not been disappointed.  My guests have been different and they too have only praised the caterer.   The staff is wonderful, they also have the knack of making a drab space look great as they display the food.  If you have not tried Cravings, I say it is a must do for your catering needs. Thank you Marisa and the crew for your great cooking ability and courteous service!
