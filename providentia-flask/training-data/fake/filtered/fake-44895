Loved Emporio!  My boyfriend and I stopped by to try their pizza after a friend recommended them.  And OMG, we were not in the least disappointed! The ambiance was awesome, very low key and romantic/intimate.  The skylight was a really cool touch!  Our pizzas were made right in front of us, which was cool to watch.  I had the Prosciutto pizza and my bf had the yummy Margarita.  We loved them and devoured every last bite! We also shared a dessert, it was a tiramisu but it had strawberries, really delicious, like nothing I'd seen before. This isn't your typical white tablecloth spaghetti Italian restaurant.  There are many classic Italian dishes but also innovative ones that will leave you wanting more.  I want more!!!
