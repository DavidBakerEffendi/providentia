Went there for lunch on Sat. hoping to avoid going there in the evening and having to wait for a table. Started with the kale salad then straight to the appetizers. All the appetizers sampled were amazing but too bad they didn't have the shishito peppers. My top three favorites were the brussell sprouts, fried eggplant and salt and pepper chicken wings. The miso broth was quite delicious and the noodles were cooked just right. If I have it again, I'm going to ask for the soft boil egg in the soy broth instead. Had to pass on the green tea ice cream but my partner was more than happy to take my share. Price is reasonable and cheap compared to going into NY. Staff and service was efficient and friendly. Â  You have to try this place, I think you'll enjoy it.
