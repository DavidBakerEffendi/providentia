Been to this place many times! Superb food. Anjappar is the place you can go with a big family and order so many tasty items. The chicken lollipops is so tasty and the prawn too good, we enjoyed the mutton biriyani and the thali meals. Â We ordered porottas with gravy. the spice and taste was perfect. I just hear anjappar has just been opened in new york city. really excited to go there. congrats anjappar!
