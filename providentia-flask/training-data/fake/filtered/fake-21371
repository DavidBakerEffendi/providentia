I'm not sure where Alicia actually went, but it surely was a different place than I was in. Hanging at Tavern on Tuesday my friend and I decided to try this place out. We walked in to a book signing. That's right folks, the owner's idea of a great time is a book signing. Wow is right. We ordered an appetizer to try that consisted of four poppers. For six bucks, you'd think they might have given us something made fresh. Heck for this proce I can go eat oysters at M&S any weeknight (gotta luve that buckashuck!) Nada - out of the deep fryer and into a bowl. The rest of the menu reflects similar options - mozzeralla sticks, pot stickers. Bleah. The regulars looked like someone brough the island of misfit toys to life. that someone was the owner, some Fred Flintstone looking dude with a bad dye job. Think I'm exagerating? Check him out. Classy too as he spent most of his night talking to some blond bag lady who apparently worked for him. Apparently they hump. What a treat that must be. The bartenders were pleasant but there is no draft beer, and overall the place is pretty small. Alicia, I hope they paid you well for your review. So to quote a song that was playing on the sad jukebox; Â 'Just walk on by' and head up to the Tavern, at least you'll have a decent drink, a place to stand or sit, and a great restaurant in the basement
