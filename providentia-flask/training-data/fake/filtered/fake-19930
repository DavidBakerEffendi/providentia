Have fallen for this place! Edi and the Wolf rocks with its unique decor and warm atmosphere! Me and my girls went there for a dinner on Sunday night and it was full house yet cosy. The food was great too - try their clams! omg best clams I've ever tried so far!!! Our waitress Jenna was really nice and quick. As if she was reading my mind whenever I was about to order another wine spritzer she was there already serving me one! No doubt I would recommend it for a dinner to my friends.
