My husband and I recently went to Grimaldi's with some friends and family.  We had out of town guests visiting from Italy and they wanted to try "our" pizza.  While we went for the pizza what we got was so much more than anticipated.  I had a ginger and grapefruit margarita for starters and the rest of our group had a variety of beverages including  a cucumber martini, chianti and imported beer.   We all had different ideas of what we wanted on our pizza but it didn't matter.  The suggestions that were made to us were so appealing, we just let the waiter bring us his suggestions. After a platter of meats, cheeses and olives, we had a focaccia to die for. The hot wings were excellent!   But the pizza.....each one better than the next, was what had our mouths watering.  We had prosciutto and mozzerella, clam, shrimp marinara, zucchini pesto and a sausage and spinach. We asked for our pizzas to be double-cut so that evetyrone could try a piece of each pie.  Each pizza was excellent but  I think my favorite was the prosciutto.  The staff are so friendly and their suggestions were awesome.  We would not have thought of some of their pizza suggestions.   We even finished off with a Nutella pizza with  espresso and cappuccino.   We are definitely going back and will be bringing more people with us. We went for the pizza, what we got was an eating experience with family and friends who all left feeling great.   Thank you Grimaldi's!
