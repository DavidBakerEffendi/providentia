Jacobs Pickles is about as good as it can get. The service was wonderful and the food even better (if possible). We came in on a very busy Thursday night a few weeks ago. While we saw multiple parties go on a wait list, my boyfriend and I were greeted by two very cheery host/hostess. The two of them informed us a table was being cleared off and would be ready shortly. The guy started asking us about if we'd visited before and giving us recommendations. He informed us of the extensive beer list and the other hostess walked us to our table cheerfully. Which is rare for hostesses. The blonde hostess made sure we liked our table and even pulled out our chairs. So sweet. We were in the back portion of the restaurant which is very homey and cozy. We were greeted immediately with water. Our waiter, Sarah, was very nice and accommodating. She was very knowledgable about both the beer list and menu. We got a few beers and an order or fried pickles to start. They were incredible. To eat we got the BLT sandwich and burger. Now I never order burgers from nice places but this one was a hit. It was slow cooked and very juicy. Not to mention the pickles on top were a hit. My sandwich was a perfect blend of indulgent and southern comfort. I'm originally from West Virginia and these grits were better than any I'd ever had. I'll definitely come back to JPs. Definitely a must!
