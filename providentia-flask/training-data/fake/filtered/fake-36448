Screw Casa Mono. I've been here about 3 or 4 times a year (and it was good - particularly the duck egg) for the past 5 years, but never again. Sat down at the bar for a quick bite (p.s. no one else was at the bar) ordered a 16$ glass of cava and a 19$ duck egg and the self important waiter snootily informs me that I have to order *2* tapas to be eligible to sit at their sainted bar. Fuck that. He could have been a whole lot more gracious. There are much better places to get farm raised meat in this city.
