Petite Crevette is 2 small, cozy rooms with GREAT food.  The menu is presented casually on chalk boards and fish/seafood is emphasized.  French and Italian seem to permeate the choices but there is no stuffy snobbery.  There is a hambuger and usually a carnivores' steak. Prices are not high - a scrumptious tuna burger, with fries and greens is $12. The fried oysters are stunning, served with greens. Where do the tasty tomatoes, year round, come from? Entrees run from $15-25. The BYOB policy is wonderful and Old Brooklyn Wines is right around the corner.   Given the high quality/reasonable prices, combined with a small but comfy space, there can be a wait.  Other diners are out there craving this food.  The staff will take your cell phone # and call.   The owner of PC, Neil, is not quite ... PC. He makes me laugh. He is jocular and engaging, on top of being a fine chef.  If you think you are a star attraction because you are 6'8", if you dislike people older than you, stay home and eat boxed mac and cheese instead of low-balling this gem to a 3 star rating. If you decide to bring babies to dinner because they are your larvae and/or you cannot afford a baby sitter, be prepared to be an object of scorn. And be happy I was not there. Perhaps we could take up a collection for a baby sitter or birth control. A 1 star?  Gerber gets a 5 star I bet. Disgruntalina post partum depression.   All in all, a wonderful place, a dinner or even lunch destination and a rewarding, 5 star dining experience. Even if you are seated between a tall kid and a 4 month old kid.
