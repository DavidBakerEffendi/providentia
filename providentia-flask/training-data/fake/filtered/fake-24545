The soup dumplings here are amazing. It's jut the thing you need on a cold winter night in New York. A friend of mine who is from Shanghai said that the soup dumplings are the real deal and taste just the way they do in Shanghai. As I've learned from first-hand experience, make sure you bite the top off the dumpling off a bit otherwise you will get burnt by the hot soup inside the dumpling. The line to get in can take a while but you can put your name down, walk around a bit and come back which should cut down the wait. The line may be long, but it's definitely worth the wait. The place itself is on the small side and always packed when I came here. Depending on the number of people in your party but changes are you will probably end up sharing the large circular tables with other patrons.
