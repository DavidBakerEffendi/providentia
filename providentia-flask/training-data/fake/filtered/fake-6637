I rate the food here as being just very average, what I would expect to find in a neighborhood Indian restaurant in some small city with pretentions. One thing is for sure: the quality is not worth the price (nor does the service match the higher price). This place is far from terrible. It just isn't all that good. There are Indian restaurants in the Princeton area with better food at reasonable prices. This is especially true if you are willing to do South Indian vegetarian (which I know is a very different cuisine than that of North India, which is what is made here). I am not saying that one should not come here. I am just saying that if you know of an Indian restaurant that serves food that you like, this place is not worth a test try.
