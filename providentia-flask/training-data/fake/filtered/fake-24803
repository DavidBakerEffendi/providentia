$22 for an extremely salty, over deep fried Schweinshaxen was a poor showing for this German style place. I tried to let Tom the waiter know that I was displeased with my meal, but her ran off too fast before I could reply to his question on how my meal was. My previous Schweinshaxen at the Brauhaus was great! Large, soft, and moist. This was almost a door stop and inedible. the sides of sauerkraut and fried potatoes were good. Only 1 weissen on tap, this was another disappointment. It might be another year or so before I spend this much money if there food quality does not improve significantly.
