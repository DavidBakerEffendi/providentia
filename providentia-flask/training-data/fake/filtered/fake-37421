my experience at this place was far beyond expectation , and all because of there manager Jenn, she is the most easiest and a darling of a girl to work with. She made sure all my request were met and i appreciate that. the moghul group is not a stranger to me, but it is that personal touch that she offer which will keep bringing us back. The Food was Excellence and The service was impeccable. I wish Urban Spice and Jenn all the success in this trying economy.
