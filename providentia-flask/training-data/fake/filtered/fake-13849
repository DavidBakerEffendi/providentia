Unbelievable thai food tucked into a delightful hole in the wall. The mango salad changed my life. I live in Boston, and I crave this salad on a weekly basis but have never been able to find anything remotely similar. Rodgee's ability to please each and every customer is clear in every interaction he has with his public. When my Bloomfield friend told Rodgee she was meeting me at Tanglewood this past weekend and she'd like to pick up some mango salad for our picnic, not only did he prepare it for us, but he de-constructed it and packaged the components separately so we could assemble the salad at the time we were eating it. He wanted to be sure we experienced his food the way he prepares it and took the extra steps to make that possible. Do not pass up the opportunity to eat at this amazing restaurant! And Thank You Rodgee for the always amazing mango salad, which I will now proceed to finish ;o)
