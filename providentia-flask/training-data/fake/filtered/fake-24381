Folks Don't be fooled by the 5 star comments for this restaurant - they were likely written by the owners family members. This place is very average. Sure they have 2 pages of parathas but do you really have time to dig through the list - you are better off with the option to simply choose your ingredients and get the paratha cooked For a hole in the wall fast food joint this pace is 1. Pricey - for a 2 person meal, we paid $42 2. The owner charges a 12% tip outright ( I did say that this was fast food place right) 3. Portions are relatively small for the price Basically all the ingredients that make for an Indian restaurant run by a greedy owner.
