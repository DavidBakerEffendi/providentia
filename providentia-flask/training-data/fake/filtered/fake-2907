Please read this before going to this restaurant.   My wife and I met friends here last night for diner.  After putting our name on the waiting list we where told it was an hour wait.  We expected to wait so no big deal, we went to a local bar for a cocktail first.  Came back to Cuban Pete's and our table was ready.  After fighting through a fire hazard crowd of people all waiting for their tables, we were seated.  There were speakers on a pole right above our table and the music was deafening.  I asked the waiter if the music could be turned down a little so people could hear each other and he told me he couldn't but to talk to him, pointing to the man who sat us.  I walked over to this man, found out later his name is Dominic, asked him if he would turn down the sound a little so people could talk to each other at the tables and he said no.  I asked he why not and he flipped out on me telling me I had to leave the restaurant.  I returned to my table, still stunned by my conversation with this guy and told my wife and friends I think I just got us thrown out.  I sat down at my loud table poured myself and others a glass of wine.  Not more then a minute had gone by when a woman came over and said he wants us to leave, pointing to Dominic.  I refused at first thinking it would blow over.  Dominic then came over and starting clearing away over utensils, and told us to leave.  We said you've got to be kidding, he was not.  He was like a mad man, yelling at us to leave his restaurant.  We said we would after we finished our glass of wine.  He then grabbed our open bottle of wine and said it was now his and he was throwing it out and walked away with the bottle.  He then called the police as we still were not leaving quick enough for him. I'm not making any of this up or exagerating, this man is off his rocker.   I say boycott this place until he comes to his senses and realizes that people can't be treated this way.
