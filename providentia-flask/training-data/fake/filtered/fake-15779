DO NOT EAT AT JUNIOR'S. TIMES SQUARE, NEW YORk!  I had the worst experience ever!  I order French Toast  breakfast and the food was burnt.  Not some of the FOOD but ALL the food.  My friends food was fine, but the eggs were wrong.  When her plate was being taking back to the kichen the store manager, white guy with arm in some kind of bandage like it is broken. Someone properly whipped his ass. Because this man a complete ass hole! Came to my table and said what happened with the  food.  I told him my food was burnt and I don't want anything else.  He got mad at me and started arguing with me about it. But he never even saw the plate of food I received.  Then he took my friends plate of food which she just asked for different eggs and told her there was nothing wrong with her food.  He told me that he does not know what kind of games and why I'm playing them, I told him I don't play games and asked him for his name because he has the worst customer service I have ever seen.  He refused to give me his name I asked 5 employees for the information and he run behind me saying don't tell her shit.  Don't tell her nothing. All of the employess were afraid I told him I was leaving and will report this to his corporate office and because of his customer service I will never eat at this restaurant again. He told me and friend to get out of the restaurant and he was calling the police. This guy is crazy. I called the customer service line and have not heard anything back.  It's been a week.
