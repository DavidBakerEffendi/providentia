The service here was AWFUL.  Granted, it was restaurant week so I understand things are a little hectic but I have never had a worse experience at a restaurant.  When we arrived for our reservation, we had to wait 25 minutes to be seated and due to the restaurant's small space, my boyfriend and I were forced to hover over other guests while they were eating.  We were told our table was actually right behind us because others who were waiting to be seated had sat in our seat. After the other guests were finally seated, we watched the table we were told we would be sitting at, moved.  Right in front of us, they brought a table from the back and placed it where we were originally supposed to be seated.  Two chairs were then dragged inside from the outdoor patio and placed at our table.  We were told our table was ready, without any acknowledge or apology of the half hour wait and the fact that we were sitting in LAWN CHAIRS. I've worked as a hostess and waitress for 8 years and if I had ever made someone sit in a lawn chair in a supposed nice restaurant, I would make sure they received the best service possible from then on.  However, we had no steady waitress, instead our order was taken by the hostess and two out of my 5 courses (two of the remaining three were the same for everyone) were not what I ordered.  With my experience as a waitress I try to be as empathetic as possible however this was just a horrible experience overall.
