Pretty damn good, thank goodness this place opened up here.  We usually order (for pickup) the 1/4 chicken meal and pickup in 15 minutes.  The hostess/waitress is always courteous and polite and our order ready.  We begin to eat and it seems we are racing each other to finish first, I know we shouldn't eat that way but it's so good you think it's going to disappear or go bad if you don't eat it quick enough.  Although the chicken meal is great, the anticuchos plate is phenomenal.  I grew up in Peru and that dish takes me back, amazing!
