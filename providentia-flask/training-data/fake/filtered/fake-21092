The food in this Chinese Restaurant is to die for!  We've eaten here many times over the years and have never had anything but a wonderful meal.  It's not cheap but it's well worth the money.  The food is the best Chinese food I've had anywhere.  Their meats are tender and delicious as are their vegetables. My husband took business associates from Hong Kong here and they said that it was the best Chinese food they'd had anywhere in our country. I highly recommend a trip to this restaurant!!!
