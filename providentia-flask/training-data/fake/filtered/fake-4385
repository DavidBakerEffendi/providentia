We love coming to downtown Burlington to Flatbread.  It was extremely busy, but my wife and I enjoyed drinks while we waited. The pizza is fantastic, the pricing is fair, and the atmosphere is rightfully busy for these reasons.  The selection of beer and wine (beer especially) is great. Recommended if you feel like going out to a "hotspot" or don't mind waiting for a table for a great pizza.
