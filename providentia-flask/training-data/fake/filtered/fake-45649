Well i just ate at the blue elephant restuarant yesterday. At first, i was apprehensive about dining at this establishment after reading some the low ratings by previous people. Let's get to the point. First a disclaimer i'm not a trained critic so my opinion may not be precisely technical. I walked into TBET which has a cool stylish decor that  looked better than lemon grass old out dated apperance. Like mentioned by others the waitress was quite polite she was nice to accomodate our request to move to a booth after being seated. I ordered vegetarian spring rolls... yes i'm a broccoli head non carnivore. I also drank sweet thai tea (no ice) it was delish refreshing not too sweet reminded me to jamaican carrot juice. Back to the food... the veggie spring rolls were fried golden crispy served with tasty dipping sauce. The complimentary soup came with order main lunch dish. My entree Sweet & Sour $10.00 With pineapple, bell peppers, carrots, cucumbers, onions, tomatoes and scallions and tofu..... now i'm no rich guy so the price for food at TBET is definitely reasonable considering it's fresh authentic cuisine. I mean seriously does any body expect good food to cost $1 like at your local fast food joint. Anyways we ate and partly moaned from yum yum yummy meal we joyfully devoured like a pack of hunger greedy wolves. Basically to summarize i've eaten at most places around hartford, west hartford and others. This restuarant is legit the real deal good spot for quality affordable food. So go take a look and try it yourself. If you  don't like it then post why it sucked.... but please keep don't write weak 1 sentence review crying about lame grass.
