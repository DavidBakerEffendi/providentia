I have to disagree with those who said this place is over priced.  I have been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner and for the amount of food you get and the service the price is a-okay in my book.  I have recommended this restaurant to many and have also taken many of my friends and relatives and they have all be satisfied.  As a matter of fact I am on my way to pick up two fish and chip dinners.  See ya!
