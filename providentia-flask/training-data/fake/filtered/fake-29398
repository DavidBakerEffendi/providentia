I was uber excited to visit this place. They are the only restaurant I've seen in the area that has 'euro-style Doner' sandwich  on their menu.  The problem is that they won't serve it to you in the restaurant.  The sandwiches are on the online menu, but are to-go only.  You can't eat them in the restaurant, and the owner is very adamant on that.  We offered to pay triple for Doner so that I could eat it with my family only to get denied.  I had to order something else or not at all.  The food was good, but I wouldn't recommend going there for Doner.  Not only it is just to-go, but it is not authentic like you'd find in Europe.  There was no sauce at all, completely dry.  I'm still looking for a place in the area that might have a real authentic doner sandwich.
