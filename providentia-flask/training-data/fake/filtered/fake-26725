I grew up on the south shore of Maui (HI) and can vouch that this place is just like what you'd get in Hi :0) The Kalua Pork was sweet and salty. The trick is to mix all of your rice, macaroni and rice into a big mess. It is delicious. I was most surprised by the Poke, which is a raw tuna dish. Huge amount of quality sashimi with very little filler. This place is amazing comfort food at a great price. Rare to find a unique restaurant like this in Willy B, I hope it doesn't go anywhere.
