the sweets are delicious but that's all. i made the mistake of booking their hall and they assured me that they don't do tastings because their food is so good. the hall was disgusting. my parents and friends had to ask the staff to clean and even put toilet paper in the bathrooms. the staff was so unorganized and did not speak english so there was so much confusion. my parents even had to ask them to take out the trash. the food was awful, stale and cold. please don't give them your business because even the owner is unprofessional, arrogant, rude and a cheat.
