First time ordering and it will probably be my last. The food was good. No complaints there, But the service was horrible. I got my food delivered and even making the order over the phone wasn't pleasant. Then, it took about 50 minutes for them to deliver my food. When they got to my house, they decided to honk the horn several times being very obnoxious. The delivery man came to my door with a white wife beater and basketball shorts looking as if he just came from playing basketball with his boys. Everyone is saying how the staff is so nice, I guess at night it' a different story. Won't be ordering again.
