Not rushing back here. The star of the show; Â the pizza was just OK. Found the crust to be flimsy and the sauce to be bland. On the other hand, the salad, service and decor were top notch. Just disappointed overall after all the great reviews here and elsewhere. Seems like more hype than substance. Better pizza of this genre elsewhere.
