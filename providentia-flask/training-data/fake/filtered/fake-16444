Great selection of traditional Greek dishes and others that are uniquely MP inspired. Most Greek restaurants have that "old" feel and are pretty formulaic with regard to the menu and decor.  MP is the cure for the common Greek restaurant as both the ambiance and the menu are refreshingly new and fresh.  The restaurant has two floors, each with its own vibe; the upstairs is the more traditional dining area, while the downstairs has the modern feel with the vibrant bar scene.  The outdoor dining area is supple and will continue to become more impressive as Ditmars progresses with its renaissance.  Suffice to say the neighbors have plenty to look at when they face MP. The food ranges from things you would consider classic Greek entrees and appetizers, to those that seemingly have a classical base with a twist, to those created by the genius of Chef Michael Psilakis.  Portions are usually generous and taste wise, the food always hits the spot.  Another benefit are the prices, especially when you compare apples to apples with the 'old' Greek restaurants in and around NYC.  When you do compare prices it becomes clear that the competitors are severely marking up the costs of their fish.  The whole pig/lamb and other whole animal options look delicious and I MUST try them in the future.
