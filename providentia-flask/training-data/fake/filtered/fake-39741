I had the chilaquiles with chicken along with sides of black beans and Mexican rice.  For dessert, I had the bananas empanadas. I thought the food was ok and decent, but not extraordinary. It didn't have the intensity of flavors or the taste  that I expect in an authuentic Mexican restaurant. This place is a good local watering hole for people to come and congregate and to just relax for the day.
