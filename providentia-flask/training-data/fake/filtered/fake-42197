I really enjoyed this place.  Although I didn't have a reservation, the hostess went out of her way to try to find seating, even calling some of the people waitlisted ahead of me to see if they still wanted their table.  The dishes were tasty, the drinks were strong, the waitstaff friendly, and ohmygod, the bacon donuts.
