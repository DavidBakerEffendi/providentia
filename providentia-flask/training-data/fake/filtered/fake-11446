Let's put it this way, I agree with Stephen H. I thought the place was horrible. I am talking about the store part. Â I never ate in the restaurant. In short, they don't really have much to buy except their excellent bread. I bought some pastries reluctantly and threw them out. They were full of artificial flavors and gelatins. I was flabergasted. Other than that they really wasn't anything else to buy. The deli was selling Hormel, I didn't see any prosciuttos, salalmis' etc. I asked for speck and they didn't know what I was talking about it. Moreover, all the prepared food dishes looked pretty much the same. Lots of tomatoes and basil. I guess they wanted to creat color. I expected so much more. They serve Lavazza coffee which is the Kraft of coffee in Italy. Bad choice. How about some Illy or even Danesi. I also didn' t like the attitude, like I was shopping in some temple of food. Maybe they should visit stores like Colluccio in Brooklyn or DiPalo in Manhattan or even Piccolo Gastronomia in Ridgewood to see what a real an Italian deli should be. Should I even mention the places in Hoboken? Its such a ashame because it looks like they spent millions in creating a guido temple. Oh and I won't elaborate on the pastries. Let's just say plain awful. Stick with the breads guys. Although, you still need a lesson from Sullivan Street Bakery in how to make your bread even better.
