Era is the joint, Heaven Hill and Lionshead specials, art work on the walls and usually good music on. There's a pool table and 2 TV's, if you bug the bartender they will put on cartoons. Once my girl got thrown out though for having too much fun and these yuppie pigs complained. But she don't work there anymore and there seems to be a more fun staff there now. They serve Ethiopian food, which I am not a fan of, but I hear it's good so I can't really judge. Great place to get rocked for cheap.
