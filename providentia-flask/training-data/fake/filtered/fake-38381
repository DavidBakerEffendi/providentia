wow, what horrible service. The bartender (PM bartender) could barely be bothered to take my order and never stopped by once to see how I was doing, how the food was, if I needed another beer. She was to busy texting and hanging out with a couple of patrons...burger was very mediocre and the bun was stale. For this price save your money and go elsewhere
