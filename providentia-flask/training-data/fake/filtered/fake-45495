the food here is good. not the best falafel/shwarma ever, but good. also they are super quick and friendly. the reason for the 5 stars is that I called in my order and when I went to pick it up, I realized my debit card was missing from my wallet, and I had no cash. HOW EMBARRASSING. Â I was unbelievably mortified. But, get this: the cashier told me not to worry about it, and gave me the sandwich for free. She didn't seem annoyed or make me feel guilty one bit. How amazing is that?
