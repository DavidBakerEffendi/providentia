Haven't been in there in a while, but know the food is good. Went last night to find they changed their dinner menu. Ordered the crab cake and seared tuna big plates. The crab cake big plate was two small crab cakes, with no sides. The tuna was small as well! For the price we paid, it was seriously disappointing and went home hungry. If you want a snack and don't mind spending the money, this place is for you.
