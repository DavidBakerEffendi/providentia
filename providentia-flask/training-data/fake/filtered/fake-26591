I have been going to Est Est Est for the past six years, and you can't find better late night/normal (i.e. not "New Haven" style) pizza than this! The owner and employees are all really nice and friendly, too. (And most importantly when you are hungry, they are efficient)! It's decidedly more of a to-go/grab a quick slice kind of a place (especially for a late night snack), but the inside is cozy if you felt like hanging out for a while with friends. I have only ordered full pies and stromboli, so I can't vouch for anything else, but every single time my order has been totally delicious. Est Est Est is definitely my default "fast food" option (and you can even order online for a discount)!
