Best service in West Philly. The bagels are delicious, the coffee is good, the fresh-squeezed OJ is to die for, but the stars really go to the service. I have only sat down to eat at the GSC once or twice, but the counter service is friendly, prompt, efficient, and fun! I can honeslty say its the best in West Philly. The Green Line cafe (both locations) make you feel like you are wasting their time (and no this isn't based on 1 or 2 instances. I have probably been there about 20 times since i moved here bc the Cherry Apple Walnut bagel is the best in Phila.), and the Milk and Honey has THE WORST service of any cafe i have ever been to in my life (ranging from getting ignored by the counter staff to being treated like a piece of crap for not knowing that their credit machine doesn't include tip. The food at the Gold Standard really isn't out of this world. The Modena Salad is pretty good and fresh, and the BBQ seitan is also only "ok", but for real, if you are looking for somewhere to get a good cup of coffee and breakfast to go without immediately regretting walking in the door, this is your place :)
