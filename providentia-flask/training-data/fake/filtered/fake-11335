I ate at the pizza & pasta section. The food was absolutely wonderful, but it was extremely expensive and the portion was small. Then walked around and had a cappuccino, which was good. It's a little annoying to have to get up and go to a different section for you end of meal coffee, but the whole place is divided into categories so it is what it is.
