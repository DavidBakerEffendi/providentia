I took all things into consideration with the four out of five stars. The location is right near Times Square, the service is friendly, the range of food options are good and the prices are reasonable for this area. It lost one star rating due to the fact that when I had breakfast there my potatoes tasted and looked like they had been sitting for a while; they were chewy, with lots of burnt parts. I told my waiter and he quickly replaced them with a hot and fresh batch and these tasted great. My waiter was Sean and he was friendly and attentive. My husband had tried their cheeseburger for lunch and he thoroughly enjoyed it and rated it the same as me. I had also tried their Matzo Ball soup and that was also very nice.This restaurant was right across the street from my Marriott Marquis hotel and I would visit this place again for sure, perhaps to try a deli sandwich next time.
