Beware of overcharging! Worst racket ever. Got 2 drinks from one bartender and the price was $8.50, got the same 2 drinks from another bartender and the price was now $9.25!!!  At a different bar inside, Play 2 the bartender did the same thing. We called her out on charging $6.00 for a  $3.00 beer and gave her the option of getting a manager or taking  money out of her tips. She chose the 2nd option.
