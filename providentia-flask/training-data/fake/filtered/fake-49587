Great, and I've already come back twice! I first went here with my husband and child and was happy to see a nice variety on the menu (meats for the husband, vegetables for me, delectable flaky bread and yogurts for my son). The food was delicious, and the space was perfect--spacious, well designed, beautiful decor. I felt like I could breathe and enjoy. The staff was also warm, welcoming, helpful in getting me to decide what to order. I came back again for brunch and enjoyed even more. I definitely recommend!!!
