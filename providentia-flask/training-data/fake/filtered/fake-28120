Hey all- Go here.  Now.   This is my after work go-to with my boyfriend.  We both wait tables.  And after a long night dealing with the crazies, this is exactly what the doctor ordered.   Cheap, varied wine list.  All esoteric wines, for cheap (under $45 for all), and narrowed down to save you the time and effort of searching through the list. As for food, get a pizza.  With anything else, you're pretty much wasting your time.  I reccommend the proscuitto pizza.  It will fill you up and be delicious. The staff is totally chill.  Any one of them will tell you exactly which wine to get, depending on what you are looking for.  They know their shit.   I think my boyfriend and I are as close to regulars as they have, and they treat us like royalty.  Go there once a week and you'll be golden, with buybacks every time. Also the music is sweet.  Think indie with a twist.
