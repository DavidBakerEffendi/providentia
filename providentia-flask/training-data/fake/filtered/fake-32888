Well, 3 visits in the last year. Excellent food for the most part. A disturbing thing happened the last visit. We had a 7PM reservation but they made us wait 45 min and we were really hungry when we arrived so we did not get to eat until we waited over an hour.  They did give us a free cocktail while we were waiting so you can imagine how we felt with a strong cocktail on an empty stomach. I think we enjoyed the food though and they even gave us an extra dessert.  I do like Perry Street although it was quite a rude way to start the evening.  By the way, they have the prix fixe only on certain hours...you have to ask. This will save you big $$ here.
