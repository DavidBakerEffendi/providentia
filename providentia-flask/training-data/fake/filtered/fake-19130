Hoping to hang on to a reputation no longer deserved, this overly expensive venue is a total disappointment for guests.  The food was almost inedible. Salad? If you call one slimy green a salad, you'll like this place. Potato souffle? Hard as a rock and not a souffle at all.  Maitre d' doesn't know his stuff if he thinks that a souffle. Awful, overcooked pasta, skimpy portions (but who would want it anyway?) and ridiculous pricing for events. Steer clear of this one. It's a Mamma Leone's type of tourist trap only the guests here aren't tourists.
