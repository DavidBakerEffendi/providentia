Be careful if you ever order the crab dip. My daughter bit into a nail and the owner never called her or addressed the issue. Thank god the waitress saw and took the nail to show the kitchen staff what they're preparing, they said it might be from a whisk in the kitchen, clearly my family recognized a dry wall nail. Thank god she is ok.
