I went to Laduree for the first time last Friday, and already had a dream about this very  special place and its macarons last night!   How's that for an impression?   On Friday I entered the shop and the patron line that snaked up to the front counter.  No one on line complained; there was undeniable excitement in the air.   I understand why.  How does Laduree make their macarons with such  finesse?   Two half shells, each crisp on the outside, but quite soft on the inside, joined in the middle with ganache.  I especially appreciate the "Rose" flavor that melts in your mouth with a heavenly fragrance.  I also recommend the "Caramel with Salted Butter" flavor, which is quite popular.   Their menu consists of year-round flavors and seasonal flavors.   Treat yourself!
