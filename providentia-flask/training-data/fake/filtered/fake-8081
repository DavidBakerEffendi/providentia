The food here is unbelievable!!!! By far the BEST restaurant I have EVER been too! They offer pages of vegan and vegetarian items. Citrus Vegan Spareribs, general tso tofu, vegetable fried rice, and especially-VEGAN DRUMSTICKS (my 4 year olds favorite!)-If you have not gone here yet you are missing out on high class food for a great price! The owner is the nicest man ever and always goes out of hsi way to make sure you are satisfied, even when we order in, he is always the one who delivers and always in SUCH great spirits!!! :) We are in love with China Pan!!!
