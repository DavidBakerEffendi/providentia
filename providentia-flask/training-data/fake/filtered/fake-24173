Since I work nearby, I pick up lunch at the Terminal quite often.  I've walked by dozens of times, and today just really had the urge for a reuben.  Unfortunately, the best part of the reuben were the two pickle spears that came with it. While the sandwich was quite large, it really lacked much in the way of flavor.  I couldn't even taste the dressing, and although the sauerkraut was tasty, it got lost in the fatty, flavorless meat.  I don't know if shaving the meat instead of slicing it thickly would have helped, but I didn't find a lot of taste to the meat - it was rather bland. I honestly was expecting more for the price, and don't think I'll be stopping again.
