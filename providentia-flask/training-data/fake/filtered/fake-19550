Angelo's on Main is the first restaurant we think of when we decide to go out to eat. We are always greeted happily when we enter the establishment and have never had anything but fast and friendly service. Tonight I decided to have the Roast Pork Loin. The demi-glace wine sauce that was on it was wonderful without overpowering the meat. The pork itself was so tender it melted in your mouth like an expensive prime rib. The steamed vegetables were prepared so that they were not steamed to death and mushy and were very vibrant in color. Cheescake was the dessert and this is made from scratch at the restaurant. Tonight's was a raspberry swirl with a graham cracker crust that puts the Cheescake Factory's offerings to shame. The only downside to this trip was that it was after dark and we missed out on the wonderful view over the golf course. Go to Angelo's on Main and you will not be sorry. The people posting negative reviews of this restaurant must not have been at the same place I am writing about.
