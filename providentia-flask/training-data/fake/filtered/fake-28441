This was my second time at Petit Abeille.  My first experience was OK but my attempt at lunch this past Sunday was a disaster. My medium rare burger was served essentially raw.  By the time my replacement burger eventually was served my two lunch mates had already finished eating and again my burger was raw.  To boot, the top part of the bun appeared to have been bitten! The manager apologized, took the burger off the bill and comped our drinks (3) but I left hungry and determined never to return.
