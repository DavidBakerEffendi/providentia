So I was really disappointed with Geno's and was praying that Pat's salvaged my Philly cheese steak experience.  Pat's steak was way better than Gino's. It was juicy, thicker, and seasoned.  However, with the cheese whiz, it made the steak a little salty.  It still wasn't as good as most people rant and rave about.  I can honestly get a better cheese steak in NYC.  So out of Pat's and Geno's, Pat's wins.
