Me and 3 other visited junior's last evening and because I visited before and had great service and really good food I expected the same. But I am sorry to say that my experience last evening wasn't very good. The waifriendlywasn't very helpful when some of the party had a little trouble deciding.. And it was clear after like 5 min. that he didn't really want to give good service. He messed up our orders both drinks and food, he wasn't attentive about drinks refills,even though he was standing right next to us and asking about the food. So Renen, you where not that busy, you messed up to many things and we had to tell you that we needed refilling. And the tables next to us wasn't impressed either... No tips from anybody. I've had better service and friendlye at a cheap burgerjoint...
