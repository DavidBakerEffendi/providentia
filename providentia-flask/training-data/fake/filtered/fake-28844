Went for the first time... Amazing. Super nice guys and beer is coming soon according to the owner. This place could be a gem it they get some great craft beer and add a few good sides(the ones I saw didn't look like must haves). This bbq is legit and everyone was awesome. Get the spare ribs and use the BBQ sauce!!!
