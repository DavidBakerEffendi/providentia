Just came from yelp my meal arrived covered with onions ( I hate onions)so I brought it to the manager basically told me to go kick rocks (although she said it with a smile) so as I sat there my guest decides he didnt want to stay since I was wasnt eating so he paid our bill n we left my dish untouched. I've been there before the food is good and reasonable so we discounted the poor service but this place is like the soup Nazi of Italian. Avoid unless you love abuse more than decent Italian
