I cannot say one bad thing about Basso56.  I literally have nothing but praise for this fabulous restaurant.  Lets start with the food: For starters my boyfriend and i shared the burrata wrapped in prosciutto and pan seared scallops.  Both were delicious but we both decided if we absolutely had to pick, it would be the scallops which were covered in sauted mushrooms and a orange oil.  We were also brought a basket of bread and plate of olives when seated which was a nice touch.  One of the first things I noticed about the food was how beautiful the plates were.  They really have a nice presentation and take the time to make sure the food looks as good as it tastes. For the main course I had the "Fagottino alla Polpa di Aragosta" which is a crepe filled with fresh lobster in a tomato chive sauce.  This was so freaking good.  The lobster pieces were huge and cooked perfectly.  My boyfriend had the "Filetto di Dentice in Brodetto" which is pan seared striped bass in white wine and lemon broth.  The plate had cherry tomatoes, fennel, manila clams, and mashed potatoes. It was so good I really cant say which one was better.   Even though I was totally full, we had to have desert.  I had the delicious creme brulee and my boyfriend had chocolate filled crepes.  Also, if you are a wine connoisseur they have a great wine menu.  I am not the most wine educated person but my boyfriend is and he approved! I also have to mention the service and in the restaurant.  Everyone is SO friendly and knowledgeable about the food and wine.  They truly seem to be proud of the place they work and want to make a good impression on their guests.  The owner himself was there to great us with complimentary champagne, and the server brought us limoncello and grapa following the meal.   Last thing: Don't forget the bar across the street!  Great atmosphere, live music, friendly servers.
