Went earlier tonight, theyre open late which is great, the shogun sauce is my fav. had the fried pickle chips were nice and cripy, real friendly staff too. we had boneless which were huge, and also the traditional were good too! My girl loved her chicken bacon ranch salad too she said it was really good! def be back!
