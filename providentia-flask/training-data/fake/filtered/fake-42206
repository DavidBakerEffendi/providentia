I came across to this restaurant last Saturday and I couldn't believe what I tasted. Their food is so good that I cant stop thinking of getting back right away. Now, I can't stop talking about their tuna tartar w/ Japanese eggplant and the strawberry baby back rib! Awesome place!. Definitely will be coming again very soon!
