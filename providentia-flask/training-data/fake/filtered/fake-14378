Two things you need to know first: Contrary to Yelp current information, Candela does take reservations.  And the entrance is not on the street but in the back of the building.  You'll want to know these things because Candela is definitely worth a visit if you are in Hanover.  We arrived very early, about 5:30 on a weeknight, and before leaving most of the tables were occupied, so by all means make a reservation.  The tapas selection is excellent.  We had the croquetas, Asturian meatballs, empenadas, and shrimp with chorizo and potatoes, all of which we would recommend.  The prices are right, about $8-10 per tapas plate.  The dessert flan was also delicious.  Candela has a nice wine list with both white and red flights, various choices by the glass, and a variety of bottles, many but not all Spanish; we had a 2009 Pruno Ribera del Duero that went nicely with the tapas we ordered.  The owner greeted us at the door, spoke to us at the table, and he and the wait staff were very accommodating. We will definitely be back next time we are in the area.
