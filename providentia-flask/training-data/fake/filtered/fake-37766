UNBELIEVABLY DELICIOUS! If you like Indian food, you must try this place!  Yes, the place is small, but the portions are huge and the food is otherworldly.  I had the Chicken Tikka Marsala and the stuffed naan and I just can't say enough about how yummy both were.  The manager came over and introduced himself and was so welcoming.  He sent us over a rice pudding on the house at the end of the meal and that was to die for too!!!  Try this place out...you will not be disappointed!
