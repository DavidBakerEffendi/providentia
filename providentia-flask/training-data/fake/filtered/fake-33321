the hand drown noodles have become a part of my life, I almost come here every lunch time with my friends. Sometimes we will share a any 3roll dinner as well. Beef brisket noodle soup is not only my favorite, but also very popular among my friends . But some of them prefer the shave noodle, but in summary, the low price and the good service will give you best eating experience ^^
