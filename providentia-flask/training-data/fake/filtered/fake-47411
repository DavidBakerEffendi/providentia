From the time we sat down this restaurant had horrible service from the waiter to the food. The pasta was under-cooked, dry along with the bread. When we asked for butter for the bread, we were told they only had olive oil, its a restaurant right, shouldn't they have some butter on hand. We asked a second waiter for butter and he said sure and brought us one square for three people. After taking a bite, we decided to send the food back and get our check. When asked why, we told the staff our reasons and then were told it was cooked fine, 'al dente", we disagreed and asked for check for our wine. The staff proceeded to clear our table as we sat waiting. After paying, as we walked away, we were yelled at and told "please don't come back", as if we would, cmon!
