Reviewer Number 3595. I must say the broth is delightful when you take your first spoonful however me being a veggie lover(although i do eat meat) I must say that it gets a bit overwhelming after a while. This place is so lively and packed that i felt like i was at a fish market at the door at 6 am. Wait was about 1 hour on a Thursday evening. This place is a must visit for out of townees.
