I ordered 50 vegetable dumplings to take home and cook.  When I got home and started cooking them, they were 50 pork dumplings.  I called the #, the guy said "closed" and hung up on me.  I called again and spoke Mandarin that I had a problem, told him what the problem was and he chastised me for calling so late.  I said I just started cooking them and that I'm returning them tomorrow.  He said something I didn't understand and hung up on me.  It pissed me off to say the least. Now I gotta trudge back to Eldridge to return the dumplings and who knows if they'll even give my $$ back.
