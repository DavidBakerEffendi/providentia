Did I go to Japan tonight? This place reminds me of some Japanese tea houses in Japan. I've been to Cha-an many times but haven't been there for few years. This place still look the same. 3 of us ordered few drinks and 2 desserts after dinner. Black sesame Cree brûlée and black sesame moci were super tasty. 2 of us had matcha float. The green tea was strong (that's by I am still up at 2am). My gf had hibiscus tea. She said it was really good too. I will try their appetizers and lunch someday soon.
