Yum. Was directed here by several friends when I asked for a good, neighborhood burger joint. Went with the savory chicory salad and grass-fed beef burger. The burger was fantastic, flavorful. Interesting pickles and of course, no better way to put back some starch like duck fat potatoes. Ambiance warm, comfy, with friendly staff.
