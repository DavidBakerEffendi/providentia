I am so sad. Le Barricou is my neighborhood spot. We used to go here at least a couple times a week - everything on the menu was delicious (salty, but I love that) and brunch was amazing. We had been traveling quite a bit this summer so haven't made it in recently until last week for dinner, only to find they have a new chef and the menu had changed. And not for the better. Beyond the annoying mispellings on the new menu, all of my favorites are gone. The creativity that we felt so special to have down the street like rabbit gnocchi and mussels prepared in various ways are now dumbed down with things like sides of mac & cheese and two burger options (are we Dumont now?). They've successfully turned themselves into every other boring restaurant that I don't feel is worth eating at. Also, the place used to be such good value. Now the entrees are equally expensive if not more and don't come with sides which you need to order separately. I truly hope the owners read this and make changes. I am rooting for you and I want to dine there like we used to, but at this moment I can't justify it.
