Love this place! Ate there for the first time a few nights ago. I had the falafel sandwich in a wheat pita - falafel was perfectly spiced, cruncy on the outside but just soft enough on the inside and overall delicious. The hummus was fabulous as well. Creamy and perfect, could have eaten a bowl of it alone. The service was great as well, fast, friendly and the girl behind the counter is great! Highly recommend Hummus :)
