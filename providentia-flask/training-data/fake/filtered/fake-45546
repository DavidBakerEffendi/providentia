Ate at the famous Dom Peppe,, i agree with the few haters, dont waste your CASH or time going to this place. The decor is old, dingy and cheap, yet the CASH prices are high. Â Pass on the oily baked clams and save your $20. The wait staff definitely pushes the food or should i say the higher priced food.
