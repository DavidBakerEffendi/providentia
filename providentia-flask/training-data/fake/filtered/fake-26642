Count me among the fans of this wonderful restaurant. My mother was visiting New York and treated us to dinner, and we had the best dining experience we had ever had in Brooklyn. The marrow and scallop tacos came with a creative plating and selection of toppings, including sea salt, which I found necessary -- marrow can be a little lifeless without seasoning. Our entrees were perfectly seasoned, and the fish was tender and flavorful. The service was fantastic. The waiters were on hand to answer questions or make suggestions, but without being pushy.
