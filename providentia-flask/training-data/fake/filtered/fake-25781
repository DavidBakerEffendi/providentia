Chef was rude and management worthless when we simply wanted to substitute pasta for a vegetable. Not only did they not accommodate me and charge me for the veggie the Chef visited our table not to appease me but to question why I felt that vegetables were healthier altnernative to pasta - seriously?! The food is mediocre at best so no love loss here. Old City is full of wonderful and better priced restaurants. Won't be visiting nor recommending this place ever again!!
