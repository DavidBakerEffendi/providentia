They have the best burgers!!! Â And the onion rings are TO DIE FOR! They have a mustard sauce that I could smother ANYTHING in. I am dying to try some of the many other things on the menu that sound and look so delish but everytime I go for the burgers since they are just so damb yummy!! And of course the beer is delish too!
