Decided to order pizza and fried dough for my daughter's birthday today it took them 1hr to deliver the food and the pizza was cold and hard the fried dough was so hard you couldn't break it in half. I called and they told me to heat the pizza up in the oven how's that for good customer service so decided to bring the food to them and here I am waiting for another pizza..last time I order from here...
