If a chef  can do the simple things better than anyone , that's already a good sign. rarely have the occasion to eat a lamb burger, while there were maybe more enticing dishes,  the lamb burger  was wonderfully tasty,  how lamb should taste! The warm pita combination appetisers had a wealth of flavours,  an appetiser is to whet your appetite, but that rarely happens. These flavours did just that. Combined with the craft beers, (I tried three!) it was a treat.  Across from me , my fellow diners were raving about  the Greek Paella, and the octopus, but I was quite content with my appetisers, beer(s) , and burger.   The service was friendly and timely.  I was in Greece last summer, this is a welcome, modern , delicious step up.
