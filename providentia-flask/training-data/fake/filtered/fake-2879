Mediocre food with a RUDE manager and team of hostesses. This is clearly a place where a little success has gone to their heads! Cuban Pete's staff act like this is Cuba: a communist regime where one can't question mediocrity! Surprise, this is a suburb of one of the great restaurant capitals. Go elsewhere, there are better choices and thankfully, we do have choices!
