This is a dinner review only, definitely want to try their brunch. And if I could give 3.5 stars I would! Â  Pretty casual, intimate spot right off 7th ave. Good for dinner with friend(s), a date, parents, etc. but definitely wouldn't recommend for large groups. It's tiny even by West Village standards. Food is consistently good, particularly when you consider the limited space/equipment their staff is working with. However nothing spectacular... Well, with the exception of their Brie cheese, which is a nice sized portion and comes drizzled with honey and topped with toasted pine nuts, accompanied by sliced French baguette. I still have dreams about it! Prices are more than reasonable. I'm actually surprised by all of the positive reviews for service, though. They are definitely not rude by any means, but the servers are painstakingly slow even when the place isn't packed. Other than the bathroom there are literally no walls in this place (therefore no server station), so you're forced to stare at the back of their head and wonder what the heck they are doing that they can't get you another glass of wine, take your order or bring your bill.
