I went for the first time Friday night. The restaurant itself had a nice feel to it, it didn't feel like going to your run of the mill family restaurant. It did seem a little overcrowded, don't know if they were making the extra space because of restaurant week, but I would have liked it if there could have been more than half a foot of space between the next party and mine. Also, it was a bit loud, probably because of their taking advantage of every inch of space in the restaurant. Nothing ultra major, but I wouldn't choose this place for a romantic date since you practically have to yell across the table to be heard. Since Pacifico was on restaurant week New Haven, so I chose a 3 course meal. As far as food goes, I was beyond impressed. Presentation, taste, timeliness, everything was spot-on. I chose the Duck Quesadillas as a start off appetizer and they were exquisite! The meat was tender and flavorful. As an entree I chose steak a la parilla, and ordered it medium well. It was cooked to expectation, was in fact delicious, and accompanied by an assortment of rice that was cooked neither too crunchy or too fluffy. Towards the end of the meal a server passed around a single slice of bread with tomato sauce, both were delectable, although I wish I could have gotten the bread with the beginning of the meal. But that's not a big deal in the least. The dessert was a little less impressive.. I chose Tres Leches with blackberry sauce because I love tres leches. But if you are expecting the usual juicy texture and sponge like cake, you will be disappointed. It tasted pretty good, but I don't think it should be labeled "Tres Leches", it was far too dry to be one. Overall I did like the experience, the staff was friendly and the food was great!
