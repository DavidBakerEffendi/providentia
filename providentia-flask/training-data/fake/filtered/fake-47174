I had went to Mediterraneanea a couple months ago and had gotten terrible service. I don't write places off because of one review so I tried again last week and was amazed how much they improved. They had a completely new crew of employees who are phenomal . If your looking for a great place with great food this is the place. And it's very close to the movies .
