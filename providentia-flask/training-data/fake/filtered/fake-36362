Went to Scarpetta last night for a birthday celebration. We started off with a bottle of wine. When we ordered our wine, it was served within 60 seconds of ordering!!  That was the fastest service I have ever seen!  Then the bread basket came out and I agree with other reviewers that the bread is pretty good.  The stromboli bread roll with cheese and salami reminded me of my dad's homemade calzones.  For appetizers, we ordered the yellowtail and the seared sea scallops.  For entrees, we ordered the Black Tagliolini with lobster and I ordered the spaghetti.  Everything was fresh and flavorful.  The spaghetti was simple and very tasty but definitely overpriced ($24)  For dessert we ordered the cheese plate and the chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was a little too much chocolate for my liking but still very good.   I highly recommend this restaurant for a special evening out in NYC.
