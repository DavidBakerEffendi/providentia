A few years ago, this place was recommend to me by a friend of a friend.  Me, my brother, and a friend went here on a day-trip to NYC.  It was a very good experience.  Food was delicious, staff friendly, service good-paced.  If you are in Manhattan and are looking at reviews to find a good place, and you just can't decide, then go here and check it out.  The atmosphere is lively and fun.  It can be a bit loud, but AHH c'mon IT IS Neyork ahight! ? :) It's a fun place to eat and socialize when you may be annoyed or feel cramped in other places nearby.  Haven't been to NYC in a few years, but was thinking about NYC tonight and had to write this... next time I visit, of course I will stop in there again.
