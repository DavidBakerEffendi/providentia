you've GOT to be KIDDING me!!! i grew UP in this neighborhood(ocean pkwy btwn k/l).  difara's opened shortly after we moved there... it WAS a great pizza place...ate there, pretty much, daily...and their dishes were great, too.  that included their sandwiches... i live in holland now.  which is where i'm writing this.  i'm to visit nyc soon... last time i was there, in 2011, my brother and i were in the old neighborhood and i said, 'you mind if i stop by difara's for a slice?'... he gave me the 'are you kidding?', of course smile... he wasn't hungry, so i hopped out of the car, jumped in and got a slice... now the reheats were never as good as the fresh slice.  but that's to be expected... but dom almost had to do cpr on me when i saw the price... and the slice SUCKED!   i mean SUCKED!   i threw it away after 3 bites...it was dried out and the only flavor it had was 'burnt'. when i got back to the car and told my brother, he started laughing... he said, 'yeah...that's what i heard...after the ny times said it was THE best pizza in ny the price went through the roof and the pizza sucked...'. caviat emptor...pizza empty.
