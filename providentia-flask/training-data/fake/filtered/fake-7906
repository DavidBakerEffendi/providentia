"Gourmet to go?" Not so much. Govinda's doesn't offer quality food much higher than the bar set by Subway - the bread on my veggie burger sandwich was OK, and the veggies were only moderately fresh. And the attitude of their staff left a lot to be desired. Definitely on the cheaper side of the spectrum, but I'm a vegetarian because I love things fresh - and Govinda's "Gourmet to Go" did not deliver.
