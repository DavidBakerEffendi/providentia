I have always loved the shady, vibrant atmosphere of the corner of 45th and Walnut, with the second mile, the Islamic center, and Saad's is an old favorite, now Manakeesh fits right in. It is beautiful inside, really reasonable prices, and the food was so generous and delicious. The staff provide a warm and friendly atmosphere, that you really notice. The Za'atar was delicious, the "side" of fuul turned out to be a whole meal. I will go back as often as I can. I'm currently signing up for yelp just so I can post this review, I was so pleased with my experience.
