Went to dinner here for the first time last night with a few friends and it was amazing. I think It was probably the best Thai food I've ever had.  NYC is completely over saturated with THai food and I think I just realized what Thai food is actually supposed to taste like.  The flavors and spice combinations where right on. Nothing was over seasoned but just left a great taste in your mouth. Nothing was too saucy or greasy(even the fried food). Often times when you order spring rolls you bite into them and all you taste is the fried wrapper and grease is all over the place. Chef Hong's spring rolls, even though they are fried there is no grease and you actually taste all of the veggies inside. THere were 4 of us and we all ordered something different so we could taste everything. Every dish we had was just as good as the other(Grandma's Fried Rice,Braised Short Ribs,Pad THai Special,Lobster in Coconut Sauce)  You can tell that Chef Hong is truly passionate about food and preparing it. She takes the time to walk around and check in with the tables and is very sweet!!  This last comment is coming from someone that worked in NYC restaurants for years with Chef's and owners yelling and screaming no stop.You can always tell if a chef is truly a good person based on the energy of her staff and the energy at Ngam is great!! It is open style kitchen so you can she that she is engaging her staff and kind to them as opposed to screaming and yelling at them . This is  a breathe of fresh air in an industry that is surrounded by arrogant,rock star chef's that like to rule based on fear and anger.  Check it out.... you won't be disappointed!!! PS- Forgot to mention the homemade strawberry chili soda is amazing!!!
