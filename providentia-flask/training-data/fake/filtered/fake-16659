We come here for thought groupon deal they accept. We try the octopus salad . It was not like normal octopus that hard. It's juicy and soft. And the other two different dishes of fish. It was really good tasting and fresh . Especially the special app from boss. The mussel was with the steamed rice. That's what I had best ever meal . Anyway. I had good time with blacksea fish&grill . .
