I made an account just to write about Lee's. A small, unassuming place that has become one of my favorite spots in all of Philadelphia. Amazing food, great prices, and a very friendly atmosphere. I slept on this place forever, which was a huge mistake. As far as delis like this go, Lee's is the best out there. I should also mention that Lee's gets skipped over by the vegetarian crowd a lot, but the seitan cheesesteak is worth the trip.
