My hubby and I finally decided to try this place after walking and driving by numerous times over the years.  We enjoy eating Mexican food and the place always looks so cool from the outside....plus its always packed with people which is probably why we have avoided it.  It is a nice set up, especially with the patio outdoors.  It makes for a relaxing lunch, dinner, etc. with a friend or few. I don't think we're returning anytime soon.  My husband loved his fish tacos but the service was horrific.  We were seated and then no one not even our waitress took our order for another 20 minutes (It was probably longer).  I couldn't believe it and they weren't even busy.  It was approaching 10PM on a Friday and there were two occupied tables on the patio. It really was not crowded.  Not indoors or out.  What made us feel even more unwelcomed was that the hostess noticed we had not been waited on. After 10 minutes of waiting I decided to let the hostess know that we had not been waited on and she stated: "She will be with you soon. She is waiting on another table". Then 10 more minutes went by and when our waitress finally did arrive she showed no remorse for having us wait and neither did she tell us her name.  She took our orders and that was it.  Terrible.  I eventually asked her name and that was it.  Oh and we had to flag her down for napkins and silverware after our meal arrived.  I really could not believe the service.  I wouldn't consider this place if I were you... unless you do take out or are desperate for a cheap Mexican meal in Old City.
