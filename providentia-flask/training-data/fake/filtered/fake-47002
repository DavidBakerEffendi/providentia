This place is great. Quick, yet delicious and health meal options. Ive been here twice and the service was super fast. The various sauces are delicious. The only thing that prevents me from giving them a full five stars is the price. The bowls will run you around $10. That's a bit pricey for what you get because the portions are small. Beefing up the portions or easing up on the price would certainly earn a five star rating because the food is spectacular.
