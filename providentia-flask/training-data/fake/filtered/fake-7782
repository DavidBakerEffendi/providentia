Pizza always great, especially the white clam and bacon....Cool industrial setting in great New Haven area....Server was a young fellow who did a nice job on a fairly busy recent Saturday....Only bad thing that I saw recently was that hosts and female servers were all chewing gum and hanging around, non-stop fratenizing to the point that you wouldn't know they are even employed there; really, really unprofessional...aside from that, though, great spot for a lot of years now.
