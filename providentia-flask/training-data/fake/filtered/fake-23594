First visit to The Spotted Pig tonight.  So disappointing.  Service was extremely slow.  The food was just so so.  The scallops were overcooked.  The vegetable plate - which was very important to me, as both my daughters are vegetarian, was a pile of overcooked beets, onions, garlic & greens. Pork rillette was just so so! We decided not to order the pork belly as I make this a lot at home!  Maybe we should have!  I don't think we will go back.
