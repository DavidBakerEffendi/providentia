I love the pickle backs here! Delicious, spicy, and I always get them when I am here. French Fries are wonderful and I love how you get your own huge sea salt with it! I just wish the man who checks your ID's was nicer to sweet afton patrons, it is a neighborhood bar and NOT a club in the city, relax!
