I wish I had reviewed Vitae earlier, because at this point I have forgotten what I had ordered.  I dined at Vitae sometime last winter, and truly cannot recall what I ordered. Pros:  Great customer service, ample space between tables, an array of fine wines and cocktails, fresh and tasty food!!!!  The food was slowly cooked and was not heavy. Cons:  None!
