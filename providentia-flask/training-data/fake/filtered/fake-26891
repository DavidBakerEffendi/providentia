Bui's is loved.  I like the egg and cheese sandwiches at different carts.  And this one is not significantly better than the rest.  But here is why they get everyone's loyalty: 1. WEEKENDS - They are open on Saturday and Sunday. 2. REMEMBER YOUR ORDER - I don't know how they do it, but they remember you.  I stopped going for several months and when I came back, they had it right. 3. CONSISTENT FOOD - It is always good and they big roll is great when it is fresh. NOTE - For whatever reason, (hangovers?), they sell a lot of Gatorade with the egg and cheese.  Once I tried it, and it works.
