Want delicious Indian food and genuine attentive service? Then visit this restaurant! The dishes we love are the Chicken Malai, Whole Fish Tandoori, Saag Panir and the Goan Shrimp Curry. But there is so much more to taste. A fine selection of appetizers, soups, breads, and great vegetarian selections too. Unpretentious, simple, clean, friendly... and did I say...DELICIOUS. My family are regulars and big fans of the owners who know us and greet us warmly by name. When you go, tell them "Aura sent you".
