YUM!  This joint is rightly known for its top notch Ramen and I was lucky enough to try it during my last trip into the city.  The service and the ramen was hands down the best I've experienced at a noodle joint in NYC and will definitely be back again.  Definitely try their classics if you've never been here but I love their hearty spicy broth that was recommended to me by several ramen snobs. If you're looking for some amazing ramen, look no further..be prepared to wait in line though!
