the food I got there has nothing to do with real Uzbek food... it tastes more like Indian stuff... I'm pretty sure the kebabs were cooked the day before and just warmed up to the order, kofta was too dry and crumbly... the meat in the dumpling soup wasn't fresh enough to swallow... it was my first and last time there... strongly not recommended
