My family and I went there last night for my birthday dinner. Fish was extremely fresh and tasty, staff was extra courteous and delightful.  We had a really fun time donning bibs and gloves and diving into plastic bag to eat flavorful shellfish (shrimp, clams, crawfish & snow crabs).  I highly recommend ordering bread to sop up the succulent juices.
