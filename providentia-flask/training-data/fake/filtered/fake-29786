Overall-  i just felt like I was a bit taken...food was good, although small portions, especially if you were to take your lobster roll out of tiny boat carton and saw how it would be completely lost at sea on a plate..I don't like using plastic flatware, doesnt work. I also worry about  the environmental impacts here- restaurant is run like take out. I guess these are all cost cutting measures by management, but left me wondering- is this a restaurant or is this take-out?? And at these prices? All a bit unsettling a bit like the unused  expanse of  blue floor( sea?) in the middle which strangely disconnects all the patrons. I did not like decor either. Think anchors and glass balls with rope around them all a bit passé in 2011 and not very imaginative. But especially did not like the seating arrangements. Either skinny bars around edges or protruding out from wall in lines,  or bar which was very cramped. Somehow the whole experience reminded me of going to Ikea.
