I stopped in with some friends to have a drink at the bar and while looking for the bathroom we stumbled upon the carriage house in the back of the restaurant.  I took the manager's card and contact info to keep on file.   We chose to host my mother-in-law's 60th birthday party on the 2nd floor of the carriage and i cannot say enough good things about our experience.  The room is beautiful and the staff did an amazing job decorating the room with candles and fresh flowers.  The service throughout the night was great and the food was really good.  We were a little nervous since we had not tried the food prior to the party but we were not disappointed.   I highly recommend the Carriage House at La Palma if you are looking for a private room for up to 20 people.
