This is the best pizza in town! Not just in town but this is arguably the best pizza in NJ. They have more options than I have grey hairs haha. The chicken parm pizza is one of my favorites. They also make great sandwiches and pasta dishes. I highly recommend trying this place for lunch or dinner. You can even order online which always saves me time.
