People give it a terrible review because they say its gross pizza.  I've had far worse pizza in regular pizza places.  I think its good and the owners are wonderful. Had my sons 2nd birthday there. They were very accommodating.  Just remember you're not going to some pizza shop in NYC.  You have to compare it pizza hut, dominos, or papa johns. Its the best of that type of pizza.
