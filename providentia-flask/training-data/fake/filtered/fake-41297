I do not understand the issues others have had.  The service was friendly and excellent.  The food was well prepared.  The wine was served correctly.  The individual who complained about the fill on the glasses obviously did not understand how to serve wine.  The server was absolutely excellent.  I would go back next time I visit Princeton.
