I came with excitement to enjoy a great dining experience with my family.  To my diappointment, I found that the manager hid his ignarance of a gluten free diet.  After saying everything would be cooked separately, he finally admitted that the potato portion of of one of the meals was fried in the same oil as the other gluten items.  If you are a celiac, this is called cross contamination.  His lack of concern and discussion, void of an apology lead me to believe that quality control was not of concern,  Hence, my daughter's 5 day stomach ache was inconsequential to him.  He viewed us as a nuisance. Most upscale restaurants are capable of both being honest and providing what they say in advance they can do.
