Just decided to have a dinner party at Chutney. Happy to see new Management making so many positive changes at once. Newly renovated restaurant, additional banquet facility for smaller parties and addition of valet (optional) is an enticement for hosting upscale events. Will definitely refer others to host more events here now.
