I love to read reviews, to be honest, I'm not much for writing them. After frequenting this place for over a year, however, and being consistently impressed by both the food and the service, I figure this place has proved to be more than worthy of the few minutes it will take me to write one.  Their burritos are literally bursting at the seams with your choice of succulent, slow-cooked meats (my favorite is the carnitas, followed by the carne asada); rice that rivals my Cuban abuelita's;  fresh and simple guacamole and pico, and a secret recipe hot sauce that brings just as much flavor as it does heat to each bite. Quesadillas and tacos are also delish (a friend who can't eat gluten loves these as they're made from corn instead of wheat flour). Total bang for your buck.
