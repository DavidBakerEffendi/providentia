Went for Breakfast and while eating my pancakes i got a mouth full of plastic/paper.  We complained to the waitress and she advised the cook must have accidentally cooked a butter wrapper into the pancake.  She offered to bring me another pancake but i declined.  I had lost my appetite at this point.   When the bill came i was very surprised to see we were charged full price for both meals, even though half my plastic filled pancake was left on the plate.  During check out, the owner asked how everything was, we told him as well what happened.  He said I'm sorry as he continued to swipe our card and charge us.   No offer to give us any type of credit or effort to keep a customer.  We will not be back.
