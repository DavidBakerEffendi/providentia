This place has been a standard go to for me for a long time.  The staff is fun, especially at the bar, and the food and drink offerings are well above average for the price.  Try the raspberry mojito and the spicy dry rub chicken wings, best in the city on both counts. This place does get really busy for lunch, but i've never waited more then about 20 minutes for my food to come out, almost always less.  If your in a rush just order a Buffalo chicken Sand. or a Pulled Pork Sand. they both come out really fast.  Keep it up Devil's Alley!
