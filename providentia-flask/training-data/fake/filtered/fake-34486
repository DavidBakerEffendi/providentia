I used to go to Star Tavern with my wife on a regulr basis until we realized how rude and inconsiderate the staff is. We came in one Sunday and asked to be seated in a boothbut the gum chewing hostess informed us there were non available. She stated the best she could do for us was to give us a table near the bar. We reluctantly took the table near the bar.  We sat down and a patron at the bar had his rear end almost in my wifes face.  I went over to the hostess to request a change of seats after a booth had opened up and I explained to her the problem we were having sitting near the bar. Now I consider myself to be an easy lets along kind of guy and didn't for the life of me understand what the problem was in having us moved to a booth. Since we had not been served or had received any drinks.  The gum chewing hostess told me it was against there company policy to move a cash paying patron to another seat after they have been seated already.  Andat this point the nasty rude Manager Miss anorexia chimes in to second her opionion and offered up her rude comments.   Will I ever go back there not even if my childrens lives depended on it!  In my opinion I think anyone going in there needs there head examined  for overpaying for pizza you can get cheaper elsewhere.  Nor would I reconsider them for a positive remark.  In my book service means more than what a pizza tastes like.  And courtesy towards your customer is how I measure your review.  Eek! IS TO KIND A WORD  FOR THESE S_ _ M BAGS.  Go here at your own turmoil if you do not mind having a terrible night.
