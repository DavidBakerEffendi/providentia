We stopped at Isabella's on 8/31/2013 because it looked quaint and had outdoor seating. The restaurant was quite busy on this hot, Saturday afternoon. My first impression was that of a busy, NYC cafe. Nothing special and nothing bad. While waiting for seating I visited the restroom. Dirty and cramped is the best way to describe it. Xcelerator hand dryer located over the toilet??? Toilet paper on the floor flying all over the bathroom while I'm drying my hands (over the toilet). Gross. Once seated outside, our waitress was friendly but we had to wait a bit for pretty much everything, including a straw. I ordered the chopped salad (think Greek salad) with shell steak. I was very disappointed. the salad had no reall taste and the steak was VERY fatty. At $8 extra for the steak, I was disappointed. 1/2 of the steak was not edible. My daughter had (runny) scrambled eggs since this was still considered brunch. The lemon fries was good. My friend had the grilled chicken skewer salad and said it was tasty. My bloody mary was nothing special, and the more I drank it the more I was questioning the chunks of horseradish that I was swallowing since my experience at Isabella's left me questioning the cleanliness of the restaurant. Our bill came to $64 for 3 people including the bloody mary and a belini. I will never come back here again and I do not recommend this restaurant, especially when there are thousands of others to choose from.
