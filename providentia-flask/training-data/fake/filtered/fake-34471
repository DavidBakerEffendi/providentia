We were visiting friends in Weathersfield and stopped at the diner for lunch.  There were 4 of us, with another 4 joining us.  We got a booth and when the next one opened up, the waitress set it and reserved it for our friends.  I ordered the meatloaf sandwich, which was huge! I could only eat half.  It was delicious. Other meals at our table included a roast beef wrap, a cheeseburger, and a chicken wrap. All were fresh, filling, and delicious.  For 4 sandwiches and 4 beverages our bill came to $46.  They take cash and local checks only, which we discovered only after sitting down.  A sign outside would be helpful for people that rely on debit cards.  We loved the food and the experience.  We will be back next time we are in town!
