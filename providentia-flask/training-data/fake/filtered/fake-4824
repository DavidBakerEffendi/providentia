Ok, so last minute decision to go into this place. First off the set up is weird. It was empty on a Sunday evening. I ordered a mojito which the waitress did not even know of. Eventually I got it and it was gross. Our calamari was cold and for ten dollars there was hardly any on the plate. Our entrees weren't bad. But the manager was hounding us like a dog. We couldn't get any private time. Our waitress was stressed and idk why since there was no one in there. Then the bathroom is not even in that restaurant but across into fuddruckers . When over there I was upset that we weren't eating there instead. Lots of ppl and the food smelt great. Overall this place kind of sucks. Not worth the money. Go to fuddruckers.
