Best breakfast in boonton consistently. My girlfriend and I consider boonton bagel our first choice followed by the food truck for a good BEC or TEC. There are cheaper options but you get what you pay for. Always high quality ingredients and made with care. Â We both work in the service industry and I appreciate paying a little more if it means the bacon is crispy and the cheese is great!!!
