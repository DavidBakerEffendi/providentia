aight mate...so they server strongbow... one of few many places in the city to know a good cider... jameson & local beers on special are a plus but the burger...  the burger.... the burger. not only did i indulge in the basic..pyt burger. i had to go for 2nds on the tlc .  i stayed away from the burger of the week to save some savoring for another visit.   the owner and staff omit the air of entitlement that just says...im from pyt bitch...get used to it.... which kindof turned me off at first but you know what... i love it
