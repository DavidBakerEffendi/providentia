Delicious meal at Cookshop. Service was superb, food was divine. Had the beer battered line beans, squash with blue-cheese, sauteed octopus to start. My trout for the main course was delicate, well seasoned and savory. The greens that accompanied the dish were crisp, crunchy and had an asian taste. Someone in my party ate the the lamb, which was buttery, yet light. For dessert we shared the Peanut Butter Tart, Mixed Berry Crumble and the Angel food Cake. I especially loved the tart and crumble. One of the best meals I have ever eaten. Everyone was very pleased!
