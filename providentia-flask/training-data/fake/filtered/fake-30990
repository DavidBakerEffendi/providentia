Sally's pizza is the best in New Haven.  I was born and raised in New Haven and would rank the Big Three: Sally's, then Modern, and a far third Pepe's.  Pep's became too commercialized.  Modern is the best atmosphere, but Sally's is the best overall pie.  Anyone who gives it a low score based on the service has never read a review of the place or been prepared for what happens there.   You go to Sally's prepared to wait.  It's just the way it goes, but it's totally worth it.  Don't bring small kids that can;t keep still.  Don;t huff and puff when it takes too long.  Don't be that guy.  Just sit back and realize you are taking in a part of New Haven's history and cultural, and when the pizza comes....enjoy it immensely!!
