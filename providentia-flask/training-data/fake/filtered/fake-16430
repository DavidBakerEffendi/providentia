This place is Horrible!!!! Been there once and will never go there again. the "famous" burger sucks! it has no taste, its huge and not in a good way, and it just looks like a sloppy massive ball of ground beef with no other condiments. The french fries look like crap, disgustingly oily. ThIs has to be the worst Diner ever! the place looks dirty. How can you possibly give these people a 5 star. and the Service was probably the worst i've ever experienced. The waitress was busy talking to the other workers and completely ignored me and my boyfriend. i sat there waiting for a refill because i couldnt get her attention while i tried to swallow that nasty meat ball. STAY AWAY!!!!
