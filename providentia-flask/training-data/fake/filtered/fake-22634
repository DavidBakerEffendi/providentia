We heard wonderful things about this restaurant and so took two out-of-town friends to have dinner there on a Friday night.  There was a substantial wait, which was fine, and the hostess was more than friendly.  However, once we were seated, 30 minutes passed with no server.  Finally he shows up and asks cooly if we know what we want.  We had some questions.  He highly recommended the peppers, which apparently have been aging in olive oil since the rule of Caesar or something.  So we order them.  Then we wait for what seemed like a lifetime (more like an hour) with no food, no approach to our table, no explanation.  I flag the waiter and ask if we will be eating tonight.  Shortly thereafter, all of the food (salads, entrees, sides, all of it) unceremoniously plops down on the table at once.  Amidst the morass, I see two smaller than jalapeno sized peppers.  I accidentally verbalize my shock that they are $3.25 each.  The waiter gives me an annoyed look.  This guy in the black rimmed glasses and the toussled blond hair should be fired.  He's either just a jerk, or stupid, or both.   The food was solid.  I've had better Italian but it was fine.  It's hard to say though, because the service experience at Frankie's was so unapologetically horrifying.  I can say that I will never go back and I will tell every person I know how terrible it is so that they are not steered in the wrong direction too.  The food would need to be pretty groundbreaking to be worth waiting for an hour and a half and getting treated like dirt by some self-righteous failed screenwriter who thinks he's too good to act like a human being.
