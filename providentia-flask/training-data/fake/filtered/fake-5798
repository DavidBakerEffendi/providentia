The Counting Room is an amazing spot to meet friends, have a cocktail or a glass of wine from an impressive wine list, and share a plate or two...or three.  Great local beer list too for the non-wine drinker. The dual space is incredible and the atmosphere, laid back and fun.  The food is wonderful, affordable, and prepared in a tiny "kitchen" behind the bar - right in front of you.  The aroma of sizzling garlic and herbs invites you in from the street, or lures you up from the cocktail lounge below.  Must-haves from the local menu are the herbed croutons, deviled eggs, and fresh ricotta cheese.  Carnivores will LOVE the meat plate.  Staff is friendly and welcoming.  A perfect brunch spot - especially in warm weather when the industrial garage doors are up.  Check it out before you can't get in!
