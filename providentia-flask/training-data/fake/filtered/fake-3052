Ordering over the phone was fine and I was told that delivery of our 2 large pies would be within the hour. To me, that means an hour or less. I guess it depends on perspective... Anyway, the delivery person arrived 1 hour and 20 minutes later. That's a really long wait, in my opinion, especially for a new customer. Â With that said, the pizza was obviously cold, the slightly burnt crust was too thin for my family's liking, and there was hardly any cheese covering the red sauce. The cheese was scarce. Will find another pizza place.
