Can you say another hyped up Williamsburg joint?  People were literally pushing me to get their famous fried chicken on a biscuit.  Are you kidding me?  This chicken sandwich or chicken on a biscuit tasted like, and I'm not exaggerating, a piece of chicken i would fry up at home on a pillbury buttermilk biscuit with frank's hot sauce.  I thought I was going to get blown away with a southern flavor.
