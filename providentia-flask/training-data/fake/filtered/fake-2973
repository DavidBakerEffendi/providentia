Excellent food. The best place to sit and enjoy the food is their bar. One can see how the food is cooked and can enjoy the meal once its ready. Starting from the host to the servers all are friendly. Also they have this wine list from A&M liquor, if you forget to bring your wine with you not a problem, the host would order it for you and wine would be on your table before your appetizers. Love their oysters and spiced tuna. Best place to get continental food.
