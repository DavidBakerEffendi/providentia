Pizza is good BUT we have been overcharged the last 3 times that we ate there. Tried to give them benefit of the doubt for adding incorrectly, but 3 times is way too much of a coincidence to not think we are just being intentionally overcharged each time. After speaking with other local neighbors, I have discovered that they have had the same issues so it seems that they are just adding a couple of dollars to each check.
