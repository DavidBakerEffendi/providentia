We had a great party using the Jeremiah's Cafe & Catering. The food was excellent and tasteful. The owner went above and beyond to make sure the event was perfect. The presentation of the food was great. I was highly impressed that she served the food in home style dinnerware vs. an institutional catering dinnerware. It gave the feeling that the food was home cooking. The price was reasonable as well. My guest are still commenting about the quality of the food after the party. I would definitely use Jeremiah's again.
