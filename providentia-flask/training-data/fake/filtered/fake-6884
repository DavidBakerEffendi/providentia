Went here on Mother's Day - had a wonderful brunch.  Two of us had omelets, one had a burrito, another had mussels and another had chicken blt sandwich.  Every one enjoyed their meal.  Waitress was very friendly and even convinced us to have dessert because it was Mother's Day.  She suggested a banana dessert (banana bread, ice cream, caramelized bananas and caramel) it was definitely amazing !!!!!!!! Will be back again to try dinner.
