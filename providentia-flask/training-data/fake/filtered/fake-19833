Hate to be a party pooper but this joint just didn't do it for me. Maybe the overwhelming decor affected my overall gastronomical experience but everything was freakishly sugary and too heightened for finer senses. A recent trip to Billyburg made me realize Astoria has quite the way to go to reach them heights. Just sayin'.
