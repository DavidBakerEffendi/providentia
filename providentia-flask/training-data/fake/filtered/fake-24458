On Dec. 13th, Custodi Caterers provided the food for our company holiday luncheon, although this was not my first experience with Custodi is was for my company. Ron arrived right on time with all the necessary accessories as promised and the set up was fast and complete. But the most important part was the food, which was excellent. All my co-workers raved about everything, from the cold salads to the pulled pork.  The pasta was perfect, the chicken savoy divine and the roast beef and the chicken wings perfect.  My favorite was the meatballs and the eggplant rollatini. I would gladly recommend Custodi Caterers over and over again and they will be our first call next year for our holiday party.
