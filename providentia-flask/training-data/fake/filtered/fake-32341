These guys make the best humus I know. Im a vegetarian and glad that they served a great tasting falafel. Many falafel restaurants use very bland spices but these guys know what they are doing. Â I will be back shortly to try other items on the menu such as the eggplant dish (cant remember the name). Also service was amazing.
