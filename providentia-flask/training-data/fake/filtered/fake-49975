The first time I ordered delivery, the manager called me to tell me it would be 45 minutes. I said that was fine (have waited that long for pizza). She arrived when she said she would, and the food was good. I ordered coconut soup, which was delicious, and I also ordered pad thai, but that was not very good. Anyway, now I ordered from Jeera a second time. Delivery. It's been 3 hours, and I have not seen my food. I am starving, and ticked as I would have just as easliy gone to the store to pick up some food to cook. I should really be waiting to write this review, but I have to say: BEWARE. The food is delicious, but the delivery service is just plain AWFUL.
