My two cents: Royale crafts the best all around cheeseburger that I've personally inhaled in my 2.5 years in NYC.  It is not the meatiest, cheesiest, hugest, In-n-Out -est, or cheapest, but it is the best fusion of these elements.  It is the near-perfection of the genre. It is like when Kanye did Be. It is like when you first had weed from California. Like when you first used flippers to swim. Their fries are the perfection of the thin cut form, similarly. Actually, on second thought, they may be the outright champs for best buns.   Definitely worth a first try if you've had the rest.
