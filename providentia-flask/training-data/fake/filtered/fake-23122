My experience at Varalli can be summed up as follows: beautiful setting with smooth jazz-inspired music, great service, delicious food. Crispy Zucchini was a great appetizer. Main dish was the seafood risotto. Risotto was to die for, but the lobster and shrimp were slightly overdone. Enjoyed a chocolate and hazelnut brownie special for dessert (divine.) And if you like blueberry and prosecco, definitely try one (or three!) of the Varalli Apertivos.
