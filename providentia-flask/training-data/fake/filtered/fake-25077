Though I've been a New Yorker for the most of my life, I tend to avoid Hipster joints and most of the time, I just hate those places. They're loud, full of obnoxious and drunk people. But this place has been great for the most part. Seating is generally pretty fast, and the food is great! Still, don't bring your kids along with you.
