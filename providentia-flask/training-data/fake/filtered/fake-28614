If the goal of a bar is to make you full and get you drunk, then, by definition, this is the only bar I've ever been to in NYC. I have been here probably 6-8 times over the past 3 months, have had the same great experiences every time, and have never left not completely full and hammered.  It is unfortunate that Hurricane Sandy really destroyed the surrounding area and this bar, so they are still repairing and is not currently the most aesthetically pleasing place.  However, what they don't currently have in frills they make up for ten fold in food and service.  The owner, Jeff, and his two bartenders are the nicest servers I have experienced in NYC.  Their chicken wings are also the best I have ever had in the city (get the buffalo and/or Momma's ginger wings).  According to other reviews, their seafood is really good.  I have yet to try any of it because I never want to miss out on the wings while I'm there, but will try the drunken fish soup next time.
