After I lived 5 stoops from this place last year, I finally decided to splurge and check it out: the colorful cocktails, upbeat Spanish tunes in the background, and delicious looking, fresh, entrees (not to mention the delicious looking waiters) have been tempting me ever since I laid eyes on the place. This is a great place to have fresh, quality Spanish food, with an extensive array of seafood dishes and the best ceviche I've ever had in the city Â (not to mention its amazing presentation). Also a good place to go for cocktails or happy hour (I recommend the house Mojito, served with a sugar cane stick and a small bouquet of mint leaves). I personally would recommend this for couples or first daters....enjoy!
