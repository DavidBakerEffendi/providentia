I went to the Mint Thai Cuisine on a recommendation from a friend. I stopped in today for lunch and was instantly taken in by how clean the place was (a big bonus for me) and how appealing the design of the place was. Â My server's name was Rocky and he was great. He was friendly and courteous. As far as the food goes, my compliments to the chef as the food was delicious. Their prices are reasonable. I would highly recommend this place and I look forward to going back.
