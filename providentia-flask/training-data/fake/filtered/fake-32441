Wow! Went into Murphy's on a late Saturday afternoon expecting a crowded college bar atmosphere with standard pub food. Very surprised. This was the most inspired menu that I have seen in the Hanover/Lebanon region in awhile. Great service, great beer selection and a fabulous locally sourced menu. Lobster & kale salad with butternut squash & goat cheese, curried chick peas with falafel, pork dumplings, and the egg, sausage & caramelized onion brunch sandwich ALL delicious and well seasoned.
