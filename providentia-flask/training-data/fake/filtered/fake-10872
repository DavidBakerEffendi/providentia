PROS: Best ramen in the city. You also need to try the Shrimp buns as well as the Pork buns in the appetizer column. Atmosphere, decor, drinks.. and did I mention best ramen in Manhattan? CONS: The WAIT. They don't take reservations so you need to go there and put your name down, then remain in the area for when they call you. I understand it's Manhattan and some establishments do this, but no one likes it and I'm pretty certain it's avoidable.
