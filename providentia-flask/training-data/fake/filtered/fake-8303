My family and I were disappointed in our experience at Chickie and Petes on Roosevelt Blvd..  The hostess were very unfriendly and rude, not sure why they have a policy on not seating complete parties, but that may be part of the problem that there are so many people just milling around in your way when you are trying to eat. The service was fantastic; however that was the only positive aspect of our evening. The food was below average and costly.  I guess if you are there to watch a game it is a great place to be, however to take your family somewhere to eat, there are a lot better places in Philly to go.
