Perhaps you need to take Chili Willie's for what it is -- while the restaurant has some tasty authentic Mexican food, it's probably best to take-out and bring it back home.  The tiny restaurant appears to be its biggest drawback, always leaving the restaurant feeling overpacked and unbearable.  The food, though, travels perfectly fine and is undoubtedly more enjoyable in the comfort of your own home.
