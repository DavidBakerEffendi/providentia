Great little spot with a great vibe and great pizza surrounded by warehouses. Place was very cute. Nice vibe and great music. Young hipster crowd and everything we had was good. We were a party of 5 on a Wednesday night and apparently beat the rush. We didn't wait but a few minutes later there was a line. Everything we had was yummy. My personal favorite was the margherita pizza. The calzone was also great. It comes with ham and mushrooms.The dough was thin and flaky and not a typical heavy calzone which I preferred . The romaine lettuce salad was good but could have used a few more roasted walnuts. The cheese and meat plate was a great starter. It had three different types of cheeses all good. The only disappointment was the Dessert menu we couldn't find anything that appealed to us so decided to skip it and go somewhere else. This was dissapointing because we were enjoying the place, music and vibe and would def have stayed there instead of having to go somewhere else for some chocolate cake :-) Â  The garden looked adorable and a cool place to hang out I would definitely return and recommend trying it.
