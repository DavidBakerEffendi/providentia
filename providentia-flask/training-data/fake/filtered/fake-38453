I am not one to write reviews but I was so upset that I just had to. I was really excited to  go to this place and ended up leaving with zero desire to go back. Their attention sucks!!! Waiters have no manners and act as if you were bothering them every time you call them to ask questions or even order. I tried ordering  a drink and had to practically scream to the waiter cause apparently  they walk away as you talk to them. Their bread was ice cold, food was bland but not terrible. My poor review is because of their terrible service.  They were the epitome of rude.... go somewhere else. There are a ton of restaurants where you will get a great service.
