This bar is Great!!! It has a great selection of wine and some very different beers.  Heidi & Ed are great, they make you feel right at home and they are very funny & welcoming!  I have tried almost everything on the menu and can't decide on what's my favorite because they're all great.  I plan on going at least once a week and I don't think I can move out of the UES now because this local bar is such a perfect addition!
