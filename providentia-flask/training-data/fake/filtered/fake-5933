Wow... so far it's another overrated white-washed fusion restaurant. Puffer fish: tasted like cheap fish or old fried shrimp. they added to the side some phony ja ja myun sauce and weird veggie noodle. The apple kimchi should have been made with real kim chi (they served it with BACON???) and their real kimchi was REALLY salty and the sauce was thick. Momofuku Ssan is a korean fusion restaurant with white chefs which (ahem) already says something BUT the drinks were good :) oh yeah, the much heralded pork bun was not bad. I should have gotten oysters but the puffer fish stopped me. If you really like Korean food, this place is sh*t. But I'd totally come back for drinks. OH, real bummer. they don't have kimchi bloody mary's anymore! that was the main reason why I chose this joint.
