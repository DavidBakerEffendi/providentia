The customer service was the poorest I have ever received at any restaurant.  When we arrived we were not allowed to be seated because we were still waiting for the rest of our party to arrive.  This is understandable if the place is full, but there were only 2 other tables filled at the time.  We asked to have coffee while we waited and were given the choice to stand outside in the cold with a to-go cup, or have coffee while waiting at the bar.  We asked if coffee was free refills and were assured it was, so we thought it would be no big deal to pay for coffee at the bar, then transfer to our table where we would enjoy refills.  When the rest of our party arrived a few minutes later, we were seated at a table that was situated so closely to the another table that we were not able to get in, so we asked to be moved to another table with more room.    After eating the server brought our check without asking if it was together or separate, and then seemed upset when we asked for the check to be split.  Upon reviewing our check, we noticed we had been charged for 3 coffees.  When I inquired about this the server was very disrespectful when I explained that we'd already paid for coffee at the bar and had been told that we would receive free refills.  My husband had asked for a to-go cup and was also charged for this coffee.  So that brought us to a total of 5 coffee chargers for 2 people for breakfast.  When we asked to speak with a manager about the matter, it turns out the disrespectful server we'd had the entire time actually was the manager!  Though the food was good, I will never return due to the rude treatment we received.  I would also not recommend this place to any friends.
