AWFUL SERVICE! We used to order from this place frequently and had recently noticed a down turn in service. Recently, a group of people from the office placed an order and they forgot a sandwich. After calling back once and promising to bring the sandwich, it never showed. After call 2, they tried to tell us that they gave us the sandwich. After 10 minutes of arguing that the sandwich was in the bag, the owner finally agrees to bring the sandwich over. Nothing like being made out to be a criminal instead of a customer. They have lost the business of our entire 1000 person operation.
