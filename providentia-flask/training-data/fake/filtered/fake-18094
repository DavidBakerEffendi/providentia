Very good at the Thai staples -- great curry and noodles (especially the Spicy Flat Noodles). One major disappointment is the calamari they use -- it doesn't seem particularly fresh, it's shaped like fusilli pasta and is always very tough/chewy -- and the individual pieces are so large you want to cut them, but since Thai restaurants do not usually provide knives, you have to carve at it with your spoon or fork. BUT, if you avoid the calamari, you will be happy.
