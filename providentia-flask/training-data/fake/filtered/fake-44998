My 2nd time at this place! The first time i had a selection of small plates and my girls and I shared among each-other. I was WOW-ed the 1st time i went! our waitress was friendly and the place itself was very cozy and welcoming! So, i decided to go for lunch again for the 2nd time and as i looked over the menu i realized the menu selection was not all that great. They have too much small plate appetizers and not enough "Mediterranean style cooking" as the rest. claims to be! Anyhow, i gave it a 3 because it was not as good as i thought! Most likely i will not be back here again!
