I love this place. The billboard on 95 says it all "best Italian in CT". I am always greeted with a smile and the food is so delicious. My favorite is the chicken dish with spinach, mushrooms, in a cream sauce! The complimentary appetizer, tomato bruschetta and sparkling wine at the end of your meal you can't beat either!
