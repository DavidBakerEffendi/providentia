In Philly on business, went to Pat's for lunch.  We talked about doing a comparison between Pat's and Gino's, but never got past Pat's.  Honestly, the steak was so good at Pat's I wouldn't want to risk it next time ... I'm going back to Pat's!     The four of us all agreed, Pat's is off the chain !
