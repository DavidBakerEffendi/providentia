I got food poison from the clams two days ago. I am still feeling it today on Easter .Thank you so much don peeps for poising me and also for making my holiday the worst ever by being in the hospital. When you go their make sure you ask for that little shit at the door John. They should take him out of their rude and cocky thinks he is a movie star or gangster. Looking forward to getting some legal advice or not. See you in court don Peppe Im sure you are use to it already...
