I have lived in Wayne my entire life and the Paris Inn has always been a great spot for fine dining.  The decor around the bar and dining area is classic with a bit of old romance, also great if you're looking for privacy. The variety of entertainment adds to the charm and ambiance. I have eaten at the Paris Inn many times, including my  mother's repast and the food has always been excellent and plentiful. I was very happy with the buffet package; i was able to select from an array of interesting entrees, not just the old standard issue, including seafood. The banquet room was beautiful, the service was great, and the price was right in line with my budget!!  Mr. Paris and his son, Tony, extend a warm greeting and are very accommodating and attentive...they make you feel very welcome.  If it's fabulous personal attention you are looking for, look no further, visit the Paris Inn!!
