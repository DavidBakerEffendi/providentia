oh what a Mexican place, I am very impress with the fresh press trotilla, they have everything made fresh every day, the queso is very good also the gaucomoley is very good, I had burrito and chips & queso,  the meat,steak,chicken,and carnitas are much better then Moe's, after eating at Panchero's I will never go to Moe's again, because the service so bed, the food is ugly taste, and it's don't make fresh. Also the pancheros staff is friendly and the manager is so kind and help full for as a new customer and is very attentive for customer, His motto was you know what you want and that why he explain every thing to me and help giving shample tast for all tree meat. I would recommend this place in my book 1st place as a Mexican restaurant.I would say who like Mexican food put pancheros Mexican grill  in your list  .         Thanks for good food in the Hamilton area.
