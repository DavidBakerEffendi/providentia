We had lunch Â on 11/11/14 we eat here every once in a while when in the area and have always been satisfied , this time was different. Our server was great she did an outstanding job, my wife ordered Alfredo with. Cesar and I got house salad with a mini pizza. Our salads arrived and we started eating as my wife was picking black olives from her salad she discovered a good size bug in the salad. We notified the kitchen manager he came out and said that was gross but it happens....huh?! He told us their lettuce is ordered washed it saves them time prepping and these slip through once in awhile, his attitude was quite indifferent. they comped the salad and entree for my wife needless to say we won't be recommending this restaurant to people we know nor will we ever eat there again. I expect more self accountability in situations like this they could have taken an opportunity to show us they care and kept a customer...
