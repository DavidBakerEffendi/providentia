OK...been coming here for almost 30 years, but you really need to consider if you want to go to a wonderful brunch restaurant and get treated like a tourist just because it is the summer.   Is it really necessary to ask me basic restaurant related questions almost implying that I have  NEVER eaten in a restaurant before....was in the business for 10+ years actually??  And it is even worse to have a college student or aspiring actor or even a graduate of NYU who is old enough to be my child talk to me as if I can't read what's on the menu.   But the WORST is charging me $3.50 for an iced tea (in the summer no less) that is HIGHLY diluted to begin with in a glass FILLED with ice, remove the glass from the table before the initial iced tea is even finished and pointedly ask me if I'd like "ANOTHER" iced tea, all for the benefit of charging me another $3.50 for another glass of above mentioned beverage.  Really.....not everyone who goes to brunch in NYC in July is a tourist....maybe just an old time TriBeCa resident, who has patronized the place since the 80's who'd like a wonderful Eggs Benedict to start my lazy Sunday!!!  The foods great but the restaurant attitude of years gone by has got to go away!!!
