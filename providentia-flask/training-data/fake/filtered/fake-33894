I've been reading about OS for some time and have been dying to try it.  It was OK.  I do have one major complaint, I found the food underseasoned.  Normally I would just add a pinch of salt and be happy.  Apparently the chef does not believe the customers can adjust seasoning to their own taste (yes, we are all a bit different) as they provide no salt or pepper on the table.  Perhaps I could have asked, but why should I.  It is merely arrogance on the part of a chef who does not accept that we all have different palates.  So, the buffala mozz with very little taste rendered the salad and the personal pizza bland.  A pinch of salt would have brightened the dishes.  (also, a hint...pre-cook your pizza crust and make it a bit thinner, it was wet and gummy). Service was however excellent and our very attentive waitperson was lovely. Would I go again?  Maybe, but I would be sure to insist on salt and pepper on the table.
