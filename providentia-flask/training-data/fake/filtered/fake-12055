We are DONE with this place... The atttitude from the hostess, at the very least (not to mention wait staff, that has no idea what the meaning of  "a service industry" means) is enough! Every time  we go there, it's a 45minute wait.... So despite the fact we have a $100 we are just going to rip it apart. There are plenty of new and much more interesting spots within a two-block radius, that I cannot justify wasting time to even just check anymore!
