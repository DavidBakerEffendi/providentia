We were taken here by a family member who lives in NYC. It was busy and Â we waited 5 minutes. The owner personally greeted us and the service was excellent. I have never had ethiopian food and really enjoyed it. we ordered Chicken combination dishes and beef combination dishes. We were able to try all the vegetarian dishes as different sides. After the great food, we tried two desserts;the apple tart and a mocha chocolate bake. I was blown away and hope that they stay busy and open. There were very yummy and quality! I highly recommend this place!
