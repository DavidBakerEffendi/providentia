It was a quiet Tuesday lunch at the restaurant we waited and waited and waited finally a server acknowledged us not particularly friendly. Would not substitute chips for my fries no big deal. Well we waited to order and had to wait another 45 minutes for food to arrive. Chips were to die for rest of food wad okay. Coup de grace was the indifferent service did not feel like a customer felt like an intruder. Will not be back. It seems attitude has got ahead of itself at this place.
