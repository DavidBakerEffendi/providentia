The food was average but not better than my Aunties cooking!! the fried chicken was ok then I realized it wasnt crunchy Â becasue it soaked up the juices from the collards they put on my plate. eww nothing worst then soggy fried chicken. just about everything had hot sauce on it here. I also ordered hush puppies, they are not the hush puppies im used too and i certaintly dont put tarter sauce on them. Biscuits were big hard and dry. The black eye peas is a cold salad not my favorite at all. Our mac n cheese was cold. When I got home I ate the chocolate donut from here and it was very good. It was about 7 of us in our group and some of us actually left still feeling a little hungry, thats a bad feeling. Small intimate spot with a long wait. parking is crazy but I got lucky once I arrived to find a parking spot. Im glad I was with my family because they made it fun, love them!! I would possibly go back to this spot but for now no rush, so on to the next good spot.
