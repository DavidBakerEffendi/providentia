Well, these guys don't need my 5 star review! Sunday night dinner, Justin was our waiter. Everyone we encountered was gracious and knowledgeable. We had a Tazmanian sparkling rose to start -good. Then came a couple a rolls and butter, housemade I'm sure. Then the amuse-bouche, mini filled bagel with a smoked bluefish spread. Next we had the chili lobster w/Siracha sauce and Texas toast and the Kampachi apps. Another person came over to instruct us on how to eat the kampachi - trust me, you just have to try it...Iron Chef stuff!! Delicious! On to the entrees....halibut en croute and the striped bass. Wonderful! All this washed down with a 2008 Bonny Doon Le Cigar Volant from a well stocked wine list. Oh yea, dessert was a floating island of meringue in lemon verbena sorbet. Fantastic meal, best we had in New York, will definitely return on future visit.
