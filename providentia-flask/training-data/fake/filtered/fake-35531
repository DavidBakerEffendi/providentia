After making a reservation in advance, the hostess asked us to move to another table because another party had a reservation at our current table in about 20 min.  We hadn't even had time to order dinner yet.  But, we were hungry, so we picked up and moved to a bar table. At that bar table, we found ourselves having to ask the bus boy for ketchup, mustard, the check, etc. because our server was MIA.  Then, as we were waiting for the check, the hostess came to our table for a second time, telling us that she needs the table for yet another reservation, so we need to leave asap.  Who does that?  This woman, and apparently this restaurant.  Sometimes I let poor service slide when the food is great.  However, it was such a problem here that I will not be back, and I really did like their food and drink.
