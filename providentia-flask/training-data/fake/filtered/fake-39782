I live in the Fairmount neighborhood and have had a drink at London on a bunch of occasions, they have a great tap list and the environment inside is agreeable. I haven't eaten there before 9pm ever but I've been told it's a completely different experience than the one I had this evening which was...pretty meh- bad. I work in food service and our server was lovely, I've had her serve me before and she is always quick with a suggestion and usually is managing the place by her lonesome and does a job of it. I asked her to suggest some menu items for me since I was too tired from working at my food service job to even decide with my friends what to share. We ended up with the periogies and fish and chips...I couldn't have been more disappointed! I couldn't believe the small portions for the money they were charging. I have no problem spending money on some really great food, I love food! I eat it everyday...sometimes more than once. The periogies were oily and covered in carmelized onions, also oily and bland. The fish in the fish and chips was a little soggy, at least not frozen but not fried well and it was on a bed of sad, limp fries. Â For $15 we got TWO...two, medium to small sized pieces of fish...that is literally robbery, white fish is not expensive and neither are fries, the markup on this dish is outrageous. The tartar sauce was nothing special and even the vinegar tasted bland! Could it have killed them to put a dash of salt and pepper on the plate? I don't know who they have working the kitchen late night (not even late night at 9pm on a Friday) but I will NOT be back there to eat after a shift. I'm willing to try it out in the midday when it's been suggested to me that the main chef is working and he does a great job of cooking the food properly. Just sad that a neighborhood spot can't hold it's own for some simple bar food.
