i moved to brooklyn from sydney, australia about 10 months ago and i can honestly say this place is my FAVOURITE cafe in new york... and i know good food, i have been to a TON Â of cafes in manhattan and brooklyn and nothing really deserves a 5 star rating quite like 5 Leaves. I NEVER write reviews but i love this place so much, I had to write it a killer review.. i mean , the ricotta pancakes, truffle fries, moroccan scramble... EVERYTHING here RULES! bloody marys are great here and the staff are super nice and chilled... they are great at their job and add to the overall experience here for sure.. make sure you go here! you will probably have to wait a short while to be seated cause everyone is wanting a seat! but its WELL worth it! i promise you will be returning back like I have ever since i went for the first time, this place is super special for sure..
