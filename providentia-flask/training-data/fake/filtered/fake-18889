A Pizza unfulfilled I don't get it. If you like pizza that tastes burnt, like really burnt. You'll love this place. I personally love a good coal oven flavor when done right, see Arturo's, but these guys are not doing it right. We actually returned our pie because we thought they screwed it up and burned it, turns out, that's how they make their pizza. Sadly the cheese, sauce and thickness was dead on, but ugh, burnt taste in my mouth with every bite, no thank you. Â This pizza will never meet it's potential.
