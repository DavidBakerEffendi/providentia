Best Sushi place! - I had about 15 pieces of Sushi and 2 hand rolls at lunchtime. I got really satisfied and enjoyed them a lot. The Omakase course came with Tuna, Albacore, Scallop with truffle, Crab with miso, stirred Kinmedai(Alfonsino), Toro(fatty tuna), and another chopped Toro, Anago(eel), Baby yellowtail, Beef with garlic, incredible Uni(sea urchin), Ikura(salmon roe) on a stirred Salmon, Aji(moonfish), Saba(mackerel), Crab Hand roll and Toro with green onion Hand roll, served one by one on the small plate. Every sushi looks very beautiful. Most are already seasoned with some kind of their special sauce or salt, so you don?t need soy sauce so much. Their special salt and sauce make their sushi unbelievable tasty and bring up the flavor of raw-fishes. Don't forget SAKE imported from Japan. The Sake goes with Sushi and those combinations make you excited!
