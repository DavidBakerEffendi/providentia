This is probably my favorite place to have brunch in the city. You gotta love latin food. Everything on the menu is unbelievably tasty. I actually don't think there is anything that I haven't tried. High 5 to the chefs. The food is consistently tasty, fresh & quick. I really love their burrito & omelete - it keeps me coming back for more. Service is always pleasant. I am still yet to dine here for dinner Will hopefully check it out one day soon. Will definitely do a rereview when I do. And as for brunch, it doesn't get much better that Calle Ocho. You won't regret the visit.
