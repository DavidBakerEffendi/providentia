Won't eat here again!  Went there for brunch today with friends and one friend has a food allergy. "hey, would it be possible to get that without the egg on top?" "sure, let me check." Returns white faced and embarrassed. Clearly balled out in the kitchen. "I'm sorry the kitchen said no." "But its a food allergy.  Can you put it on the side or something?" "oh..let me check"  returns embarrassed again " I'm really sorry but they won't allow for substitutions. " "really? No egg is a substitution?  Well maybe theres something else on the menu.  Hmm ... everything has an egg on it.  You're sure they can't leave the egg off?" "yeah, they won't do it.  I'm sorry." And because of that we had to leave.  Thank you kitchen for being a total d bag.
