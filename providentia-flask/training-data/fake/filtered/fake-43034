Being new to Bushwick, Brooklyn (six months now) as well as yelp (three reviews in) I am on a tour de force of adventure through out the boroughs for bars and restaurants and I gotta say - Montana's Trail House is currently reigning as my favorite. I love eating and drinking so very much. I love searching for delicious cocktails and bites where ever I am (living or visiting - and I've been all around the world). With that said... The drinks are so incredibly amazing it's retarded. The menu is extremely creative, fits with the space and theme and super delicious. Great use of spirits and house-made ingredients like apple butters, BLUEBERRY BASIL SYRUP (!!!) and smoked whiskeys. Not to mention the super tasty CURSE THROWER is pre-batched (already made and chilled) and is served super fast! AMAZING. ALSO YOU MUST TRY THE SWITCHEL! I love drinking and I love cocktails, but my new love is this stuff. Not only do you walk away a little buzzed but also feeling healthy from the house made apple cider vinegar fresh ginger and maple syrup! Well done! Not only are the drinks incredible, but the food is AH-MAZE-ING. Having now been a couple times, the first time I tried the stuffed squid, went back a few days later with a pal and learned the dish was replaced by a more seasonal appropriate squid salad. Saddened at first, I ordered it any way and it was even more incredible than the stuff squid. I wanted to order it again! Other dishes I am in love with is the Root Beer Brisket and the Master Fat Fried Potatoes! The service is super friendly and nice and spot on. Not to mention everyone there is exceptionally attractive. Nice, knowledgeable and hot? Well that nearly unheard of. The overall vibe is really fun, even moreso in their front yard that is for drinking and hanging out. Do you smoke cigarettes? They allow that out front too! All around, this might be one of the coolest places I've drank and ate at and can't wait to keep going back! THANKS GUYS!
