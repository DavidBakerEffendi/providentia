omg!!!!! i wish i Â could give 0...to this restaurant....food is so nasty...never thought i would be so disappointing..after reviewing yelp and visiting there....i guess all these servers must be new...they don't know...whats the ingredients.....i missed old waitresses .back then around a year earlier.they used to be so friendly and knew how to sell their food....but now its completely different..i wouldn't recommended other people from now on. when i asked to talk with manager then he was full of attitude and arrogant, he was around mid of his 40s...what a full of arrogance. i really regretted going there.nothing seems authentic..full of salt and oil....i really missed old yak...now its full of bizzares...yuck.....and finally its homepage says...and defines yak food...but came to know....no yak which sucks.....i really think...yak really has to change their food style and..bring their old servers....i wish them good luck in future..
