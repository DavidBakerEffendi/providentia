Hey guy, to keep it short, I have been here more than a few times only because I was craving Thai food, Â service was terrible every single time and not just the waiters but also the rest of the staff. I feel like they are doing me a favor by serving me. They don't stay open very late and exaggerate waiting times to make it look more busy than they are. The bar is extremely small and unaccomodating. If you don't mind the extra wait and have a car you might want to try Sea in Williamsburg, or for that matter any other Thai place in the area.
