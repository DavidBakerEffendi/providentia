Had dinner at this new joint two nights ago and would love to give it more stars had it not been for the sour experience we had. To start, everything was great. The hostess, all smiles, seated us promptly despite our lack of reservation (the place was packed!). Our waitress came, we ordered, and began to eat. Towards the middle of our meal, we heard a serious altercation going down between our waitress and who I assume is the owner or manager at a nearby table. I don't know what she had done, but she was being chewed out something nasty. On the contrary, our service was great all night and I can't imagine what could have gone wrong. This manager seemed to have it out for everyone while we were in there, and it made our dining experience not only uncomfortable but unenjoyable as well. I felt bad for the girl! Otherwise, food was pretty good (that sandwich, can't spell the name, but woah) and service great and very friendly. The place was modern with a giant cat mural. As others have said, the feline theme is a little over done, kind of tacky, but no big deal. What they really need to work on is their professionalism. Take the issues out of earshot and visibility, put on a smile, and invest in some more chairs - diners were tacked onto the ends of tables in lawn chairs.
