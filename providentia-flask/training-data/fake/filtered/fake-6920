I ordered from this restaurant and was not really pleased with their customer service I only ordered jalapeno poppers and 2 Oreo milkshakes  which were halfway melted I opened the door to receive my food  and I told the delivery guy to have a nice night he says that's it then screams no tip! I explained to him that I do not have cash on me maybe next time he yells and screams that he drove a long way from George street to west haven and he deserves a tip and i explained to him again that I do not have it right now maybe next time he yells and screams i also told him there are people in the house that are sleep and he continues to yell so I shut the door in his face to so no one will be  alarmed of the noise Then I called the restaurant and explained to the owner what happened and then told him there are people in the house sleep and your driver was here screaming about a tip which he didn't deserve the owner then says well I been in business for 40 years and you should have gave him a tip once again I explained about my family in the house and also I did not have any cash on me and next time he would get a tip but he continues to scream on the phone so I told him don't worry I will not order here again he goes good and hangs up in my face..... The worst service I have ever encountered and hope nobody tips them with a card because their service is really bad and from what I read the people that did tip have a huge regret because of their service From one manager to the next in customer service the customer is always right I feel like they tried to haggle if they have a big issue about delivery from New Haven to west haven maybe they need to lower delivery miles and again from one manager to the next maybe include the gratuity in the delivery charge as a whole so your delivery drivers wouldn't beg nor harrass your most needed customers
