Any other place in America, this place would have been 5 stars, but I'm pretty picky when it comes to New York pizza. I had a slice of cheese and a bite of the pepperoni (not because it was bad, just because it was my friends slice). The crust was crisp, which is my first check mark, the tomato sauce was a little on the tangy side, which is okay but not my fav. The cheese was a little more than I prefer. When there is too much cheese, I feel like the pizza slice is not balanced or trying to hide other ingredients. This is a great little spot if you want run in and eat a slice before a Broadway show. It's pretty small. Only fits about 5 people.
