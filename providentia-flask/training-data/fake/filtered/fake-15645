I tried this restaurant for the first time this week and was very impressed! Great atmosphere, nice music and not overly loud, great service. I had a really good cocktail, then the salmon, which was perfectly done. The price was totally reasonable and the quality of the food fantastic. What a nice treat! I will be back for sure.
