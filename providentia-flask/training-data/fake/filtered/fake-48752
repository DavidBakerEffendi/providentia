We reserved the private dining room for a family party.  In advance of the event, the management made helpful suggestions and cheerfully answered multiple questions.  The room was set up as promised, with appetizers waiting for us when we arrived.  It's upstairs and well away from the (noisy) main dining room and was very quiet, to our relief.  Our server, Robert, was absolutely outstanding, a true professional.   The food left nothing to be desired.   For example, roast trout with wild mushrooms; local chicken and vegetables; pork paprikas with homemade spaetzle. -  Enhanced & delicious comfort food.  Only downside was a bit of sticker shock.
