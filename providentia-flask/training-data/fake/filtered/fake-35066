We were looking to get crepes at the Creperie next door.  They weren't serving yet.  Neither was Saigon Shack but Mike, the owner, let us come in and order coffee while he was opening up the place.  Soon after he said we could order food too even though it was still a little before opening.  The Pho was delicious and the Grilled Pork Banh Mi was also very delicious.  Fresh ingredients, great atmosphere and the owner was super friendly.  We're so glad the Creperie wasn't open and we eneded up at this place...although we still got crepes for dessert!
