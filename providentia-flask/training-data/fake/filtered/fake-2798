I have never been treated so horrifically at a restaurant.  We had a party of 8.  We were meeting there at 5pm.  They would not seat our party until we were all there.  My husband and I were the last to arrive but the couple before us saw us pull into the parking lot.  They were about to seat us but since I was not through the door yet he gave our table to someone else.  If that was not bad enough, the owner returns to tell us it would be 1 1/2 hr. wait, only to return 5 minutes later to tell us it was now a 2 hr wait.  He was rude and arrogant.  So if you are willing to stand around waiting for hours and be treated as if you didn't matter, than this is the place to go.
