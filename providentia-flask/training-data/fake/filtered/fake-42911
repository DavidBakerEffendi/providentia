we arranged a holiday party with the downtown resturant. The deal was stuck with the owner. After we went there, to our disappointment, the owner didn't agree on the deal. After lot of back and forth, he finally agreed. He then gave us very very bad service, the food was not even served properly, cut down lot of items from the discussed menu. I would STRONGLY DISCOURAGE everyone to avoid the resturant at all cost.
