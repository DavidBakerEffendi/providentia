I won't go back to this place...had a terrible take-out experience there today.  Ordered Spanish Mackeral (among other things) and got something that was NOT Spanish Mackeral.  I called to explain and the host (who was a total prick) told me over the phone that it was, in fact Spanish Mackeral.  I've had Spanish Mackeral many times at many different sushi places.  Not only was this NOT Spanish Mackeral, whatever it WAS was terrible.  I actually took it back to the restaurant, showed them pictures I had looked up on my phone of what Spanish Mackeral actually looks like, and they STILL refused to do anything for me.  There are so many great sushi places in NYC...I would not bother with this place.
