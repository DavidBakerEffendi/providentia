My husband and I went to this cafe for Sunday brunch after reading exceptional reviews on yelp, and we were not disappointed. Yes, there were a lot of people, but the wait was no more than 20 minutes. We especially loved the quaint and cozy feeling of the place. We looked through the extensive menu while waiting so when we were seated, knew exactly what we wanted. The coffee was amazing! Nice and strong and of course, fresh. One of the best I've had in a cafe/diner. I ordered an Omlette and my husband a waffle with bananas, both delicious. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of lack of good service. We got the food quickly but there was no cutlery to eat it with. Even after asking for it twice, nobody seemed to respond until finally my husband got up to get it himself. Also there was no jam/jelly on our table for the toast and neither there was there syrup, salt and pepper on the adjacent table. They kept borrowing ours, which sort of disrupted our conversation. Despite a few flaws, I highly recommend the cafe for its delicious food. We are definitely going back soon!!
