I have been to this restaurant atleast 6 times and never been disappointed. All the servers have been pleasant and informative. I always get a table right away but only come for dinner. My favorites are the Blue cheese crusted filet mignon or Isabella's chopped salad. AMAZING. Some of the specials have been extremely good as well. Be cautious though- appetizers, wine, desserts etc. inflate the bill more than you would think.
