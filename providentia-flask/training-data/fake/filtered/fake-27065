We have tried oak haven 4 times now. The first time, right after they opened, was wonderful -- great food and atmosphere. Ever since the food has been bad (weird and superfluous seasonings on everything!! Let the Brussels taste like brussels, people!!) The scallops are good, but served on weird undercooked vegetables. Almost everything we have had has been average and has had a bizarre twist on it. The atmosphere is poor, unless you are going specifically to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender who talks and tells jokes loudly the entire evening. The waitstaff are always good, but that's not enough for us to come back.
