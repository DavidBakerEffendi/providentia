i found the pizza to be pretty good but the overall store appearance to be a little dirty. the staff is mostly men and they speak italian behind the counter . i studied italian in college and couldn't believe what they were saying in italian about their customers. i found the staff to be hard working and the one woman behind the counter is very unfriendly and rude.
