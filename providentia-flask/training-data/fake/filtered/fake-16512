I LOVE this place. Went to UVM and i was a frequent visitor. I can really only comment on the sushi rolls since that is all i ever got so my comments is that they are epic! I love their fresh made rolls and the mango martini is awesome! This restaurant makes me wish i still lived in burlington and is a must visit when i go back up. It is an intimate place so a reservation is deffinately recommended.
