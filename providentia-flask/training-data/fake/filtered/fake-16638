Pretty decent stuff.  I didn't know what to expect as I have never had doses before.  I tried the deluxe with the mango sauce and I must say the flavors were interesting.  The crepe was the best part. Nice and crisp.  Next time I must just try the sada which is just the crepe it self without the filling.  The interior is nice, but I can't say it will be a regular spot for me.  I wish they had other more traditional Indian menu items along side the dosa rolls.  Nice place nevertheless.
