I was thoroughly disappointed.  The first warning sign should have been the disenchanted waiter standing outside the door not trying to escort customers inside like every other restaurant in Little Italy.  When we entered, it took a couple of minutes to be seated as we were ignored for a bit.  (This is a tiny place.)  The crust of the bread was quite hard, not delicious but not terrible.  The chicken cacciatore was very unpleasant to look at and not all that pleasant to eat.  Everyone in my group left very disappointed and feeling quite gross.  I will never go back and recommend you never try it.
