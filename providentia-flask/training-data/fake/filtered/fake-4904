Had a horrible experience at this restaurant this past weekend.  It is a very small restaurant, the food was mediocre and they "conveniently" lost our reservation for a party of 8 made 3 weeks prior and reconfirmed with them twice .Apparently big parties over the weekend they just can't handle....it is poorly run on the business side and the food is just average Italian. The restaurant is run by  Maria, the daughter of the owner and her brother the "cook.", neither one are very professional or know how to "run" a restaurant.  Would not recommend it there are many other restaurants in NYC that are better and have got "their act" together...UNIMPRESSED!
