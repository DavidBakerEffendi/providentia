Came here for dinner the other night and it was AMAZING!! We started off with the tuna tartar and oysters and everything was SO fresh, and the tuna tartar was delicious!!! We then shared lobster mac, a lobster salad, scallops and some sides, which were all equally as good. Also- my friend has a gluten allergy and they were extremely accommodating about helping us pick out dishes that she could eat as well! Our waiter also helped us pick out a great wine, that was reasonably priced. He seemed very knowledgeable about the wine and the food!! Overall the staff was super friendly, food was So good and I am definitely looking forward to coming back!!!
