Amazing new Astoria destination! We just had a wonderful first experience at Sugarfreak! The decor is unbelievably cool. So much attention to detail and so charming, you feel like you are in the comforts of a Southern home. Also, the BEST Mac n cheese I've ever tasted! Can't wait to try the traditional Louisiana goods. Might I recommend adding a little Crystal hot sauce to the Mac n cheese, it brings out the multitude of delicious cheese flavors. Â And the drinks! So delicious! Hibiscus lemonade and the Hurricane were my boyfriend's and my favorites. Go! Enjoy! Have fun! Cheers!
