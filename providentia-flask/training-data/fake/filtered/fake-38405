I went there twice in a week. Weekend & weekday. but each time make me so disappoint. I think you shouldn't go there with a group! Poor management! They cannot make a table for four people. We had to wait 2 hours to be seated, even though we came there earlier to put our name on the waiting list and were told the wait would be one hour.  More than 20 couples went before us! The food was so delicious. I love the interior. The server Shige's table  service was excellent. But I will not recommend to go there with a group. ):
