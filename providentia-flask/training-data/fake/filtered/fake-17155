Went there yesterday with my son and had an amazing lunch. I ordered their Steak and Cheese Works which was delicious and filling. My son had their Clam Strip Roll...Which seemed to be more of a Clam Strip dinner with how man strips they give...Loved the portion sized and the fact both meals came with soup. We'll be back.
