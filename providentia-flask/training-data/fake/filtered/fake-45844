All I can say is "Yum!" I came here on a Monday night and we were seated right away. The decor was really cute with it's blue lite wall, and the way the tables were set up. We first had the sweet saki, which was very good. I didn't realize saki could be sweet, i've only had the more grainy dry kind. After we finished our saki I ordered a Dragon Roll and a Spicy Scallop roll. The spicy scallop roll definitly had some kick to it, but was tasty. The dragon roll was my by far my favorite though. Delicious! The avocado was actually on top of the roll, which made the texture really nice. By far the best roll I have ever eaten, and I have had a lot of sushi. Definitely try this restaurant...you will not be disappointed!
