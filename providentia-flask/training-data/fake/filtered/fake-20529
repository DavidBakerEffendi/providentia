One of the best meals I've had anywhere.  Zahav is a great restaurant with creative offerings and wonderful flavors.  The eggplant dish was fabulous as was the lamb's tongue.  The desserts were fabulous with halva mousse and labaneh ice cream.  I can't recall a more eclectic and tasty meals in a wonderful atmosphere.  This place should be on anyone's list of restaurants to visit while in Philadelphia.
