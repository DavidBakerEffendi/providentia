I seriously can't get enough of L&B. Any time a friend of mine from college comes to visit me in Brooklyn, I ALWAYS bring them to L&B for at least one meal. I have friends from freshman year that still talk about it! The food is delicious, the portions are HUGE (tons of leftovers!), and the prices are pretty reasonable. A must-try!
