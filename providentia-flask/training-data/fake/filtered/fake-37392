yes, the happy hours sign was one of the reason i went there too... and when i walk in with my wife my expectations increased. LOOKS LIKE A FAMILY PLACE we ordered the drinks ,it came promptly and there after the appetizers were ordered along with the main course .then suddenly i saw this loony-tic person that used to be at the counter at moghul express. always confused and disoriented , Has no grace nor manners and have noticed him talking to himself before. I am sure they can do better than that. I don't think i will bring my family there........
