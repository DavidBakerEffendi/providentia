Great place.  I've gotten take out for dinner a few times and enjoyed it every time.  The little tacos for $1 each are fantastic and if you're looking for a filling breakfast the heuvos rancheros with steak are delicious.  The staff there really cares that each individual plate is to the persons liking.  Good place to grab a quick satisfying lunch/dinner for take out but certainly comfortably and festive to enjoy sitting and eating.  Prices are fair, food is great and the owners seem like great people.
