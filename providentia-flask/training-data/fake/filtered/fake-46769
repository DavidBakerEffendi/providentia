Lets start off first that I am so excited a fantastic restaurant has opened near by. Not too many of these that I find exceptional. The first thing I noticed was the facility was a little small, but I can not say its a bad thing. My girlfriend and I came out on a very icy day and not too many tables were taken up. When I first walked in, the atmosphere was great, it was comfortable and elegant at the same time. The service was fantastic, any time a plate was empty someone would come buy and quickly ask to take it off the table to make room.( BIG PLUS). While we were looking at the menu some people were getting ready to pay the check and all I could hear was how delicious the food was. I could not wait any longer. I ordered the shrimp cocktail which was fantastic and the shrimp was huge! A house salad came next and quite a big salad for only $5.00. I was very worried about ordering the Fillet Mignon at a new Italian place, but I have to say it was the best steak I have had. As crazy as it sounds, I can not wait to go get it again. It was so juicy and tender and cooked to perfection. The best part of the steak was how flavorful it was. I never had a Fillet with that much flavor! VERY HAPPY! My girlfriend had the homemade Rigatoni and Vodka. I wish I could have tried some, but due to my diet I was unable to. She could not believe how fresh the pasta was and how amazing the vodka sauce tasted. She even ate the peas and she hates peas. Our waitress was very nice, they try to get to know you there which I also liked because I am local and I am absolutely going back. I can not wait to bring all of my friends to this new place and brag about it because I found it. Â I have to say I read the previous reviews and the one guy who gave it 1 star! I would have to say go back and just try the food! The food will make you change your review quickly trust me. My only wish is that I would of liked to try the pasta.
