I have eaten at Marzullos many times and I've brought several friends there.  We've always left full, happy and satisifed.  The ambiance is warm and friendly, the wait staff very capable and the food is excellent.  I had a salami hero there that may have been the best sandwich I've ever eaten.  Pasta is a favorite of mine and I've had several dishes at Marzullo's, each one delectable.  The desserts are great, especially the tiramisu, if you have the room.  I always try!  The hostess has become a personal friend of mine and the owners, Mimo and Raphael are gracious and welcoming.  Although Marzullo's is a bit of a ride up the Parkway, whenever we're in the mood for a good meal in an inviting place, my friends and I head to Marzullo's in Montclair.  We've never been disappointed.
