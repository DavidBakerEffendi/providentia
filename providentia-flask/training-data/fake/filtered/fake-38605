This place is nice inside.  I attended on Saturday April 6th and was kind of disappointed.  The food was great!!, but there was a DJ's birthday, so I though YES!! It's going to be Jammin'.... NOT.  DJ started playing Rap music degrading  women, instead of Hyping it up the crowd with House/Dance music. People was starting to leave.  Nothing against Rap music, But who ever was the DJ has to go!!
