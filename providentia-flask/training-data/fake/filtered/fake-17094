What a surprise! Came here for dinner a couple weeks ago with some friends and both the food and service were amazing. For an appetizer we had the cornmeal crusted calamari. Instant favorite. However, the whole experience was really made by our server Jim. He was very personable and highly attentive to my friends and I. Extra points to him for recommending the lobster mac and cheese, which was so delicious I didn't want to leave. Must give it a try.
