I know I have already written a review in the past but I had to write another one. Every time I have come to Buttermilk Channel I continue to fall more in love. I love this place more and more every time I come... You must try the pecan french toast unbelievably good and the lamb on the brunch menu; holy cow this is amazing when I'm taking the bite I almost feel seduced by the flavors really good... lol amazing love this place... We were on our way to try another spot but found us heading over to Buttermilk Channel. Jeannette B
