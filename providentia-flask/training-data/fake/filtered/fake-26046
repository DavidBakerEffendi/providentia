Awesome! We went as a group for a mid-afternoon lunch and had a great time and ate delicious food. Everyone we came in contact with from the owners to the servers where awesome.  In planning the event the owners really made us feel welcome and excited to have us.  The servers were great.  One table was just the kids and that server filled the countless requests of the kids quickly with a smile.  The adults all raved about how good the food tasted and fairly priced it was. Will we be back?  For sure!  Would I recommend to a friend, certainly without question!
