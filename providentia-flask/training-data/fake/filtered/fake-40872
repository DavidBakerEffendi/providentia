The best pie in NYC hands down!! I dont usually eat pizza but when I do I go to Lombardi's.  The last few times I went it was about midday and there was no wait to get a table.  We were seated right away and the pie was thin, perfectly crispy crust!! Yummy!! I got the margherita and it was so freaking good, the fresh basil, buffalo mozzarella, and sauce.  Freaking great from the first bite to the last!
