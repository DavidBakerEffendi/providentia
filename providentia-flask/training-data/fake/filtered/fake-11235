The place is huge and can be a little overwhelming because it is very crowded. Â The food is good, but on the pricey side. I highly recommend trying the pizza. As for shopping not much is really worth the price, except the fresh pasta station. That is a must try. Service was slow and we had trouble getting our waiter to pay attention to us.
