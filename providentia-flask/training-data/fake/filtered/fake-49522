Just went to El Vez this past Saturday night and it was so freakin' good, I felt the need to yelp about it.  The margaritas were divine!  Note I'm a big fan of tequila and often drink it on the rocks.  The tortilla chips were good but, the Pico de Gallo was delicious, flavorful and fresh.  For my entree I had the crab tacos and I nearly cried it was so f'n good.  The perfectly salty crab with the avocado combination blew my taste buds away.  Perfect portion, lovely texture and amazing flavor, what more can you ask for?  We finished the night with coffee and the Tres Leches cake which was equally awesome.  Overall, I highly recommend El Vez it was a great dining experience.
