I have been here many many times, mostly for birthdays or anniversaries, and have to say the quality has gone downhill in the last few years while prices have gone waaay up. I still love the food, and think the sangria is the best in town, but we have cut down on how often we come by simply because of the high prices. Mind you, if we still got the same amount of food for higher prices, i would be fine, but I have noticed the dishes getting smaller....I used to order the seafood in parsley sauce. which is served in a  little caldero pot, and it used to overflow. But around the time of the Gulf disaster, I noticed the  amounts dropped by 1/2. I assumed when things got better, the sizes would go back up..but no...the prices INCREASED dramatically and the smaller serving sizes stayed and this is how much later????   So that is very disappointing. Even the rodizo prices have increased a lot. Not worth it in my opinion, but my husband really likes the meat-says it is not too salty like some places we have gone to. I do love the grilled pineapple at the end. Sangria is always great. So is the food quality (not the quantity). I usually get the seafood in parsley sauce but have tried other dishes too and they are all delicious. I do like that for their dessert menu, they actually bring out a tray of the desserts so that you can see them and choose that way. I am VERY visual so this works marvelously for me. I will add one more positive thing; My aunt is a PICKY eater. So difficult to take out and yet, she LOVES the food here. She was a big fan of the chocolate mousse-flavor and presentation, and still raves about it. I have never had an issue with the service, but then I like to not be rushed, so if they are a little slow I do not generally mind. It does get crowded around 7pm on weekends, but we usually go around 4pm for an early dinner and have never had an issue. All in all we will go back, but I wish the prices would settle and stop crawling up.
