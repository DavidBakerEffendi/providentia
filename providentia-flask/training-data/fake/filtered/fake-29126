Hands down the best pizza there is! Why is their webpage so bad you ask? Because they are known for their pizza, not HTML skills.    We got 2 small pies, a plain and a meatball. Both were cooked absolutely perfect. Not one part overcooked or burnt. Cheese melted perfect, and crust edible. Sauce was nicely seasoned.    The only thing I didn't care for was the loud SiriusXM music (Sinatra). It was the right music, just a tad too loud. Maybe it was up to anticipate the loud crowd for lunch?    We ate earlier than the lunch crowd to avoid the wait and the food came out fast.    Waitress never came back to check on us. The food was perfect, but what if I needed napkins? Very friendly staff though.    Overall a great experience. Only problem is.... how can I ever eat another pizza and say its good? Nothing compares to this place! This pizza is on its own level.
