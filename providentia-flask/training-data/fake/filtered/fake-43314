This is the best greek restaurant i've ever met outside of Greece.The food is very good,the bread with the dips was excellent and the service was professional.The decor is so nice that you feel you are at home.If you go there try the steak,i think is one of the best dishes they have. I recommend this restaurant to everyone who wants to try the real greek food made with the best ingredients,always fresh and nice.
