Went to Xochitl earlier this month and experienced a few good things and a few bad things about this restaurant.   Pros: Guacamole was excellent, well prepared and well seasoned.  The perfect margarita was delicious, although on the expensive side. Cons: Service was awful.  It took over an hour to get our main entrees and the size and quality was pathetic. The chicken tacos (around $15) were tiny with little meat and even less flavor.   Overall, the ambiance is very nice but the quality of food and service is lacking.
