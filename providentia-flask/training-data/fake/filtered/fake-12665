The wings here are AMAZING!  I think that the people who are disappointed when coming to this place are ones who didn't know that it is a sports bar.  This is not a place to go have a quiet meal or to bring your kids to.  It is a great spot for groups of friends to get together, have some drinks, watch the game and get a little rowdy at!  You have to take it for what it is.  The food is good compared to most bar food, the people working there are nice, and there's a pretty mixed crowd of young adults and older ones.  It can be a good time!
