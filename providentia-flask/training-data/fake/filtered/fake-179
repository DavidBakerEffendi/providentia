Ate here over the holidays several years ago.  Waited outside in the cold night for 2.5-3 hours in extremely long line.  The pizza was good, but I was also pretty hungry by the time I got inside.  It was nothing amazing.  The service was terrible, however.  The waiter kept trying to get us to leave after 20 minutes so he could bring more customers in from outside.  He wasn't even nice about it.  This is the type of place you go one time to say you went there and then you never go back again.
