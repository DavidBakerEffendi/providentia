If there were more stars on this review sheet, I would give Rita & Joe's all of it! I've been eating here since high school!  they serve the best italian food in jersey city!  portions are huge and the prices are reasonable!  i must admit that only jersey city natives know about this place...i recently moved to the woodbridge area and I find myself driving to jersey city just to have some ritas!
