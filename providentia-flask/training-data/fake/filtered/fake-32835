Clueless, rude and arrogant management.  Service was inept, though they tried. Waited over 30 minutes for a reservation for 10 people. Given 2 round tables put together.  Squeezed and cramped.  After asking for a more comfortable table, was told they don't have tables for 10. (Should have told us when taking the res!) Waited 45 minutes for food that finally arrived lukewarm with sauces congealed. And they started clearing the table when people were still eating. And the bathroom garbage cans overflowed with paper towels--not a good sign.  Never again.  I'll go back to Casa Vasca.
