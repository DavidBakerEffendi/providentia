I found myself at the Ssam bar upon the recommendation I found online as well as from some locals here in New York. Being a fan of traditional Korean cuisine, I arrived with an appetite full of anticipation. Being a busy spot, the genial hostess was unfortunately unable to put our names down for a table until our group was complete. That was fair enough, considering that there was a growing mass spilling onto the pathway waiting for tables. While our group waited for a table at the adorable Milk Bar, there seems to be a sense of camaraderie amongst the crowd as I was offered some of a stranger's blueberry cookie while sipping on my Rose. Â  Finally, we were ushered to our communal table where we immediately placed an order for a dozen oysters and two servings of pork buns (2 buns per serve). The oysters arrived casually on a utilitarian platter of ice- each mollusk cradled in its half shell dotted with a version of kimchi sauce. The result is a melodic marriage of heat (chilli) and cold. Fabulous! My company were very excited about the pork buns. While they were admittedly delish and more-ish, I can't help but draw parallels to its better tasting traditional version which includes crisp lettuce. For our main courses, we had soft shell crab and hanger steak- both of which were beautifully prepared and in a serving that is ideal for each person. If you are hanging for a a gastronomic feast expecting to be fed as much as a goose for foie gras, don't waste your time here. But if you want to enjoy a good meal through grazing over delicate yet bombastic platters with good company in an energetic yet intimate space, make sure you arrive early!
