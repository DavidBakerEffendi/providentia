Nice atmosphere with the outside lounge area. Also the restaurant is decorated nicely with a modern look and furnishings. However, I can only give it one star since the food was only OK for the price that is charged. The cocktails are small and very weak for a almost $10 price. After telling the waiter about the super weak cocktails I found the bartender had come out of the bar and over to the dining area to give my fiance and I a dirty stare down look. The waiter said he would take off our drinks from the bill. After the stare down from the bartender I only felt comfortable in ordering a soda. I had to wait almost 20 mins just for the Coke to arrive and had to ask him twice for it. Once it arrived it had no ice and was warm. To top off everything when the bill came he had not taken off our cocktails....Now I know why their was only two other tables filled and the rest of the restaurant empty.
