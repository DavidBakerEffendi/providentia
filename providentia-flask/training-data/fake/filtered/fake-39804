Was there on a Friday @ 11:30 PM. The place was empty so we got seated right away. In a few minutes 6 cops came in and evidently the waitress knew them and that's the last we saw of her. We waited for about 10 minutes and then walked out. Guess she didn't need our business and the cops will compensate her tip-wise. Never got a chance to place an order, so who knows how the food is.
