Just had weekday brunch here.  Great place.  I ordered the salmon nicoise salad.  First off, it was huge.  I like quantity to go with my quality :)  Very tasty.  Pan seared salmon over a bed of mesclun - with onions, egg, potato, and a nice dressing.  I also ordered a glass of white wine.  A little on the pricey side - $9 - but hey, you have to live a little. The restaurant is quaint and well-decorated.  Great location.  Right by the park.  On the southewest corner of the avenue so great views and sun.  If it was warmer, I would have eaten outside. The waitstaff was attentive but not bothersome.  And they're French!  Always a good sign.
