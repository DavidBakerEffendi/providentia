My hubby and I decided to dine here after walking down Melrose and hadnt booked anywhere - they were able to seat us quickly. We really enjoyed our meal - it was a bit of a twist on the standard mexican fare and everything was super tasty. The sangria was also fabulous! Our hosts were great and no complaints about anything. It was a little on the pricier side for Mexican but we felt it was worth it.
