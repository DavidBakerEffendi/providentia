Not bad ramen.  I ordered the tonkotsu ramen with the chasu pork.  I can't really comment on the authenticity but I enjoyed the broth and noodles.  The pork was quite good too.  The extra egg was marinated and cut in half and was good too.  I had the tempura as well for an appetizer and the batter was light and crisp too.  Service was prompt unlike some of the earlier reviews so it sounds like the initial opening pains have been dealt with.  The music was loud and annoying however.  This place is a good addition to the neighborhood and I'll be back for sure.  I haven't tried any of the other ramen places in Philly yet for comparison however.
