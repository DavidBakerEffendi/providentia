Great hole in the wall BBQ place.  The wings are great (smoked and then fried), and so are the Beans, Yams, and BBQ Sauce.  The owner truly makes you feel like you are welcome.  I have been there several times and the food is always very good. The only setback is there is almost no parking, the neighborhood isn't the best but not the worst, and the food is reheated sometimes in the microwave. Besides those minor things, I really recommend it.  Just remember if the chicken or ribs are pink, it is the smoke ring they are not undercooked!!
