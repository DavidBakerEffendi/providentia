Well well well... this is THE pizza. I'm new in town and I'm a big pizza lover. I'm half Italian and lived in Italy so I'm picky about it, so of course I consulted with my Italian friends and this was their recommendation for the best pizza in Manhattan. I'm not sure and I'll probably never now if they were right, because after trying their Calabrese pizza with spicy sausage and roasted peppers I am not planning to go anywhere else for it. This is it. I'm hooked! Thanks Piacere! Oh, they also have excellent Italian coffee!
