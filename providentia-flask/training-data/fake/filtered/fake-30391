Two weekends ago, with an estimated one-hour wait for a table at Lucali's down the street, my friend and I walked into Bar Bruno to pass the time. As soon as I entered, the staff made a friendly impression. A bartender, whose name I would later learn is Ivan, said hello and asked how I was when I passed him on the way to my table. I was immediately impressed by his attentiveness. My friend and I sat down, and she ordered the Mexican Hot Chocolate, which was wonderful. As we were chatting, both our server and Ivan checked up on us to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves. Visiting New York from Toronto, we didn't have a phone to look up directions to our destination following Lucali's. Ivan, who had just met us, left us with his phone while he was making drinks so that we could map our way to East Village from Brooklyn. Leaving your iPhone with two strangers? That's exceptional service! To top off the experience, we were given two complimentary mojito shots and my friend was not charged for her hot chocolate. I left Bar Bruno down no money and up one new friend. My night was made before it even started. I would definitely make the nine-hour commute from Toronto to NYC to go back to Bar Bruno.
