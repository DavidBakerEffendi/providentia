So, it was time for University City Dining Days [q.v.], and our Foodie group decided on something off of the $15 list, which is how we wound up at Vientiane Cafe.  Our group of 6 had to wait about 15-20 minutes; the place was absolutely packed, all 40-50 seats of it.  It's all chair-and-table seating; no booths.  At capacity, large folks and those wheelchair-bound will have trouble negotiating though the restaurant.  It is NOT air-conditioned, though they have ceiling fans and ninja waitstaff so stealthy you barely even saw them come by and refill your ice water.    The Dining Day menu was limited, but allowed various levels of vegetarians at the table to indulge.  Appetizers sampled were: (1) chicken satay with peanut sauce [somewhat small, perhaps 6" of meat on two 8" bamboo skewers]; (2) Spring Rolls with two different dipping sauces [one spicy, one sesame oil]; and (3) green papaya salad [shredded, not cubed, and added to a bowl of iceberg lettuce with a few standard toppings and house dressings.  All appetizers received good reviews from multiple tasters.  Dinner choice was slightly novel, a move which I applaud; you choose 1 of 4 sauces [which included pad thai, eggplant basil, and green curry], and then add tofu, chicken, or beef.  Plates were large, about 12", and were well-filled, but not heaping [the pad thai was the only one that came with noodles, so it was a bit more food than the others].  Dessert options were a tempura-fried banana, a chocolate-banana spring roll, and coconut rice pudding [which came in two small, tablespoon-sized bowls].  The bananas came out ahead in the dessert category.  The limited Dining Days menu was good, with "safe" options for those unfamiliar with Asian cuisine.  Waitstaff was attentive, despite being packed.  Restaurant is BYOB and Cash or Check ONLY [there is an ATM within two blocks].  Would be interested in going back for a normal dinner from the normal menu to try some other options and check their variety.
