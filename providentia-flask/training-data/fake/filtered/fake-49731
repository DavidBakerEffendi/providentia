My wife and I took a a friend there and treated her to lunch. The food was very good and we were all well satisfied. I liked the TV sets in every booth and the fact that you can control the sound if you wish. I couldn't believe the selection on their beer list. If anybody can't choose a beer from their list you aren't a serious beer drinker like me. My wife and I will definitely be going back.
