We travel to NYC once a year from Nebraska and had high hopes for GREAT thai this time around. Was highly disappointed with the food! We tried the chicken curry buffs and they were overrated, the chicken satay was rubbery and the shrimp pad thai was horrible. We ended up only eating a few bites and threw the rest away! Atmosphere was extremely cramped,  probably a cool "scene" for the hipsters is why it gets some good reviews.  Service was good but having eaten thai in many locations I would say this was by far the worst.  Pam Real Thai is MUCH better!!!
