The first time I was walking by Tartine, I told myself: "this looks so cute, so nice, the spirit of west village, I really need to come back for brunch". I go back home, check Yelp, and find pretty nice reviews. So on a bitter cold Saturday morning, I went with my girlfriend. We arrive a 10.32am, the place was opening at 10.30am. Only one miserable table is available. damn this place is popular. Now the place is so small and tables are so close to each other that it is impossible to have a bit intimacy, you hear all the conversations around you, the waiter is constantly pushing you to reach another table...plus we started hearing the noise from the kitchen. So far the experience sucks. Â They also forgot to bring water and it took them forever to bring some. The brunch was miserable: the egg benedict with salmon was so disappointing. The egg was cold, the muffin was cold, the hollandaise was so fat (i mean more than usual) it was awful, the potatoes were fine but whatever. We also had one of their layer cake which looked so good and it was really disappointing too (as if the cake had been standing there for a week)... well seriously do not go there.
