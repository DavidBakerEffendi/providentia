Now this is Strictly for the Weekend lunch buffet.  We went there on a rainy sat afternoon.. going by the fantastic reviews and the name it bears "dhaba" i mean seriously ..that word dhaba gives my taste buds a shake up ! and my tummy starts growling.The people there are fantastic and really polite. The buffet food strictly average ! but there comes the twist with the naans. Fresh . hot. soft yummy.. a meal in itself for me. Yes i can even eat their naans(only)  for a meal. the tandoori chicken did not seem like tandoori chicken. i mean its not tandoori to me until and unless i get to dig my teeth into some juicy and "hot" "leg piece"( as they say in my country). they were all broken up pieces ... really ?so much for a dhaba ? but i am gonna try my luck again and order delivery some time soon. Cant stay away from the naans for long :)
