We finally fulfilled our long time plan to experience the so-called "Best Pizza in NY" only to be sorely dissappointed.  I love pizza, almost any kind, but I have to admit that my experience at Grimaldi's has influenced my feelings toward their pizza.  It's surprising that they even open their doors to the public, since it doesn't seem that they even like the public very much.  Not one person working there thanked us for comng and spending the most money we've ever spent on pizza.  Our server was even annoyed that we wanted to make an additional order.  I refuse to believe that it's just that NY "rough"  exterior because we've been to many eateries here and never did we receive such cold and unwelcoming treatment.  Some words of advice:  I'd be careful Grimaldi's.  Your so-called good pizza won't keep you in business forever.  You may lose one patron at a time with that attitude, but it 's just a matter of time before you lose more than you can afford......let me be the first.
