I have been working on an off with Ciro and his family for over 14 years. The reason i lasted that long is I MINDED MY OWN BUSINESS unlike Terri who criticized every one from owners, employees and customers. She is unhappy person and it shows all over her face. No body wants to be around grumpy people. If it was for me I would not have even contemplated hiring her at all, but Ciro wanted to give her a chance like he does for all who wants to work. It is uncalled for you Terri to be accusing him for taking money from the tip jar. She accused servers of taking money from the tips jar and she accused me for accepting tip from customers and pocketing it, which all of it was false, only a thief  things that everybody is robbing from them. There is nothing truth about what Terri says. Like her being a Human Resource person for 15 year, then jumped to work as dancer at a gogo bars? then bar tender and this is  not something I came up  with she shared that will all the customers and she talked  about her $3000 breast implant and working the pole. She got upset with customers if they asked for someone else to fix their drink and she got nasty. I can go on and on talking about the negativity of  Terri all day long but the bottom line is you need to grow up Terri and move on and may be fix your personality, you are a good worker but your personality does not fit in a bar or any service oriented job dealing with people. Everything you said behind every bodies back reached them because you do not know when to shut up. Guess what, you are at it again. It is never your fault it is always everybody else. I tried to be nice to you but that does not work especially for an ungrateful person like you.  No body is perfect but we at Amalfi try to make your visit as pleasant as possible your comments are always welcomed and Ciro and his family are always ready to listen to your comments and concerns. May you all have a happy season and God bless you all and thank you for your business.
