Great place! Â Thanks to Yelp I came here.. Juliana was the best, told me what was good. Totally talked to me about what to order and how food was. Baked Lasagna was the bomb ( Ca talk for great). I fly corporate and have had the best over seas but this place is a sleeper! The Tiramisu is with out a question was the best I've ever had! Ask for Juliana she rocks and is very low pressure. JB
