Theres pretty much nothing like this place anywhere in NYC (or any other city for that matter). They've found a limitless number of ways to eat potatoes, with 15 sauces, like 8 types of cheese, veggies, and you can choose to add proteins (chicken, sausage, bacon, vegan chili...). I had the sweet potato crinkle which i LOVEDDD and sweet potato is actually very healthy for you. The staff is very helpful especially if its your first time there and helps you decide what to order. They forgot to give me one of the cheeses i added, but they remembered before I can even notice and added it. Â I'm already thinking about what kind of potato I'm going to try there next time. =D
