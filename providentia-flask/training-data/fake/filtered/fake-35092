Impressed by their fish freshness and servers' warm service. Although Mom doesn't like raw fish at all, she liked her chicken yaki undo and yam yam eel (sweet potato and eel tempura appetizer) so much. I am glad she is happy to try Japanese food with me finally. Love this place and will definitely come back. The best sushi place in New Jersey I have tried so far. In addition, the presentation itself is a piece of art. The master chef is so talented!
