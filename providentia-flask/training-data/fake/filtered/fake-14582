Been to 'B' a couple of times, and food  (burger salad) is yummy.  Big draw for me is humanely raised beef.  I trust that it means the same as it does at Whole Foods near by.  I don't eat much beef but when I do, I buy humanely or pasture raised whenever possible.  Love the fried string beans :) made me smile cuz they're so much healthier than fries, and its a great way to cook them without overcooking. Today I ordered spicy steak salad expecting same greens, etc as burger salad instead of iceberg lettuce wedge.  Not impressed with iceberg wedge nless i order an iceberg wedge! Steak was nice and RARE, but no spice at all (?) Staff very nice and service quick.  Wish i could go during cocktail hour and try the other 2 B's.  Thanks!
