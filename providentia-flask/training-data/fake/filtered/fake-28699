Unfortunately for Bella Vista, a place like The Wishing Well has a very captive market and is taking advantage of it. Is the game on? Yes. Is there beer behind the bar? Yes. Therefore, neighbors will unenthusiastically slip in once a month at the very least for a couple drinks or to meet other neighbors. That does not mean the business is successful, the environment appealing, or the offerings unique or desirable. I visited The Wishing Well four or five times in the spring/summer of 2010 shortly after they opened. Eager for a new summer spot, I was increasingly disappointed with each visit. Menu was bland and expensive, too many staff on the clock at once made it feel disproportionately crowded. I had a draught beer that tasted like a brothy soup -- Â I'd had it before and knew something was wrong if it tasted like food. As the restaurant remained open week after week, the business owners slowly converted the large, cozy, cushioned corner booth into their office. In a small, stark bar, the laptops, paperwork, and HP printer taking up this area stuck out like a pile of barf on the cafeteria floor. I must reiterate also that this was the most desirable seat in the house -- a perfect, nice spot to sit with a lot of neighbor friends at once. Perhaps one thing the place actually had going for it. I don't blame the owners for claiming it as their own! Stupid. I don't care how tight on space you are, check your email in the damn kitchen. Put your printer behind the bar. And, for god's sake, don't sit there and do computer work with a restaurant full of patrons. Evidently a change in decor is pending. What are they going to add, a copy machine? Some file cabinets? Great. The more it starts to look like my office, the more I'll want to stop by. Blah.
