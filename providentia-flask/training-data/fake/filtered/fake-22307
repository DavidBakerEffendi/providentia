Trying a new Chinese takeout place is like courting a girl for the first time. It is exciting, on the one hand, to try something new. On the other hand, you always worry about being disappointed. Needless to say, no disappointment here. Rather quite the opposite. I first came here and tried the hot and sour soup. The first thing I noticed was the welcoming feel. The staff was very friendly. The restaurant is very clean, unlike many take out places. The soup was great - it had a great kick, and just enough tang, The second time I ordered moo goo gai pan. Most certainly a tough first act. They nailed it. Â Not only was the price right ($5.25 for a portion for one and rice), but the sauce was succulent, and the vegetables crisp. Great prices, friendly staff, great food, and free tea too! I'm certainly coming back, I would recommend this place to anyone.
