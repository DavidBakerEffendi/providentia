I think a review of this amazing restaurant  is imperative given the fact that yesterday I ate at Craft and today here.  Service is unsurpassed.  I love Tom, but his emphasis on food and his elitist aura structured around his reputation fails to place the customer at ease. At Gramercy, on the other hand, Danny makes me feel at home.  World class service without a sign of pretentiousness.  And the aim is to exceed and never to fulfill expectations.  Great (art)work to all at Gramercy.
