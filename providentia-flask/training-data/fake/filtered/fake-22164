I was in Philadelphia for an extended weekend around 12-12-09. During that time I sampled many cheese steaks from different restaurants. There is no question that the finest sandwich I had was at Carmen's. All other cheese steak makers should sit down and let Carmen show them how. Not only was the sandwich wonderful but the service and conversation was superb.
