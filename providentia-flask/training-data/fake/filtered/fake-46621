As I stood at the counter and admired the menu, I knew I was going to be in for a treat. The options are unique, culturally diverse, and all sound delicious. The choice between light and dark meat chicken was exactly what I wanted to see. I opted for a Tikka Masala Burrito with dark meat chicken, and man oh man is it good. I will definitely be back at Boloco in the near future.
