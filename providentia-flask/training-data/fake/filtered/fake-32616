La Taza De Oro has been the first thing I see when I walk out my front door for the past 16 years. I've been there a million times at least, and I have to say.... Nowhere else will you find a more dedicated team of workers and waiters, a more cheap yet delectable pallet of food, and a more lively ambience than right here in this Puerto Rican watering hole. This is THE place to be. Living near here and not speaking a word of Spanish has never once made me feel like an outsider coming here. These guys are friendly to everyone, and like I said, their work ethic is borderline insane. Often you'll see idle workers in other restaurants, but here, if someone is waiting on a customer, they'll Â do it while washing the counter, cleaning tables, filling shakers. If they just cleaned the counter, they'll do it again - NO sitting around doing nothing. I will say, in terms of food, their quality has slightly decayed over the years, which is why I decked a point. But honestly, if you're looking for cheap eats, and you're nearby, just jump in! I swear to you, there is no reason not to, and you'll walk out with a smile - even if you don't like Spanish food!
