The food was very good. We had asked about the 2 course lunch special but that is only for lunch Mon-Friday. This is not on the web site. While the other wait staff around us seemed to be friendly and knowledgeable, our waitress was looking at her watch and was not very helpful when asking questions about the wine or the food. This was disappointing. The Polpetine was excellent and so was the Stracci.
