Very disappointing :( I have been wanting to go to Bubby's for a while.  The menu online looked good and I liked how the food is supposed to be fresh and that the meat is natural.  I was also excited to go there because they have a photobooth downstairs near the bathrooms.  So I thought this would be a fun place to go to with good food. Well...  you have to pay in cash, which is crazy because who wants to carry around that kind of money in the city. The food was extremely OVERPRICED!  I ordered salmon which cost $23.  The piece of salmon I got was the size of my fist (4x3 inches).  The $6 side of fries was a larger quantity of food compared to my entree!  And I wouldn't have minded the small quantity of food if it was good quality food.  The food was mediocre at best.  You are better off going to Applebees or Chipolte or any other chain restaurant for that matter if you want better food. Also, there were children running around and screaming, even playing in the bathrooms! To sum up:  NOT WORTH IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
