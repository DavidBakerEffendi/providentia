This place appears to have some mixed reviews; and I'd venture to guess, having been here multiple times, that I know why. It's rather inconsistent. At certain times you go in and have the meal of a lifetime, (which is probably far too dramatic a statement) whereas other times you go in and during a shift change in which the cleaning crew appears to be manning the culinary helm. Even so, the cleaning crew doesn't do too bad a job and at this place's worst its a three star establishment. At its best it gets all five from me. I generally have the #11 (the name of which escapes me). It contains beef, egg, and of course, a veritable bounty of noodles. If you come when thsi place is on and order the aforementioned dish, you'll be likely awed. If you don't, you'll still have a good meal.
