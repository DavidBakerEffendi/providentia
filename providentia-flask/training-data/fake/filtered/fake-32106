We went on a Friday night, around prime dinner time, but were able to call ahead and have our place on the waiting list so we didn't have to wait at the restaurant as long.  I loved that, especially with two kids.  When we arrived, we were seated and were asked about our drinks and served them right away.  However, after we ordered the food, the wait took quite sometime.  The manager seemed to noticed this, and came over to our table, and took care of us.  Our food was excellent.  I had the Key West Fish Tacos, and they were great, but I really loved the mayo sauce that comes with them.  My husband and kids loved their food as well.  For dessert, I had the Pina Colada bread pudding, and it was sooo goood.  I live on Long Island and don't have any Bahama Breezes by me, but will be making the trip to Wayne again to have it soon.
