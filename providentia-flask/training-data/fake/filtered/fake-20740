This was my second visit to La Sirene and it was just as good as last time. BYOB is a nice feature as we brought a good red wine that would have been too expensive off of a restaurant menu.  I had the pear, Gorgonzola salad and my friend had the beet salad.  We shared each and both delicious but think I enjoyed the pear salad best.  Then I had the quail with cranberries.  It was soooo good!  Friend had the duck.  Only reason I am not giving 5 stars is the duck was good but not as good as we have had in other French restaurants.   Dessert was a shared creme brûlée that was excellent. I will return!
