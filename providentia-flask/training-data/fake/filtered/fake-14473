I had the veggie burger it was good and I loved the red velvet milkshake .. Would I go back ?yeah in the summer time for a shake the place was freezing and the food was high. They don't sale turkey burgers so I was a bit disappointed , every body don't eat beef. The staff constantly when in and out the doors which made it even colder in there smh
