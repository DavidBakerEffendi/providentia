It's 16 hours after that meal and I still feel gross.  It's a real shame. Dining with my friend, we enjoyed most of our dishes and the staff was very pleasant.  The gnocchi was terrific and the mushroom sauce was great.  Unfortunately, our mussels were sandy, definitely unclean.  Within an hour of eating, my friend was already feeling ill and it continued from there.   More than a few bucks + intense illness = never again. Note: I feel very sure that this was the cause of our illness.  It was the only meal we shared and we had the same symptoms.  Further, if one ingredient (the mussels) have not been properly cleaned, it makes me suspect about the integrity of the whole dish.
