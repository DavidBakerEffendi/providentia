Advanced reservations clearly did not mean much here.  My husband secured a reservation for June 4 for our birhthdays 2 months in advance. We arrived to find our table was occupied by latecomers and we would have to wait 45 minutes or sit outside. I was hesitant as the evening was cool but gave it a try.  Too cold.  We asked our server if there was any chance of an indoor table and we were told the bar was available.  Nice. We took our drinks to the bar.  She didn't follow us in with our menus or water.  The bartender saved our night.  She was great! We even attempted to explain our case to another manager only to be ignored the rest of the evening.  The cowardly managers left it to the bartender to extend their apologies by covering our drinks when we received the bill.  The food was good, but that experience left a bad taste - we probably will not return.  I don't know if their egos got in the way of customer service, but that it was people like me remember.  And that is what people like me tell other people.
