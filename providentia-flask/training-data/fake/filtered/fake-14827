We ate here because a coworker told us it was good... CHILE PLEASE!!!!  My husband & son & myself didn't like the food .. It was disgusting!!! Even the damn UPTOWN BEVERAGE WAS NASTY...  The serve was azz .. Even the water was nasty  I will never go back again what a joke What a waste of money KIM IN THE MIX IN RAHWAY NJ   SOULFOID IS WAY BETTER EVEN DON's Diner all u can eat  soul food buffet on sat/ sun  is way better
