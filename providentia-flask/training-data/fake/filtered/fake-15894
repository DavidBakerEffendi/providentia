Not so spectacular ending to a spectacular time at radio city music hall. Found this place here on yelp. Was looking for affordable Spanish cuisine not too far from radio city. Mediocre food, served barely warm, felt rushed by our waiter, and had no flan! Stay clear of this place if you're looking for a nice dinner. Maybe a quick lunch spot-- emphasis on maybe.
