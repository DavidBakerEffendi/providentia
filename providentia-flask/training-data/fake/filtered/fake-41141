I went to totto 2 days ago and had been waiting outside for an hour, even if there is outdoor heater but it wasn't help at all. My fingers and feet were dead. Anyway, I don't mind for the long wait if the ramen is very delicious. Â I ordered totto extra spicy ramen and my friend order niku ramen. The taste was just ok, not outstanding. Just like other ramen restaurants. Plus, the thing that made me very disappointed was the totto extra spicy ramen wasn't spicy for me at all. Then I asked for more sesame oil but they charged me $1.25 for a very tiny cup. I think 50 cents is reasonable , $1 is ok but $1.25 is unacceptable!!! I can eat spicy and the menu indicates that this ramen is very spicy( with 9 chilies). I went to Thai restaurant they gave me hot sauce with no charge. By the way, the service was nice. But the ramen wasn't worth the wait at all
