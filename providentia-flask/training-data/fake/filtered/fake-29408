I landed  at this place by recomendation from a local friend and was so happy to find great food that I loved like the shakshuka ( Moroccan style spicy tomatos withe pouched eggs on the souce ) that was a delight , also the "phool "dish made out of  fava and gorbanzo beans was  a protein boom to my body as well as  a tasty dish , overly I was very happy with all the choices that they served  , thanks to the chef and the staff
