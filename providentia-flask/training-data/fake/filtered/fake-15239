Day by Day is simply delicious. They have an awesome variety of options for lunch and brunch foods, and everything I've had there left me oozing with satisfaction. My favorite Day by Day indulgences are the desserts- scrumptious cookies, pies, cupcakes, and the like. The service is terrific- everyone is really friendly and the food comes quickly. This is definitely my favorite lunchtime spot in Philly!
