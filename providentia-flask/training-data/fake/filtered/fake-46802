Crowd of 15 people descended on 10 Park last night for dinner.  Excellent service throughout the evening, not rushed and someone always nearby to fill a glass or answer a questions.  Started with eggplant rollitini, calamari and tomato, homemade mozzarella and basil for apps.  Everything was delicious.  Each of us had a salad and different main courses.  I had appetizer shrimp in garlic as main course, jump shrimp and lots of them.  Everyone raved how good their meal was, including my cousin who just spent a month in Italy.  Super friendly staff.  Had desert & coffee.  It was a big hit, thank you 10 Park!!
