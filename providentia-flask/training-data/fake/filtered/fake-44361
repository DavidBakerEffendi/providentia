I love this place! I love their sweet and sour chicken, the best I've ever had anywhere! I also like their lo mein. Its very consistent everytime I order it.......always good portions and always delicious. Even though its usually pretty crowded and you have to share a table smooshed up to a bunch of strangers I think it makes the experience even more fun. Definatey stop by if you are looking for some good chinese
