Great food truck, if not the best food truck for what they serve. Everything was super tasty, I did not order for myself so I could not really distinguish some of the funkier cuts of meat, but nothing was off or anything less than super yummy. We had our food within 5 minutes of ordering. Can't beat that. Spending $20 here is enough to feed a family.
