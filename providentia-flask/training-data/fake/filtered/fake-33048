My husband and I had good food, great spanish wine and exceptional service. It was Friday night and their free tapas when you order some wine was mighty delicious. Jonathan the bartender was very helpful and friendly, and he made our dining experience most delightful. We haven't had that much fun and great service in a very long time!
