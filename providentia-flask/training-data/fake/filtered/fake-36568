Recently went for dinner on a Monday and it was wonderful! We had the pulled pork with slaw - very tasty. My only suggestion would be to get a bakery roll instead of something from a plastic bag. Still, when I ate my leftovers the next day, the potato roll hit the spot. The potato salad was really good as well. The husband had the ribs - tender and flavorful. We also tried the mac and cheese... good good. Oh, and definitely get the cornbread - awesome! The flavor is embedded in the meat without having it swim in the sauce. In fact, I ate my pork without any sauce; it was so good. And leave room for the key lime pie, which was fantastic! We're definitely making this our go-to BBQ place.
