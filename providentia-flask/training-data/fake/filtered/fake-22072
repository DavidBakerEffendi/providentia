I love this place.  it's my grocery store, and my favorite lunch spot.  People of every race and social class go there to do their shopping.  It's Philadelphia at its best. Just don't go on Saturday or, if you can help it, when a convention is in town.  It is a tourist destination, and i'm ok with that.  I just have to plan ahead to avoid the worst times when people have to move single file through the aisles.  Monday morning is the best for grocery shopping, unless you want to go to the Amish stands.  They are open only later in the week and never on Sunday.  This may disappoint tourists, but they have to understand why the Amish stands are closed -- they have a life, and it's not all commerce, all the time.
