If you're looking for a great brunch or lunch experience, look no further! I have been frequenting Manajares for a couple of months now and I have yet to be disappointed. I have been to all the brunch places in Westville and this is by far my favorite.  I first started coming to get the pastries - their chocolate croissants are superb. I think what makes this place worth 5 stars is the flavor and the fresh quality of all of their food. The orange juice is fresh squeezed from RIPE oranges- the orange juice at Bella's Café is bitter ! In addition they bake their own breads! Their Challah French  toast is exquisite and packed with flavor - Lena's Confection's Challah French toast was bland, thin, and left me hungry. The portions here are perfect! Not too much (Bella's) but not too little (Lena's). Not to mention the prices !! The prices are ideal especially for what you are getting. Dare I say  one "$" sign is a more apt symbol for the prices here. I come here 2-4 times a week!  In addition, the owners treat you as if you are family, and it really makes the difference. I love this place, and I will remain faithful. (yes, they have mimosa lol)
