The food is my favorite, Home made everything you can taste it! I love everything from their breakfast, hot dogs, sausages to the home made desserts! the service is great and you're served with a smile, the old time photo's of Philadelphia they have are very intriguing and worth taking a look at really takes you back to what it use to be. Love the HUGE hot dog man mascot very kid friendly! You wont find another place like this in Philly!
