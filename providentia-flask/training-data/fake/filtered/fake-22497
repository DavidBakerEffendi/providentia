A great addition to New Haven!  This restaurant has a serious chef at it's head, and the team has assembled a menu that allows for a traditional full meal, a tasting of many small plates, or a small bite.  The menu and wine list orient to France and Italy, and the wine list has many fine choices across the price spectrum.  After tasty signature cocktails and an amuse bouche that whetted our appetites, my wife and I assembled a meal of crudo & tartare, shaved asparagus, grilled octopus, and 2 pastas with a side of kale.  Each dish was excellent, with taste elements that excited the palate without masking the main ingredient.  The meal was finished with a wonderful pana cotta.  Service was good and very accommodating.  There is nothing like this in New Haven!
