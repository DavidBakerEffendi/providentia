I don't know how they do it, but Pommes Frites actually reinvents french fries. I have been there a few times, and am always surprised at how astounding the difference is between fries from Pom Frittes and any other place. The most important part of eating here is choosing the sauces. They are not only delicious, they're fun! I am surprised at what they're able to concoct, and am personally a fan of the sweet mango chutney mayo and the pesto mayo. It's a great place, highly recommended!
