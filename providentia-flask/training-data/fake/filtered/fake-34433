We have been going to Baja's for a few years now and we have found one thing: consistently AMAZING food.  I have read some reviews on here that state that the waitresses don't write things down, that is because they know the menu and what is on it.  So excuuuuuse me if YOU don't know what your little kid ordered.  Read the menu and you will also see when sour cream is NOT included with many of the items.  They ask if you wish for some as MOST people like sour cream with their Mexican food. Anyway, I will get off my soapbox and state one thing.  The food is to die for there.  I will gladly pay $50 for me and my boyfriend to enjoy amazing Mexican food (with leftovers due to the huge portion sizes) and two margaritas, which might I add are the best ones I have had. EVER.   Every winter the place closes for about 6 weeks at which point we go and try other restaurants when we crave that Mexican taste.  Every year we are sorely disappointed and we wait for the minute those doors open again.  We were in there once again tonight and once again, we won't send our friends and loved ones anywhere else.  Nothing in this area beats Baja's.
