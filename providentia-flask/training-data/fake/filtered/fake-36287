We tried out Yakitori Boy with a Groupon, and really enjoyed our meal there.  It is terrific to have a Japanese-style izakaya here in Philadelphia -- other than NYC and California, it is so hard to find this kind of fun, informal, delicious Japanese place where you can try out many things (small plates) for a reasonable cost.   We were lucky and had our own little room for our table of six, so it was quieter -- the main dining area seemed louder (and definitely got much louder by the time we left).  The wait staff was very friendly and brought out the food pretty quickly -- things are brought out as soon as they are done (the way a typical Japanese restaurant does).  The selection of food is very wide, which is great when your group has varying dining preferences -- everyone (kid and adult) was very happy in our group.  We especially liked the robata-yaki (the grilled skewers), the yakitori bowl (it does take about 45 minutes though, so be sure to order other items that will come out more quickly), the agedashi tofu (fried tofu), yaki-onigiri (fried rice balls), and the J Roll and Green River Roll.  We would have liked to order even more, but were too full.   We did not try the karaoke, but our kids want to come back to try it some time.  We will definitely be back to eat in the restaurant!
