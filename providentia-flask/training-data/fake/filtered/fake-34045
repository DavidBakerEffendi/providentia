You know when you're on vacation, finally arrive at your destination & you're in desperate need of decent food? This was the place for my family & I - Â and it was worth it. I had the gyro platter; so much wonderful tasting food, to start off; the gyros were incredibly soft, the meat was perfect and the tadziki sauce had a wonderful flavor. I'd definitely visit again!
