I have eaten here about once per month for the past few years.  They're still BYOB, which I like.  It;s nice to spend your money on good food and not break the bank with a good bottle of wine. I highly recommend the mushroom cigars and the seared tuna.  I would stay away from the goulash.  It's good, but it's made fresh daily and great goulsh needs days, not hours.  The steaks are great too.
