Dear Santucci's, I LOVE YOUR PIZZA; however, I must say that your brunch totally blew this morning. Â If you guys want to have sold out brunch like you do in the evenings you need to get it together in the following ways: Have fresh coffee (I had to wait for a new pot to be made), have condiments at the tables already , (after we were served our food we waited for the waitress to squirt a nearly empty ketchup bottle into a little container, it wasn't enough and we were never given more. We waited for butter until our toast was cold and then waited for jam- which wasn't enough for everyone to use). GET YO EGGS RIGHT, (I ordered over easy eggs and they were served over hard). My friend got given the wrong kind of tea (random, but disappointing none the less). And if you can- insulate the front door like other restaurants have done temporarily for winter, (it was freezing). Hopefully soon your brunch will be as good as your dinner ;-)
