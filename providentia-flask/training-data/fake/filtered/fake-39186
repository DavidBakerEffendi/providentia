Great ambiance! Great Live Music on Sunday night! Service is amazing! Started with a drink at the bar the bartenders are very fast considering it is one of the longest bars i have seen so far they work it very well! As more of my friends joined the party we considered getting a table though we had no reservation the hostess team was very great with helping us get a table! BIG SMILES and great sense of humor and did not make us feel bad about not reserving in advance! Service was great now being served by a waitress it was an even much more pleasant experience being that it was a bit more personal than being at the bar the waitress was very nice! we ordered apps and the nachos are to die for if your into that kind of stuff! they offer a full menu and I will return here and suggest you all check out the spot for sure!
