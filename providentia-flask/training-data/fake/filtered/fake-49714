All I can say is, go and enjoy the wonderful attentiveness of the owners and brothers, Thibault and Alex.  The food is good and they go out of their way to please.  Reading some of the reviews (which are good and well deserved), there are some that aren't worth paying attention to (sorry earlier reviewers).  You will be pleased, we were, and have been back several times.  The food keeps getting better and the wines are great.  Keep up the good work guys!
