Right on the lively corner in Watchung Plaza, next to the famous Watchung Deli and Mr. Dino's Pizzeria in Montclair, is a small lunch and dinner restaurant filled with Japanese and Korean delights. Sushi Koshi is filled with rows upon rows of sushi under glass and a chef waving at you from behind the counter.  The waiter's radiant smiles make you feel right at home.      We arrived there at 1:30 on Saturday and got a seat promptly because there are never too many people there. We first got ginger ale and water, along with the complimentary soup and salad. The salad had ginger carrot dressing that was so sweet it tasted like sugar. After we finished the salad and soup, we ordered the Watchung Roll with a chicken teriyaki lunch box and shrimp teriyaki lunch box. The Watchung Roll is a mixture of fried shrimp, smoked salmon, crabmeat, and avocado mixed to greatness. The roll tastes perfect with the steaming chicken and shrimp teriyaki. It felt as if we were eating at a fancy restaurant like Ruby Foo's in New York.      Not only did the servers bring the food out with haste, but they did it with a smile. If we ever needed assistance, the waiters were there in seconds. They politely answer any questions and gave us free drinks and desserts. When we left, the waiters and chef waved us out with smiles on their faces. Price: $20 can cover one person. Any type of clothing is accepted.
