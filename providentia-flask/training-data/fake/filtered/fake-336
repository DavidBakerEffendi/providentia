Not at all close to the hype on TV.  Went to Geno's as a first ever visit to Philly, but not impressed.  The servers were a bit rude and the cheese steak was ok, pretty skimpy on the steak for the price.  Get the wiz since otherwise the steak will be dry.  One other thing is why two windows one for steak and the other for fries and drinks?  What I liked about the place was the speak English sign...totally agree that is something that needs to be said more often.
