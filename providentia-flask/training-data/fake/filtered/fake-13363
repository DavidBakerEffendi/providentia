As far as the sushi half goes, this restaurant is reasonably priced and a beautiful place to eat at.  They have various specials through out the weekdays, including "Buy One Roll, Get One Free" on Mondays.  I am very partial to sushi and not too crazy about hibachi, in general, so I can not speak for the hibachi half of the restaurant.  Overall, though, the service has always been nice and extremely fast, as well as the food being very fresh and delicious.  In an area that's lacking nice spots to eat, the opening of this location is delightful.  BYOB.
