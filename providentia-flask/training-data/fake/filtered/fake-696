If you want some real Puerto Rican home cooking then this is the place to come to. Prices are very reasonable- you'd be hard pressed to prepare a meal for the same price at home. The food is tasty and fresh. The cooks and wait staff are very friendly and seem to be family, uncles, aunt etc. Try the rotisserie chicken and roast pork. Pop out the back through the kitchen and you can see it all cooking. If I lived in the neighbourhood I'd be a regular, as it is I live in New Zealand
