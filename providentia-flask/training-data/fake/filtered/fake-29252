Our entire table was trying to figure out what makes this restaurant successful. While some of the executions were nice and thoughtful others were just OK. Honestly the service was good by Manhattn standards. Menu couldn't have been printed with smaller fonts. The restaurant was busy, which is a plus in a dining experience. The bathrooms not so good, not so clean at all. Overall I really can't remember one thing that stood out for any of us.
