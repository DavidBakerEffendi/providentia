Just wanted to share with all that food - sashimi and sushi - were excellent. Having lived in NY for a long time frequenting so many great Japanese restuarants, i wondered if i can find a nice Japanese restaurant with fresh and high quality raw fish and yummie sushi near North Caldwell, NJ. But, Â i don't have to wonder no more as i found a great one right in the neighborhood. We did not order lunch box but we ordered a big boat - sashimi and sushi for two. This was big enough for 4 of us. If there is any complaint, i would say that the service was a bit slow as we went there when it was the busies. I am hoping that it will be faster next time. Any who, I really enjoyed the food here and i loved the ambiance as well. Go give a try, i am sure you will love it.
