I have always loved Pietro's until my last visit, when the manager did something that has caused me to swear to never return! When we were getting ready to pay our bill, my friend asked a passing busboy to get us change, handing him a $20 bill. He never returned and when we asked the waitress to check on this, she came back and reported that the busboy said we had never given him any money! We most certainly did, so she called the manager over. The manager was very rude, and proceeded to basically accuse of trying to rip off the restaurant, saying that he busboy was very honest, etc. He offered us NOTHING for this loss of $20. I think maybe the busboy got so busy he legitimately forgot, but I still think the manager should have reimbursed us. Why he would think two business people would make something like this up to get $20 back is beyond me. VERY poor customer service - I won't go back!
