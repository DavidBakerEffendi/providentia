Just wanted to give a shout out to Brooklyn Commune's supper club.  I went to the one this past weekend and it was great!  Food was fantastic and plentiful...there seemed to be endless courses, from baby bok choy with mushrooms and plums to amazing brown rice fritters in curry sauce.  I wasn't completely crazy about a cabbage dish but I don't like cabbage so go figure - everyone else was going nuts over it.  My only complaint is that I ate too much because each dish was better than the last.  And at the end, dessert was this lemon thing with yoghurt and granola and berries.  Perfect. It was $40 and BYOB (not sure if they have a liquor license) but that worked.  People at my table (most of whom didn't know each other) got along so well that people were sharing bottles of wine.  And JuiceBox WIne is right next door so we just picked up a bottle en route to dinner. It's served family style which gave to a real neighorhoody feel.  I think they have the event every month.  Definitely worth checking it out.
