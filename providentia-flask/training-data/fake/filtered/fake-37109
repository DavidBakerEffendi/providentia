My wife and I have joined other friends to dine at John Henry's twice in the last two months.  The dinner was a wow factor and we dine out a lot. For Salmon lovers, they prepare amazing choice and their New England Clam Chowder is the best I've ever had. Service was good, and the ambience was good.  I highly recommend it.
