Outstanding "home-cooked" Caribbean food. Both the jerk and curry are excellent, as are the beef patties and fried shrimp. The desserts are very good too, especially the banana pudding. Friendly, casual atmosphere...the chef/owner came to our table to check how we were doing (very well, thank you!) We stumbled onto this place after getting off the NJ Turnpike to get out of stop-and-go traffic. What a find! We are going to make it a regular stop now on our way to visit our son in college. Love it!
