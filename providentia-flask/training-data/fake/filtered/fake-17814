My date and I really enjoyed our experience at Charcoal. We had the grilled romaine and macaroni and cheese for a first course. The grilled romaine was a nice change to the everyday salad adding a bitter char taste to the greens. This with the lemon confit and caesar dressing made for a great dish. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and delicious. We both ordered the steak and eggs entre, cooked exactly med. rare and well seasoned with coarse salt. It was so much fun to have the sauce for the steak drool out of its little fried vessels. For dessert we shared the cheesecake with kiwi sorbet, caramelized apple rounds, and melt in your mouth toffee dust. This dessert was amazing! The tartness of the kiwi complemented the sweetness of the apples and toffee perfectly. We really enjoyed the asymmetrical dinner plates and cute pot the macaroni and cheese came in, as well. Service was great; the servers had good energy and were very positive with us. This restaurant was a refreshing experience compared to the others in the area. We appreciated the attention to detail with all the dishes and can't wait to frequent Charcoal often!
