This place has possibly the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!! After the delivery took over an hour to never appear, I called to cancel. After speaking with a so called manager i was ensured that my credit card would be refunded for the order. Almost a week later the refund was never processed. When I called  to find out why I never  received the refund another so called manager ( who was completely unapologetic, I might add) tells me that they have been "backed up". How could you not refund a purchase for items a customer never received immediately?!  Its sad that a place who has a great product is missing the key ingredient of customer service. I will never order from this place again. To speak to a nasty employee after I was essentially stolen from, is unacceptable.
