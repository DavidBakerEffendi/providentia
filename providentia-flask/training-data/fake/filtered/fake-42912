We ordered food but it was never delivered to us. We called the restaurant and the manager started yelling at me and stated that the food was delivered. We ordered via Seamless.com so that we paid when we ordered. I have never experienced such a horrible attitude as displayed by this manager. He treated us horribly rude. He was very aggressive, inconsiderate and unacceptably hostile. Bottom line: We paid $25, never received any food and were even yelled at. Please do yourself a favor and NEVER order food there!
