The best is their basic wonton noodle soup. Price and flavor can't be beat... It's small tho so the 4.75 maybe isn't that entirely cheap. They are super fast with to go orders, and many of their other entrees are solid and not expensive. Definitely one of the better places in Chinatown for HK style food and noodles...
