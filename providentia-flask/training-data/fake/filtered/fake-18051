What can I say? I love this place. The cocktails are delicious, the bartenders are the sexiest in the city, and the cocktails are delicious. The food is also delicious. One of my favorite things to eat is the turkey platter, with a "Devil Top" (onion rings stuffed with french fries) on top. Delicious. I do have a major complaint, and it's one that I hear from all of my girlfriends, too. THE BARSTOOLS ARE HORRIBLY UNCOMFORTABLE. It makes it hard to sit around for more than 10 minutes without your leg and/or ass falling asleep. There may be a time and a place for a numb backside, but it's not while you are sitting at the bar enjoying delicious cocktails. Please, Devil's Alley. Get this girl some comfortable stools!
