Recently had dinner at Nikko Hibachi with a bunch of friends.  We had hibachi and it was very good.  Chef was entertaining.  Wait staff attentive.  After dinner went to have after dinner drinks at bar.  Bartender (Amanda) was friendly and spot on when making Long Island Iced Teas!  Would recommend Nikko's to anyone.
