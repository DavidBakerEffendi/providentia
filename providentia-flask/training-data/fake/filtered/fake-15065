I was pretty surprised to read the other review. I order pizza from here every few weeks and have always found the food quality to be great and my pizza is always piping hot... perfect! As far as staff, everyone has always been super friendly. I've even had one occasion where we were dining in and the manager brought over a bag of zeppoles on the house and another where I swung by near closing for 2 slices... they had 3 left and gave me the extra one for free. This place is always clean, you can order online, and their specialty pies are great! EDIT: It looks as though a lot of the old reviews were removed or filtered. I said I was surprised because previously there were a lot of negative ones that didn't seem accurate to my experiences.
