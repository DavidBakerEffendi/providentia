Ate here for the first time last week. Such a great experience. Started with one of the guacamole dips. I usually do not really like guacamole however this was excellent. Our main course was even better. If you like spicy this is place for you. There were 3 of us and we shared desserts. Yummy. Excellent. Not only was the food great, our server was very nice, explained the food and drinks in a way that you wanted to try everything. The atmosphere of the place also perfect. If you have not gone you should go soon.
