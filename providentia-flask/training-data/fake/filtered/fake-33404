In short I recommend it, a very fine place.   In more details, one can enjoy a variety of excellent organic healthy food prepared in front of you on the grill.  While you wait there are many kinds of shakes that you may try and they are fleshly made in front of you.   After a delicious meal, you must their coffee it is outstanding.  At the end one can just walk over the adjacent place and relax smoking a hookah.  :-) What an enjoyable evening.
