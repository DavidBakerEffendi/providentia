I was super excited about going to this place based on the other yelp reviews, but then I had such a horrible experience that I will NEVER go back. First of all, the service sucks. It take forever for them to bring you anything. I mean come on how long does it take to bring water and a salad. Then this horrible man who was hosting that night came and yelled at me and my friend bc one of our friends showed up late after work and sat down with beware because you must tell them when you are having someone join even if they are not eating. I understand the point, but he was so rude. Then on top of all of that, i looked at my bank statement and they charged me twice. One charge was my actual bill of $39.10 and then another for $73!!!! My friend also looked at her bank statement and had a double charge. This place is ridiculous and I will never be back.
