Tandoori Bite is the best indian restaurant in New Jersey. The food is delicious and the service is great.  I have eaten here many times and have never been disappointed.  Tandoori Bite also delivers to the Princeton area and I have had their delivery a few times as well.  If you are in Princeton, definitely stop by Tandoori Bite on Whitherspoon and try it out.
