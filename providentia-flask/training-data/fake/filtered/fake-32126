Stopped by early before the Devils game. Wasn't that busy but every single staff member seemed as if they could care less that they were there. Our waitress was terrible and several times ignored us with empty pint glasses. when we ordered a round it would show up in spurts over 10 minutes and not all at once. Food was ok, but not great. Took 3 times to ask for a side of mayo. I added "bay" fries for a dollar extra. It was a ripoff with just a small amount of old bay on them. Over a 3 hour period we each had 3 beers but wanted more. The only one who was doing anything was the young girl running out the food. The staff where fighting at one point due to one of them walking into the other one and spilling some drinks. They all seemed to be in a rush and didn't know what to do.
