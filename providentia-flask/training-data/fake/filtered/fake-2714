If I didn't have to give at least one star, I wouldn't. My boyfriend has been playing in bands for a good 3 years so I've been to quite a few bars. I've never experienced such a poorly run bar. Firstly, the bartenders are rude. I don't know if it was just a bad night or what but purposely spilling a person's beer by bumping into their arm because they didn't tip you and then brag about it to your bar friends after they walk away, I'd have you fired in a second. Secondly, the beers really aren't reasonably priced unless you come during their specials (which end at 7) **I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND PLAYING HERE** My boyfriend's band sold a good number of tickets and brought in a good number of people. Usually if its a good turn out they either get some free beer or get paid for the night. They got neither. Definitely wasn't worth lugging their equipment from North East Philly and having to deal with all the rude people that work there. There are much more better places to play at.
