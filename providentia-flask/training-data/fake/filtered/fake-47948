I take a group of friends or colleagues here once a month. The food is so creative and delicious. The Chef here puts his touch on everything from seasonal veggies to local meats and in house made charcuterie. It works as a tapas place where you order a lot of different dishes to share, this creating a very social atmosphere! Flavors are unbelievable! This is a place for food, especially a group of friends to share. The drinks are always exciting and different. It is a very popular place. Understandably so. We arrive at our scheduled time and are promptly seated, which always is a very nice surprise. The restaurant is very busy, but the service is really quick and very personable. Do yourself a favor and save room for dessert. I've visited Ibiza Tapas probably a dozen times, there are a couple standards always on the menu that would alone make a return trip a must. Don't miss this little gem in a great spot, great food, good drinks, great waiter, great service, good vibe... will keep going back!!
