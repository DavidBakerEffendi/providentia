My husband and I checked out this place because of all the positive Yelp reviews, and I have to say it did not disappoint.  The food was very fresh and the wait staff was incredibly nice!  We completely loved the ambiance, this is an awesome restaurant!  The menu was simple and didn't overwhelm you, this is a true gem!  Go there if you are ever in Little Italy!
