I love the soul food ( yes they have it) and the Chicken Cheese steak  with spinach. Mr. Lee is quiet and unassuming, great with kids who show up to buy snacks on their way to school.  Yes he will say he has the BEST chicken cheese steak.. I  remember when they did the lunch program for a local school, not sure if that is still in effect. Lee's Deli have evolved to the changing culture of university city from soul food to vegetarian selections. They also sell lottery tickets. And if you're looking for something for a parched tongue, hot or cold they just might have just what  you're looking for. You can sit in or order out.  Check out their menu: philadelphia.menupages.c…
