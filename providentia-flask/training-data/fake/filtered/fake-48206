When I found out that there was a place in NYC that was able to thrive off of solely selling French Fries, I knew that I certainly had to try them out, and in doing so I had no regrets. The fries are awesome and the assortment of sauces and dips that they have to go along with them is mind blowing. Their Mango Chutney Sauce is on the top of my favorites list at the moment; so much so that I went out and bought some sauce for myself at home... ;-P
