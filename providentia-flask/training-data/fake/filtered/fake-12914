I don't want to sound like a snob, but for some reason, every time I walk in here, the water gives me phlegm and tastes like dishwater. And it's pretty metaphorical for the restaurant. We live right around the corner, and gave it multiple chances, and quite literally EVERY time the wait staff has messed something up. Made fun of us for not being able to pronounce something, brought us the wrong food, took way too long, eventually climaxing into the most recent time where they screwed up our check, but could not fix it and eventually had to just say that my card would be refunded in a few days. There is better Italian pretty much everywhere in Philadelphia.
