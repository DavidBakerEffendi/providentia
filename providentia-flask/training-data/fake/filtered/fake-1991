One of the best vietnamese restaurant in Philly. I always order the BBQ platter and spring roll when I go there. It is always awesome and I never get disappointed with its food quality. I think I should try other food like pork chop or those meat with vermicelli noodle. I'm confident that they must be tasty also since everyone mentions about how delicious they are.
