As a Philly native and lifelong resident, I like to think I know a thing or two about cheesesteaks. When I moved to Roxborough, everyone told me I HAD to try Dalessandro's. So I did. Meh. The cheese and meat were well integrated, but the meat was so finely chopped that it was like eating a paste; not terribly appealing. My mushrooms and onions were simply laid over the top in very large pieces. It wasn't awful, but strictly mediocre. I've gotten better steaks from West Philly pizza joints.
