Order the chocolate mousse cake for pickup. Had peanut butter in it and not in the description on the menu and I am allergic to peanuts. Thank god for a full epi pen. I also had to re-ask for utensils even though I asked to have it added to my order. The cornbread was terrible , very mealy. Â Service leaves a lot to desired per reviews, I thought takeout would better. Guessed wrong.
