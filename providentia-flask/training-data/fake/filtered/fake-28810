I found the Hourglass Tavern online while looking for a place to have a work dinner that included some Vegan friendly menu items. I met with Beth and was very impressed by her dedication to our group and her attention to details. It made our evening a fabulous success! We felt like VIPs and everyone enjoyed their meal and the charming atmosphere. Our server and bartender, Scott, was wonderful. Thank you Beth and Scott, The Hourglass Tavern is certainly on my list of favorite places!
