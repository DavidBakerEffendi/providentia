The food here was really good.  Expensive considering most of the dishes are appetizers but it's the city so I guess that's to be expected. Ribs were great, pork buns were great, loved the crab croquettes. They don't have a full bar so drink choices are limited but other than that i really enjoyed it.  Go early if you can we sat down at 530 and the place filled up around us. By the time we left there was an hour wait.  Highly recomend!
