let me say first that most people will be put off by the location as it is in Belleville NJ however dont let that put you in the mood to not go as this is actually the BEST resturant in all of New Jersey.we arrived at an odd time for lunch 2 pm way past the lunch crown and way too early for the dinner rush and were at first hesitant as we were the only ones there but that really had more to do with the time then anything else,and just as always the people there make you feel right at home.we ordered the spring rolls as an appitizer to share and they came out piping hot and the tastiest home made spring rolls i ever had ,then my boyfriend had some noodle dish with shrimp,the portion size was unbelivable and not only did it had shrimp but calamari and other goodies i could tell by the look o his face that he was very happy with his choice.i ordered the Tamarind Duck and let me tell you if you like duck this is the pace to get it,it was without a doubt the best duck i ever ate in my life the crispy parts were just right and the meaty parts were so tender you wanted to cry and it was a HUGE portion,im hungry for it right now and we just finnished it a half hour ago.for dessert we had the fried oreo and fried brownies that comes with vanilla ice cream YUM YUM YUM.the service is friendly and quick even when the place is crowded as my boyfriend has been there 3 times earlier and raved about it every time and now i know why!
