Beware of terribly rude restaurant owner-manager! I have never been treated so rudely in any business in my life. I had eaten here once before and agree that the pizza is good (not great but worth a return visit). Last night my friends and I visited Mama Palma's to celebrate my friend's mother's 70th birthday. We arrive at 7pm. The restaurant was less than 2/3 full with most tables empty. We were tersely instructed by the owner to wait in the back on a bench until our whole party had arrived as we would not be seated until all were present. When the last of us had arrived we returned to the front to confirm we would be 7 persons only to be rudely told I must return to the back until summoned as I was an obstruction in the mostly empty restaurant. When I commented to the proprietor that his hospitality was not very warm he flipped out and as I walked back to the bench as requested I could hear him loudly shouting that he would not serve us and we must leave. A waitress came back soon after to say that they would serve us if we wanted to stay. But after such an experience with a proprietor shouting about a client in the middle of a restaurant when surrounded by other customers we felt that we were best off dining elsewhere. When I commented to the owner on the way out the door that I had never before received such "excellent" service he again began shouting and followed us out the door violently shouting obscenities at us as we stood on the sidewalk alongside his dinner guests eating outside. The experience was literally the worst I have ever experienced in any restaurant or business. Rather than welcoming customers or inviting the elderly guests in our party to take a seat and be comfortable, we were treated like pests. When questioned, the owner-manager became enraged, rude, and crude, shouting obscenities at customers in the middle of the establishment. No meal is worth this level of abuse and insult.
