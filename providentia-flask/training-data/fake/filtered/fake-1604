Though the wait is often terrible I've never had a bad experience with the food. The portions are large and I usually never finish my food, luckily my boyfriend is a fan as well and tends to finish what I don't. I honestly would have given a 4 star rating but what really bothers me is the tiiiiiiny little drinks they give you that never last through the entire meal, when I ask for an orange juice I don't mean a shot and I've noticed customers who the staff clearly knew getting special treatment.
