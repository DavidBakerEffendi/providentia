I was very disappointed by the xiao long bao (soup dumpling) served in this restaurant. I went this particular restaurant twice. The first time the xiao long bao was too salty as if people tried to preserve the pork meat from being spoied. By seeing the relatively good reviews for this restaurant, I came 2nd time. However, the xiao long bao was tasted like coming from the frozen food sections of a Chinese gorcery store. This might be really the case because there are very few people know how to make the xiao long bao right.
