After reading reviews on Yelp in general and reviews on this restaurant in particular, it is quite obvious that most of the people using this service are not in the possession of the basic gustatory capacity nor the experience to provide credible reviews. While I do not doubt the sincerity of the sharing of their experiences, their reviews' lack of useful, critical, balanced information that does not lapse into trite sensationalist language like "it was amazing" etc. is astonishing. I don't care how many of you are offended by this truth because chances are if you're offended you're probably part of the problem here. That being said, this review is for those of you who have taste (pun intended). While I'm not a professional food critic, my abilities in this regard are on par with some of the best you'll read. So if you wish to receive excellent advice on where to eat, follow me and be sure to give my reviews about 10 times the weight as the usual gushing, 5 star, hoi polloi write-ups that are so common here. Review of Greek Taverna: Overpriced diner food. Don't bother unless you're desperate for something different than your usual favorite restaurant and would like to experience disappointment. Some Low points: - misdirecting you with large portions with hopes that this will somehow make up for the lack in quality. - gratuitous usage of olive oil in everything (except the raw, undressed shredded cabbage accompanying most dishes) - amateurish presentation - Inedible, oily, overcooked greens - pork chops over cooked and poorly seasoned - stale phyllo dough, strange flavor, rancid? - uninspired Greek salad, coarse and ill prepared To leave on a positive note the servers were gracious and professional, parking was off street in a lot, and the atmosphere was passable.
