after visiting Queens comfort a couple of times, I think it'll be a long time before I go again. Last time, I ordered the mac&cheese and it never came.  By the time I got the waiters attention my friends had eaten and I found my meal so big and heavy that I didn't even bother to tell the waiter.  But still had to fight to get it off my bill. Oh well, I was hoping for better once they started doing brunch.  but not so much.
