Awful experience. 9pm on Saturday night. Noticeable from time walked in that the place was understaffed (or staff was just lethargic) Still we figured we'd give it a shot. But things only got worse. Waiter didn't greet us. Basically just asked for our order. We asked about specials. He said "read the board behind you." We ordered the pesto pasta dish with scallops. (Looked/tasted like it came out of the microwave) Monkfish was overcooked & tasteless. We had wanted to try Next Door after enjoying a dinner at Blu & knowing rep of Zod Arifai -- but left very disappointed. Will not be back. We wound up at Salute down the street. THAT is a place we can recommend.
