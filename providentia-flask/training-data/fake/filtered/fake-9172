This place is absolute garbage. I ordered from here and I'm so dissapointed with everything. The fries are crap and the burger was messy with absolutely everything I told them NOT to put on it on burger. I'm a college student, so I don't have a lot of money and this was just a waste. I'm absolutely livid that I spent 12$ on this when I could've gotten chinese food. It arrived on time but I spent more than 10 minutes on the fucking phone with the delivery man who didn't know his way around the campus and the food was over priced for the piece of crap that I got. Honestly, I want a refund. Fries and burger were luke warm when they got here. Two bags of fries were filled like Lay's chip bags, more air than fry and I am so disappointed. I won't be ordering from here anymore. IF ANYONE ORDERING FROM HERE ON KEAN UNIVERSITY'S CAMPUS, DO NOT ORDER. Next time I order off of grubhub, I'm ordering chinese. Even if I'm craving burgers. IMO? More like IMAPIECEOFCRAP
