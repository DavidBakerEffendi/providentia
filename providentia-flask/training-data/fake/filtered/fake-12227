My friends threw me a birthday dinner here this week (on a snowy Wednesday) and while I have been a Miyas fan for a while now they really impressed me this time. With thirteen diners its a little cumbersome to get everyone to decide what they want and then remember what they ordered etc. Our waitress suggested that we tell her how much we wanted to spend (~$15) and any dietary restrictions and she would just bring us whatever the chef felt inspired to send out.  It was spectacular, not only was the food amazing (as usual) but we had the opportunity to try all sorts of things that we probably wouldn't have chosen off the menu (seriously, how to you ever make a decision at Miyas?! everything is amazing and the menu is intimidatingly huge!), The staff was delightful and super cute!  they were great about having 13 nursing students and SOs sitting around and being loud for a couple of hours and were sweet enough to sing me 'happy birthday' as they brought out the cake (which we brought with us). Amazing! I'm thrilled with Miyas! and you should be too!
