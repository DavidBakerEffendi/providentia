A great addition to the Washington Square area! I've only tried the coffee/grab-and-go section. Every baked good I've tried has been absolutely delicious (get the ultimate zucchini bread!). Like others have said below, ordering is a bit confusing and it'll take a while to work out the kinks. However, the staff is doing an excellent job so far. Prices are very fair -- ginormous snickerdoodle cookie was only $1.50! Most baked goods are in the 2-5 dollar range and well portioned. Coffee prices are a little steep for the specialty drinks. Love that they have a water jug sitting out on the coffee bar. Can't wait to try the dinner options when they debut!
