OK, I only had some bar snacks - but the food was not too good. The staff was nice - very young, but attentive. Â I chose a beer to go with my food - I realize the craft beer thing is very in now, nothing wrong with that - but maybe they could throw in a Stella or Duvel so everything on the menu in not a mystery. The Library was just OK, kind of small....I was expecting more.
