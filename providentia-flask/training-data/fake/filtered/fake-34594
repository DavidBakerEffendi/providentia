Was here on Sat n Today. I must say this is close to what I had in a great southern Indian restaurant in NY and it is wayyy cheaper. The sambar is awesome and they did not stinge on Dosa filling. The Samos's and mango lassi is heavenly. Most recommended. Slightly longer waiting time a it was busy. Brilliant. Thanks for a great meal
