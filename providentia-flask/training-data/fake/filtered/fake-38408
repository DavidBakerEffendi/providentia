My date and I went to Ootoya for lunch, and we were quite disappointed.  Simply put, the service was atrocious.  We waited approximately half an hour for ice water and another 5 minutes for our order to be taken. The food redeemed our experience slightly.  I ordered the Hokke teishoku, and my partner ordered the Mackerel.  The fish was cooked nicely, but some of the other components were lackluster.  The oroshi (grated Daikon) was bitter and spicy, which results from slicing the daikon incorrectly.  The pickled vegetables were bland.  And the chawanmushi lacked anything but runny eggs.   Perhaps it was an off-day, but the service and poorly prepared sides do not entice me to return.
