I am shocked by the bad reviews on Thai Essence.  My family and I eat here very, very frequently and we are never disappointed.  The food is absolutely delicious.  Most Thai restaurants make their dishes too sweet, but Thai Essence's pad thai, pad kee mao, and pad see ew are PERFECT.  Not to mention, the chocolate souffle is excellent.  The restaurant itself is very cute inside and trendy.  It's enough for you to feel comfortable while at the same time still enjoying the ambiance of "going out".  And best of all, it's BYOB.  Pricing is very reasonable.  You will enjoy the food and atmosphere here... 5 Stars.
