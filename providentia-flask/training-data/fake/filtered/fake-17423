The service was good and the famous dan-dan noodles requested to make it without pork was GREAT...but the other dishes..cold chicken with szechuan as well as their pot hot chicken..BOTH HAD OVERLY DONE SZECHUAN PEPPER..I am used to using szechuan in many of the food i make and this was over done..and with regular peppers..chilli peppers and szechaun peppers on the food..they had killed every bit of flavor out of the food...i dont think i will go back..migh tbe a bit overrated for me..but then again..the dan dan noodles were preettyy good and the service was good too...!!
