Visited on Feb 2nd, 2014 for dinner. Was excited initially to have found a good South Indian eatery in the vicinity of Princeton. But the overall food experience was extremely disappointing. The wadas were clearly frozen and reheated. So was the sambar which clearly lacked the feel of being fresh. Tried spicy hyderabadi dosa and the mysore masala dosa. Both had filling that too appeared to be frozen and reheated. Texture and taste of Indian food is such that the difference between fresh and stale+frozen can be made out immediately. Probably, Â the saving grace was an attentive service; but that may have been because there weren't many customers that evening.
