The corn on the cob is great! I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on their fruity fresh beverages but they look good. Â  I love the festive decor and bright colors! It's great for the outdoor patio on a beautiful day (sun and birds are out). I always want to go dancing after I eat here at Habana Outpost because I get hype...Viva!
