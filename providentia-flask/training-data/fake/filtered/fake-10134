Have been a customer of Beana's since they opened their doors soooooo many years ago. When we started coming, our (now) 24-year-old son was little more than a toddler. Beana's play area meant that my wife and I could have a rare meal out where we ate together while we watched our son entertain himself with puzzles and coloring books. Now, our boy is a young man and we still go to Beana's. In the 20-some years, I have only sent back one meal. I found their chili to be greasy. That aside, Beana's food is always consistent. Their refried beans are wonderful. The taste can't be found in something in a can on a supermarket shelf. I always ask that they serve them 'naked,' without cheese or salsa on them as they taste great all by themselves. Also recommend the fajitas dinner, which is too much for one person to polish off. Tacos, hard OR soft shell are another delight. If you are a vegetarian, you can ask for black bean filling instead of beef or chicken. Although I am a dedicated carnivore, I have frequently opted for black bean tacos. Yes, the drinks are in red Solo cups. Who cares? The birch beer is just as sweet as in glass. I wouldn't turn away a frozen mug, though. Big props to Gina and the gang for providing happy dining for many years.
