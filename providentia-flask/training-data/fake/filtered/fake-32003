I disagree with Alex g., Who wrote that he thought it was inappropriate for a employee to have tattoos, wear a tank top, and vintage clothing, while slicing the Brisket. He admits he's never been there, so he assumes that those things indicate unclean food handling. You can't spell assume without the ASS! I just made my third visit to BrisketTown and again, Food was was fantastic, the place is clean, and they have a great and very friendly staff. Alex g. why don't you review the restaurants you've been to?
