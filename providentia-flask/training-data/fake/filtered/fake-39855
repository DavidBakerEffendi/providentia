Please no one tell me when this place opened because i'll be extremely sad to know how long I've been missing out on this AWESOME food! Discovered Pure last week and had such a great lunch! Ordered the Pad Kee Moa with calamari which was extremely yummy. Everything was cooked to perfection, the seasoning was nice and spicy and the calamari was overflowin! Capped it off with their dessert special -- yam custard with mango sticky rice. If you haven't tried it, you must! It's heavenly goodness wrapped up in a banana leaf. Just trust me on this! The service was also stellar. The food flew out of the kitchen and our server was super attentive. And the place itself has a nice cozy, rustic feel to it that makes you want to hang around for a while (even though there's probably some other hungry folks eagerly waiting for a table). I wouldn't hesitate to go back. In fact, hoping to find any excuse to go back very soon!
