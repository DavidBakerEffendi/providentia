Oh My God~~~~~  We have finally found the best Thai Restaurant in New Jersey!!!!!   I had no idea this place existed until we read the 4 star review in NJ Monthly this past month.  We came here on Friday night and all I can say is that this is the absolute best Thai food we have ever had.  We used to go to a certain Thai place in Nutley - never again.  This place is the real deal.  The entree's and app's were out of this world.  It's a BYOB and by the time we left, the place was packed.  Who knew this tiny little place existed!!!  The heat factor is right on the mark, if you love spicy, you will love this food.  The 1-10 heat factor is not for wimps.  We had great wings and fried calamari for app's and the volcano chicken (awesome) and the glass noodles with crispy chicken (excellent) with an "8" heat factor.  And let me tell you - that was not a wimpy "8".  That was a "clean your gut out" 8.  We cannot wait to come back here again.  Loved it!!!!!
