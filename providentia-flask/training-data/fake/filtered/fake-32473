What a disappointment! Place has pretty good food and some our office staff regularly orders food from this place (at least 3 times a week) - but customer service is horrendous. For example, we called recently for a delivery and due to the fact the delivery was going to be a while, we asked that they simply put some of our food in separate container so it doesn't get soggy. The response from a young woman, "I was told that you guys order from us a lot and have too many requests, so from now on we are not going to be able to do that for you." My response was sure charge us for the container, the young woman on the phone said "NO"!!!!! What the heck! How much does a container cost!!!! She even stated that "it takes extra time to do that" - mind you I don't even think that they are that busy as there are only one of two customers each time I have been (in total of over 20 times in person). Truly disappointing....will not be a patron here anymore!!!!! The owner of this place should really pay attention to their employees!!! THIS WAS AN ABSURD INTERACTION! - Pat
