a great stop over if youre in brooklyn. the place is minimal. but the pizza and the people make up for it. the pizza is always just coming out of the oven, since there's such a huge turnover with so many people ordering. one way to guarantee you get your slice faster then some, ask for a topping, dominic puts it on a slice while the pie's still baking, so when it comes out you don't have to wonder if you'll be the lucky few who'll get a slice or have to wait for a new pie. the best topping is extra cheese, fresh mozzarella pieces put right on the slice.
