Nice day, so my husband and I decided to go to the READING TERMINAL for their delicious ROTISSERIE CHICKEN WINGS and POTATO SALAD from the AMISH. Of course we have to wash it down with the AMISH freshly squeezed fruit juices....so refreshing! The Reading Terminal is a busy spot and clearly they need some one to direct traffic but it's well worth the hassle because they have so much to choose from there...even a CHOCOLATE and CANDY spot that you just can not deny...definitely want to try those chocolate covered strawberries...
