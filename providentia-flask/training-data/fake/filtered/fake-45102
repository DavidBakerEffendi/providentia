Excellent food. Soup dumplings (xiao long bao) were tastier than joe's shanghai's and nice green bo's. Â They usually start tasting greasy and heavy by the 3rd one, but here I had 5 and would have kept going if there weren't other yummy distractions. Lion's head meatballs were also great although the sauce was a bit salty for my taste. Scallion pancakes were the best I've had in Chinatown. The closest to the real thing. The decor is elegant and it was so clean! What a treat for Chinatown! The best part was Maggie Kwok. We were a large party and she was very accomodating. Would definitely go back!!
