This used to be my favorite place to order, their new driver left an experience that was less than to be desired. I called the restaurant to complaint about his attitude but it did not seem like it mattered much. Â I recommend Asian Palace or Yummy Yummy and probably will be the only two I do business with moving forward. I don't like writing reviews but this was a terrible experience and have been ordering from them for the past 3 years. Hopefully they take care of their new found short comings. To add: We ordered the duck in scallion sauce... it was mostly all scallion sauce shrimp fried rice, which had shrimp that was cut up.
