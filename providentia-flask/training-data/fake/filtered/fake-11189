I had such high expectations of this place, so perhaps that is why I was disappointed in the reality. There is just way too much happening in there. It was a sensory overload. I am quite skilled at shopping, navigating malls,eating in restaurants and getting through crowds, but to have to manage all of that at once is just too much. When I walked in, I was taken by the overall size of the place. It is huge. It was somewhat exciting actually. However, as I started to walk around, I began feeling a little overwhelmed and nervous. I wasn't sure where to go or what to do. While I understand the concept of making it seem like almost like a piazza with lots of shops and restaurants in one place, it doesn't work as well indoors. If there were a map or people around to ask for help it would be much better. However, I felt completely confused and alone. Weird to feel that in a store I know. I eventually had to leave - once I could actually figure out how to get out of there. I wanted to love this place. Unfortunately, I didn't. This is not for the faint of heart.
