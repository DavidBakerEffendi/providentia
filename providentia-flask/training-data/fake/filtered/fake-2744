Donny's New York Pizza is a MOSTLY excellent establishment that really makes Winooski proud.  The atmosphere inside the restaurant is relaxing and the owner is a gentleman and a scholar.  The location is prime and must be visited by all pizza-lovers in the area.  There is just one problem I encountered and it had to do with the delivery.  The delivery guy I encountered was an abomination.  From the moment he stepped out of his noisy, piece of shit vehicle there was clearly a problem.  His attire was less than acceptable and his body odor was noticeable from far away.  As I spoke with him at the door, (if you want to call it that, he was yelling the whole time), I was offended multiple times by his inappropriate language and incessant ranting about the New England Patriots.  I could not tell if he was under the influence of illegal narcotics or not, but there was certainly something off about him.  I was appalled by his general disregard for professionalism, as he seemed to have a strong dislike for Vietnamese people.  He even admitted to "rubbing one out" in the car on the way there.  As he left, I fought the urge to return my pizza because I was so outraged.  An otherwise successful business, I just felt I had to come on here to review my one insanely absurd experience with their delivery service.
