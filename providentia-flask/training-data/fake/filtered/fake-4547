i really want to like this place, but i have had awful service multiple times. I ordered a 3 egg make your own omelet today. First, there's no sign of my omelet for 10 minutes after my friend is served his brunch. Then, she comes over to apologize and says that she brought it to another table instead, and they're going to remake it now. Not a big deal. She finally brings it out and it looks like a dollhouse miniature of an omelet. There's no cheese in it. I tell the waitress this, cause for $13, it better be a good damn omelet. She says while rolling her eyes, do you want me to put cheese on top of it or get the manager? (it's cold by now and my friend is done his brunch) I say confused, "no. . .?" Anyways, nothing is taken off the check, no apologies. . . .so for $20 i got some toast, a fruit cup, a latte, and some orange juice. Another time, a friend ordered a chicken BLT and they forgot the bacon. . . not a big deal, but when my friend told our waitress about it, she rolled her eyes at us, scoffed, didn't apologize, and made it seem like it was our fault.
