wonderful place. Chef is a very modest but explosive culinary entite. i have been several times and basically only get my sushi and rolls from there. atmosphere is a mild , jazz cafe type mood with not much seating but if you have to wait it is so worth it. The New York Roll and The Incredible hulk are great Come see for yourself.I can basically swear that you will enjoy yourself. Oh bring your own alcohol. lol
