I was excited about this place opening in my neighborhood and really wanted to like it since I am a fan of Lure. However, I have to write about how disappointed I was that we placed an order for takeout and what we received was completely wrong. When we placed the order the staff were very nice however we very clearly indicated we wanted a Classic burger (on the menu this includes tomato, cheese, lettuce, onions, etc). We also asked for it Medium. When we got home and opened the order all we had was a charred pattie in front of us with absolutely none of the lettuce, tomato, onions, etc trimmings. If I wanted to pay $13 for an overcooked pattie with nothing else then i could have visited many other establishments. How disappointing!
