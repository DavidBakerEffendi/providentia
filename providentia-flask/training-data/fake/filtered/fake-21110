The food and service were passable...but nothing to really rave about. I was one of those that enjoyed the OLD Montville Inn for what it was; a dark little Gin Mill with the best Burgers in New Jersey! The New Montville Inn is ABSOLUTELY NOT the restoration of the original 1700's Colonial House, but a completely new building...not even the foundation survived the onslaught. Any Montville or Boonton resident that traveled Rt. 202 on a daily basis can attest to that! I found the New Montville Inn to be somewhat pretentious, without the slightest wink, nudge or tip of the hat to it's past. It's only connection to "history" is that it sits on approximately the same geo-historical location. Unless you are a "yuppie" a gen-Xer or someone approaching retirement age, you may feel uncomfortable there, because it seems that WE were NOT what the focus group was looking for as their cliental. Sorry to be such a downer, but truth must come out... We miss you Kippie! Will I go back? Â Yes, I probably will, if for no other reason than just to see if I was having an off day, or if they were... Eating at a place only once, is not a fair way to make any real judgments. Trust me, if my opinion doesn't change...I will let you know, and if it does, well...I've been wrong before!
