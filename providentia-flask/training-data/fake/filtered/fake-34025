A new amazing ,healthy,reasonably priced restaurant. The atmosphere is calming, it's beautiful and tastefully decorated. The staff are sweet as pie. On to the food... Seasoned with love, just enough and the Caribbean influence on the food items make these healthy dishes quite tasty! The stuffed avocado paired with a paradise smoothie is an amazing combo. The hummus is to die for. All around the food is absolutely amazing! A perfect place for vegans and non vegans alike.
