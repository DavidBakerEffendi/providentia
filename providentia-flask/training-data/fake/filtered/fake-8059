Great food is on almost every corner in New York, but great service can be another story. The Odeon delivers on both. We pulled up to the bar for a Sunday brunch and everything was excellent, from the Bloody Marys to the Croque Monsieur to the French Toast (which my husband declared as the best he's every had). Our bartender, Sam, was knowledgeable about the restaurant's history, the food, and the area and delivered service that was nothing short of perfect. Bravo - can't wait to return.
