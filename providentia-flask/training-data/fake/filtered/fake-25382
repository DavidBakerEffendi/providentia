The food here is excellent.  It is my first Cuban cuisine experience and I was impressed. However the cafe is very cramped and the service was lacking.  The experience was pretty authentic.  If you aren't looking outside you could swear you're in Havana somewhere. Get the corn as a starter you won't be disappointed.  I had the Cuban sandwich which was quite tasty but small compared with other mains.  I'll give it four stars because the food and feel carries it.
