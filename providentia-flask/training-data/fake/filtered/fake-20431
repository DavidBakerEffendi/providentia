I was looking for a new brunch spot and went here after reading good reviews and seeing rose water waffles and green shakshuka on the menu.  It is in a great hood and is a nice looking spot but there is definitely nothing special about decor.  Waited about 5 minutes for a table for two.  Once we were seated the waiter took a while to come over and take our order.    We then had to wait forever for our food to come out.  The hostess came over to apologize but it seriously took forever to come.  My shakshuka was cold and the waffle tasted kinda like matzo.  I can see waiting a while for food when a place is crowded at diner but not during brunch when you are making eggs and waffles.  Seriously, how long does it take to make a waffle?!   With so many other great spots around, I will definitely not be back.
