WOW ..............I walked inside Sports Burger and I got a warm welcome from the Manager Jimmy. He told me he just took over the location and that it was under New management. I looked at the menu and ordered the New Jersey Burger with Waffle Fries & a Drink. I didn't know what to expect. The food was ready and Jimmy brought it over to me. I haven't had a burger like this in a while. It was a Fresh ground beef Burger, Peppers ,Onions, Cheese, lettuce & tomato, Mayo & Ketchup and the Bun was really good, never seen anything like it.          I have to say that was a great meal, at a great price. The hospitality & the staff was so nice. The place had a great vibe. The food was fresh and I enjoyed every bite. I am always in Newark on business, and that will be my spot for a great burger. On the way out Jimmy made me a sample of the wings. I will let you guys know about them next time. Keep up the great job SPORTS BURGER! SEE YOU SOON!!
