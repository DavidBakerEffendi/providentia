Some friends and I recently went to Bishop's Collar when in the Fairmount neighborhood. The inside was kind of dingy, but the outdoor seating was nice. Most of the beers were in the $5-7 range and they have a good mix of different draft and bottled brews. The food was reasonably priced and we all agreed our food was mediocre. What really made me want to write this review was the mean servers. It seemed like more of a regulars type of place and maybe that explains why the staff was generally unfriendly and in a couple cases made snide remarks to us (and no, we weren't drunk or rowdy). There are so many great places in Philly I would never go back again. It's a different neighborhood, but Good Dog has similar prices with outstanding food and MUCH more friendly service.
