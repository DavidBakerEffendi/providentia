Really one word describes this place. Atrocious Hummus- mushed chickpeas no seasoning spices or olive oil. mushed chickpeas not hummus Eggplant app- barely edible but the description was nice All food was delivered to us at CHOP nothing was even remotely warm let alone hot. Poor experience more like Greek Shady....
