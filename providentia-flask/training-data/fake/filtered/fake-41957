I go to this place once a week at least.  Their sangrita tequila chaser makes me crave tequila.  (something I usually don't even drink.)  It's a spicy sweet juicy little tomato juice cup of deliciousness. Their chicken sandwich on the late night menu is my latest culinary love affair.  I dream about it at night.   The chicken is juicy thigh meat, they spread black beans on the soft fluffy bread, it comes with avocado and summer tomatoes and is accompanied by spicy hot peppers! mmmmmm.       You gotta go after 10 to get this though.        I love that they also have many veggie options as I am oft accompanied by an herbivore pal.   The bar staff is fast, communicable and entertaining.... My glass never even gets close to being empty at this place, never am i left waiting, staring into outer space for another cocktail to wind up in my grasp....I am consistently amused and pampered and always leave feeling more super than when I arrived.
