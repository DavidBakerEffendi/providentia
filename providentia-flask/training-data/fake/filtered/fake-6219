Went here on a Monday evening.  The atmosphere was pretty nice and overall I like the design and cleanliness of the place much more than other establishments in the area like Zinburger.   I chose the build-your-own custom burger and it was pretty good.  It was made just the way I like it and there are alot of good options to add on as toppings (the guacamole was very good and the number of combos seems endless).   I definitely suggest you get the 1/2 lb patty over the 1/3 lb because the 1/3 lb appeared very small.   The fries, however, were not as impressive.  My sister got the sweet potato fries with her meal and they looked a lot better.  The burgers are a bit pricy ($12.50 for a 1/2 lb patty plus $3 for a side of fries, so I will not be frequenting this place often, but I do recommend you check it out for yourself and enjoy a very good gourmet burger.
