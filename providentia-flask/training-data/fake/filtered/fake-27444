i dont know what is wrong with you people honesly.. THIS PIZZA IS NOTHING!!! the place has been closed down 4 time from health department and is the dirtest grimest pizzeria i have ever been too.. You can write your name on the greesy dusty walls... It always full and packed becuse the guy making the pizza is 60 years old and makes one pie at a time.  hes the only worker there besides the daughter which is slower then he is.   He has an electric oven not even and he burns every pizza buy 95% of the time... all in all the slice is ok but i dont know what the hype is.. Take my advice go check it out and you will see how disgusting the place is.... pizza is ok if you want better head to bensonhurst to a place on 65th and 23rd across from firehouse then youll see great pizza and what a pizzeria should be!!!!
