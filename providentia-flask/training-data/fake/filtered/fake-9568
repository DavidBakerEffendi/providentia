Morning Glory you used to be lovely, but now you're a rude, frustrating, disappointment. A friend and I have been going to Morning glory once or twice a month during the week for breakfast for the past 8 months or so. We always get there at 7:30 and order basically the same thing, so the usual morning waitress recognizes us and knows our order. That was great and breakfast was delicious for months. However, this morning we showed up at 7:30 and the gate was still locked. They open at 7. There was a couple and a child sitting at the counter eating who looked and acted like they were be the owners. (The woman, I believe, was Shannon who owns Chapterhouse.) We waved. They ignored us. We walked around to the other side of the building to see if there was a notice posted about late opening or anything, but there wasn't. We walked back and the woman held up her hand to indicate 5 minutes. She didn't come out to talk to us or apologize. We sat on a bench to wait, annoyed. And then it started raining. No joke. We left at 7:40, they were still sitting at the counter eating, ignoring their customers waiting in the rain. When I was searching for the owner of Morning Glory online I found that Sam passed away recently, which I was very sorry to hear. And this must mean that Morning Glory is under new ownership and/or new management. If this new management intends to open at least 40 minutes late without notice and leaves paying customers outside while they eat at the counter, then I don't intend to ever return - to Morning Glory (or Chapterhouse). I'm all for the staff eating, but at least let the customers come in out of the rain for coffee. Her behavior showed rude and inconsiderate business ownership, and I would rather support a local business that values and welcomes its customers.
