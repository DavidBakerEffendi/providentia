I used to love this restaurant, except after this evening, I am so disappointed.  I registered my information on their new web site, placed an order, received two emails back from them. One with the account information aknowledging that I registered and the other with my order information.  After waiting for over an hour for the food, I called and j.o. is trying to tell me I didn't place a address in my registration form.  I am not a a.o. and know how to order.  It doesn't even allow you to go further w/o the address information.  He sat there an argued with me, basically implying that I was an idiot.  Who is the customer?  Do you want me to give you a good review, pass your business info on to others or argue with me? I cancelled my order and will no longer order from these people.  You would think he would have called back and apologized to me????  To boot, they have delivered here on numerous occasions. Don't order from here to be treated like a piece of shit!
