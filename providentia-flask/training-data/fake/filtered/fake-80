We had a good time at this place. Service was good, food and drinks were good. The only negative is the Loudness factor. We were in the semi-private dining room downstairs and got a huge headache from yelling the entire time and trying to hear what everyone was saying. Too bad the acoustics are just terrible in this place :(
