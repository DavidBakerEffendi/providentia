Went to South Street with some of my friends to look for a new place to grab a bite. As we parked our car, a couple walks by talking about this great place they just went to. I asked them which one were they referring to and said La Fourno. The place is cozy. The service is great!!!! Every item we ordered -- delicious!!!! Truly an Italian restaurant in the heart of South Street. We are definitely coming back to La Fourno with more friends and families.
