I don't get the hype.  The baked empanadas were ordinary, and the only fried one that stood out was their seafood empanada, the Viagra.  The rest really are just average, especially if you've eaten lots of empanadas from different countries.  The positive note, however, is that they have empanadas catered to all different kinds of tastes.   The entrees, which I've ordered for takeout are OK (average Latino cafeteria food), but nothing bad but nothing great.  Staff is professional and courteous.
