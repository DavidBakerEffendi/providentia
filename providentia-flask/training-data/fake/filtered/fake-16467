Heard a lot of good things and was disappointed.  Service was good, food was mixed results, one meal really great (steak with mini baked potatoes and avacado salad) one wasn't good at all ( lobster Mac).  Also restaurant was extremely loud and it was hard to even carry on a conversation without shouting.
