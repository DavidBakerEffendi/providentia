I would like to commend the Miele's staff and owners for their flawless service during our family's gathering there after my Mother's funeral last week. The food was fabulous and there was never an empty glass or bread bowl. Everyone was so helpful and courteous. Thanks you so much for making a sad occasion into a beautiful memory!
