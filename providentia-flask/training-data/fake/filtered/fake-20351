BEST CATERERS!! We had an amazing experience using Sukhadia's Caterers for my son's wedding in Boston, MA. We had the 5 day event had the beautiful Westin Waterfront and Sukhadia's exceeded expectations!! Apart from delicious food, timely and clean manner, and white glove service, the most impressive thing was how much customization and personalization they put into our party. We had our own catering manager who we could use as our point person for the 6 months during preparation. They surprised us with a new/unique dish at every meal without charging us for it! And, they even made sure to feed the family and bride and groom first at all times! We had them cater all of 7 events and they can make a variety of foods to make each event different. They offer anything from Gujarati food to Thai food and everything in between. They will bring their whole team to your party and do a great job of working with hotel managers and other vendors to make sure everything goes smooth. I cannot thank them enough for making our party a success! Our guests still rave about the food!! Definitely go to Sukhadia's and speak to Raju if you need a quote or more information on their caterings. btw, Hiral P, I am so sorry for your experience! That sounds nothing like them! I'm sure if you call and ask for the owners they will do something for you. You should try that :)
