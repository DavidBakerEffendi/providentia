This place is wonderful. It's nice to see a place with an original menu and everything is made from scratch even the condiments. A welcome change from the generic road they could have taken. I wish they had soups. I could imagine them being delicious. My wife and I stopped in on a Monday night and were pleasantly surprised to see a table full of musicians having an acoustic jam session. Evidently, one of the chefs was the banjo player. We cannot wait to go to The Winchester again.
