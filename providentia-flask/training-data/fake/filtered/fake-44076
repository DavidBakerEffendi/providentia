Heading to Staten Island with a Boy Scout Troop of 30 folks, the plan was to take the bus from the Ferry Terminal to Joe & Pats. I was telling the Ferry policemen on the ride about the plan, and they gave me the tip of the trip. Pier 76 is the new, best slice in New York...owned by the son/nephew of the owners of the world renowned Joe & Pats. We dropped in unannounced and it was exactly the right decision. This was awesome, classic New York style pizza. Delicious sauce, perfect cheese, foldable and requiring just a sprinkle of hot peppers. It was as good as it gets. I'll definitely be back, and we fed 30 people for $170. Are you kidding me? We were planning to spend twice that...left a huge tip for their efforts and still came out way ahead. A, great, great experience.
