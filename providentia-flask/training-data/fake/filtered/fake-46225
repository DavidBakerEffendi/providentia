Came here with one of my friend, who promised me that I would enjoy the food here. The place isn't too big so I had to wait about a hour to be seated. The service here was good and the employees were all very friendly. The food here is good but the portions are really small for the price they charge. Overall this is a decent place and I would come again but not when I'm really hungry or have to wait that long.
