My First time here in NY and I  was impressed with the food .  I often try out new places with friends, and I find the food here VERY VERY DELICIOUS.   They serve a lot of interesting dishes .  Great Service, Staff was very friendly and polite, I'll definitely stop by again the next time  I visit NYC. I recommend
