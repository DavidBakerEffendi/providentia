I have been meaning to write this review for months and I am finally making the time because we had such a great experience. We made a reservation months in advance for a Friday night in December at 5:30PM only to be caught in crosstown traffic and forced to arrive thrity minutes late.  I called to let them know of our predicament and the gentleman who answered the phone was most gracious and said our table would be waiting. When we arrived, we were immediately seated center stage, the food was perfection, the service couldn't have been better, and we're planning a return visit next December. P.S.  The caprese salad with proscuitto and the seafood and squid pasta were beyond description.... I have never had anything so beautifully created and presented and, of course , it was delicious.
