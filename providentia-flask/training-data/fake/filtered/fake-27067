Great new spot on State Street!  The bartender/owner was fantastic and very knowledgeable about drinks and the food!  Everything was wonderful! We lucked out as it was a warm evening, so we were able to enjoy having the entire front opened.  Great decor and good music too! We will definitely go back!
