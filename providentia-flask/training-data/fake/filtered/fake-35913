Skip this place for a number of reasons: 1) food is overpriced - it's just not that good 2) the manager actually told my friends and I (8 people total) that we had to get up from our table because there was another party after us waiting to be seated. Worst part is that we were actually ordering more drinks.  When I went over and complained about it all they could say was that they had alot of people waiting - no apology at all.   3) overrun with hipsters trying too hard including the waitstaff and managers
