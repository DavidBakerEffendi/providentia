I went to Amy Ruth's about 9 years ago when I first moved to Harlem and the food wasn't good (Just so you know I only had breakfast) I never made another attempt to go back to the restaurant but my mother did and she was highly disappointed. She said "I never in my life had to cut through gravy and have eaten bitter collard greens). My mom is from the south and cooks soul food ALL the time (she even makes homemade biscuits) so having to experience such distasteful "soul food" and breakfast doesn't set well w/ either one of us. I really don't want give Amy Ruth's any stars but since it's required, I'll give them one for great service... Amy Ruth's is just a big name w/ lousy food!!!
