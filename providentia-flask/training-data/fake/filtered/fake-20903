I just had an eightieth birthday party for my mom there on 7/13/13 with over 50 people and I couldn't have been more pleased. I live in PA and am originally from Belleville NJ but had never been there. In my desparation to find a place for the party, my cousin told me he had been there for various parties and loved it. I literally booked it over the phone and never stepped foot in it until the day of the party. Pat and Liz had been so helpful over the phone in planning. I was so very pleased with the venue, the food and the service. I used Buffet #2 for the luncheon and ordered the antipasto, sausage and peppers, chicken tuscony, roasted potatoes, and the celebration cake that was included from Gencarelli's bakery. EVERYTHING was delicious! The food was plenty and we had leftovers to go home with. We were able to BYOB, and bring our own homemade cookies for a personal touch and they were fine with it. We hung posters on the divider windows (not on the beautiful wall paper), and put centerpieces on the tables and again no problem. The only minor negative was that we had a few cancelations but still had to pay for them, so just wait until the last minute to call in your numbers and you'll be ok. Besides, you can take the food home. I received compliments from all my guests! BRAVO to Pat and his staff. I wish I had a Ralph's here in PA to have all my parties at.
