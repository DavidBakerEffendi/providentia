Quite possibly the best place for breakfast during the weekdays in NYC for those who live in the West Village--otherwise it's totally overrun on the weekends. Great for coffee, fresh juice, the latest copy of NYT or WWD, two soft boiled eggs with soldiers, yogurt with fruit, etc. Short rib hash and breakfast club is also great for those with a larger appetite. Staff is lovely in bateau stripes.
