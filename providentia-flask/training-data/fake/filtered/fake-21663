I ordered a turkey sandwich here and was given exactly two slices of turkey between two slices of stale bread with a bit of avocado inside. (I admit that I asked them to leave the cheese off, but still...) Â Maybe this place is good for breakfast, but otherwise I would stay home and make yourself a decent lunch!
