My fiance and I had our Valentines Day dinner here. I am impressed. The atmosphere is very nice. It feels a lot like Shiroi Hana. We ordered the Octopus Ceviche as an appetizer, and I had the sushi deluxe, while my fiance had a Dragon Roll and a California Roll as our main courses. It was all delicious. They treated us to Miso Soup, Edamame, and a few other things. The most impressive was the seven inch sea eel sushi. It was absolutely delicious. One of the best things I've had. Their sushi portions were very large (something the specialize in, we were told) and we both left very full. We had the hand made chocolate dipped strawberry mochi for desert. If you're looking for something that's not overpoweringly sweet, give it a try. It's probably relatively healthy as far as deserts go as well. People talk up Umai Umai a lot, and it is legitimately great, but the portion sizes are small which makes it less of a value for your money, especially if you have a big appetite. Combine that with its popularity, which can make it hard to even get a seat on a weekend occasionally, and this place looks more and more attractive. They plan on doing take out and limited delivery in very near future. Our waiter, Dan, was a gentleman and was a great conversationalist. He made sure we were comfortable and the service was prompt. I hope this place really takes off, but I have to admit it was nice that it was just the two of us for dinner. The only hiccup was an issue with the credit card processing before I left, which took only a few minutes to resolve, so we didn't really notice. The two of us will be going back, and regularly. It's a lot more convenient than running to center city for great sushi.
