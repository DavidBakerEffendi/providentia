Had an amazing dining experience here last weekend. The staff was amazing (especially Sara and Sharon!) and the food was fresh and interesting. You really feel like you're dining in someone's house..really cozy and warm. Appetizers included green eggs and ham, kale salad and duck bacon wrapped scallops. All great. Cod and the special swordfish for entrees. Also simple and delicious. Everything is locally sourced, but they aren't obnoxious about it. They also acccommodated our gluten-free guest with plenty of menu options. We closed the place and hung out and talked with the owner and staff for awhile after dinner and they showed us the kitchen, where everything is cooked in a brick oven with wood. Really great night. Spread the word about the Marshal!
