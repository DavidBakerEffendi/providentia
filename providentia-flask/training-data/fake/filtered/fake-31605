This place is amazing!!! The food is perfect the prices are really good but what really made my experience the best was my server Alexis. She is by far the best server I've ever had in any restaurant. Â She's funny, extremely friendly and just exploding with personality. I honestly felt like she was my best friend that night. I wish she could've sat down and joined us for dinner because she was just that much fun!!!
