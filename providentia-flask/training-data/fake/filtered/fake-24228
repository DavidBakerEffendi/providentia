I've been eating at Vinnie's since 1986. I actually liked the old location better for some reason.   Anyway, Vinnie's is probably the only place where I order a pizza loaded with toppings.  All the toppings taste fresh, the pizza is delivered very hot, and it's delicious.  I swear the pizza tasted better in the 90's though but it still tastes good. Vinnie's meatballs are REAL meatballs.  They are not of the rubber variety.  These meatballs actually are nice and messy and they fall apart. The only dinners that I order are the Eggplant Rollatini and the Chicken or Veal Marsala.  The hot sandwiches are excellent. I do wish they would use softer bread though. Do not order the lunch special.  I ordered from it twice and the pasta was not even cooked properly. I was not impressed with most of the other dinners, the cold sandwiches, the seafood, and the pasta and I didn't like their Calamari.  On a few occasions, they messed my order up and the chicken parm sandwich did not taste fresh.  I've probably ordered from here 100's of times so I forgive them. Vinnie's is  rather expensive for the area and the prices continue to keep going up.  Some appetizers are as expensive as some sandwiches and dinners elsewhere. On a positive note, the place is extremely clean, Pat runs a tight ship over there. Staff is friendly and professional, and delivery is fine albeit 45 minute waits for in-town service. Most of the Italian eateries in the area seem to taste the same to me. I'm still looking for one that will blow me away. My favorite dishes here are the Eggplant Rollatini and Veal or Chicken Scallopini Marsala.
