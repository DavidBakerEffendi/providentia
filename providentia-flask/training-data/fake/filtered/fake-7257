My girlfriend spends a lot of time in NYC for her fashion job, and naturally she had heard the buzz surrounding this restaurant and was keen to go. Right from the beginning the service left a sour taste in my mouth. The hostess was surly and dismissive, and the whole front area was crammed with 20+ people waiting for tables. This gross overpopulation filled the rest of the space where tables were spaced so close together that you had to keep your elbows tightly to your side the entire time for fear of bumping into your neighbour. Our waitress was unpleasant and hurried, most likely because she was overworked, so I forgave her for that. Our drinks were late and wrong, our appetizer was late, and our meals were late. I had spent my college years working as a waiter in a fine dining restaurant, so I'm sensitive to how stressful the job can be, and always try to be pleasant. But given the price and the reputation of this place I felt completely let down. The food was mediocre at best, portions extremely small even for fine dining. She forgot several items of ours and our neighbours, one poor woman who had to send her food back twice because of a mistake. I wanted to speak with the manager about the poor food and service but after battling and shoving through the mob of people at the front to get our coats, I lost the will. As a last slight, the boy who brought us our coats rudely told us that normally people give him 5% for his service. It was a terribly disappointing experience and one I hope never to repeat. There are a plethora of incredibly delicious and well priced restaurants in the city, do a little searching and ask around. Avoid this tourist trap at all costs.
