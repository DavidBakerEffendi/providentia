Me and my dinner date walked in without a reservation on a Monday at around 7:30. Place was packed, but they managed to seat us within 10 minutes. Waiter was in place and telling us the specials as soon as we sat down at the (rather small and cramped, my only complaint) table. The wine list was as long as most novels which my waiter was also very happy to help me with. Used my better fiscal judgment and settled on one of their $25 bottles. For the main course I had the Galletto 'al Forno' described on their menu as "Savory Bell & Evans Organic Chicken in "pollo brodo" Â with scallions, asparagus & Jerusalem artichokes." Delicious, and just enough that I wasn't stuffed, yet completely satisfied. I realized that I had forgot my receipt three days later which I needed for an expense report. I called an amazingly they were able to pull it up and email it to me within an hour. Couldn't have been nicer about it too. Will definitely be back next time I'm in NYC.
