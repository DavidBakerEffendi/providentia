Putting this place on the rotation!  What a great idea: Dinner, drinks and a movie at the same location.  I had dinner there last week.  Great burger, perfectly cooked. Delicious fries, and I'm fussy about my FFs. Went just right with my tasty margarita. GF had soup and a salad and said both were great.  Very attentive staff.  The space is cool in  the bar/restaurant and in the lobby. And you can bring your food with you into the movie. Plus, bar is perfect for an after-work drink, even when you don't have time for a movie, just a brew and a snack.
