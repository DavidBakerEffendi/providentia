Came here last week for happy hour. Got 12 bluepoint oysters from RI (?) They were presented nicely with lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish. The oysters were good, but there was a lot of grit on the outside of the shell that didn't always make for a pleasant mouthful. The oysters are a $1 a piece, which is pretty cheap. However, you could easily go to Devon's seafood in rittenhouse, which is $0.75 a piece! (haha, only for those who are real bargain hunters) The place reminds me so much of boston with its down to earth, clean decor. However, the gritty oysters sunk this place down to 3 stars.
