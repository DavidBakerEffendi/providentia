I have been a consistently frequent customer to Andrews Cafe since it's grand opening.  Vasantha (Owner/Master Chef) is the king of improvisation; he makes the best tasting food in town and doesn't even have a kitchen! His menu has a sandwich list that will take you around the world and back! His omelettes are like nothing you have had before (in fact I was just sitting next to a man in his mid-thirties that says the Indian Omelette he just consumed was "The BEST omelette he has EVER eaten".... Just think: 35 years until you've eaten the perfect omelette.  I can go on and on about his delicious soups, his beautifully crafted GINORMOUS salad and more, but I leave it to you to come and taste his creations for yourself!  Oh, I have almost forgotten, he has FREE WI-FI, so bring your laptop/ipad and type away while you digest magic!
