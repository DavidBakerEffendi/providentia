I just moved to this area a few weeks ago.  The kitchen in my house isn't finished so I tend to dine out frequently.  I have been to the Cantina probably 6 or 7 times in the last few weeks and I have to say, I love the ambiance.  It's kind of loud but very fun.  I like that the restaurant as a whole is dark but not too dark.  I like that they play good music usually (sometimes a bit too loud though).  I also enjoy the complementary chips.   One thing I'd have to say is that the food is not really that great.  I feel like I could get better stuff at taco bell, let alone across the street at that wonderful little place called el zarape.  That and the bill is always very high, usually a lot larger than what I would expect to pay.  The place is clearly very popular in the neighborhood, I just think they need to up the quality of their food or lower the prices just a bit.
