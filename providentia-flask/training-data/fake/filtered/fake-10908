Went to Dominic's this past week. Was just ok. Ordered pasta fagioli, NO pasta!!!! They forgot to cook it with pasta!! Inexcusable! The waiter couldn't believe it, just nodded his head in disbelief and apologized. They spilled soda on my wife and no one came to see if she even needed anything. She had to ask for something to clean herself up! To add insult to injury when I went to pay check, they told me they would charge me 4% for using my debit card!!! It was for a family of 4, not for a soda. This is not just bad hospitality but BAD BUSINESS. Never been anywhere that does this!!! When I asked waitress about this she said the owner is getting killed by fees. I explained to her this is the cost of doing business and all pay these fees. People who use credit cards pay their own fees, why should they pay this business' fees too. She agreed that she wouldn't want to pay someone else's fees either. It's not the cash, its minimal, but the point that its not the way to do business. I will never return and I will let all know of my experience at this restaurant and let them decide if they want to patronize this establishment.
