I'm not one to write food reviews, but I decided to make a Yelp account and write one for Lee's Deli. Two of my buds recommended this place for its famous buffalo chicken cheese steaks and carrot cakes, so I decided to taste it out for myself. I heard people pile in during breakfast and lunch hours, so I called in ahead. It was busy as a beehive, which I think is totally understandable. The food was off the hook!! Even if I forgot to call in, my meal would've been well worth the wait, hahaha. Lee's Deli is LEEgendary!!!!!!!!
