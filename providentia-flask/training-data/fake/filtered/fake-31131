Hands down my favorite Greek place in the city! Not only is the food fantastic, but the service is wonderful as well. It's everything you would expect from a family owned restaurant. My finance and I go there often and the staff always recognizes and greets us like we are part of the fam. I have not yet found another Greek restaurant whose food is up to par with Zorbas. THE BEST!
