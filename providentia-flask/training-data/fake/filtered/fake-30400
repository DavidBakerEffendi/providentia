This place is a true gem! Everything here is amazing! They have an unbelievable wine list, including wines that I have never found ANY WHERE ELSE! 'The Bin' as my family refers to it is a quaint little hotspot! There is a cute little bar that you can sit at, or behind that there are tables with barstools; or when you first walk into the restaurant there is a little moroccan nook that you can chill in while noshing on your amazing panini! After you're done with your wine and sandwich, you MUST try their panino! Quite the delicious dessert!
