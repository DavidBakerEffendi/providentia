I was looking for a restaurant to cater a school wide event, I had the best experience with Mama Mary's. From the beginning, they were kind, and we're willing to work with my budget. The foods was amazing, and and easily fed everyone at the event. If you are looking for a place that serves great food, even breakfast, give Mama Mary's a shot. They are great!
