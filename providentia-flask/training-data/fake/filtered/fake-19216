My main dish of fish and rice (special) $12.00.  Plain rice was in a small bowl no more than 6 oz., and some kind of bass fish, when skin removed, had some kind of fish bones, rice was too crunchy like the rice stuck on the pot.  Had to spit out in my napkin because rice was so hard.  Waiter was busy talking to others, had to call for everything.  When asked about the special, he said it is only $12 what do you expect.?  Noticed flies going around.  Also, noticed 19 violations at NY City violations site.  Unfortunately, there is no other thai/chinese restaurant on that blvd.,  Probably, will not go there again.
