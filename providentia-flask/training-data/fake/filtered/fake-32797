We just stayed in Philly for three days, and found the place quite by chance. It turned out to be great! The staff is really friendly and takes care about everything. We were served free tea, and a grapefruit to chew on while waiting for the receipt. The food is cooked so that you can see the process, everything is really fresh. They make the best coconut rice I ever tried! Tofu was delicious, too. I had a marvelous dinner (one dish only, but Â even that was way too big for me) for less than 10 dollars, including the tip and the tax! Great place - if I'm ever back in Philly, I'm sure to go there again!
