I called to place an order and they said that they don't have time for that and hang up on me! Â I called back and told them that they are rude. Now they told me that I was rude for ordering large volume of sandwiches for my students. What is wrong with them?? Seriously...what part of that is really "Friendly"? Anyway I found other place that welcomed my $600.00 worth of sandwich order.
