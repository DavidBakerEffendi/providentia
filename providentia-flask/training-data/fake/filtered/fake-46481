I have been meaning to write my praise for this place for awhile now, but did not have time until now.  My partner and I usually go to New York every year to go shop, watch broadway shows and try the best restaurants that we have heard about.  This ramen place surely deivered on being the best. The broth of the ramen I ordered was amazing.  The texture and taste solidifies the fact that these noodles are handmade fresh. We were going to see Daniel Radcliffe in How to Suceed in business... that night and I was so disappointed that when the waiteress offered a refill on my noodles I had to say no since we were running late. The next time we go to New York this definitely will be a "MUST".
