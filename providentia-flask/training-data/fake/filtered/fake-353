Geno's Steaks, located at 1219 South 9th Street, in Philadelphia, PA is OK; but I still like sweet peppers on my steaks along with the fried onions (and none of that Cheeze Wiz that many of the "younger" generation crave). Â For the green peppers and onions on the steak, I go to Pat's, King of Steaks, across the street.
