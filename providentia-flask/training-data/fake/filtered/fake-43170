This place is an absolute delight. As veterans of many buffet and all you can eat places my family and I have high expectations. The expectations were quickly met and exceeded over the course of the entire meal. The staff is friendly and courteous. The nine of us spent 3 hours dining on food that was fresh and tasty, and at no time did we feel rushed. Water glasses were quickly and frequently filled and food was served efficiently. The staff helped grilled the food which added to the positive experience, as they were efficient, warm and simply pleasant to be around. The meat and veggies, along with their amazing selection of sauces, were high quality and fresh. I would definitely go back again with friend and family. Even at 10PM on a Sunday evening people were streaming in.
