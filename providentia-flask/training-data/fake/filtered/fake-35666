If health took a nosedive into a deep sea of delicious, where it danced with the beauty of culture and re-emerged as a food... that well-endowed Â deliciousness would surely be the food you get served to you in the homely quarters of Uncle Momo's. I was recently there with some friends and family, where I was pleased to find out that everything on the menu is made from scratch, and even more pleased to find out that it is possible to feel fat and sassy WHILE feeling completely and utterly healthy. If I could eat there very day, i would. The food is appropriately priced and woos you with its' flavors. So much so, that after stepping in Uncle Momo's... some regular foods just won't do any Mo'...mo.
