I read the yelp reviews before coming here and I have to say it made me a bit nervous since there were great reviews and not so good ones. However, I decided to try it anyway and that was a great decision! The food, atmosphere, and service were all great! I went there on a Tuesday night and couldn't have been better received. The place wasn't too packed so there was a lot of attentiveness without being annoying about it. Oh and the drinks were on point. Totally recommend this place hands down. No complaints here.
