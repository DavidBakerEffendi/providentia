What a restaurant!  From the hostess stand to the clearing staff, and everyone in between, the service was outstanding.  Everything was delicious.  We had a seven course meal, each course better than the one before.  (How can anyone make a sardine taste good???)  The diners at the table next to us were equally impressed.  The owner was making the rounds to make sure everything was perfect.  I have special dietary needs, and Chef PJ Calapa came to our table at the beginning of our visit to make sure he understood what I needed.  He turned out fantastic dishes that were perfect for my needs. No wonder this is a five-star place.  If you're going to visit, be sure to make advance reservations - it is clearly popular.
