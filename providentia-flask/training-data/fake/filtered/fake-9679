I'm never a person to write a review but it was totally necessary after visiting endo ichi. I've been to several different sushi places in Wethersfield and rocky hill (huge sushi fans) and this place went above and beyond. First of all, the presentation of the sushi was amazing! Second of all, the sushi rolls were large and reasonably priced. They were so fresh and flavorful. Last but not least their staff was so attentive and appreciative. They even presented us with a surprise dessert which was really nice. Their green tea ice cream was soo good and such a nice touch. My boyfriend and I found our new sushi place :) highly recommended!
