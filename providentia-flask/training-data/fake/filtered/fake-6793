This was an amazing experience for my family!  My husband, 3 year old daughter and I decided to try it this week for my birthday.  The waiter was extremely attentive and the food was AMAZING.  There was so much flavor infused in each course.  My picky toddler even loved the experience.  I dont think this place is usually a family spot, but my 3 year old loved the variety and colorful decor.  I would reco making a reservation.  Especially earlier than 7.  People really seem to start streaming in around that time.  I will definitely be back for my next birthday or another special occasion!!  Thank you Marrakesh!
