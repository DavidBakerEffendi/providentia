we went there on a thursday night around 8 pm.....after about a 30 min wait we were greeted by every one as we entered....we ordered the pork char siu buns, croqettes, hirata chicken wings.....and for ramen our server recommended akamaru modern so we obliged n all 4 of us got the same one...we also got extra toppings of pork and egg.......we must say dat it was the best bowl of ramen i have ever tasted.....the dessert was also pretty good...we ordered the lady m crepe....but out of all what made me give 5 stars to ippudo was their service.....our server 'RIo' was very nice and attentive n one my friend thought he was very cute.i definitely recommend this place for its food, ambience and great service!!!
