Went there for my wife's birthday.  The food was OK but they forgot to put in the main dish order for the person who was celebrating her birthday.  She ate her meal after the entire family was finished.  Also, the final bill was inaccurate.  The waiter overcharged based on his own error and did not make it right.   I am not the kind of person who makes big scenes in when things are not right but this guy missed the boat on customer service.  He should have at least made an offer to remove something from the bill for the service related problems or offer a complimentary dessert (or some small jesture).  He was not interested in doing the right and ethical thing.  I still drive in to South Philly for food because I expect good service in a caring environment.  This was very disappointing!  I will not go back and can not recommend this place.
