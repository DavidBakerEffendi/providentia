Peppinos surprised me quite a bit. I wasn't sure what to think of the place when I first walked in but the atmosphere was warm and inviting. I sat down and had a Margarita Pie and it was to die for! Just the correct amount of sauce to cheese ratio, it came to our table piping hot and the sauce wasn't overly sweet which is a pet peeve of mine. I can't wait to go back and try some of the steak sandwiches, I hear they're great!
