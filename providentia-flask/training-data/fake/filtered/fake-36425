I'm a local of New haven and I would have to say this is probably on the lower end of the thai restaurants New Haven has to offer. 1.) There were flies everywhere in the restaurant (gross). 2.) The food is just greasy and loaded with sauce. It felt like it was microwaved right after I ordered it. The only good thing is the service is fairly nice but I would not recommend this restaurant. I would go to Rice Pot on state street instead. This is an honest recommendation and I have no bias towards any thai restaurant.
