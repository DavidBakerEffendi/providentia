My 76 year old father chose this restaurant "Rubirosa".  I was so delighted as he usually chooses dumpling restaurants and really Old school pizza parlors to eat.  I loved that he picked a delicious foody hotspot that I have been eyeing for a while.   My father a native of Greenpoint, Brooklyn;his family owned a sausage shop in Greenpoint and we all were raised on the most heartwarming, nourishing cooking of his mother who lived to be 98 years old. The eggplant parm at Rubirosa put a smile on our faces and reminded us of our "Nona". As well the Bracciole was melt in your mouth deliciousness. This is a place where the Kitchen has soul, spirit and a true respect for Italian cooking. Upon leaving my father warmed by the familial flavors and a genuinely friendly man started talking to the Host about his background.  This man playing host was so uncomfortably nasty and literally said aloud "OH, DADDY HAD A GOOD DINNER?" Unless, you are looking for Italian food with an attitude....I reccommend choosing one of the 982 other Italian restaurants in Downtown NY because as a Native to Soho and someone who believes people over 60 matter...this place is BULLSHIT. Or they could lose the little blonde host who thinks he's Simon Cowell....
