I picked The Boil to celebrate our 8th anniversary and we thought it was simply perfect.  My husband and I enjoyed everything from the decor, service, drinks, to most importantly, the food.  We ordered three appetizers and shared the Dungeness Crab and crawfish combo.  We took home leftovers, which I was looking forward to the next day. We can't wait to go back.  We've already set a date with our close friends and will definitely be back soon!
