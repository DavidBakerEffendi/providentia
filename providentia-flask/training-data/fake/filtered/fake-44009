I have been going to Yamada for 5 years now. This place is fantastic!!!!!' I have been to several other sushi restaurants and still have not found one to top this!!! Charlie, the owner is so friendly and accommodating! I am pregnant and he makes me specific, completely cooked rolls so I can still enjoy!!! BEST sushi restaurant in NJ!!! And the food is soooooo delicious! Great atmosphere, super clean and it's byob!
