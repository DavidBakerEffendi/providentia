I like this place. The value is great - good portion size, friendly service, simple yet inexpensive wine list, and homey cooking. (Even waiting for a table at the bar next door was nice!) Throughout dinner, I kept exclaiming that we had to return. The experience was really fun and warm. Everyone looked like they were having a good time, and we felt so well taken care of. I think that at the end of the night, I would've given it four stars. After sobering up, I realized that the food was actually more mediocre than I wanted to admit during dinner. I say this not b/c it was bad or b/c I don't want to recommend it. I just want to temper your expectations a little. Some of these reviews are so glowing - I think going there w/reasonable expectations about the food will ensure a more positive experience. You go for the entire experience - not just for the food. Our two starters - fried artichokes and the grilled radicchio were disappointing: the artichokes were a little acrid, and the radicchio was bland. My pasta w/crumbled sausage was also so-so (but then again, I should've known better - I'm not a sausage fan). My husband had the seafood pasta, which was really very, very good. I'd go back for that! What made all of these dishes still acceptable though were the prices. My so-so pasta was $9.50. For that amount, I don't mind experimenting and (re)discovering that I don't really like sausage. Bianca is a nice little neighborhood spot. It reminds me of places like Supper. I think the latter has better food though. And for just a few dollars more, I'd go to another neighborhood spot - in the UES - to Vespa for much better tasting food if I were more focused on the food.
