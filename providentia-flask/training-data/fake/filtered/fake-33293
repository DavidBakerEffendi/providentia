A hidden gem.  What an adorable Jamaican cafe.   My family loves this place!  I'm not a very spicy food person, so I ask not to have the sauce put on it and it's perfect!  Everything is cooked there on the premises.  I'm usually not a brown rice fan, but theirs is really delicious. If you get a chance, check it out.  I usually get the jerk chicken, and my family also loves the jerk pork and the brown stew. Yummy.
