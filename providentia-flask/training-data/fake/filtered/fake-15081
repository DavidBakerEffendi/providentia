my visit to risotteria inspired me to join yelp... we had to wait a bit, not a surprise for such a small restaurant. fine The hostess that greeted and sat us was incredibly friendly Our server was a good looking guy, super friendly as well the food was pretty tasty so why the 2 stars you ask? well as we are leaving there are two men SCREAMING at each other right outside the door... so I stop and listen because I am nosey like that... and it seemed to a manager or owner screaming at one of the employees... umm really? right in front of the restaurant. That is tacky.
