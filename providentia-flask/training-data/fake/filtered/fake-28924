Food is great for pub food and not overpriced, which is nice. Fries are delicious and my lamb wrap was fantastic. Sat at the bar on Friday and the bartender was fabulous. I've had some of the friendliest encounters here with bar staff which is what kept me coming back.  My only problem has been the atmosphere the last few months seems to have taken a turn.  I used to come here multiple times a week, but recently the vibes havent been the same.  Could be the change in clientele now that its summer, or a change in management, but I miss the old cask Vibe. Otherwise, a great bar.  I'm a fan.
