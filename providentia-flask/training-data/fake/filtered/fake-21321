I went to Bogota for the first time last night with a friend from out of town for a late night bite.  The food was solid (we split the fish tacos - you go can never go wrong with chipotle mayo)  and the drinks were tasty (chipotle pineapple margarita - apparently we were really into the chipotle), but the highlight of the visit was easily our server Emily.  She was quick with a smile and menu guidance and made us feel at home at every turn. I will definitely be returning for late night snacks and drinks in the future.
