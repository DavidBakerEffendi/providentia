This place is really hit or miss. I've been here a few times, and I must admit that the food is tremendous, but the clientele is...lacking. The moment I sat down at my bar stool, some guy (probably 25-31) taps me on the shoulder. As I turn around, he punches me directly on my nose. Â The whole rail, all guys, just start pounding on each other. One after the other is falling down. There's blood spurting from my nose, and I'm trying to collect as much as I can, using my tremendous lapels. Awful. And slippery. I finally make it to the bathroom, and realize that the gentleman who punched me was wearing this gigantic class ring that read "WHARTON" in all-caps. However, the letters are placed left to right (from the impact), and I realize this as I walk back into the room, and four young men are chanting, "Not! Raw! Not! Raw! Not! Raw!" Well, I have to admit. I'm a bigger guy, but when you have 3 financial professionals swinging chairs at you and benching each other while catching a breath, I just had to get out of there. Far too dangerous for my liking. Like I said, the food is tremendous. Just don't be surprised by the aggressive behavior throughout the entire room. The place is seriously full of little boys in big-boy costumes. Beware, and be safe.
