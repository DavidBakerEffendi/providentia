I went there for the first time today, and I absolutely loved it. For about $21 per person, it was easy to get the most out of your dollar. It took some time to actually give our order, but the paper menus were quite easy and efficient. The food came almost instantly, and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed the miso soup thoroughly, although I felt the servings for some of the appetizers were small. The rolls, on the other hand, were sublime. There's about 6-8 pieces for each roll, and they are made to perfection. I particularly enjoyed the Crunchy Eel roll and would definitely recommend it, along with the Passaic roll. Overall, Sushi Village is definitely my new sushi place.
