Ordered a pork chop with onion today for my lunch. It was good and their pork chop is less fat compared with other place is 60% is fat and only 40% is meat. Their serving is fast even tho they are always busy. But the only thing bad is their is abit priceee $6.5 but I get more meat less fat, still worth it :)
