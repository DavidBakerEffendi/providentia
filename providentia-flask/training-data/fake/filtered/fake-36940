Just got back from Lithos and had to post immediately.  We found this to be a simply stunning restaurant and we had a wonderful experience.  From the moment we walked in until the moment we left, everything was perfect.   We found the food to be very unique, but at the same time authentically Greek.  And not your standard Greek fair authentic too, I'm talking creative and bold while not straying from the root foundations of Greek cuisine.   The decor is very tasteful while there is a warm and lively ambiance.  Considering the fresh selection of fish to choose from, the restaurant is reasonably priced when all is considered.
