Loved this place! Great service! Really nice staff. Hostess was very attentive and nice. We made reservations online phew! * FYI come early or make reservations. The restaurant fills ups fast due to limited seating. Ordered wine, oysters & pork chop! Waitress matched wine perfectly with my oysters apps and pork chop. Overall great experience in the neighborhood. Perfect date spot!
