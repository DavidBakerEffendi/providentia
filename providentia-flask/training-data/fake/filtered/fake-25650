Absolutely wonderful dining experience! The waitstaff were so nice and friendly, but not in a pushy way. They brought out amazing warmed buns made with duck fat and sprinkled with salt that were just too good for words...you could ask for more if you wanted (I think I would've been happy with that and some wine!) and then brought out a complimentary chef's starter, some crazy melon foam on a spoon, strange but interesting...we tried the tenderloin with brussel spouts/bacon and also the lamb - both were so unbelievably good, paired with some great wine, it was a perfect meal...we were so full, but they also gave a complimentary sweet treat at the end which went nicely with our coffee (another place that serves coffee with side of hot milk, ugh, what is that?! I asked for some cold milk so I could actually drink it) They also gave us complimentary cookies as we were on our way out, it was a nice touch...overall, wonderful dining experience, definitely not quiet (could get very loud) so not ideal for an intimate dinner, but still worth it.
