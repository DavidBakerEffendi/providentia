I have eaten there quite a bit recently. The food is very good, large portions, and extremely affordable. The service is top notch and the owners are very friendly. I have enjoyed the steak and cheese with mushrooms and bacon and last night ordered a sausage and bacon calzone that was so large, I have leftovers for lunch. In fact, I dropped it in my driveway when I got home and dusted it off as I did not want to let something so good go to waste. I would highly recommend this establishment to anyone looking for a fun environment, good food, and friendly service.
