Well I eventually got the opportunity to go to grimaldis pizza tonight, being an old family owned restaurant the pizza was great! The service on the other hand was slow and almost as if we didn't exist. The worst thing was that when we ordered our drinks at the start of the night, hot bottles of coke were served with a glass of ice to cool it down. This didn't impress me much because by the time I finished my first glass the ice had melted and I had to ask for more. The atmosphere was good and we did enjoy the meal, but I won't be in any rush to get back or won't be recommending it to any friends.
