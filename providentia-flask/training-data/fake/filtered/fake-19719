i was so amazed at this wonderful restaurant. the food was G-R-E-A-T!!!. the music, setting, service was just excellent especially to be in bed-stuy. i ordered the catfish sandwich & honestly i thought it was going to have a sandwich for 10 bucks. but it came wit fries and coleslaw. the price is very reasonable. i would come here anytime. its a taste of southern in the hood with a touch of class.! also the staff was so friendly and welcoming!!! a con would be small space. long wait time.
