Good food, great prices, great karma. Stopped by this little kabob house yesterday and the people were really nice. The bartender was incredibly friendly and the food was delicious. The owners are from Nepal and have a wonderful disposition as well as plenty of good karma to go around. Try a yogurt shake, the pita chips, or a wrap.
