LOVE this place! This is my favorite restaurant. Everything is great about it. The staff are wonderful and the owner is always there to greet you. The teriyaki chicken wings are amazing and so is the pana cotta. They have a beautiful patio with the old North shore railroad tracks running alongside by the water. I was worried they were destroyed from the hurricane but I was happy to hear they had minimal damage. This place is one of the best on the island. I would highly recommend trying it.
