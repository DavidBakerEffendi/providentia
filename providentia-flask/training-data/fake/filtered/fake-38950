The food was exactly what I ordered.  It was pleasant, but served in excessive quantity, and was swimming in salty gravy.  Not top of my list, and certainly had much better cuisine in the surrounding area.  A quaint little spot nonetheless.  Probably better for brunch than an evening meal.  Unless you want a metric tonne of food.  But then you've probably got other issues.
