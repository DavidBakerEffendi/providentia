I've been wanting to try macarons for about a year now, and living around the Buffalo, NY area, I don't come around any macaron shops. But I was in NYC for a few days and visiting Ladur√©e was on the top of my list. I went around 4, and the line was very short. It's very pretty in there, and everyone is very nice. The guy that helped me was wonderful; charming and French. Is there a better combination? I told him to give me 10 of his favorites, and that's exactly what he did. Every macaron he gave me was phenomenal. Sweet, chewy, but crunchy exterior. Macarons are better than I expected. It's a bit pricy at $2.80 a piece not including any gift boxes you might choose to get. Still, they're worth every penny. Definitely coming again the next time I'm in NYC.
