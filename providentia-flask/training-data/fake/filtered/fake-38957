NOTE: before I even start I want to forewarn you that this restaurant only takes cash. We were not prepared for that and were embarrassed as we scraped up enough bills and change to pay for our meal. We'd heard good things about Tartine and loved the fact that it was BYOB. The hostess was nice enough to recommend two nearby liquor stores and remembered us when we returned despite the line that had formed and seated us immediately. We loved the atmosphere and generally had a great evening. However, the food was disappointing. The evening started out on a high note with one of the special appetizers: goat cheese and prosciutto stuffed figs. Delicious. But 45 MINUTES after we ordered the waitress returned to inform me that they had run out of the entree I ordered. Between the two of us we ended up with a special codfish dish and the steak au poivre, and frankly, neither had any flavor. The steak was a small cut of meat not particularly flavorful nor well seasoned. The codfish and accompanying vegetables had no flavor. We moved on to dessert and after a few bites, decided we weren't impressed with that either. The best things of the night were the appetizer and bread and butter (we both remarked at how outstanding the butter was)! Service was mediocre, food was mediocre, but the atmosphere was so enjoyable (packed on a Tuesday night), that we'd probably go back for an appetizer or try it for brunch.
