Showed up on Friday night in the hopes of getting a quick bite. Unfortunately, my friends and I were not aware of the fact that the kitchen was closing in 10 or 15 minutes. Instead, we were hurriedly forced to order as if it was our fault for not understanding his timeline. WTFF?!? We ordered two dishes and a round of beers. We were essentially ignored the rest of the time and not encourage to order anything else. Mind you we have patronized this place since Sandy and helped it get back on its feet. So much for that...
