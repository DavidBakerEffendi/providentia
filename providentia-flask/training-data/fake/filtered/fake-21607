Hat City is a great neighborhood spot and a good alternative to the Manhattan experience. I never feel pressured to order a huge meal and the service is warm, friendly and intelligent. The po-boy sliders with chipotle mayo are my favorite, I also recommend the fried chicken. Wish this place was better known- they have a great mission.
