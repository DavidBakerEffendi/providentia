I went to philly a few months ago, and I made sure to check both Pat's and Geno's. Overall, there was very little difference in the two restaurants. The meat, the bread, the cheese. You could easily get a similar or better heesesteak somewhere else. The history of the restaurant doesn't make it any better than a regular cheesesteak.
