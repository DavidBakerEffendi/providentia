We were pleasantly surprised by how good the food was, we don't know Ukrainian cuisine at all. Actually, we happened to be the very first customers on opening day. Looking for a lace to eat on a saturday evening, we noticed this place with balloons outside, celebrating its grand opening. The staff was very nice and the food very delicious. After, they told us that since we were their first costumers, we eat for free. They also served us a great desert on the house. Wonderful! We are definitively going back. Raphael di Lauro
