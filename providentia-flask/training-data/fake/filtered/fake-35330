We were in the neighborhood and saw a line for this place so we thought we'd give it a try. The line was for ordering the food and it was very slow moving. Still, we were thinking that the food must really be good. Maybe our expectations were too high because the food was okay but nothing special. We had the ribs and the pulled pork and baked beans and sweet potato casserole. It was okay, about the level of Texas BBQ. I think the line was because it is a pretty cheap place to eat. The total for all that food, plus 2 iced teas. was $27. And there's no service so there's no tip. It was uncomfortably noisy in the place, too. Sitting at a table, we had to raise our voices to be heard.
