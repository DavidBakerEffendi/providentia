Love Sam! For frequent fans of this place know who I am talking about. From the looks of the place on the outside its nothing to brag about and it is small inside BUT the food is tasty. You are served hot tea and delicious homemade crispy noodles with hot mustard and duck sauce for dipping. They have two separate menus, a regular menu and a menu for vegetarians. Love their vegetarian wonton soup and crispy shrimp entree. Yum!
