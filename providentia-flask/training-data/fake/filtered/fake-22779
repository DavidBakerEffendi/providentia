I am split on Trumbull Kitchen, hence the 3 star rating. I have been to TK a number of times for different occasions, from a pre-drink before going clubbing at 960, after a late night for drinks, to just hanging with friends and to grab  dinner. Let me first say that I like the atmosphere, it's a nice swanky place that overall has a nice vibe to it.  Each time we have gone we have been seated at different areas, once at the normal tables, another time we grabbed lounge sofas up front (which were great to sit and chat by), and another time at a long table that was shared by probably 12 strangers. It was a bit odd and made making a trip to the rest rooms a bit of a challenge having to play leapfrog to get out. The food is overall very good and if you judge this place solely on food then I most likely would have given it 4-5 stars. Even their drinks for the most part are very good, they are typically strong and my girlfriend loves the apple martini. The food alone, however, is not everything in a restaurant. Now to where the problems lie for me. It is the service.  I have never received good service at TK no matter the occasion or time. Every person whether they are the door staff or waiters has been rude and seemingly pretentious.  The last three times we came we stood by the front obviously waiting to be seated or to have someone acknowledge our existence.  Two times ago 3 people walked right by us and the girl at the front desk ignored us, chatting with friends before I had to step in. Another time we were sent to a table even though we made it clear we were only getting drinks.  When the server realized we were  only having drinks (which weren't cheap by the way, they probably totaled a meal by themselves) he was so rude with his remarks, attitude, rolling eyes, and even throwing a napkin to the point where I should have called the manager over in hind-sight. Too bad as the place has nice bones but is shrouded in a pretentious facade.
