I was so excited to come to this place, after seeing the other Yelp reviews when I was around this neighborhood.  So my friend and I stopped by for dinner around 9pm on Saturday night.  When we stepped in we were asked whether we made any reservation.  Being an impulsive decision maker, I didn't think we needed a reservation (especially seeing there are still 4 tables vacant).  As soon as I said 'No' the waiter basically chuckled and shooed us away.  It was so impolite and rude, he could have simply tell us that you need to make a reservation for the weekend.  The attitude was definitely unnecessary.  No matter how good the food is, with this kind of service, I don't think I'll step foot in here again!
