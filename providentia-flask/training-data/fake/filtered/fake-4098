Went here last evening for Happy Hour. The bartender was very nice and friendly, but a bit "absent" when we wanted to order. No big deal. Weird "bar bites" Â menu with strange pricing, but I went ahead and ordered the "chicken planks", not really knowing what to expect, what but the heck...I like chicken. What I got was 4 frozen Banquet-esque chicken tenders. No joke....these looked like they were straight out of a warming tray at my high school cafeteria. Now, this app was only $7something, so that's not my gripe. My gripe is that I'm adult and I'm ordering Happy Hour food at a bar and being served something that I would expect to get at Friendly's (but at least there I would have gotten a damn Happy Ending!). So maybe it's unfair that I'm judging this entire place on that one item. But really?
