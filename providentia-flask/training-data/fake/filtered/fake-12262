I don't usually write reviews on here, but I want this place to stay -- so, here it goes: We were craving oysters a two weeks ago and stumbled upon this restaurant, and so glad we did.   We've already been back twice with consistently good food every time.  The cocktails are delicious and generous and the food... oh the food!  We've already tried a fair amount of dishes ranging from the Amish free range 1/2 chicken (amazing) to the whole wheat tagliatelle with clams (their pasta is homemade!) to onion soup, salmon, margherita pizza (thing crust!), salads, etc. etc.  Each thing more delicious than the last. Finally we have a nice restaurant in the area that has great food and caters to individual tastes. There's something on the menu for everyone:  steak-a-holics, seafood fans, guten free people, and vegetarians (black bean tofu "steak"!). I can't wait to go hang out and eat in the bar area and pig out on wings, truffle fries, the chicken marsala pizza, and pot roast nachos. Yes, it's true. We'll be back for sure.  Many times.   Go to Tierney's Copperhouse and spend your money. I want this place to stay for the long haul.  It's delicious and beats all the chain restaurants in this area.
