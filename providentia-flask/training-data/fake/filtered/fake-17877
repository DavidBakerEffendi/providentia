I tried this new place and just loved it.  I went back a few more times with friends and family and they all thanked me for introducing them to this friendly atmosphere and appetizing food.  The last time we were there, we enjoyed the Chicken Tawook, Chicken Shawerma with Tabouleh Salad and Baba Ghanouj served with hot pita as sides (don't forget their Falafel, too!).  I ordered their Baklava sampler for dessert and when the owner overheard that one of my guests had nut allergies, he approached our table and advised my guest not to worry and assured that he would take care of her.  He came back with a slice of cheesecake and a flourless chocolate cake "on the house" (guaranteed NO NUTS) which left a great impression on us.  Their staff is friendly and the owner is very accommodating.  I give this place a 2 thumbs up!
