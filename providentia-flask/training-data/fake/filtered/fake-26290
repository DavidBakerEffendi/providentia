This Thai place is truly a treat for Thai food lovers. We've tried all the places in New Haven, but this is our new favorite. The place is immaculate, and the food is amazing. We had Pad Thai, Red Curry with chicken, papaya salad, and crispy rice appetizers. The rice crackers with the sauce was delicious-- crispy with a flavorful sauce. The pad thai was delicious, and served on a large dish to make a dramatic presentation. We also tried the coconut juice which came with coconut meat--perfect and fresh. Our server was actually the chef's husband, so he was naturally very knowledgable about the menu and was able to make good suggestions for us. He was also extremely attentive and friendly. Â The decor is clean, modern, bright, and simple. Although I live in New York, my favorite Thai place is now The Terrace!
