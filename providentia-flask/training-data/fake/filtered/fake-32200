I am a returning customer at Aloha Japan. I go there every weekend and the food has always been good. I love trying out new things like The Kani Salad. Choosing any thing from the special roll menu is always a great choice. Not only is the sushi side of the restaurant is good but its less celebrated companion the hibachi and teriyaki dinners are great as well. Although the server may not be great at speaking English, she always shows great care and concern for me and makes sure my dining experience is the best it can be. I personally am a fan of Aloha Japan because it sure bets any sushi you get from the supermarket! Aloha Japan taught me that there's more to Japanese food than a tuna maki roll and miso soup.
