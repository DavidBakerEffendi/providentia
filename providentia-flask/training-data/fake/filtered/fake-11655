$1 a slice is awesome! Met a group of friends there for my first visit and was very happy with the quality and service. If the food isn't enough for you to be a fan, their focus in helping the community is fantastic. You can't help but be overwhelmed by the support that Rosa and its customers have to help those in Philly. For nothing else, you should stop in and see what the staff is doing for Philly!
