The service was great! The bartender was friendly, quick, focused. I tried the nachos, and the first thing that stood out was how the nachos were presented neatly, as in the topping wasn't drenching the nachos. A very strong combination of sweet and spicy. It was great to stumble into a location that had more than above average customer service. I was very pleased with the overall drinking/dining experience. The menu is also locally, seasonally sourced, which was nice, if a bit limiting.
