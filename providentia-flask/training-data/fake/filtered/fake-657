Went here with a group of friends a few weeks ago for appetizers and drinks. We were only going to stay a little while but decided since we were having such a good time playing Shuffle Board we would stay, then a band went on and we stayed a while longer. We were told they Never charge a cover!!  Great list of Craft Beers, especially for the Fall and the wings and potato skins were really good.  Hoping to head back soon.  :)
