I went to this restaurant before going to a bachelorette party at Hunk-O-Mania at club Element and I can say that Yerba Buena is now one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in the city. The food is EXCELLENT. I would recommend ordering several of the appetizers vs. an entree so that you get a taste of everything they have to offer. For 2 people we usually order 6 appetizers as they are small portions. The drinks are dangerously delicious and the atmosphere is fun and lively. The service is ALWAYS excellent and accomodating. Enjoy!
