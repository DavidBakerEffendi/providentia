What a disappointment. We used to frequent this restaurant years ago and thought we would go back. Bad move. Saturday night at 7pm and there were no other customers in the place. We sat and were immediately bombarded by a chatty hostess that was peddling everything from sushi to Thai to Chinese. My sinuses immediately started shutting down ( my guess is mold in the room ). The decor hadn't changed since we were there last about 4 or 5 years ago. Tables were peeling, pictures fading. The sushi was poorly and sloppily prepared and our main dishes was mediocre at best. The sushi guy was popping aspirin or something behind the sushi bar which was disturbing Â but the wait staff was friendly and attentive which is the only reason they get any stars from me. I think it's time for them to pack it in. Their time has passed and by the amount of patrons they had (us two people) everyone knows it except them.
