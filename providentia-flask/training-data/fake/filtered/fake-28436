I used to go here often.  My friend and I would always go for mussels and  1/2 price bottles of wine on Tuesdays.  The place was pleasant and the food was decent.  All was well until they stole both of our credit card numbers.  Not sure if this is an ongoing problem in this restaurant, but problem enough for me to never go there ever again.   I know it was them because... I just so happened to tell my friend that I was waiting for a new credit card because my # was stolen and how it was used to make a large purchase at Toys R' Us in Ohio...she was like "mine too" (I was like...huh..how could it be?)  and then she told me how she knew it was Petite Abeille and now it was totally confirmed since my card # was stolen too.  Apparently she only used this credit card this one time and it was to split the bill with me at Petite Abeille.   So both of our cc numbers got stolen that night... So for all of you that enjoy this restaurant and want to keep going, I recommend that you pay with cash to avoid getting your cc # stolen.   We dined there in the end of August 2011, and in October 2011 was when I got the call from the credit card fraud dept...so the fraudulent transaction took some time to happen from when they initially took our information....
