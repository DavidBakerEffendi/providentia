I totally agree with S.H. the owner is a total Jerk, I found a Â hair in my fried rice i complained to him and he said maybe it was mine, even though the hair was about 12 inches longer than mine, the food is ok but overpriced, i will never go there again and that because of the owner, he treat his customers like they are idiots
