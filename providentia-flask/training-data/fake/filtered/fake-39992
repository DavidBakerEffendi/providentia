Great food for basic and creative Mexican cuisine.   I have been to Mx 20 plus times, have worked in DF and spend several months a year in Puerto Vallarta.   This is as good as any food I have had anywhere in Mexico.    The salsa was excellent, chicken quesadilla was great and soft tacos Guadalajarra were perfect.   I can't wait to go back.   Simply nothing more you can ask for.
