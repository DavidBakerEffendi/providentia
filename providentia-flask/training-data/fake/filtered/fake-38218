Wow Greek Lady! Now this is what fast food should be about- fast, inexpensive, delicious and fresh. My mouth is watering just thinking about the gyro and salad i had the other day. Cant wait to come to the dental school so I can dig into another one. Had many gyros here and there.... yours is one of the freshest and most delicious I've had. Only problem..... too busy at lunch time! Next time I'm coming at a latter time. The good thing about all the traffic you get: your gyro is fresh, fresh fresh! Not many can claim that because their gyro meat does not come from the spit.. it comes in frozen slices and gets thrown on the grill-that's not authentic. Gyro means: round and round- as to what happens with the meat on the spit. Very nice Greek Lady! Fresh and juicy gyro with phenomenal jatsiki sauce on a very soft and fluffy pita bread. Greek salad was like it should be- fresh produce and a good quality piece of feta cheese. Loved it! Coming back.
