A must stop if ur ever in the area.  The food is great.  Shrimp oreganato is out of this world.  Hot peppers, shrimp beeps, chicken savoy and the chicken giambotta.  Home cooking in this Newark landmark.  Get there early because this place is packed everyday it is open. And don't let the waitresses scare u they really are not that mean.
