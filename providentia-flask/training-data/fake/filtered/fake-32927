My second visit. Affirmed my prior experience. Food was excellent. Wine was great too. This is now my 'go to' small party place - I doubt I will ever be disappointed. The menu is innovative without being flashy with evident attention to overall menu as well as individual tastes / textures / smells (the best cheese in town). The menu coupled with a knowledgeable serving staff (without being overbearing) leaves me impressed and certain to return. Soon.
