First of all, I came to this place all the time in college, maybe it was only good looking back because I was drunk I was in town visiting, and we came for steaks after the Eagles game, WOW, I would rather go to a Dallas home game and lick a rock. Worst steak I've ever had plus the entire staff are assholes. You can't even get a simple order right. Please go somewhere else, this place is not what it use to be, and they don't care they will tell you they are assholes, just a tourist trap
