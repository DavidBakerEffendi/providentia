Tina's is Cuban comfort food through and through with very generous portions at an affordable price. If you're a fan of rice and beans and no fuss then you'll probably be a fan of this quaint little place. First off, its location right at the heart of Midtown Manhattan makes it a prime spot to grab a quick, filling, and cheap lunch if you find yourself noticeably avoiding the usual expensive spots in that area. It's my go-to spot after pick-up basketball sessions. They have a small section in the back with tables and waiter service if you want to eat in (they automatically add 18% gratuity if you eat in), but the type of food they serve is made for take out/delivery.  Either way, the service is quick and easy. Tina's offers sandwiches and even smaller options such as empanadas, but I normally stick with the platters which come with 2 sides.  Some choice favorites from my usual crew of friends are: - the baked chicken - the beef stew with potatoes - the fried fish The meat can be slightly dry at times, but they have this green sauce that helps with that and gives the meal a little kick in the process.  Some of the choices for sides include Spanish potato salad, rice and beans, and fried/sweet plantains which are all great choices.  I usually stick with the standard yellow rice and beans which really hits the spot especially after a workout session.
