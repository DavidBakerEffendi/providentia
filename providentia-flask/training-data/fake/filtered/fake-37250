First and foremost, I am a born-and-raised Peruvian, so I am very familiar with our cuisine. Â This past Saturday, my family and I went to this restaurant to celebrate my mother's birthday. The interior was pleasant and inviting, which is typical of a Montclair restaurant. I could tell the restaurant caters to the somewhat upscale and trendy crowd, which is fine. This is where the compliment ends. For appetizer, my wife and I had papa a la huancaina- potatoes with cheese sauce. The sauce was bland and the potatoes were tiny. I guess they're were trying to be fancy. I then ordered a lomo saltado, which is pretty much a simple Peruvian dish consisting of fries, onions, tomatoes, and beef strips- a tasty Peruvian dish! Rice was a side order- never heard of that before!!! But that was ok. The dish was salty. My wife ordered a Churrasco a lo Pobre- grilled ribeye, tacu-tacu (mixed rice and beans), sweet plantains, and a fried egg. My wife ordered the ribeye median rare but it came mostly rare. For dessert, we shared a crema volteada (Peruvian flan), which is one of the most delicious Peruvian desserts. It was too creamy, too hard. It was either prepared a day or 2 before or it had too many eggs. Price was on the high side, but that's what you get in Montclair. I would've rather gone to more a tradicional and authentic Peruvian cuisine restaurant, but that's where my mother wanted to go, which is fine. I, personally, would never return because the food was lacking in taste and it was expensive to boot.
