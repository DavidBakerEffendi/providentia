As a personal trainer and health coach I often ask my clients to try eating just one mindful meal per day. This means simply eating your food without distraction. No phone, no email, no work chat, no television...it's actually pretty hard to do! Hu Kitchen is where I come when I need a mindful meal. I come by myself, eat upstairs, put my phone away, and enjoy my food. It's easy to enjoy a mindful meal here because you know that the food is actually food (that tastes delicious), the atmosphere is relaxed and conducive to healthy consumption, and the staff is incredibly friendly and passionate about the mission of the place. My top meals: Rotisserie chicken (w/ whole gloves of garlic yummmm) Sweet potatoes Fresh steamed greens Chicken quinoa soup (perfect for cold winter days) Gluten-free toast/bread Mash bar - everything but esp the chia pudding Macaroons Coffee!
