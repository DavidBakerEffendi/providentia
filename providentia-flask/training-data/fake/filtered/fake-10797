This is just the place that Point Breeze needs!  The interior design was creative.  I loved that there were no televisions there and the fact that there is a second floor really allowed for the downstairs bar to not have that over crowded feeling to it.  The lighting could have been a tad higher but other then that the service was good and the energy was really fun.
