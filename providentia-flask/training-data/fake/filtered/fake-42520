ok the orginal pop's on oregon ave is the one i know of but past years the quality has diminished at both itlaiano's locations! The full flavor isnt there anymore it's now rated a 6 on scale of 1 to 10 in my opinion by trying other water ice stands nearby ! I mean full flavor chocolate with bits of chocolotae in it or pineappel or lemon or orange is what i'm talking about here! YOU all know the two locations i'm talking about almost a mile away is Jim's going east then north to wolf st ! The other is named john';s somewhere around 9th and federal or christian st's or is it on front st ? Anyway try the other two compare to italiano's now watered water ice !
