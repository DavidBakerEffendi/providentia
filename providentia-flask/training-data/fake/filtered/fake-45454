Had dinner at Terre a Terre and the food was awesome!  The artichoke and oregano soup was the best soup I ever had!  So flavorful and creamy with a hint of cheese ... to sum it up HEAVEN!!  My entrée was very good (lamb chops) and the butternut squash that came with it was absolutely delish.  I would highly recommend this restaurant and believe it's definitely one of the Best in Bergen County and am so happy it opened last year.
