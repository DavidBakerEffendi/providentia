Honestly, if it wasn't for the crappy service, I would give this place 4 1/2 stars. The food is executed beautifully but the service is subpar. It took our waiter 10 minutes to greet us once we were seated and he had a snobby attitude, which made our dining experience mediocre. When asked his opinion on dishes he would tell us what "people rave about online"--I didn't ask for what Yelpers' reviews were--I asked for the waiter's opinion. I would give this place one more chance because the food was very good. We ordered the mushroom salad, branzino, and the pasta special--all of which were fantastic.
