We are new to Astoria and we discovered all the great restaurants on 30th ave,one of the best is the Butcher Bar. The decoration very nice and modern and the food exceptional! I order the brisket sandwich it was so good and juicy! my husband ordered the ribs with mashed potatoes everything was tasty and well done! We definitetly coming back and we highly recommend this place!
