My girlfriend and I came here with a few of my family members for a Saturday night dinner.  My brother and his girlfriend (who were also in attendance) recommended the place since they had dined here before.  The restaurant was very nice but after waiting a few minutes to be seated, they place us in the way back of the restaurant, in what seemed to be an unfinished area of the restaurant.  At that point, I was a little skeptical but we ordered a few drinks and decided to make the most of it. We started with some apps, including the spicy calamari and the cheesey garlic bread, which were both abolutely delicious.  Our meals which included a chicken parm dish, tortellini dish and a couple of steak dishes were also extremely tasty and we all very much enjoyed our meals.  Not only was the food good, but the experience was excellent as well. To top it off, the Owner (from what I could gather) was super friendly and checked up on us a couple times to see how we were enjoying our meals.  As we left, he thanked us and we walked to the parking garage to get our car.  Side note, they validate parking in the parking garage right next to the restaurant.  So we grab our car and we're pulling out of the garage when we see the Owner sprinting out of the restaurant towards our car.  My first thought was that we left something behind, but that wasn't the case.  The Owner had run out to meet us and send us home with 2 loaves of pre-made cheesy garlic bread, which we all later enjoyed the next day.  Talk about excellent customer service.  I've never experienced an Owner so friendly and willing to go out of his way like that.  Next time I'm in the hartord area, I will DEFINITELY BE BACK for another awesome experience.
