I've heard good things about this place so was looking forward to trying it with my family on Saturday night for a small birthday celebration.  We checked in about 10 minutes early and got a slight attitude from the hostess because our whole party wasn't there yet.  We waited in the incredibly small & cramped front part of the restaurant by the door - which was freezing cold, by the way.  We were seated promptly when our whole party was there but to our disappointment, it was at a very awkward long table, right under a very loud speaker and a large AC vent.  We were so spread out that we could barely have a conversation together over the music.  The vent blew cold air all night - we wore our scarves - and asked for the air to be turned off - but it wasn't.  The food was decent - go for the vodka pizza - and the service was ok until the end of the meal when our waiter literally disappeared for 30 minutes.  We finally had to get up and ask for our bill and when it arrived (by being thrown on the the table by someone who was not our server), there was already a 20% gratuity included because we were a party of 6.  Not only was the service sub-par and not deserving of a full 20%, but they included the alcohol and tax when calculating the 20%.  We were so cold and annoyed by that point - and our waiter was still no where to be found - that we just paid the bill and left.  When we walked out the front, there was our waiter - folding napkins!  He never came back to check on us, figuring the 20% tip was locked in at that point.   Although the food was good, the overall experience was so disappointing and uncomfortable, that I will think very hard about going back and giving them my business.
