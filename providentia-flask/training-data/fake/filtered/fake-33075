obsessed with the STRAWBERRY CHEESECAKE BAGEL !!!  toasted with cream cheese please !! large tea with milk is my typical breakfast, and i usually get a chocolate peanut butter or cranberry pineapple muffin. they guy that works there sometimes hooks it up with cookies, hey ill take it... the egg and chicken salad are delicious also that's my lunch, i also love it how the staff remembers you when you're a regular !! THE only thing i do want to say is i wish it  had a bigger sitting area more space.
