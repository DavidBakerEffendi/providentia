Just moved into the Fairmount area and my BF and I wanted to a place to go for brunch besides Sabrina's. Was excited to check out this new place. Pleasant and quaint atmosphere, seated quickly and it is a BYOB! Food was plentiful and delicious. We had the Breakfast Burrito and Chilaquiles. Extremely yummy! And fairly inexpensive. I hope Blue Cat succeeds and stays in Fairmount. Will definitely be back!
