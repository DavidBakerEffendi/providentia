I went here with my parents earlier today.  As soon as we got in, the host who was an older gentleman (notice how freely I use the word gentleman) took us to our seats.  As I was about to sit down I thanked him to which he didn't reply and then bumped into me as if he couldn't walk around me, or as if he wasn't the host.  The only nice person was our waitress who brought my mother a soggy crab cake, my father an unseasoned chicken kabob, and me the chicken parm with creamed spinach and cauliflour as the sides.  My chicken parm was disgusting, a piece of fried chicken breast with Campbell's Tomato Soup poured on top.  The creamed spinach was cold and my parents were quite dissatisfied with their orders as well.  The waitress kept asking us how the food was (like I said, she was the only friendly one) so we kept saying it was OK.  When we went to the front to pay, the female cashier was quite rude.  My father (way too polite) said thank you and bye to her three times, to which she never responded.  My verdict: disgusting food, disgusting staff, and poor service = us NEVER returning.  Do yourself a favor; don't take yourself there, unless you're in the mood to be treated like crap by the staff and brought subpar food that you wouldn't even want your dog to eat.
