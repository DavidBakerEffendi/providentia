Just went out for a birthday dinner. After getting seated waited 15 minutes for a server. We ordered immediately but didn't get our drinks for another 10 minutes. 15 minutes after that we got our appetizers. They were oysters it wasn't like they had to be cooked. Dinner arrived approximately 25 minutes later with our salads. One of the entree's needed to be sent back along with two sides that were extremely cold. After speaking to the manager I was told they were extremely sorry but still ended up paying my entire $240.00 bill for 3 people. I eat out about 3 times a week and for the price this is probably one of the worst experiances I've had in quit a while.
