Most horrible bar service I have ever encountered !!! They ought to teach their staff that they're in the HOSPITALITY BUSINESS This bartender was so rude, inattentive.... never once broke a smile.... her professional appearance could also use some discussion but will focus on the service tonight, she looked miserable and acted miserable too that was until her friends showed up and THEN we saw her smile, she was clearly devoting her attention to them ONLY we had empty glasses for about 10 minutes and even after that I had to actually interrupt her chat with her friends to get a second round of drinks. When we arrived I told her I was celebrating my friend's birthday and wanted something cool and different to try- she had nothing to say, we ordered beer bc she couldnt come up with any possible highlight on the menu. Late Fridays are a NO NO NO NO NO
