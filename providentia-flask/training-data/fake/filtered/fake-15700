Been there twice (just to see if my findings the first time was accurate) and I can honestly say it is not as good a pizza as the hype surrounding it leads it to be. Overall Soggy/Doughy consistency, really burnt crust, tasteless pie (meatball/pepperoni/spinach combo). Its obvious, the one who prepared the pizza does not do it with heart and that he should not even be making pizzas. The waiters can be true snobs as they have so much pride in their pizzas. One of them saw me not eating the disgusting/burnt/indigestible crust and said he was disappointed for me not eating something so "special" while kissing his clasped fingers. Whereas he should be paid to kiss my ass instead if he wants the tip. The snob tries to cover it up by quickly getting olive oil, tabasco and vinegar. Unfortunately it's really hard Â to fix food that is already dead. Perhaps the only thing that tasted right was the Snapple Iced Tea to remedy the pizza's blandness and then Ginger Ale to remedy my stomach after eating burnt crust with oil, vinegar and tabasco.
