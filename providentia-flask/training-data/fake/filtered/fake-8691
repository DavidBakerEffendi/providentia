This was my 10th visit. The food was an is good for the price. However, my visit on Saturday, 7 January left me with unfilled expectations. The service was mediocre at best. The $4 cappuccino at the end of the meal had no coffee taste. It seems they used the same coffee grounds to make too many cups. The waiter dropped off the coffee and the check about the same time and that was the last of him. I caught up with him as I was leaving the restaurant and he was unconcerned. It was almost 10 the place was packed and people were still waiting outside. What reason do they have to be concerned about poor service? Kind of like the Eagles, good team, high expectations, poor performance. Â People still buying tickets. Bottom line for this restaurant is like the Eagles. Not a complete package but on any given day they just might click and deliver a winner. Good food and bad service but better luck next time.
