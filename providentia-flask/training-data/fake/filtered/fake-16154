As our cab rolled up to cafeteria, I was a bit turned off by the incredibly long line.  My friends and I, visiting from NJ, had heard that it was a must 24 hour place after a night of drinking, but we were unaware that  we'd have to wait online for almost an hour for a drunk snack. We made our way to the end of the line, but only to have two doormen escort us in almost immediately, which made us VERY happy. Unfortunately it made a few people quite upset since they had been waiting much longer & would probably wait all night from the look of things.  We were sat in a cozy booth, which certainly came in handy for my intoxicated sister who was able to pass out comfortably.  We ordered the mac & cheese spring rolls, which were to die for.  I'm not going to lie..I wish we would have ordered two.  I also ordered a turkey burger with avocado that was unfortunately overcooked, chewy & without flavor.  I wasnt too happy with that, but the fries were pretty tasty.  The place was packed with lots of beautiful people, some of which decided to invite themselves to take a seat at our table to chat throughout our meal & there were a couple of "celebrities" eating a few tables down from ours.  It was a great place to people watch & socialize, but the food & the service weren't impressive.  Our waiter was a bit of a drama queen and a little bitchy, who forgot a few things we requested & the service was slow.  Our table was just about on top of the one next to ours, so throughout our meal I bumped elbows with a man sitting beside me. He was very attractive & turned out to be really sweet, so it worked out okay, but it was still a little uncomfortable. Overall, it was an interesting experience.  Would I go again? Sure, why not, but not for the food.
