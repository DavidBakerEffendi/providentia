Have gone here twice now for drinks and apps and for dinner. Grilled octopus is the best in Astoria. Great beer selection and great bread. Amazing service and atmosphere. The dumplings are delicious, the lemon chicken is a little oily and heavy with not many potatoes. But that is my only complaint!
