We started with cocktails - Aperol Spritzers, and they were perfectly made.   Our appetizers: The fritto misto, a dish of rhubarb, spinach, and asparagus lightly battered and fried, served with aioli -  light, crispy, and delicious!  We really loved the crostini - fresh, creamy ricotta with roasted strawberries and fresh thyme - so incredible.  The salumi were good as well.   Entrees:  The brick chicken was very good, if a bit over-seasoned.  The Cod was light and very well seasoned, served in a broth with spring vegetables (asparagus, carrot, and fennel).  I'm not a fan of broth on a hot day and would prefer a pan-seared fish but I enjoyed the dish nonetheless. We all went crazy for the chocolate-caramel-sea salt tart - oh boy, was that good!!!!
