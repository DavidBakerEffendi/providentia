We went here for brunch, and it was really a lovely experience. Our server was very nice and helpful, and the food was great. Squid ink was amazing and the steak.... we debated whether it was sous vide or not and the winner was me. It was cooked so well - pink color throughout made you think it was sous vide BUT it wasn't! For dessert, we had the pistachio cake (not as moist for my taste) but the plum sorbet was divine. I'm so glad I gave Locanda Verde another try, and I will definitely be coming back for another brunch!
