Nice friendly place to hang out with the family and friends. Solid, tasty basics, like omelettes, salads, burgers, hanger steak. Standouts for me are the red flannel hash and bloody mary. Can you tell I go there on Sunday mornings alot? It's hit or miss with the more adventurous dinner specials though. But the vibe is always cool, as in welcoming.
