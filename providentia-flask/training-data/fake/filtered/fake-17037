Birthday Reservations for my girlfriend.... Restaurant rubbed me the wrong way from the start. We made reservations for June 6th @ 9. We arrived a little early around 8:50 so we expected a wait but not the wait we received. We were seated around 9:15-9:20. You would think the place was packed out - Not at all - about half full! After being a little annoyed about the wait and the staff completely disregarding the notes on my reservation to be sat by the window - we tried to let it go. Upon sitting I noticed a dirty place setting followed by a 15 minute wait for water. Our appetizer empanadas came put relatively fast tho. They were pretty tasty. We placed entr√©e order at about 9:30 or so - entrees didn't get to our table 10:42... to me that is UNBELIEVABLE!!!!! I ordered the skirt steak which would have been good if it was hot!!!! My girlfriend had a stuffed chicken dish which she enjoyed.... one highlight they remembered to bring the birthday dessert (flan) but by that point we were Both fed up
