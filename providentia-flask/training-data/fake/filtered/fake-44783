As an indigenous New Yorker now living in Connecticut for 9 months of the year, I was pleasantly surprised. For Connecticut pizza, it's actually pretty good. In my experience with the local area, this is the one place from which it's actually safe to consume pizza. It's not terribly expensive either, which is why I've given it four stars-- it's pretty good considering that it isn't NY pizza (usually the pizza gets progressively worse the farther you get from Brooklyn), and considering how reasonably priced it is. Also, the grinders are really good-- I highly recommend the Philly Cheese Steak Grinder. I've only ever had it delivered (I've never been to the place in person), and usually the delivery is reasonably timed depending on when you order. The people on the phone, in addition to the drivers, are really difficult to understand due to the presence of really heavy accents. In short, pretty good. Sisson Ave is my favorite pizza place in the area, and I've tried a few.
