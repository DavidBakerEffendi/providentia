When McLadden's opened almost 5 years ago, I loved it. Big fan. Food was good, service was great, atmosphere fun. However, it's been on a slow decline and almost at the bottom. My husband is a Founders member. We come for the $3 craft beers because of this "elite" club. And let me say, we get about $3 worth of service. Take this afternoon for instance. A simple order of a burger was completely messed up. We watched 3 parties hunt down someone to take their money so they could pay their bill to leave. 2 parties waited a good 10 minutes to be seated (it's middle of the afternoon on a Sunday and not crowded) because the hostess wasn't at the front of the house. We listened to a 20 minute conversation the manager/key holder was having with a customer. The one urinal in the men's room, according to my husband, is cracked and ready to fall apart. The quality of the beer will always be the same because McLaddens doesn't make it. As I write this review (first time I've ever felt compelled to do so for any restaurant) we've been waiting 15 minutes to pay our tab. The food, along with service-from the top of the chain to the bottom is horrible. The turnover rate of employees is high. Even management. That tells us what I originally stated to say: decline, decline, decline. Time to shred the Founders members card and find a new pub for the occasional Sunday afternoon hang out. It's just too bad...
