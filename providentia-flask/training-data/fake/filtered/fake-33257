Have eaten here a dozen times over the last couple of years. It's a place with a great personality, and it hasn't lost that. This is the first time I've felt motivated to post, though: tonight I had pappardelle that were the best I've eaten in many years. Sauced with shredded pork (belly?), and awfully rich, but the pasta was ethereal. Like the owner and the staff, even if sometimes they are random. In warm weather, the tiny back patio is a haven.
