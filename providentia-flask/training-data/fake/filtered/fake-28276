So for the price we paid, I didn't think this was THAT great.  This is not a cheap place, although the staff is super friendly and helpful and attentive.  We waited for an hour for a table for 6, the place was packed.  They were out of pork chops and mussels, both which we came specifically for!  The pork kebabs were suggested in place of the pork chops and they were OK.  The grilled calamari was recommended and it was overcooked and chewy.  The free dessert was nice and just being able to talk as a group, however it gets so loud in there we had to shout!
