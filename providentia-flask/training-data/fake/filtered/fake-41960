Just like getting great pizza in Rome. My Pie is a great midtown find- an assuming little space with a cheesy name. But boy o boy is the pizza good. These are the Roman-style pan pizza slices, and not your typical New York triangle slice. The crust is wonderfully thick and flavorful, and the sauce is awesome. Get the slice with the cherry tomatoes and fresh mozzarella and you won't be disappointed.
