Overall, this is a good restaurant. The service is prompt, wait for New York is reasonable and the variety is great. We had several yakitori and other dishes. I've had yakitori before but at other restaurants. Here it's noticeably smaller so it would be nice if they could provide an additional one on the plate for sharing. I thought the marinade is tasty and the grilling was v. nicely done.
