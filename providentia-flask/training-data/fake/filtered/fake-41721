I found this place on Yelp and am glad I did! The space is quite small, but surprisingly my boyfriend and I were able to be seated right away. I like how the menu is constantly changing due to the fact that they use really fresh ingredients. The week I went, the featured animal was duck and I ordered these duck tacos and noodles. Both were delicious! They have so many types of drinks ranging from picklebacks to craft beers...awesome. Will def come back soon!
