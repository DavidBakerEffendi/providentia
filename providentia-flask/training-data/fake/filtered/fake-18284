I just returned to my office after waiting for 20 minutes, ALONE, at the salad area.  It was 2 in the afternoon and I figured that the "lunch rush" was over.  I was ready to purchase a salad, made to order, and a box of cookies and a water.  I waited for over TWENTY minutes at the counter while the young girl wrote something on her paper.  No one else was waiting for food.   I was never acknowleged (i.e. "be right over, I just need to finish up on this")  I was as patient as I could as I stood in plain sight of this employee.  Finally, I got fed up, left my items and walked out. I have been patronizing D'Angelo's since it opened over a year ago.  I hadn't been back in four months (I work right across the street).  Looks like I won't be returning for another four months AT LEAST.   Completely RUDe and I was totally aggrevated
