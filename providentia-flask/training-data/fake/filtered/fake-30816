I live one block from Double Windsor so I hang out there at least once a week.  Yesterday I had a bad experience. I was with my husband and 4 friends, we were sitting at the bar.  Three of my friends went to smoke outside. I was at the bar with my friend.  When my others friends came back they realized that the drinks were taken away and some money too.  We ask the bartender what happened with the drinks that were almost full and she told us that we shouldn't leave drinks at the bar.  So where else can we leave the drinks if we are sitting there and we just want to smoke?? She didn't even apologize for taking the drinks, she  made fun about my friend's accent, putting a nasty smile saying "I can't understand you" when she spoke to her perfect english. I am sad that DB hired somebody like her when they have such an amazing bartenders like John and Kate.
