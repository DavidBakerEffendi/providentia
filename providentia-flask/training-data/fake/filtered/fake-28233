Heard about this place from a columnist who gave a good review so I thought I'd make a visit with my best friend last night. We ordered the Show Stopper and Napa Chicken. This isn't a fast food restaurant so if you want your food properly done in a gourmet establishment you do have to wait. We waited equal to or less than 5 minutes for our food and it was DIVINE!! The burger was juicy and fulfilling and it had some secret ingredient between the cheese which made the burger taste even better. The chicken sandwich was also fulfilling and light. The owner and staff are very friendly and check up on you to make sure you're satisfied with your meal. I'll definitely be back again - it's worth it.
