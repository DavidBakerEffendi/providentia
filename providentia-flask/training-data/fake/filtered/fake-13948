I went here with a friend for dinner on Friday night.  She loved it and in fact has been raving about it ever since.  I had some issues with my meal which I will share, but definitely think its worth giving another chance.  Here's a little about my experience. The atmosphere was great for sharing a meal with close friends or a date. The wine list was pretty good and reasonable priced, and the cocktails seemed to be worth testing out in the future. We sat at the counter and enjoyed observing the chefs. Everything they prepared looked so delicious and it looked like the gnocci and the budicino (sp?) were the two most popular items.   We started out with the marinated olives (delicious!) and the beet salad, which was too, too salty.  For a main course my friend ordered the gnocci and gobbled it up in about 3 minutes proclaiming it the most delicious pasta dish ever.  Not in the mood for pasta, I decided to try one of the pizzas. Overall the flavor of my pizza was good, but the texture needed some work. The center of the pie disintegrated under the sauce and cheese, creating a sort of pizza mush in the center. which was really a shame becasue the crust was crisp on the outside, soft in the middle and with a nice char.   The dessert - delicious. I would go back just for the budicini. Salthy, butterscotchy goodness.
