You can't go wrong here. We are now weekly visitors to this fine establishment. The food - beyond YUM. The service - best I've EVER had. The prices - Always leave full and doggie bag in tow without breakin' my wallet. Honestly, this place is superb. We have gone 8-10 times, still haven't gotten the same thing twice. You can easily split two menu items with your special someone, or a friend, and leave completely satisfied. Always a good experience. Oh - Â and Nutella hot chocolate? Are you kidding me? I choose that for my dessert this last time. Definitely a winner.
