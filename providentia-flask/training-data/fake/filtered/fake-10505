As a first time customer to AKB, I am beyond impressed. I always heard great reviews about their previous restaurant so I wanted to give this one a try. Immediately walking in you can tell this bar/restaurant is more upscale than your usual restaurant. I was worried about how much id be spending but the prices are very reasonable. I ended up getting the AKB cheese burger as my entr√©e and the potato skins for the app. This burger is probably one of the best burgers I've ever tried and for a good price too. As for The potato skins, they were phenomenal as well. I've been to AKB 3 times already and fall in love with their food more and more each time. Very pleased with their new restaurant. The staff is very polite and looks amazing inside as well! Keep up the good work!
