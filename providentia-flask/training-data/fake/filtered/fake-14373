I ate at Candela for the second time last night. Food was excellent . Great flavors with nice presentation. The scallop tapas is wonderful. If you like aged Rum try the Zacapa with hints of the whiskey barrels it is aged in. I was there a little after the dinner rush so noise was not a factor. Will be recommending to people looking for a light meal in the Upper Valley.
