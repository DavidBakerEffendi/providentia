My husband and I ate at Grant's Restaurant on Valentine's Day after reading the reviews posted on this post, and wanting our Valentine's Day to be romantic. I did make reservations.  We were seated immediately.  Our coats were taken, and we were promptly greeted by a waitress.  The menu was not over extensive.   Our meal was a wonderful tasty experience!!  The atmosphere is very romantic.  The employees very knowledgeable, and dedicated to providing a pleasant experience. I will return to Grant's.  It was a very magical experience.
