Well, looks like Yelp was right again.  In short, good food, not so good service. Dinner for two on a Sunday evening, the place crowded but not packed.  After waiting more than 15 min for menus, we had to flag someone down to get them.  We had to flag someone down to order an appetizer.  Then get another person's attention to order our meals.  Then another person to get some cheese.  No one asked us how everything was.  No one even offered us dessert.  The staff weren't unfriendly, they just forgot our table existed. The couple next to us got slightly better service.  A waiter actually came over to them and asked if they wanted dessert.  They replied they were never given menus and didn't know who their original waiter was. Food: Caesar salad - one of us liked it and the other thought it was fair.  Gnocchi w sage/butter - very tasty, especially after I was able to find someone for a little cheese.  Pasta w eggplant, basil, cheese, tomato, etc - very tasty.  The bread with oil they had on the tables was also very tasty. Overall, go, enjoy the food, just be proactive about the meal
