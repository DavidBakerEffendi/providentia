Im not sure if the people who eat at this establishment have low or no standards but if I could give his place zero stars I would. If I could give it negative stars Itd be most ideal. The young incompetent ghetto youth working there are an absolute turn off. No smile no greeting no effort in their appearance... the "waitresses" walk around in dingy leggings and socks... if you can concentrate on your medeocre meal over their loud inappropriate conversations with their baby daddies and them your realize you made the wrong choice. Cracked plates, freezer burned vegetables, just an over all terrible experience. The thing that really bothers me, and made me take the time to write this nightmare down is... I went to eat there while I was pregnant... they have NO bathroom. I had to beg to use it.. once they allowed me to use the bathroom I had to walk through a disgusting kitchen, where no gloves were being used and the area food that was being served was not at all up to standards... I wonder what inspector they paid off to get this shanty opened. Off to BBB because this experience was not an anomoly. I know several people who have gotten disrespect from this place. From the employees to the manager Gary. I tried to rectify this but got cursed out. Customers are never right at just fish... and it JUST SUCKS!!
