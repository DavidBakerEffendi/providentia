Oh. My. God. I spent 10 weeks in Spain on a study program. Since then, I have been DESPERATE to find an authentic Spanish tapas bar. Look no further. From the brick decor to the food, this place is authentic in every way. We ordered 8 entrees, and every single one of them merited an "Oh my god" after a first bite. The prices are totally moderate for New York, and everything is SO delicious. I will come back. Advice: Get there early and ask them to save a table for you if you have a larger group. We had a 30 minute wait to get a table, so we just went to a few stores and then came back. Worth it!
