I had dinner here a few weeks ago at the bar. i have to say that I had an amazing time. The bartender Tom, was so cool and funny. He made the experience a lot of fun. The food was delicious too say the least. I cant wait to go back. If I had one complaint it would be the other bartender, I think her name was Kelly, or Kelsey? Very strange girl and seemed flustered the whole time. But over all, LOVED!!!
