I come here every week! Today, I tried ordering my usual Turkey sandwich and grubhub lost my order! The guys at TRO didn't make a big deal of it, got me my sandwich and threw in a free cookie! These guys really do make my day :) Great salesmanship too! Also, their sandwiches are always the best, at the most affordable prices :)
