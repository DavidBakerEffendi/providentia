Great decor, amazingly detailed, and the menu is perfect!!!!!!!!!! Try the Arancini and the Lightly Spicy Calamari in a tomato sauce, also ask the owner for a cocktail suggestion, they have an amazing Wine list too. I'm happy to have this new -place in Soho, brings a very elegant touch to the block.
