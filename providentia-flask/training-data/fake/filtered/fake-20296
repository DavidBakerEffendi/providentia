Best pierogi by far in the East Village, and I have tried many others. Very friendly staff, for the afternoon Andrew and Robert, and the morning Chester and Roman, Chester making the best scrambled eggs I think I've ever had. They only complaint I have is that the leg room is not the best, but the food substitutes for that 20 fold.
