THE ABSOLUTE *BEST* FELAFEL I'VE EVER HAD!!  And since FELAFEL  is my FAVorite food, I am always searching for the BEST..AND I have lived in NYC 3 times while performing in the theatre, and thought THAT was the best....it's not : )  I work at The Philadelphia Shakespeare Theatre on 21st & Sansom St.'s and everyone told me to go...It's amazing!  So glad to have found you!!  THANKS!!  BTW...the service is always prompt and freindly...if there's a line it moves quickly, and you can comfortably sit inside and  outside too!
