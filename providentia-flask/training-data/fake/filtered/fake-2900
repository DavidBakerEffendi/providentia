We loved going to this place until we had an issue with getting charged for another persons meal and had to deal with the manager/hostess, Ryyan and owener Dominck.  I looked at my bank statement after eating at Cubin Petes and realized not only was I charged for my meal but I was also charged $121 in a seperate transaction.  I figured it was a mistake that could easliy be corrected so I went and spoke with the manager.  She was beyond rude and did not apologize once.  she told me I needed to wait 5 business days to see if it would correct itself.  It obviously never did and she was suddenly "on vacation" and was not around to take care of this.  I then had the pleasure of speaking to the owner.  It is truely amazing that this place is still open and is as busy as it is.  The owner said it was because I used a debit card and banks do this.  What??? Take responsibility and realize someone made a mistake.  he told me to wait 7 business days and gave me his card to call him.  Well lets just say he doesn't answer his phone or have voicemail.  I tried one last time with calling the manager and again, she was extremely rude told me she was too busy and would call me back and what a shocker, she never did.  Horrible, horrible management and ownership.  I really hope people realize how this place is ran and people will stop going.  Please take my advise do not give these people your business they are not good people
