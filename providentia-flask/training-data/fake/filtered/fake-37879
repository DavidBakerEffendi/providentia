Not sure why my original comment was deleted, but here goes again.. First off, the pizza took an hour and thirty minutes to deliver.. it was being delivered just over two miles, about a nine minute drive. The pizza arrived over ninety minutes later with little to no explanation besides "we're busy." It was supposed to have arrived within 45 minutes. After an hour and ten minutes I called to see where the pizza was and the dispatch told me it was arriving as we speak. I then called back after an hour and twenty five minutes and the dispatch called the driver and then told me the driver was outside of the door. I went downstairs and still waited for over five minutes. The driver never called when he arrived, I had to spot him first. When the pizza arrived it was obviously cold, but not only cold. It was 90% soggy because it had been sitting in its grease in the car for an hour after it was cooked. Took two bites and threw it away because it was not edible. After paying 19 dollars and waiting an hour and a half for a pizza, one would think it could be eaten, but no, right to the trash. This place is terrible, service, food, everything. This was the second time I was extremely disappointed by the food/service. As for the subs, I've tried those too, and I can say that it wasn't anything to write home about, so to speak. It was neither good nor bad. I don't like to give reviews such as this, but It is only fair to express how poor the service and food was. Sorry, but I certainly won't be back!
