This is one of my favorite New York restaurants. I've been twice and both times I've had wonderful service and the food was delicious. The last time I went, I was with a group of 10, and we asked the server to bring us all of her favorite dishes. She checked on us throughout the night to see if we wanted more, or if we were slowing down. Everything was great and it was a fun way to try several different dishes. Oh, the Sangria is also delicious! My only warning is that it's a little hard to find because it's in a residential neighborhood and there's no street sign.
