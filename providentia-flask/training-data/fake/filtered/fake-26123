By far some of the best Italian food I've ever had. Everything is thoughtfully and simply made. No fancy plating, no special tricks....just straightforward, honest, delicious food with family style seating. (Don't fear...this only adds to the warm and inviting atmosphere, it's contagious.) Please note: If you're looking for pasta, don't go here. (I do not believe their was a single pasta item on the menu...and that's a-ok with me!) I believe the menu changes often but, when I went, the server offered to choose menu items for us...so, we let her do that and were served a delicious variety of things. I ate there about a month ago so I cannot recall the exact details of every dish but, I can assure you that wether you decide yourself what you'd like to eat or let one of their servers choose for you (yes, they will do this) you will have an exceptional meal. The one dish that DID stick out in my mind though, was the black rice risotto. It's was perfectly cooked, slightly sweet and paired beautifully with the Pinot Grigio we were drinking and the delightful meatballs they served along side. If you want light, authentic, regional Italian food....if you want to feel warm and cozy and welcomed by kind people....go here. I don't say this often but I definitely think "love" is an essential ingredient in their food. Love of food? Love of cooking? Love of customers? Love of culture? Love of heritage? Love of all of those? I'm not sure which...but, it tastes AMAZING.
