I am soooooo happy I found this place!! Fabulous menu (a bit eclectic), great drinks (and beer selection, served in mason jars) and just an overall chill, cool vibe. If you're into coffee, espresso they have a big selection of this as well. The yucca fries and kale salad are DELICIOUS! Staff is extremely friendly. Haven't had the pleasure of being here when there's live music but hopefully next time! Great for big groups.
