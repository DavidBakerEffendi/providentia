I want to love this place. When it first opened, it was a breath of fresh air in a neighborhood that could use a few more bars. My boyfriend and I were excited for the potential of a new "corner bar." The location and beer selection are great, as are the open windows and plentiful seating. Unfortunately, we will not be returning. We gave it a solid 7-10 visits and 85% percent of the time were really turned off. The Sunday afternoon bartender is the worst. She is irritated by your every request, patronizing to customers, and cannot remember your drink after several rounds (even if you're the only one at the bar). Although they have a huge TV, we were scolded for asking them to turn it on. It has the potential to be a great post-work spot or a regular lazy Sunday locale but until they find some bartenders who are genuinely happy to be there, or at the very least not pissed off at your presence, I'll be taking my business elsewhere.
