I went to Las Bugambilias on Sunday Jan. 24th, The restaurant was wonderfully decorated with 1940's and 50's Mexican actors and actresses. Too cute! Besides that the services was great and the food was out of this world, but the only thing I would have to say was a bit scary was the "costumes" these poor girls were wearing. Black cowboy shirts with an really honking bow tie. It was really embarrassing. When are people going to learn that you don't need flashy uniforms to make your restaurant stand out.
