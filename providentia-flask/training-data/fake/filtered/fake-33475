Amazing atmosphere! A great place to meet large or small groups of friends but still feel cozy and included in the rest of the bar. A truly unique experience in Brooklyn with a huge selection of beers. Also, the food is even better now that they revamped their menu to include delicious sausages/brats. Really appreciate the absence of live german music... cough cough berry park.
