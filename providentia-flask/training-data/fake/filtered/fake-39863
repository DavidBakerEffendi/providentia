We went to Tony & Lucille's with a party of 4.  Each of us ordered a different entree.    Within a two hour period after finishing our meal, 3 of us began having stomach aches, and ultimately the inevitable. I called the restaurant and asked to speak with an owner or manager.  I was told that I had reached their "answering service" (I don't know of any restaurant with an answering service).  I was asked the nature of my call.  I explained that in our party of 4, 3 of us had gotten physically ill, and that I wanted to convey that to the ownership or management, so that they can take corrective action.  I made a point of telling the "answering service" that I was not looking for a free meal or a refund.   I was told that I would receive a return call the next day.  I never did receive that call.  I can only feel that the owners of this establishment are not concerned when 3 out of 4 people get a stomach ache and diarrhea after eating at their restaurant.  Obviously, this issue is not a priority to them. My recommendation when patronizing this establishment......bring some Pepto-Bismol.
