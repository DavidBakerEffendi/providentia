Absolutely my favorite pizza, anywhere, ever. I have been going to Jimmie's since 1980 and the quality and taste have been consistent, even through changes of ownership. (I've seen Jimmie back in the place on a few occasions over the years--he obviously approves!) My favorite is pepperoni, onions and peppers--what a combination. Crisp crust, not too thin--classic Greek pizza--the peppers are the pickled kind. Different taste from "fresh," but oh so delicious. Just the right amount of cheese, too. Not too heavy...not too light. Perfect. (Even the plain cheese pizza is just great--because of the crust, and the cheese he uses. Sauce just the right taste.) And the pepperoni grinder! Haven't had one in a while. It's time! I've only seen it on the menu a few other places, but here, instead of making it with pizza sauce, they use fresh lettuce and tomato. A wonderful sandwich. I don't live in Hartford anymore, but whenever I am even passing through, I go! Honest. It is that good. Long live Jimmie's! (and Jimmie, too...what a great, friendly guy.)
