This place is awesome! I have only had the crab but it is sooooo good, makes me not want to try anything else. I recommend getting all of the seasonings together. Only thing that sucks is they do not take reservations so you most likely will be waiting for a while (depends on what day and time you go). They do make up for it by sending you a text when your table is ready so you don't have to wait in the restaurant. It does get crowded. Love love love the place.
