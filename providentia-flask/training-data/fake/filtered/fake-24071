We went on New Years Eve, so we weren't expecting their absolute best.  They were offering 6 courses for $65, and to be fair the portions were surprisingly generous for a tasting menu.   Chef Erin O'Shea does a nice job of pairing sweet and savory flavors, which was helpful because the meats and fishes were far too salty.  I ended up not finishing the trout (3rd course) and bypassing the quail (4th course) altogether.  The gingerbread cake and pistachio ice cream had a wonderful texture and taste and I would get it again if it were on the regular menu.   What really killed it for us was that we were there for three hours!  And that was after we asked them to omit one course because we just couldn't sit in the chairs any longer.  Basically we were waiting half an hour between courses, and oddly other tables were served ahead of us.  It was hard to comprehend because otherwise the service was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The one bathroom had a long line and no lights. The food was intriguing, but not really worth the back pain.
