I tried to make a reservation for a group of 12 people for brunch here for my husband's birthday. When I called, the manager said they don't usually take reservations for brunch, and they couldn't take us at 11am, but they could take us at 10am (when they first open). I called everyone in my group, rearranged all our plans, and called back the next day, only to be told that the manager had "talked to the owner," and they could not accommodate us after all. I'm a food editor and a former waitress, and I know large parties can be harder for restaurants to handle. But I always tip extremely well because I know this. And I'm appalled at the idea of a restaurant simply refusing to accept someone's business because they don't want to deal with a large party. This is just bad business, and sends a message that they don't care about their clientele. I've been to this restaurant before, and they definitely have the space to seat 12 people. The food here is quite good, but there are other places with equally good food that understand how to treat their customers.
