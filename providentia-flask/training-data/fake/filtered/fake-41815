Luigi's really disappointed me last night. I got a Margarita pizza and it barely had any cheese on it, actually we had to re-bake it and add more cheese when we came home and realized the disaster it was. It only had like three leaves of basil scattered around and i specifically said I wanted to add kalamata olives to it and they added the cheap canned black olives. We also ordered a caprese salad and the mozzarella was tasteless not to mention that it was not a caprese but a salad with lettuce. Apparently they don't know what a caprese salad is. I don't know what happened with this place.
