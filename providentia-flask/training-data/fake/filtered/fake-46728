came here for the halo halo, which was very good. bicol express was good too, but bulalo soup was very salty. would have been a good meal but you come out smelling like you cooked the food yourself. they need a better exhaust system! passed by some people having kamayan, looked all fried and not very appetizing. i would go back if i can take out halo halo to go.
