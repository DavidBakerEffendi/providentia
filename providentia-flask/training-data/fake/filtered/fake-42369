After trying, and really loving, Avroko's new spot down the street (Saxon and Parole) I thought I would do a first visit to Public. Glad I did. The food here is unreal from beginning to end. Had something like a mushroom ceviche that was tangy and delicious. Tried a fish dish that felt really fresh and light and was thankful the chef didn't weigh it down with anything saucey or heavy. Dessert was worth the calories. Salty sweet chocolates and a bite or two of my girlfriends hokeypokey ice cream. This place deserves 6 stars.
