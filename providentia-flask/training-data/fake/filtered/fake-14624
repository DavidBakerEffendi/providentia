I made a yelp account for the sole purpose of reviewing Tacos Don Memo.  Tacos Don Memo makes traditional Mexican fare, and it is fantastic.  Best burrito in Philly, hands down.  I've eaten from their cart for a few years now, and the two guys that work it consistently impress me and every coworker or friend I've dragged there.  I am thrilled that they've moved down to 33rd and Market nearer my current job, so I can get my weekly burrito fix once again.  I have to stop offering to pick up burritos for people in the office, because it's become an absurd task of coordination, given how much everyone likes the food. My only complaint is they sometimes (grossly) underestimate the wait.  Expect to wait, and  be pleasantly surprised if you do not have to.  Today I got my burrito within 5 minutes of ordering it.
