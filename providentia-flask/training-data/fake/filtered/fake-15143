I stopped by for some nibbles with a friend who seized by the sudden need for a Sunday afternoon indulgence in bubbly booze. We went at around 4,  and with the homey decor and still-slow hour, it was perfect for catching up and trying out a few different dishes.   The food was great, the wine was good (as far as I could tell), but that said, what really warmed me to this place was that our server chased me down a full avenue block on a rainy day to bring me the notebook that I had left on the table when leaving.
