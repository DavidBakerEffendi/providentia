Years ago, every several months or so, I'd remember Jones, how it seemed cozy, and drag a friend or two in. I was always unimpressed. But sometime in the last year or so, they placed an experienced general manager there and its a very different place now - its awesome and I go there much more often. The decor and even the menu have always been comfortable and cozy, but the food was always simply fine and the service was not bad, but nothing impressive. Now they seem to have to wait staff, who are great and a few who are just outstanding. And there are a ton of new things on the menu now. The fish sticks are great - they're like you've always wanted them to be but never are: light, still crispy, tasty and with nice quality fish. I LOVE the Cheese Hold the Beef Burger - fried halloumi??! Sheer genius. And I would put that sauce on every sandwich I ever eat if I could. And the drinks - its so nice to have good beer available, but I usually have to try one of the new cocktails, too - delicious - the Rhuby, the Derby - all great. They are kid-friendly and simply a great place to go for excellent food in a nice but relaxed atmosphere. Why is this place so great now, compared to the blah it was? From what I can tell, they simpy now have a general manager who's not just experienced, but has great ideas to keep the place fun and service-oriented attitude that is contagious. Well done, all around.
