Metropolitan Mexican Grill is a wonderful place to eat and/or take out.  Jose and the staff never fail to greet us by our names, with a smile and a big, "Hello."  I LOVE this place.  The food is really fresh and inexpensive. You get large portions and can tailor your selection to you own tastes.  It is less expensive than Taco Bell and tastes twice as good.  The guacamole is sensational and did I mention the lemonade?  It is the best lemonade I have ever tasted! As this is a very personal style of dining, I would recommend a personal visit so you can choose all the ingredients you like.  You won't be disappointed.
