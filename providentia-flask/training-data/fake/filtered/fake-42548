My husband and I received a groupon for Moshulu as a gift.   The boat is cool, but the decor is pretty outdated.  Even though it was a slow Monday and the restaurant had less than 20 guests, we were all seated in the same smaller area, which felt a but cramped. As for the food, we had a crunchy spicy philadephia roll and the rock shrimp as appetizers.  The sushi was fresh and on par with other similar rolls I've had before.  The rock shrimp were awesome; they were definitely the best thing we had while we were there.  The entrees, however, were disappointing.  My husband ordered the crab cake entree.  It was a bit on the small size (the shrimp appetizer was actually bigger than this entree).  The crab cake was okay - it was what I would expect from a chain restaurant, nothing special.  I ordered the pork chop.  This was a sizable entree, but was unfortunately overcooked (the skin was tough, the meat was chewy).  The side dishes in both were pretty bland and left a lot to be desired, especially when considering the price.  I did not find that it was a good value for the cost, and I would not return.  Additionally, we ended up not being able to use the full value of our groupon, which made for an even more disappointing dinner.   On the positive side, our waitress was courteous and parking was easy (although it did cost $15).
