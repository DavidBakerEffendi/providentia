I had breakfast here on Thursday, March 8.  There was a definite lack of organization in the serve staff- It seemed like I had a different server for every thing.  I did not get water until my meal was almost complete.  The griddle cakes were overdone and tasteless,  It was greatly overpriced for the product delivered. I will have blueberry pancakes at a small country diner on March 15.  They will be vastly better than what I endured at Junior's- and also, will cost less then $5.00
