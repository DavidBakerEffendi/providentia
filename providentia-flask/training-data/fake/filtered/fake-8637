My girlfriend and I absolutely love this place. I'll start off by saying that the service is great. The people answering the phone are easy to speak with. They confirm what you say and always get the order right. A lot of pizza shops in this city have surly workers on the phone; you know, places where you can't hear what the person says, rushes you during your order, and then hangs up abruptly, leaving you wondering if you're even going to get your order. Not at this place! Delivery time is average - I think this place is usually pretty busy. On to the pizza. I will be so bold as to say that this is the best pizza I've had in Philly. Just perfect, really! The sauce is great, not sweet like most pizza in this city (eugh!), and I appreciate that. The toppings are super fresh and tasty, the cheese is excellent, and the pizza is always cooked just right! This place is very consistent with their food - never undercooked, never too doughy, and never burnt. I must get at least two pizzas here a week - it's that good. I haven't had a pizza I didn't like. How about other food? This place has pretty good food besides pizza. The hoagies and hot sandwiches are killer. I really dig the chicken parm's, although they can get messy if you get them delivered. The fries are kick-ass. The wings are OK - the sauce is pretty good though. They're nothing to write home about, but then again I'm kind of a wing snob and I usually make my own. The wings are still better than 90% of the places in this city (this city has crappy wings!). TL;DR - Best pizza in South Philly hands down, good sides, hoagies, hot sandwiches, friendly AND consistent service. I'm glad to have such a great pizza shop close by to my house. Francoluigi's sets the bar high!
