This was so gross. It took forever for delivery. And when I opened up my food after waiting for 40 minutes for it to finally arrive, there was a very long hair wrapped around the meat. Never again will I eat gyros abd gyros were my favorite food of all time to eat but not anymore because of this place. So I wasted my money and I did not even eat any food because it was gross to look at.
