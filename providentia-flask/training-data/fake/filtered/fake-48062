Pros: The Smith is lively, raucous, young and fun. The food is hearty, robust and flavorful. The cocktails, along with the rest of the menu, were surprisingly affordable (for downtown Manhattan). The service is friendly. Cons: Loud. Like Madison Square Garden loud. The room is sprawling, and while the decor seems to reach for bordello-brasserie, it's never quite distinctive or intimate. The clientele mostly wore jeans and I saw more than a few BoSox caps (no offense to Boston fans but dude, if there's a wine list, take off your hat!). Conclusion: The Smith is a great place for a group, a college reunion, or an internet date where you want to be easily distracted. Not so much for romance. But hell, you can't have it all. . .(and the chocolate sundae was good!)
