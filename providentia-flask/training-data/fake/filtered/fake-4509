These guys are incredible. I've had over a dozen different sandwiches in the last couple years and every one is solid. If I have one complaint about this place, it's that they put some tissue paper on the sandwiches that gets stuck to the cheese on some sandwiches (meatball, eggplant, chicken parms.) I have to gnaw it off the paper like a squirrel. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra money for a seeded roll. Most times one half is good enough for a meal. Save the rest for later. In addition to sandwiches, they have everything you'd expect from a corner deli. Chips, candy, ice cream, soft pretzels, tons of drinks/sodas. Cigarettes. Milk. Everything. And they deliver! Skip Pats and Genos and get a real steak at Cosmis.
