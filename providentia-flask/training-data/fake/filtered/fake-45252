Finally, a pizza shop that has owners that actually interact with their customers. These guys appreciate you each and every time you walk in their shop, even when calling in for a delivery order. Their chicken Caesar salad pizza is addicting! And everything else I've tried on the menu is yet to disappoint. A great city feel with their outdoor seating and an amazing part of the family feeling with their VIP service and inside decor. They truly want you there and can't wait to see you next time.
