Love this place!! Food is awesome! The staff is the Best in NYC!! Highly recommend this spot. Only negative, Â they use to play an awesome mix of contemporary and old school hip hop music but recently changed the music to what I can only compare to 90's top 40. Woof!!!! The new music just doesn't fit the rest of the vibe they have going at this place. Tres Carnes I love you PLEASE bring back the hot music!!!
