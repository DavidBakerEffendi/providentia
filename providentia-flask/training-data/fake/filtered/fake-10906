This was the worst meal I've ever had! There was three of us and we all had different meals and everything was awful. The mozzarella en corrozza was basically a dried out grilled cheese, the calamari looked and tasted like a frozen/fried in oil that hasn't been changed in months. We couldn't even eat it and when the waiter took it away he didn't even ask why we hadn't eaten any of it. Our server never introduced himself or asked how anything was, he also didn't ask us if we wanted anything to drink besides putting a jug of water on our table (which he didn't even pour for us). Our pasta entrees were bland the chicken was dry (it also came with a hard boiled egg on the plate which was so strange for chicken saltimbocca!). Very disappointed. We go out to eat a lot in that area and it's by far the worst place we've been and I've never written on yelp before! The Only upside was that it was their "1970s" special pricing for the entire month of April so our bill was only $50 but for 3 people to eat in 1970 I doubt they spent $50. You can also tell they haven't updated the restaurant since 1979.  Needless to say .. We will not be returning ever again!  Do NOT go here if you want a good meal! Go to gennaros for a byob that's local and never disappointing!
