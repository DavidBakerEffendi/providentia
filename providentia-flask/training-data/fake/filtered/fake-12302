One of the best slices of pizza you will find. The plain slice alone is a perfect meal. Get a plain slice and one with pepperoni (but hold the extra cheese they automatically include). It's REAL PEPPERONI! A MUST-HAVE if you're in the area. If you're not in the area, then go out of you way to try it. I would!
