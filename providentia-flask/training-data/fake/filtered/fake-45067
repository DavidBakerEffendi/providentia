I have been going here for over 30 years with family and friends and business associates.The pizza was great UNTIL 2/16/12. We had the worst pizza ever at the resevior! Not to mention the other things we ordered and did not eat. I can believe my pie SUCKED! I asked our waiter,I have never seen a waiter here before only very nice waitresses, to please take it back to the kitcken. It came back soon ,worst than before.It looked like they poured a glass of water on it. The waiter told me it was my falt!  WTF! I ask for the check. This waiter charge me for the pizza from hell. So,I said you charged me for this pizza ,we did not, or let me reframe that ,we could not eat it! I request he remove the cost of "THE PIZZA FROM HELL" His reply was "only the manager can do that" I believe they don't have a manager.  Just an owner. I ask to please see him. The waiters reply,Oh he's not here. Catch 22! So I paid my 65.00 bill and left hungry. This place was built on good food and happy ,loyal customers,like myself and family. Hope you can fix your problems. and the waiter said it's my falt the pie sucked! Just remember" you can't fix stupid"
