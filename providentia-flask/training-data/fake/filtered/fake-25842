I can't disagree more with Kevin R. about the Bagel Stop's service. First of all, the bagels are some of the best in NYC. Forget about Sam's or Bagel O's, they have the most authentic bagels. I think they are owned by the same guy as Sunrise on Berdan. Their hot breakfast sandwiches are to die for. (Taylor Ham, Egg and Cheese with Salt Pepper Ketchup is the way to go!!) Prices are dirt cheap and the service is top notch. The people behind the counter always are eager to help a customer. Ever since moving from the city, the Bagel Stop is my favorite bagel store in town.
