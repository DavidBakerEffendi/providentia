I knew we shouldn't have eaten here, pizza from a chain is generally mediocre at best.  Previously got a pie from the Kips Bay location and the pizza sucked - salty and the bottom was burnt.  But we were in brooklyn and my friend insisted that we try the DUMBO location, so we spent about 40 minutes looking for a parking spot and then waited on line for two hours.  And, as expected, the pizza just wasn't good. Salty, the flavor is off - can't pub my finger on it - it's just not good, it doesn't taste fresh.  Maybe at one point this place deserved accolades, but not now. Definitely not worth the wait or cost.
