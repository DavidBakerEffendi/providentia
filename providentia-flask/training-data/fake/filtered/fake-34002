I don't review unless I think it is warranted.  Sally's is by far the best pizza in New Haven.  Expect to wait but it's worth every minute once you bite into their eggplant pie.  I go to Sally's with my daughter and two grandson's a couple times of month.  Family owned and delicious.  You won't regret it!
