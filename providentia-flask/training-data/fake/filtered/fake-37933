Wow. As others have commented - the food was a tremendous disappointment. The Chicken a la Reine was like eating a pile of salt. The Lamb Testaroli was also over-salted. And I love salt! :( Â And the potato dish was overcooked and flavorless. On top of that the space is cramped and incredibly loud. This evening out was a real dud.
