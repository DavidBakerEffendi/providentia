Well Ive been going to Rutts for a Long Time.  There is something here that makes me feel good, memories and comfort food.  my dad got me started when I was little and I remember how fast the food came out. we sat in the dinning hall at the time.  now I sit at the bar to get a few laughs from the bar tenders comments or some of the funny patrons.  for years I went to the standup side and pounded food like an animal.  my favorite are the rippers dipped, cheeseburgers double dipped, frenchy gravy, city gin, and maybe a chili all meat.  I can do 2 dogs, 3 burgers, a fry and a chili in one sitting....maybe that's gotta cut back soon :)  Nobody but me ever orders gravy on the dog...my secret now shared.  you can get the dogs in different degrees of wellness. in and out, weller, ripper, creamator, destroyer.  double dipped on a burger means there is gravy in it then the dip half the burger in the gravy too.  The relish for the dogs is great but I like the less sweet taste without it.  if you hear 2x2 it refers to the ratio between articles of food and the amount of plates they are on.  anything you want to go is traveling, be sure to mention.  yohoo drink is called a mavis and city gin is tap water btw.  I lived in seattle for many years and when I flew in to visit family in nj I would have the taxi take me right to ruts off 21n.  remember you can get lunch at 10:00am, that's the start time.  They used to be open to 3:00 back in the day but let me tell you it used to be a sloppy mess of all smashed kids from the bars.. fun times tho.  give ruts a try, if you don't like it no problem, its meant for the locals.
