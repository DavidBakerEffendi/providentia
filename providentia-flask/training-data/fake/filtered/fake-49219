The Dragonfly Restaurant is a really great place.  You can either come with your family to have a good time.  Or hang out with your friends at the bar.   The sushi here is amazing.  Best I've ever had.  My favorites are the Samurai Salmon Roll, or the Shrimp Tempura Roll.  And let's not forget how amazing the drinks are!  Me and my friends come here as often as possible to unwind and have a Blue Long Island Ice Tea.  Our big thing was Sake though.  The hot sake is really amazing. But this place would be incomplete if it wasn't for its amazing staff.  From the hosts to the waiters/waitresses, everyone is really awesome and friendly. Our favorite waitresses are Suzy and Kasia.  They're just THE BEST.  They're super helpful and friendly.  They're honestly the coolest people to talk and hang out with, and they truly just tie the whole experience together. If it wasn't for how cool they are, we wouldn't really be going as often as we do. Despite all that, the food and drinks are amazing. But the most amazing costumer service is what really keeps us coming back for more.  We honestly love it here.  It has been our hang-out spot for over a year already, and we just can't see ourselves not coming back. If you really want to have amazing sushi, drinks, and a really fun time, hit this place up.  You won't regret it.
