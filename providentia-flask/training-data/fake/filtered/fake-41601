It's one of those trendy spots that banks on its rep as a cool watering hole, especially in a smaller town like New Haven.  The food at Barcelona is fine enough and decent.  But the service is horrible.  The night my friends and I were there, there was one server for 10 or so tables.   Poor server was overworked with no backup from management or whoever that dude was who came over chewing his food in my face when I asked what was up with the slow service.  Management, sadly, doesnt care about the concern of customers.  Aside from the guy chewing in my face- very unprofessional- even worse was the manager I spoke with.  Do not patronize Barcelona. Better food and service at Soul de Cuba up the street on Crown and High or Bentara on Ninth Square.  Better drinks and friendlier service at Firehouse down Crown Street.
