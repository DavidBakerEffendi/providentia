This is a great food truck.  There is a line.  There is a reason students and staff are waiting (sometimes 20ppl waiting) in line when 5 food trucks parked right next to this one have no line at all.   I like the chicken satay tacos, I really like the chicken katsu add egg, $6 what a great meal at that price. Thai tea, really tastey.  A great veggie burger loaded with toppings and that's not easy to find.  The menu is small, maybe 7 choices but what they do, they do right.  The service is top notch too.  There is a line.  There is a reason.
