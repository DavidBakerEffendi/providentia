Bellini's has the best baked Gnocchi in America.  I've visited more than 35 states in the last 22 years.  Whenever I found an italian restaurant that served gnocchi, I ordered it.  No one even comes close to Bellini's.  If you get a chance to try it and want to experience it at it's best, you have to special order it as follows:  Ask them to add extra ricotta cheese stirred into the gnocchi with extra mozzarella cheese on top.  (I call this Bellini's Gnocchi ala Michele...but no one else knew that till now.)  Unfortunately I moved out of state and haven't been able to have my favorite dish for a while.  But I'll be visiting NJ in about two weeks and am hoping to make a pitstop after our 12 hour drive to fill my belly with the best Gnocchi in the U.S.A.
