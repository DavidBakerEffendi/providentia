Been there only for lunch but a great unique location.  Very homely feel inside with a grocery fridge full of the finest beers around.  Both times I went I had to go with the Hawthornes burger because it was too good to pass up but my whole crew was more than satisfied with their menu selections.  Great place, recommend it anyone, any time of the day.
