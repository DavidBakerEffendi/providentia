Extremely poor customer service.  I ordered an Italian grinder with no mayo.  When I arrived, I received it hot.  When I stated that I didn't want it hot, the girl said sorry.  That's it, sorry.  When I called to complain, I was advised that a manager wasn't there and that I would need to speak with "someone in charge". I was advised that since I didn't request a cold grinder, it was my fault.  Really?!, for $6.00 you can't make the customer happy?  I strongly recommend a course in customer service and an updated menu.  Best of luck continuing with your new establishment with this attitude!
