A quality, affordable BYOB French restaurant in the West Village? LOVE IT. After Lulu closed, this became a favorite for my husband and I. The canard is absolutely delicious with nice fresh veggies. The steak is generous and tasty. The bread is crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. If you are lucky, the cellist who often plays across the street will make your outdoor meal (there are tables inside too) even more romantic.
