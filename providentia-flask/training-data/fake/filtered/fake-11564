My wife and I have been going to The Bethwood for many years for Sunday brunch and have always had a wonderful experience. I find The Bethwood to be a bargain for brunch. Champagne is served for the whole meal, the food is delicious and beautifully displayed and all of the staff are wonderful. The international coffee bar and desserts are over the top. You can't go wrong at The Bethwood!!!
