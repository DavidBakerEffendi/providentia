It takes a lot for Italian restaurants to make a good impression on me but I was blown away by the Risotto House.  Went with a friend  Since it's a BYO, we went in with a bottle of red and a white.   Split the house made Manicoti with bolognese sauce for appetizer.  It was amazing and very different since they make them there.  It was paper thin, almost like a crepe.  It came with 2 large pieces and we each had one.   For the main course we both had the Sea Bass, with scallops and mushrooms in a light tomato sauce.  Fantastic! Fish was cooked perfectly and the scallops were huge and tender... and only 20 bucks for a huge portion.   My friend called it a night after that, but I opted for an espresso.  The waiter even offered me a complimentary shot of anisette to go along with it  (gave him an extra few bucks on top of our already generous tip).   Waiter was very attentive, but not annoying which can be the problem at times.  Cant say enough about this place.  I will definitely be back many times.
