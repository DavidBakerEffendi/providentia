At first glance this place seems to be a hot spot with people coming to this venue frequently. Once you sit down and receive your entree that seems they tried to put a little creativity into it the food has to be the worst tasting Cuban food i've tasted for the price they are charging. I have a problem with the previous reviews it seemed as if they wrote themselves because for one sure thing the food really sux!!! With the exception of the free bread that's given to you. Overpriced food that's mediocre!
