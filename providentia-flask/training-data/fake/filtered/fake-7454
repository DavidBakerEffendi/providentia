This is by far my favorite place in N.Y.C. From the time it opened ans had a doorman named Lincoln(restaurants with doormen, cute..lol) The seafood is unrealistically fresh and so deliciously enticing. I prefer a round,  leather booth in the back where it's a little quieter. I've always found the service to be excellent,  the food and beverages fantastic and oysters and a filthy martini are the perfect cure for a snowy, cold winters day.
