Ate dinner at Rho last night. The food was fine. My husband started with the seafood chowder which was excellent (soup of the day). I had the mixed green salad which was a good sized portion. I chose for my entree the tilapia cooked in parchment with capers, tomatoes and zucchini. The meal was flavorful though there could have been some more veggies thrown in. My husband had the veal scallopini. No complaints from him about his meal. Our mutual complaint was the staff. They seemed to be distracted and we had to flag down anyone we could get the attention of to take our check. They seemed to be concentrating on where to seat large parties of people as opposed to the customers they already had. Service definitely needs improvement.
