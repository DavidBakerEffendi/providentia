if it was possibloe i would \give this place half a star. ok ok so i was visiting my daughter in brooklyn, and wanted to try the pizza that everyone always talks about. this place was just around the corner from her appartment, so i was really excited! we drove over there, but it took forever to find parking! this was the beginning of the end. ok so, we got inside and they people were too busy watching a baseball game to even say hello! as if!!!! (as my daughter would say) when they finally turned around the pizza guy was very unfriendly, and i think he was looking at my daughters body in a way i didnt like. very arrogant about pizza! so we ordered the spinach salad to split instead. when he finally brought it out, he said ok "8 bucks" excuse me? it said 6 bcks on the menu. he told me to grab a menu and read what was written on the cover. i began to read the name and address of the place. "noooo!" he said, and grabbed the menu out of my hand, hurting it. "all prices are subject to chance WITHOUT NOTICE." call me old fashioned, but this seems very sketchy. we left as fast as we could, and the sald was gross on top it all!!!! no pine nuts!!! i wanted to throw up because i was so upset. i'll never eat here again. sickening. the guy was a pig. -gwen
