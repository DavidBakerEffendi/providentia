Variable dishes, fresh and tasty to soupy and bland. Sort of pricey considering the neighborhood and some of the ingredients. Table service very good. For some reason they Â won't split the bill, and will only charge two credit cards per dinner bill. This may pose a problem if you're eating with a big group of people.
