I had heard good things about Stone Hearth, and we decided to give it a try for dinner.  So glad we did!  Loved the menu, the apps and cheese tray were very good.  Service was excellent!  Each of our entrees were also delicious!  The desserts were on the simple side, but we shared two - the strawberry trifle and the chocolate pot -- outstanding!!  All in all a great experience - will be back soon!
