OK, so I'm not really one to write reviews, but I guess theres a first time for everything. A friend and I went in at around 7:30-ish on a Friday night. I was expecting it to be insane, and for everyone to be "eh" after reading a few of the reviews on this site, but I have to say I didn't encounter any of Â that. We called ahead, and although they said they were booked we could definitely walk right in. When we got there, there were people milling around and we had to shove our way up to the host stand. Both of the hosts were really sweet and complimented me on my dress. They told us the wait would be about 20-25 minutes, not so bad for a Friday. We didn't feel like drinking so we chatted with them for a while and read over the menu. 15 minutes later the table was ready. Awesome. Our server was super nice and recommended some good stuff. mac and cheese is always good, I had the meatloaf which was awesome, my friend had the mahi. It was ok, but a little bland. For dessert we had the peanut butter cup which was AMAZING. Prices were a little unreasonable, but this is New York. I have to say, I felt really bad for my server though. We were sitting at these tables for 2 that are all next to each other--and the people around us were all being really rude and demanding to him. He dealt with it the best he could, but I still felt bad. All in all a very nice night. I'll definitely be back.
