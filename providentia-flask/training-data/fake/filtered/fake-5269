I have been to Barrio Chino a few times and never had a real problem with the late and few is ok (nothing special) and reasonable. Nothing special. Went there on a Monday night and was told a 30 minutes. After an hour was told "another 30". After complaining to Joe was not given an apology and was told "too bad" Will never go back.
