This review is a few years coming, but well-deserved, as my experience at Union League Cafe was absolutely divine. My boyfriend and I went for our third anniversary and everything -- from the drinks to the food to the service and the atmosphere -- was impeccable. We had delicious cocktails with our cheese plate appetizer, red wine with the meal (the boyfriend ordered lamp chops with risotto and I ordered the duck breast, which came on a bed of the most heavenly whipped potatoes), and we split a dark chocolate suffle for dessert. The timing of the meal was impeccable, our waiter was attentive but not suffocating, and the duck stands as one of the best prepared I've ever experienced. It melted like butter on the tongue and the accompanying sauce was robust and complex. If we someday evolve into rich Yale alumni instead of poor graduate students, we'll come back here each time we visit New Haven. Until then, we highly recommend Union League to anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or have a ritzy night out!
