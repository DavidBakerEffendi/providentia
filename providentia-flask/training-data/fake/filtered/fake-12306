My favorite pizza place EVER.  I moved to the west coast 10 years ago (its true, there really is no good pizza out here!) and everytime I go back to NJ (usually 2x a year), Dominick's is the first place I go to.  Love love love their pizza!!!!!  Everything I have ordered from there is delicious!!!   Limited seating, they only take cash, parking can be a nuisance at times....but soooooo worth it.
