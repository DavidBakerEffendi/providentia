went over the weekend with a friend. had reservations.First timer. A little noisey but no big deal alittle tight also no big deal because the food was just great. We ordered hummas and eggplant puree for appetizers which were excellent. I had bosphorus kabob and my friend had lamb shank wrapped in eggplant.For dessert i had baklava, and my friend hadbaked rice pudding. I had a taste of the rice pudding and i wish i had orderd that. A great time great food and the service was ok. best to make reservations it looks like it gets a little crazy
