Went to Westville Chelsea today to pick up my lunch. While I was waiting the bartender, Nick, did everything he should have been doing for the other customers but managed to strike up a conversation that made the wait time go quickly and enjoyably. He offered me a bit of a vanilla milkshake while I was waiting and it was the best one I've had since I was 6 years old. He made my day.
