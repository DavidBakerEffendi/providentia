Something odd happened. I wrote a review several weeks ago stating how disappointed I was in the service. The food was ok but the bar staff ignores you.  Truthfully they treat folks s though they are a nuisance . It's a great place to go if you want to pay to be mistreated.  There is one good bartender... The guy. The women are not.  I suggested the owner pay closer attention because he is losing many.   Now the question for Yelp... Why did you remove a negative review? There was nothing mean spirited or vulgar. Just an honest review.  Is what we have heard about Yelp true? That Yelp accepts money for advertising and cleanses reviews for its subscribers?
