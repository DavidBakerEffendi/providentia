If you can stand the lines, or get there when it isn't crowded, the Halal Guys is absolutely delicious! For $6-8, you get a big plate of rice, lettuce, and perfectly cooked schwarma meat or falafel. This is not only how food stands should be done, but how middle eastern food should be done in this city. Not to mention, the guys are very nice, and will make your food any way you want it. Yeah, the lines are long, but the lines are long for a reason.
