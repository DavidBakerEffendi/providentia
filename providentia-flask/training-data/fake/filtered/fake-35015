I wasn't sure what to expect because of the hit or miss reviews of Agricola but I decided to risk it for a wed b-day dinner for my mom, now 65 (when medicare kicks in it's time for life in the fast lane). We had an exceptional experience. The restaurant has a wonderful ambiance and as a graphic design nerd I loved all the little details. Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable of the menu. We were placed in the kitchen area which was a little more quiet. We had the cheese platter to start which was really delicious w homemade zucchini crackers. The food was really great, beautiful presentation, also I loved my cocktail which was called an ice pick... or something close to that. To top it off the end of the night we were all stuffed and they bought over complimentary cheesecake for my Mom. It was a wonderful night. I'd love to go back soon even for just cocktails.
