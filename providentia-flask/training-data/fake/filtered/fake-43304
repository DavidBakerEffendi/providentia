Not that I go to a restaurant to pick up girls but this dude filled establishment is run, owned, operated, and attracts mostly dudes. The food was okay Greek food. The spinach pies and Greek salad were good. When I was there a few weeks ago, I also got salmon and chicken which were not that good. I had two different waiters, the owner, a guy filling my water and the only girl in the joint who explained the dessert platter to my table. No one besides her asked us if we liked our food, needed more drinks (which we did) or gave us any love. The one and only girl was very attentive and suggested places in the city we can go dancing after dinner. I felt like we were being rushed. The grand finale was when I overheard the owner tell the dessert girl to get us out if we weren't ordering desserts.
