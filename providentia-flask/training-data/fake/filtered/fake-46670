This used to be an incredibly good restaurant, with fresh, good food over and over again. We used to love it. Regrettably, this is not longer true. I went recently - the formerly wonderful yeasty hot bread was stale at every table, I ordered a lamb stew that turned out to be such an oily greasy moussaka that I couldn't eat it (I tried removing the puddle of grease but I couldn't get it all out) and the comped dessert that we were given to make up for the bad food was soggy. Even the waitress was embarrassed to be serving the food.
