My fiancee took me to BK Fare on my birthday for dinner.  If you aren't aware they do a tasting menu. The food was okay but I found the chef to be pompous and at times rude!  The hostess however, was just lovely. Because of some food allergies I needed several substitutions and she made my experience comparable to that of my fiancee's who didn't have any allergies or food sensitivities.  I had a few friends who wanted to try this place but honestly it just wasn't worth the price. Chef- you need a better attitude- a taste of  humility- buen provecho!
