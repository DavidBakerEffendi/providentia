It was a solid Indian restaurant and I have eaten at a few bad ones recently so this says a lot. The appetizers were the best part of the meal. Â Portions were enormous so the value was exceptional. The menu was a bit confused though. They had some north Indian fare, some Chettinad and some dosa/idly dishes too. A bit on the spicy side. The only downside is that they had a waitress who did not know the menu at all, did not like spicy food and had no idea what the dishes were. This is not good if you're an Indian food novice. Overall, I would recommend this place and would go again.
