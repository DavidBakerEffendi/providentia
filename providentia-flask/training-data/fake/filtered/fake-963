We have been going to JoJo's for more than 10 yrs., It is our most favorite place.  Yes its always crowed but that is part of the fun of it.   We always have a big smile and happy time being there.   The food is the absolute best.   Whatever you order, expect a great meal.  We always have a great deal of fun, overtime we go there, which is quite often.
