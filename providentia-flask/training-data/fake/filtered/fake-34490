After reading the review of Oct. 7, 2011 I totally agreed with him.  On 11/12/11 we went there to celebrate my birthday with a party of 12.  The service was horrible- everyone was basically rude, when we asked for silverware, they placed it all in front of my 1yr old granddaughter.  REALLY!!  Then we ordered 3 antipasti's and received only one set of oil & vinager for the table, 3 pieces of bread and 3 tabs of butter.  Are you kidding me!!  I had better service at McDonald's!!!   I think with the attitute of the staff (which when you asked for something, they acted as if you were bothering them) they should all quit or get fired.  With today's economy any other resturant would be happy to serve a big party.   Will never go there again, so sorry we tipped, we shouldn't have. Wish I couldn't give any star at all. Liz Rizzolo Roseland, NJ
