Excellent, fast service and delicious food. Rangoon exceeded my expectations in both taste and value. My family and I will be returning soon, if only for the delicious Thousand Layer Bread, a big hit with our youngest who is a slightly picky eater. The dishes were priced well and presented fast. We had the Jungle Beef, (made to our request of not too spicy), the Mango Chicken, Northern Noodles and a pork fried rice dish that Â had large tender pieces of perfectly cooked pork with crisp green veggies. The spices are uncommon and yet comforting. Can't quite name the seasoning in the Northern Noodles but, again, they were delicious. Some restaurants will adjust the spice level in a dish and lose the essence of that dish. Not so at Rangoon, where the Jungle Beef dish still had loads of delicate flavor (kaffir lime and coconut milk) after such an adjustment. Really worth a visit!
