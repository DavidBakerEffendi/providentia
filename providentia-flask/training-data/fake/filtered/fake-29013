My wife and I ate at Spanish Tavern early in January.  The experience was simply excellent.   Server:  Wilbur (yes, "Wilbur" - - ask him how he got the name!) could not have been better.  Very attentive and informative. Food:  Meal started with the complimentary bowl (not cup) of soup - - nice touch and excellent.  We shared the shrimp in garlic sauce appetizer (as so many reviewers raved about it) - - it did not disappoint.  For our entre, we opted to share an order of paella (Wilbur assured us that it would be enough for two - - and it was).  My wife inquired if it might be "too spicy" - not to her taste - while I indicated that I preferred "spicy" and Wilbur suggested that he bring out a "side bowl" of a "spicier sauce" that I could add to my share.  How often do you get a server who will even listen to his customers, let alone go out of his way to make the experience memorable.  Bottom line - - wife and I both loved our entre.  Pitcher of sangria was a perfect match.  Flan for desert was to die for - - at least as good as all others who raved about it.  To make up for sangria arriving a bit late, Wilbur offered complimentary dessert wine.  Another "above and beyond" touch. Ambiance:  Really very nice, although a bit crowded  (but less so than other Ironbound restaurants as we've heard).  Free, attended parking lot across the street was another very nice touch. Price:  I have eaten in restaurants in 13 different countries and this experience was one of the best value dinners I have experienced - - total bill was under $70 including a very handsome tip. Can't wait for my next excuse to be in the Newark area to return to Spanish Tavern.
