I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place! I came for a quick birthday dinner with my boyfriend and friend. They don't take reservations unless you have a large party, but we were sat right away on a Saturday night thankfully. Our waiter was awesome, really friendly and quick. He even comped me a dessert because he felt we waited too long for the check....What a prince....he wrote Happy Birthday on the check! I would go back here any chance I get...if not for the amazing service and food...just for the Spinach Gnocchi.
