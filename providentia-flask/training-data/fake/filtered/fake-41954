On a tip from a friend, I dinned here last weekend and was very surprised. We were seated in the lower level which was full atmosphere...and candles. We had perfect, perfect margaritas that were just right. Our first course was a mouth watering tuna ceviche, followed by some mexican flat bread and juicy carnitis tacos, which were disappointing only because my wife wouldn't let me order a 2nd round of them.   For the main course we had the fried chicken dish and the snapper. The fried chicken was juicy, flavorful and delicious. The corn bread which a lot of restaurants do not put much effort into was fantastic. The snapper was different in a amazing sort of way.  Fresh as could be and seasoned oh so right. For dessert we had the doughnuts and dessert martini, both were delicious were the perfect end to our amazing night. The service was great, our server Wedge was thoughtful, calm and polite, even though the room was full. We will definitely return soon.
