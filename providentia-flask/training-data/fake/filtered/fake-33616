This review is based on my one and (thus far) only visit which was a co-worker's going away party.  We were here on a weekday after work a couple of weeks ago. The interior is roomy, pleasant and clean; the staff are attentive.  We had no problems with our many orders (there were ten of us) and empty plates were removed in reasonable time.  They handled the party very well. With so many people I was able to sample about ten dishes here.  Everything was good or excellent - I recall the beef & chicken skewers and lamb tikka as being very good, as well as the tongue and blood sausage.
