Went there because Modern was closed - was willing to give Da Legna a fair chance. However, service was extremely slow and staff did not seem well trained. For instance, we got our drinks after our salad, and only because we reminded the staff. The pizza was normal, though I personally prefer the dough at Modern or Pepe's as Da Legna's did get hard quickly and was way too charred. Will not return.
