Just went to this place on a Sunday afternoon with my BF....I would have to say that I have had better Mexican food at chain restaurants in the suburbs (which will remain nameless). I had the fried plantains for an appetizer and the enchiladas. I didn't know that the plantains were going to be drenched in sour cream, I would've liked the cream on the side. The enchiladas were just bad. The chicken in them seemed to have been cooked about 2 weeks ago --did not taste fresh. I cannot comment on the drinks bc I wasn't in the mood for alcohol, (had a full evening of tequila laden drinks the night before) but they did look good. Oh and our table was sticky, seat had crumbs all over it, not the cleanest.
