Best decision ever made to go here. I chose this spot for my mom's Birthday celebration and we both loved it. The food, the atmosphere, the service were all wonderful. Highly recommend for a date night, girls night out, our just unwinding with a group of friends. Soul Food w/ Flare and Class....LOVE IT!!!!
