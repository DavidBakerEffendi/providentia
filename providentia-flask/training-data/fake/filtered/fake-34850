I celebrated my birthday at Union League Cafe last Saturday.  The food, service and ambiance were outstanding.  To top the evening off my wife called ahead to have my dessert come out with a candle and happy birthday written on the plate in chocolate sauce.  The whole evening was executed perfectly by the Union League Cafe staff.
