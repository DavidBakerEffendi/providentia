REEEEEALLY fellow Yelp reviewers - 2 Stars?!? R U KIDDING ME. You are in Robbinsville, NJ not exactly the restaurant mecca of the world and in my opinion the freshly prepared dishes, friendly service, chic decor and delicious cocktails @ Centro Grille is comparable to any TOP RATED restaurant in the state. What a gross misrepresentation of what is hands down one of the better restaurants in the area... All you can eat mussels on Tuesday, $1 oysters on Wed, Happy Hour w/ live entertainment on Thursday etc etc etc SUGGESTION(S): - Mozzarella Spring Role - Mushroom Ravioli - Ask SUPERSTAR Bartender Steve for a 34x distilled PURITY Vodka Martini Â  ENJOY.
