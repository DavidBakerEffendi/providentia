really hungry after furniture shopping today and decided to stop here. been to nearly every single 'rave' burger place but truly enjoyed the burger and cheese fries we had today. opted for the bleu cheese burger and not only was it way bigger than the already large bun, it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. cheese fries were the seasoned ones, came with tons of cheese sauce and were really crispy - eat 'em quick before the cheese sets in unless you like them like that. recommend, i will def go back there. peice was good too.
