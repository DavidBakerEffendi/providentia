It was a surprise as I ate in this location before.  The outside looks a little different from the previous Japanese restaurant that was there last time I visited 3 months ago.  The menu has changed a bit.  I ordered the grilled squid & tonkotsu ramen.  Both are just great.   I ate grilled squid before but this is the best I ever have & I strongly recommend this to anyone who are going to eat there.  Hope this info helps.
