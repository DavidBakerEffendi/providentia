i went there with my friends for dinner and i ordered a dish with Kebabs... as i cut Kebab and tasted, it was an OK taste... but what i further saw and the end results amazed me... Kebab was uncooked inside and when i told the waitress/ Owner he look at me and smile...  when i said i would like to return it... he said you already took a bite so you can't return it... when the bill came out.. they charge me for the dish... i talked to the Owner about charges... He had no explanation...i didn't care about that i paid... Owner seems nice but what a Stingy Prick... just from one bite of uncooked food... i was in the hospital... i haven't been back ever since... all I'm saying fellas is that when you eat there or anywhere just make sure their food is cooked...  All the best!!!     i could've easily sue the restaurant, ahh but what the heck...
