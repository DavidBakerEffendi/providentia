I took my college roommate visiting from DC to Fat Salmon and was really happy with the service, food, and atmosphere. Their menu had so many options and the avocado salad was relatively large and very good. They also had every Hitachino beer including their stout which is hard to find, but it was severely overpriced at $10 for 11.2 ounces. However, while the lighting was a little cheesy, we had an amazing time with great sushi, plum saki, sapporo light, and a fantastic server. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a girls night/date night/ or a group night. I also highly recommend the plum saki and their special roll, the Hako roll. SO GOOD! I will definitely be back especially considering it's great sushi for an even better price.
