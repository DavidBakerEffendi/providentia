I made an appointment for 4:30.  We got there 4:15 and checked in. at 4:45 I asked how long I would have to wait for my 4:30 reservation and I was told 30mins. wow!! what is the point of making a reservation right???  While waiting to get a table my mother saw a cockroach crawling on the wall, we were grossed out and didn bother staying to try out the food. We were excited about trying out the place but weren't excited about the little creepy crawlers. The place was too loud and very crowded. Not the best atmosphere to relax and have a conversation. The hostesses are a bit rude.
