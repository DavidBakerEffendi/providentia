I visited Green Eggs on President's Day, and was favorably impressed. The service wasn't all it could be (they forgot to put tomatoes in my omelet, and so served them on the side ??), but I was everything else was nice. The atmosphere is nice, the food was fresh, and very tasty, and not too outlandishly priced. Or at least I thought so--until we got the check! It turns out that they charge you for EACH CUP OF COFFEE. The server had not mentioned this when she asked me if I wanted a refill. So I ended up paying $4.00 for two mugs of coffee. This is a real deal-breaker for me--to nickel and dime me over an extra cup of coffee when the prices are already on the high side for a breakfast place? I hope they change their prices--if not, I think I might head over to Sabrina's instead.
