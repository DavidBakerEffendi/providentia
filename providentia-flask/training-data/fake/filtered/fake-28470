Went to Acacia for New Year's Eve dinner and it was by far one of the worse overpriced meals I've ever eaten. The duck ball appetize's were the size of oranges and tasted more like turkey than duck. The beet salad consisted of two razor thin slices of beets on a bed of spring lettuce straight from the bag, wilted with little if any dressing, a sprinkle of almond crumbs and no lentils to speak of, and tasteless goat cheese balls,  Red snapper lacked any flavor with a sweet potato croquette the size of a hockey puck - but pasty and flavorless, mahi mahi was bland, mashed potatoes  that were salty with brussel sprouts that were actually good.  We didn't stay for dessert as we decided to cut our losses.  We'll never go there again! I can't believe I've recommended this place to friends.
