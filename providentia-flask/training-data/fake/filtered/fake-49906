What can I say about City Steam? After years of stalking the elusive mug club I finally made it on. I can now drink beer cheaper and from my very own glass. I was really tired of bringing one with me all the time. The food has always been great, though I have settled into ordering the Mac n Cheese religiously now. If you don't get it with chicken and bacon you are doing something totally wrong. The beer is great. There is always something new on tap for each season. Though when in doubt the old stand-bye is the Naughty Nurse for sure. The service is always great even when the place is busy. Everyone is really friendly and if you become a regular they really take the time to know and remember the things you tend to order. The only real pain is the parking, but hey, that's Hartford for you. If you don't mind paying, usually $10 there is a lot across the street next to the Society Room that is good. If you want to brave the streets I recommend the street to either side of City Steam. You can usually find a spot there to park. There is also another lot behind the building, but I have never used it so I cannot say how good it is. I'm sure to head back there often, I've sort of invested in my mug now so I should go use it.
