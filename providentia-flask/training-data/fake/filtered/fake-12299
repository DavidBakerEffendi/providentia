Domincks is a true Passaic Valley institution. Anybody who has lived in the area for a while (West Paterson, Totowa, Wayne Valley, Little Falls, Hillcrest Paterson, knows that Domincks is one of the best pizzeria's around. One key reminder is that they don't deliver, and that is for a reason. Because they don't have to!!!! Â Open Tues to Sat. Cash Only. It's a real old school italian family run place that makes good quality simple food. Order the mushroom pie, they use real portobello mushrooms, not the canned garbage you find in most places. It can be pricey, but you get what you pay for. Keep it up Dominicks. On a side note to Brian H, you must have some type of vested interest in Casa Mia, because that place is disgusting, and is usually empty. You cant even compare them.
