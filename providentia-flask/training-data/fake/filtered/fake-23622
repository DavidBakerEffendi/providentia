Nice looking funky spot with an upstairs bar, but surely over-rated by the people who crowd into that spot every night. They had a good IPA on tap, but the signature burger had a sharp skunky cheese on it that was less than adept, and the shoe string fries, though nice with the rosemary, were so small that it was impractical to eat. Oh, yeah, and overpriced no doubt. Burger was over $20 and like I said was not good. I'd suggest that the place revamp and recharge or get out while it's still somewhat cool.
