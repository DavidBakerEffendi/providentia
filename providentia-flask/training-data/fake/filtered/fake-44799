Solid byob for a night out. Small, bustling and unpretentious - a place you go to enjoy time spent. We had the chef's choice appetizer to start. Not a bad choice on it - favorite portion was the shrimp scampi. I had the braised short rib and she the cannelloni. Both were just about right from size - I finished mine and she took the remainder to go. For desert the cherry bread pudding was our choice - I would sell my first born for seconds. The owners were great - funny and personable. Felt like I was at a crazy uncle's house - in a good way. Looking forward to going back soon.
