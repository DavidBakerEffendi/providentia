I have been coming here for years since I was little and I will no longer be giving them my service. It used to be amazing. The sandwiches were perfect ! The past few years everything has been going downhill and my last visit was the last for sure ! Jersey is known for their Taylor ham and cheese sandwiches.. I ask for it well done and they give me burnt Taylor ham and cold cheese...not to mention the sandwich wasn't even cut all the way so when I went to open it, it fell apart. The service inside is terrible. The people working there are so rude and when there's a problem they give you such an attitude. I miss the old bagel stop ! Looks like I'm taking my business elsewhere considering deli workers cannot make an easy sandwich I can make ten times better in my own kitchen !
