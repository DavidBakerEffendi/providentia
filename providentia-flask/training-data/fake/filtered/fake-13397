I had the absolute BEST experience here yesterday with my sister! The outside of the restaurant is so quaint and welcoming and the inside is design perfection. I wanted to move into the space. The attention to detail is so on par. Even the beautiful pieces of fabric that the bowls and spoons were laid on to dry were stunning. I could go on and on about then intimate interior. The meal we ate probably ranks up there on the top 5 things that I have ever eaten. I wish I took a picture or wrote down what we ate because I can't remember the names. We had a bluefish ramen noodle soup dish. The homemade noodles were delicious and the fish was delicately cooked. We had the bacon and eggs ramen that wasn't a soup based ramen but it was sauce based with a poached egg that when broken and mixed into the noodle gave it a velvety texture on the noodle. The most amazing and my favorite dish was the salmon, Camembert cheese and fish roe with thick noodles. This is probably the best thing that I have ever eaten EVER! The fish roe were soaked in lemon juice and something sweet and were the most amazing burst of flavor and mixed with the Camembert had the most unique delicious taste. I wish that I didn't live in San Diego because I haven't stopped thinking about my meal since I left and I wish I could go back and eat there right now.
