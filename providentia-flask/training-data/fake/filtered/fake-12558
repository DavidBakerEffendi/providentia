Terrible food, worse service, this restaurant won't be around long Waited nearly an hour for first dish to arrive, then had to send it back because it was cold. Don't be fooled by the cheery looking decor, Koreander is a definite miss. Plenty of great places to eat in Montclair. This will never be one of them.
