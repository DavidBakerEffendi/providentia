This restaurant had the music playing so loud that we couldn't hear each other speaking. It sounded like a dance hall and I thought it was totally inappropriate for a restaurant. The food was very overpriced and forgettable. We ordered pad thai and it tasted like wood. I have no idea why this place ranks highly but I'd never recommend anyone eat there!
