Pretentious, over priced, horrible service, and not kid friendly at all.  I first entered with my 4 year old.  We were told we couldn't bring the stroller inside.  OK, fine, it was left outside.  Waited for 15-20 minutes at the table.  Nobody came or asked us for our order.  My wife joined us with our 8 month old during this wait, and finally we had to  ask the owner if we could order something.  He said sure, walked away from us to the table next to us (who were seated long after us), and asked them if they'd like to order and started taking their order!  At that point we picked up and left.  Just plain rude! Get some high chairs, and treat your patrons like guests!
