pretty good for brunch, but better deals around. Of course, had high expectations so that's probably part of it. I am obsessed with spaghetti carbonara, and HAD to get that the particular day we went. So yummy, and totally hit the spot. My friend got the raviolo al uovo--he's obsessed with eggs, but while this dish tasted delish, it was a small portion and not very satisfying. We also tried the suckling pig ragu which was rich and complex and so delicious. The frittata blanca which my cousin got was pretty disappointing and unexciting. so overall, 2 for 4, which is not a great average. But the whole ambiance was comforting and inviting, and I have a feeling I'll be coming back to try other things on the menu
