By Far the best local high end Burrito, Quesadilla and Taco place in town.  Not only does the atmosphere make it great, its the folks that serve you...   they are awesome!   The food is simply the best in its category.  If you want to spend 8 to 10 bucks, get high quality food, and a really chill atmosphere, el Fuego is just the place.  It is far better than the Qdoba and Chipotle, especially because its local, and feels local.  There is always sports on, especially world soccer..  so if you are a soccer fan, this is perfect.  I believe the folks working there are passionate about soccer.
