I would strongly advise not to go to this place...after reading such great reviews we decided to go for a meal. We got a table fine, there is a good buzz about the place, some would say hectic but it felt good! So here comes the BUT.  The staff are awful, our waiter was SOOO rude, he asked if we wanted dumplings, I said no thanks and he walked away in a huff without asking the rest of the table - it was as if he was offended.  The spring rolls were greasy, rest of the food was average and when we asked for the bill the waiter practically threw the bill at us.  I was also sick through the night which was not the best way to start my 30th birthday...if you want bad service and the runs this place is for you otherwise I would save your time and money.
