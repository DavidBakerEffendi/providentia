First up, they got both our orders wrong, & we were overcharged. The food had no creativity to it. I could have made better at home.  My "chimichanga" burrito had pickles in it (as part of the salsa?) and was a disgrace to beans and rice everywhere. Govinda's  was more expensive than what is reasonable for a greasy takeout place. I will definitely NOT be going back.
