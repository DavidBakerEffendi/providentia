Great service.  Our waitress was very friendly and prompt.  Most of the pitfalls were with the food. Mussels appetizer was left under heating lamps too long, so a few were dried out.  The Dijon broth is also odd. Caesar salad was completely saturated in Parmesan cheese to the point where I had to abandon ship. My partner's burger completely fell apart after one bite. Very tasty fries, though. The mac and cheese is basically baked ziti sans tomato sauce.  It's just very greasy, stringy cheese with non of the creaminess you want from even baked mac. The Grant's Fashioned cocktail I ordered was basically a glass of straight bourbon.  This is great in theory, or if you want to get totally blitzed, but not so great in practice when you want a cocktail to sip with your meal.  The elements had potential, but the bartender was too heavy-handed.
