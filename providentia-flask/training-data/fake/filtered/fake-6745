Left its obnoxious neighbor, Jack the Horse Tavern, last night after being treated very poorly with 15 people and walked down the street to NOODLE PUDDING where we were welcomed on short notice with GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE.  These folks know how to think on their feet, welcome their customers and provide a delicious meal.  My advice:  RUN, don't walk, from Jack's to its far superior neighbor, NOODLE PUDDING.  Thanks everyone for a really fun evening!
