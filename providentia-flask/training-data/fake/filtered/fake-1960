I heard about the Brooklyn Crab when it was first being built but never quite made it there. this is absolutely well worth the trip. We sat indoors on the upper floor - amazing views. The windows are these cool garage-style windows. The whole vibe is awesome. I ordered the fish sandwich - delicious, moist, flakey - and i'm a hard sell on most white fish or breaded fish. My husband loved the chicken sandwich. We both had fun trying the various hotsauces available. We'll definitely try to go again and bring friends! The miniature golf in the back also looked like a lot of fun for kids. ;)
