the best Indian restaurant I hav ever been...the food is excellent and it matches south indian taste perfectly....me and my husband just love the mutton chukka dish.... the ambience is very gud and we feel like we are in our home place....the service is gud and the owner is so humble and treats everyone with equal respect.....I wish the restaurant is near to our place....last but not the least, the price is reasonable!
