Went to celebrate our son's birthday.  There were 4 of us for dinner on Sunday Aug 17th.  The staff was very friendly.  We sat upstairs and we picked our table.  The food was wonderful.  We shared about 12 plates favorites were: Fried Goat Cheese, Crispy Brussel Sprouts, lamb meatballs and octopus.  The flavors were unique.  Pace yourselves- order a few plates, enjoy them then order a few more....Our waiter was friendly and attentive.  We had Vina Ardanza with our plates.  We all enjoyed something our waiter suggested it was like a spicey ravioli.  Oh so good.   We will return!
