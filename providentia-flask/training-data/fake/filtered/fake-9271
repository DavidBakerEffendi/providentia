A downward spiral... I'm not sure if this place has changed ownership or what but every visit has gotten slowly worse. The first few times I went the food was good but the service needed some polish and the room was dark. Like, actually dark. But, there was a definite feeling of potential. As if with a little time to figure it out this place would shine. Unfortunately this has not proven out. The last time i went (which will be Â the last time) the food served to me was easily the worst meal i've ever been served. I ordered the sweet potato hash and ... ugh. There seemed to be some one elses omelet scrambled into the bottom, the over easy eggs were rock solid. I actually held them up by the edge with my fingers and they barely bent. The has itself tasted off at first bite and upon stirring the mess i was served it only got worse. Unfortunately our server never returned to check on us even once so i could give them an opportunity to make it right. The whole experience felt like something had just given up. I'll certainly be watching future reviews in the hopes that they'll find whatever passion made them open in the first place and they live up to their potential, but until then I guess i'll be waiting to get into Sneakers.
