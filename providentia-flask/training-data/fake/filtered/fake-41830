Do not go to this restaurant if you have a theater reservation or need to leave in a timely manner!   We arrived at 6.30pm for our 6.30pm reservation. We were told a table would be ready in minutes so waited at the bar. By 6.50pm we were still waiting: we warned them we had a tight schedule and needed to leave by 7.40pm and were duly promised we would be seated by 7pm. By 7.10pm we were still waiting and increasingly concerned.  At this point the manager told us that a table has become free but had been given away by mistake since they thought we were eating at the bar. We had expressly told the maître d that we were waiting for a table at the bar and she was fully aware since we kept on asking about the table - so I don't know how that happened.  No apology at all- in fact the manager argued and said he could do nothing. Nice venue, great bar staff who tried to make up for it. But steer clear if you need to get somewhere on time. They do not respect your time or reservation.
