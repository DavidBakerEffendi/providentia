Beautiful restaurant, if a bit loud when completely full. The food (we shared pizza, ravioli, smoked fish and kale appetizers) was all very good. Cocktails were excellent. All around good ambiance. We'll come back again when we happen to be near cortelyou, though probably not go out of our way to do so. I do think the prices were a touch high given the portion sizes.
