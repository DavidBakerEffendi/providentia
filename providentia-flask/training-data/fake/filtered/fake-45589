Thanksgiving Buffet was awful. Potatoes very very salty. Went there with the family had been there for THanksgiving when it was O'Connors and had no complaints.Nothing and I mean nothing was really good. Potatoes were very salty, stuffing was dry, desserts were terrible, ... they had these mini pies and they were dry and Turkey carving station gave me bones with my meat. Everyone was very very dissappointed. They should be ashamed. We ordered a pitcher of Sangria for 20.00 and that was even terrible. Never again. Previous owners did it much much better.I'll cook next year. AWFUL!!!! Doesn't desserve even 1 Star.
