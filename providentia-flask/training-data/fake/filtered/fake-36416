Neighborhood GEM!!!  The prices are super reasonable, and the food is fresh, delicious, and generously portioned! Plus- happy hour until 7pm (even Saturdays!!) with $5 wine, beer, bruschetta. I have literally gone back three times for the same black truffle pasta special. Un. Be. Lievable. And $20 for more black truffle (shaved in front of my face... so sexy!!!) than I have ever seen in my life! Paninis are excellent (vegetarian husband) and huge. The owner is a sweetheart and the staff (same two guy and gal every time I have been there) are funny and cute. Sidewalk seating! No reservations (no big deal, I have always gotten a table) and could use a few more vegetarian pasta options. Favorite new restaurant on the UES.  I hope they stay busy enough to stay open forever, and slow enough that I can still get a table! :)
