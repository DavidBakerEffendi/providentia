We had high expectations for this restaurant as we heard it received four stars.  Well, you can tell by the rating that it is definitely not!  The service was fine.  The food was dismal, tastless although presented nicely.  I personally had the Ricotta Cavatelli - with the duck ragu.  There was no duck ragu, but the duck that was there was tasteless and seemed to be on par with boiled chicken.  I ate only the cavatelli.  Other diners with me had scallops, pork chops and roasted chicken.  Of those three, the pork chops was the only good dish - but not excellent.  We had soup, the cheeseboard to share and chicken liver as appetizers (which we shared) - the soup was not hot, and needed something to bring it up to four stars, the cheese board was fine (but the server did not tell us what cheeses were presented - we recognized the blue cheese), the chutney quite tasty and was used to spice up the liver.  Desserts were fine, but the coffee was not worth drinking it was so weak, while on the other hand the double decaf espresso I ordered was only a single and so strong and bitter I was unable to drink it.  I am completely happy with a perfectly brewed espresso and was expecting a lovely taste.  Unfortunately, all in all we would never go back to this restaurant and cannot recommend it.  We had heard the quality of the food was "spotty" and we must have hit that spot!
