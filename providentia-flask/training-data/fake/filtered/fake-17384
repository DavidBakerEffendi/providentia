Burgers are average but they make a mean chicken sandwich and offer great options for toppings. The fries, Â regular or sweet potato, are very good. This is a low key place to enjoy a burger with a family style layout. Not many drink options unfortunately. The back patio is preferable in the spring and summer, so sit there if the weather is nice.
