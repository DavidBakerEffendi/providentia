Exactly what I have been looking for.  This is a great chill spot with an unpretentious crowd and atmosphere. The food is flat-out awesome.  I highly rec the mac/cheese or the cheesesteak sliders.   For 7 bucks, you can get a huge plate of either, and be on your way to drinking and having fun.   The service has always been good.  The staff has been friendly.  I laugh at the reviews below citing bad service.  This place has only been open a few weeks.  A little mistake here and there is part of the learning curve.   Great place.
