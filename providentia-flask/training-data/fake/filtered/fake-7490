As a native New Â Yorker, I am so disappointed by this attitude of the entitlement that some New Yorkers may have. It really exhibits poor grace, and we live in such a phenomenal city where we have so many cultures. We are lucky to have the tourists that builds this city's economy...These immature and unreasonable opinions clearly displays that you do not travel and are not well rounded. Also, the fact that Balthazar cares for the well -being of their guests, it shows lots of CLASS!!!! There are so many places that can care less about people and repercussions can happen....just look at the news!
