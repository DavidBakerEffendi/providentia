Myself and friends stopped by Acacia for dinner on Sunday evening. We were pleasantly surprised by the live music. It set the tone for a great meal. I go often, but my friends had never been there before. They were all blown away by the food, atmosphere and service. They swear they'll become regulars. With a liquor store only a mile away, BYOB is no problem. A hidden gem in the Princeton area.
