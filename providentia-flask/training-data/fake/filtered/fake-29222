Believe the hype. This place is gooooood! The tacos are filling, the burritos are crispy (not fried, just crisp). Everything tastes so good. So much flavor! I have dined in and gotten delivery. I enjoy dining in because the staff is great and its BYOB. They also have outdoor seating. When i ordered delivery, they forgot my rice and beans but totally made up for it when they came back with r&b plus corn (also, the owner delivered the food and was very apologetic). The food and price is just right. 5 stars!
