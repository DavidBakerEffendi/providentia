Although the food is quite good, I strongly recommend only ever eating there in-person. As is the case with many Chinese restaurants, there is a large language barrier: it is difficult to understand what the person on the phone is saying, and the person on the phone does not always understand your order. Unlike most Chinese restaurants, Su Xing will not fix its delivery order mistakes. In one order, they forgot our rice. We called asking them to deliver the rice, and we think their response was that they would fix it next time. Whatever it was, their solution was not to deliver the rice that was supposed to be part of the meal we paid for. In what became our last delivery order with them, I requested a side of white rice. Mindful of the problems with the previous order, I asked them to repeat the order back to me several times. I could not understand what was said back to me, but I thought it sounded close. Since I had repeated the order multiple times to them, I thought they probably had repeated the correct order to me. They delivered an order of vegetable fried rice, a dish I do not like (their peas are not cooked enough for my taste), and a more expensive dish. We called to tell them the delivery was wrong. They did not fix the order, they offered no refund, and they blamed the miscommunication on me. We paid for food we didn't eat. Su Xing did not care. We will not order delivery from this place again. Due to their lack of concern for their customers, we probably won't be stopping by in-person either.
