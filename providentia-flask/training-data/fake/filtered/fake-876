My husband and I haven't had a hot dog in years and so when my daughter recommended we try out Underdogs, we were not quite sure what to expect. But, we were more than pleasantly surprised when we found out that there was a veggie dog option and even more so when it turned out to be totally delicious. The Chicago Dog was reminiscent of the hot dogs I loved when I was younger, but better with fresh toppings and a really fresh gluten free roll. This is not your icky tofu pup. The spices, texture and taste were the best I have had. There were many different types of "dogs" including turkey, lamb and even a seafood sausage, all with lots of different toppings to choose from. We will definitely be back, and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a healthy, fun eating experience.
