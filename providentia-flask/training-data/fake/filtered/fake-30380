I have been here a bunch of times and it's usually pretty solid but I'm sad to say I'm not coming back. They recently "changed" their menu and to my dismay now charge extra for any sides that used to come with their entrees ($6 for a boring side salad ? No thank you). I tried to order my usual shrimp tacos and after I stated  that I'd  like a salad with that, the lady on the phone said, in an unusually chipper voice, "we now charge $6 for a side with that "! So you're increasing the price of your shrimp tacos by $6? "Yep"!  Folks, these tacos are tiny and they're $15! $15 for three mini soft tacos with nothing else?! They're appetizer sized. I'll take my business elsewhere. Fair is fair and that ain't fair.
