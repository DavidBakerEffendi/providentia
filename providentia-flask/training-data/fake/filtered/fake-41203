This is my favorite restaurant.  I got something w tempura shrimp and noodles, but there was so much flavor, it was perfect.  I did have to wait a little because it was so crowded, but the 10 minute wait was so worth it. The salad was also amazing, staff was friendly, and the peach mousse was alright.  (Just getting vanilla ice cream would be better) I definitely want to go back soon.
