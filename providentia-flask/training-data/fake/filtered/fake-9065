Hoagie Haven makes the best subs I have ever eaten. Their sandwiches are extremely creative. For example, the Heart Stop is a cheese steak hoagie with bacon and eggs. Despite their tasty creations, they do not handle large amounts of customers well. Therefore, it is advisable to go to Hoagie Haven when there will not be many people. Avoid weekend nights. A stop to Hoagie Haven is definitely worth your time
