The sausage lasagne--one of the day's specials--could not have been better!  Perfect blend of sweet & savory sauce with spicy but not-too-hot sausage, just enough ricotta, and plenty of mozzarella to hold it all together.  My companion raved about the excellent eggplant rollatini.  Best meal we've had at Angelo's!  The plain cheese pizza gets high marks too--light on the oil, not too much sauce, and very tasty.  We'll be back.
