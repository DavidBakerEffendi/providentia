I spent $9 on a pork burrito and was very disappointed by what I received.  Small, boring, and cold.  I opened it to eat within a few minutes of leaving the trailer, and it felt like it was taken straight from a fridge and wrapped up!  The tortilla was frigid, and the filling was mostly cold with a few tepid spots.  And the whole thing was a soggy mess by the time I was halfway through eating it.  For $9, they need to step it up a bit!  Might have been a fluke (most folks seem to like it), but I'm probably not going back.  I'll wait for the Misery Loves Co. truck to come back!
