The worst management I've ever come across! I walked in to get a grilled veggie hot wrap with herbed mayo (for the 2nd time because it was good the 1st time I ordered). I asked the manager who was attending the cash register for a knife, who gave it to me as if I had bothered her for it. I got home and realized there was chicken in it. Really? Chicken in a GRILLED VEGGIE wrap (Apparently they just heard the order as with chicken). I took it back and they gave me another wrap, this time I opened it in the parking lot to make sure it was right. Of course it wasn't, there were only grilled veggies with NO herbed mayo (it's advertised on the board WITH herbed mayo. I told them to cancel my order as I had been fed up by that time. So I asked for a minibagel with honey walnut cream cheese. I'm expecting a refund for the rest. She says "you can't get a refund. I threw in a second minibagel with honey walnut cream cheese." So she charged me $3 for each MINI bagel and I wouldn't even have gotten the second minibagel, I would have gotten something else. She just threw it in there. She said "you have to understand I have to throw both the wraps out." Well I say "You have to understand, tell your workers to make it right." The worst managment ever.
