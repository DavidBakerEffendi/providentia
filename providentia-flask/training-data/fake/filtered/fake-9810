My fiance and I came here for my birthday dinner.  I have to say I am somewhat disappointed.  I expected a better dining experience than we had since this place has great reviews on Yelp. We had a early dinner reservation around 5:45 pm and the restaurant was not crowded at all around that time.  However, somehow the host seated us at a wobbly table and we sat all the way close to the windows.  It was drafty all night and my fiance had to put his feet on the table legs to stabilize the table from moving too much while eating. We decided to go with the tasting menu.  The dishes were pretty good. However, one of my dishes - black bass was tad bit undercooked and I pointed out to the manager. The staffs were very friendly and they kept wishing me happy birthday.  However, the overall experience was not that great.....
