You will probably think I am exaggerating, but this is very possibly the best restaurant in NYC. How do I backup a statement this strong? Well, I can't. I'm no foodie and I haven't tried every (overhyped) superchef restaurant in the city...but this place is everything I love. Great cozy atmosphere, really caring service from a staff of one, and food that seriously makes your head spin. The bacon mac n cheese cannot be overhyped. It is a revelation. So is the crab dip...and the shrimp tacos...and the date pudding...and every special I've ever tried. Seriously just go. And then judge me for saying it's the best place in the city...and then thank me for the joy in your mouth. And then play trivial pursuit while you eat.
