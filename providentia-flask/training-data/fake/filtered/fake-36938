Petit Oven NEVER disappoints! I always love how Chef Kat takes classic dishes and makes them her own, always with the finest, local, seasonal ingredients. They oysters were as fresh as they come, the Brussels slaw was light, but very satisfying, covering all bases (flavor, texture, and sweetness, all in one bite!). We then moved on to the fried oyster appetizer...the foie gras cream sauce to dip the oysters in was very creative- I would have never thought to pair those two ingredients together, but I'm glad Kat was brave enough to, because it was the perfect combination! The salmon entree had a "potato chip" crisp skin that was supperb! The bouillabaisse was sublime! Fresh seafood, in a light, garlicky broth with potatoes and crispy bread, and of course, what makes a great bouillabaisse (IMO) is the rouille (a garlic-saffron emulsion that is supposed to infuse into the broth of the bouillabaisse as you eat each bite) made me feel as though I was in Provence for the evening. Having washed it all down with a delicious Ros√©, the bread pudding and apple-cranberry crepe desserts came and we DEMOLISHED both desserts! I wish I had something to complain about, but this restaurant is just THAT good! Can't wait to come back! Thank you, Nicole and Kat, for another memorable dining experience!
