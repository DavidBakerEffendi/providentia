My girlfriend and I stopped in for sandwiches and a couple beers with a friend after following his recommendation. The three sandwiches we ordered were all delicious--not the best, but certainly unique, very tasty, and filling. Maybe a bit expensive, but $15 for a good sandwich and a good beer isn't outrageous. I would have given it 4 stars, but as we were leaving the owner insisted that we take some cookies (very good as well), and then gave us an "extra" sandwich that somebody ordered and never picked up. The owner and the one girl working behind the counter were both friendly, and they were more than happy to tell us what was in each sandwich, so no problems there. All in all, we got some good food, a couple drinks, an extra sandwich, free cookies, and were in and out fairly quickly. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Burlington.
