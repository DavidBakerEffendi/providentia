My friend and I bought a 30 for 60 groupon. We were unsure going in, but the experience far exceeded our expectations.  The food was cooked to perfection. From the tandoori selections we got cilantro chicken which was the hit of the night. The flavor was outrageous. The server brought it out on a sizzling plate and the sautéed onions (still sizzzzlin' at the table) were to die for.  We also got some chicken masala and out of mild medium or spicy we went spicy.  It was soo good...especially mixed in with the rice and scooped up with naan. Our last dish was veggie korma, medium spice. The taste was amazing. Overall friendly service, beautiful decor, and dishes did not leave me feeling weighed down at all. I was shocked by how good this place was after experiencing so many good Indian food restaurants in the Hartford area. The reason for this extensive yelp is because I felt bad for using the groupon!! Haha. I dont usually do this but all things considered im giving this restaurant (which I learned is under relatively new ownership) 5 out of 5 stars.
