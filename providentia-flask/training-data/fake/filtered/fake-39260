Went here over the weekend on a date.  Place was chill.  The girl I was with seemed comfortable and impressed.  I guess that's a weird way of saying it was a great spot for dinner.  We had the rice balls and chicken parm and chicken marsala.  Food was tasty.  I love old school Italian and it rocked that.  I got a kiss at the end of the night.  So... that gets Galli an extra star.
