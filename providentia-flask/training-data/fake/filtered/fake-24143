I'm not one for ramen shops or noodle bars, primarily because I think that I make a great home made ramen and find it hard to justify paying so much for it but this is the first time I was surprised, amazed and left longing for more when done with my meal.  I've tried Momofuku Noodle Bar (HUGE disappointment), Totto and Setagaya before finally finding this gem.  All were quite disappointment for a multitude of reasons.  I had pretty much given up on trying any more ramen spots but since my wife is such a ramen lover, she brought me to Minca and it was an amazing revelation.  The place is small, the service is great and the kitchen staff all greet their customers coming and going.  I ordered the spicy ramen and it was spectacular.  Not too salty, just enough spiciness, and the noodles were perfectly al dente.  The pork, mushroom and other garnishes were fantastic.  Bottom line, I think I'm probably the hardest person to please when it comes to paying nearly $13 for ramen but Minca has given me a reason to look forward to eating ramen outside my own home.
