one star i for the friendly ppl that work there. whoever owns this place needs to use fresh oil for those fries man. i mean it's right in front of you, when they fry ur fries. the oil was black as if it was used diesel oil or something. that dirty oil destroys the taste of the potatoes.. i went here twice and i dont go back becuz i always see how dirty their oil is. and the other star is because they have good sauces.
