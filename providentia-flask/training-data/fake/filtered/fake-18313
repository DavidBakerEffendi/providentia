Do you like eating meat faces?  Do you ever watch YouTube videos of frolicking sheep and think, "I could just devour that sheep's entire head myself."  Finally, a restaurant where you won't be judged for these eccentric proclivities.  A restaurant where a terrific and extensive beer list is matched with meat prepared as it should be, indelicately and in giant slabs.  Yum! You wouldn't expect an artisanal hole in the wall in this bro-ey part of Murray Hill.  It's just a counter, where you come face to face with your enlightened meat and beer hosts, who are eager to facilitate scrumptious pairing of face and obscure Belgian IPA's.  Yum, again. We've been here three times and we're getting close to having consumed an entire animal, though they haven't had foot on the menu yet.   We realize each time we talk about these seemingly odd dishes it might turn you off.  But you owe it to yourself to try every sinew that this restaurant has to offer (but even if you come under unclear pretenses, thinking you could get bolognaise, thinking that you would play footsie under the bar, they still have a phenomenal, and giant, steak). We realize this was kind of rambly, but you should go to Cannibal poste haste.  Q/X out.
