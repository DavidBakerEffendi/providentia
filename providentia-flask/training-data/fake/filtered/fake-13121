STUFFED BREADS Alert! As I am not originally from around here, this whole business of stuffed breads was new to me.  I mean I know and love calzones but never knew it went further than that.   I have tried a few (including from businesses on Orange St) but it was not until I tried Aniello's that I went out of my mind.  These are divine and so reasonable for the size (around $7 I think).  The best (and only ones I've tried) are ham, cheese, tomato, spinach and cheese and eggplant.  Oh yum!  They always have them on hand ready to go cold or you can call ahead (or wait when you are there) and have them heat it up in the big oven.  I have bought these several times for lunch when having people over and with a salad to accompany are always a hit.  Very easy.  Enjoy!
