The first time I had your food, a coworker ordered it and it was wonderful, so I was excited to go there in person.  Getting there today, I was pretty nauseated to see that the bathroom and outsides of the kitchen machinery were filthy.  The orders took a long time and then came out wrong - my Doctor sandwich came out with horseradish mayo instead of the honey mustard on the menu and with tomatoes and without lettuce even though I had requested the opposite.  The turkey was skimpy and the sandwich was too heavy on bacon.  Yikes!  After you've deepcleaned and improved your staff, let me know and I'll try again.
