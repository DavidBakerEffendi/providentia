I grew up in New York and have been to the best of the delis there. Spent time in Montreal and had the best of the "smoked meat" sandwiches there. I had a pastrami on rye with mustard at Hershel's yesterday that was the BEST I'VE EVER HAD!! It's a heart attack on a plate, so not for daily fare, but the meat was tender, flavorful, a beautiful shade of red, not over seasoned, cut in front of me, piled high on the bread, and served warm. You owe it to yourself to have one of these at least once in your life, but like Lay's potato chips used to say, "Nobody can eat just one."
