New York is arguably the best overall city in the US for dining and Yasuda simply fortifies that belief.  Came to New York for a conference and my wife heard rave reviews about this place from friends and co-workers so we had to check it out.  Outstanding cuisine - with the sushi being fresh and beautifully arranged.  We talked with several other patrons who all agreed; one gentleman said this is the best place for sushi he's ever been to (that's a bit pretentious - I know some places in Tokyo which could rival it!).  Nevertheless, you get the picture:  a great restaurant.  Considered pricey, but if you plan out your meal carefully enough (and don't get too carried away), it can be reasonable.
