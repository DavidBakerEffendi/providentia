Arriving at 6:00 PM there was no wait and we were immediately seated. Thirty minutes later the restaurant was packed with wait times of 30-60 minutes. I suggest you to come early if you want to avoid the crowd. The restaurant is not very responsive to reservations unless you have a large party. Splitting 4 entrees with my fellow friends we got a diverse taste of the different dishes offered at this restaurant. Coming here based on the recommendation by yelp, I did have high expectations for being "the best thai place in NYC". Sadly I don't see what the big hype is about this restaurant. The pad thai was lacking and consisted of a heavy tomato/ketchup based taste. Our other entrees were good but not outstanding as many people make it seem. There are much better thai food places than this one.
