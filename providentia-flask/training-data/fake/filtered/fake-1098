Cute atmosphere.  (I like the original Continental better though.)  The brunch menu varies with lots of goodness.  At first, I couldn't decide on what I wanted but I went a favorite of mine, the turkey club.  I had the Continental salad with it instead of fries since they don't serve the shoe string fries.  Oh my, the shoestring fries with the dipping mustard is to die for but you can only get them at the Market St. Continental.  Both restaurants serve LaColombe coffee, thanks Todd for conceiving such a wonderful cup of Joe!  The first time I ever had LaColombe was years ago at the original Continental and I have never turned back.  :) lacolombe.com
