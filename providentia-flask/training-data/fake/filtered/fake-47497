SHOCKINGLY AWFUL.  1) Waiters slow and rude. 2) We asked for OLIVES and got ONIONS.  3) The onions made the crust completely SOGGY and like glue. 4) We also asked for mushrooms, which were TINY SLIVERS, almost invisible and gave NO FLAVOR.  5) HORRIBLE WINE.  6)  Music so LOUD we could not have a conversation without saying WHAT? 5 times.  7)  One of the staff came and took one of our party's coats and threw it on a coat rack by the door.  Didn't even ASK who it belonged to. When our older friend came back from the embarrassing bathroom, he completely freaked out, thinking it had been stolen.  No one had seen the man take it.  The reputation, and the line (which we blessedly missed) are AMAZING and WRONG.  It seems that once people HEAR someplace is great, that's it.  But this place SUCKS.
