Fat Salmon was incredible! I went for lunch with my friend. We both did the $14.50 lunch combination special. Usually with the lunch special the roll selection is not great, but here it was awesome. The sushi was so delicious (better than Zama in my opinion) and for $14.50 for two great rolls and a salad, you can't beat that. The service was excellent as well! I will def be back.
