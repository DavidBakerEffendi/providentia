I spend a lot of time on business in Southern California, Arizona & New Mexico so I feel that I become very accustomed to authentic Mexican food.  That being said, after dining at Las Bugambilias for the third time, I am very happy with the food at this restaurant.  Although, since I have been exposed to so much Mexican food, I have developed a bit of "fire-proof" stomach and a few of the dishes here could use a bit more kick but I think that's just me.  My wife thinks there is plenty of spice. One note of real praise - the Mexican hot chocolate is a must for me every time I am there!! The only reason for no 5th star is that the restaurant is indeed very small/cramped but that is really just due to location.
