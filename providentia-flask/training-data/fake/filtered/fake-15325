Speakeasy-vibe bar with lots of food options.  Probably one of the best places for mixology at this price range in Brooklyn.  Their wine and beer options are a bit limited but still cover a lot of bases.  I'd really recommend the cocktails here, though.  Excellent $1 oyster special.  A quite, hidden place that's one of the gems in the growing Bushwick bar/restaurant scene.
