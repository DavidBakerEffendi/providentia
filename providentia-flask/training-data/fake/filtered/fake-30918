Just returned from "Jimmies of Savin Rock" and can only summarize my experience by saying...disgusting food and very poor service.  I do not recommend this place at all.  If you dine out and expect a decent customer experience, this is definitely not the place to spend your money.  Dont waste your money or time at "Jimmies of Savin Rock".  They just don't get the idea that good food and the customer IS important.
