A good solid bar pie, thin crust.   A must try is the Lombardis platter.   It can be a bit noisy but hey your going to a bar Restaurant what do you expect.   I am amazed by the amount of complaints about this in these type of establishments.   Show me a quiet bar and I'll show you a bar with no customers or a place with a bunch of old men just wasting there days away.   All in all, I recommend Lombardies to anyone looking for a good thin crust pie.
