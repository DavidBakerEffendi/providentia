This rest is right off a J and Z train station. Me and my gf walked right pass this little place and almost couldn't find it. But other than the obscure entrance, the food and atmosphere was pretty good. Entrees were 15-20 bucks. Service was good. Atmosphere was decent. Bathroom a little below average. The wait for the food took a little while but it was worth it. There was a live band next to us too. 4 stars.
