I can also say great things about this restaurant. i went with the Park Slope Dinner Club, a group of friends that gather and enjoy the great food in our neighborhood and all of us were amazed. The highlight for me was the cocktail - one of the very best I have ever had. The fish was also stupendous. And the service superb. There are a lot of allergies and dietary restrictions between us and the they were super accommodating and flexible. The only thing not positive that I can say was that the restaurant got very loud and at times it was hard to hear over the din. That said, with such great atmosphere, food, and spirits who really needs conversation?
