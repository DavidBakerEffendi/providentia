I was very disappointed with my experience today.  This is my third time at this restaurant. I took my husband there for lunch on Veterans Day because I wanted him to sample the food and make the place our Thursday/Friday night out. The waitress, after seating us and after we've been looking at the menus for a long time and was ready to order informs us that "they aren't doing lunch specials today."   Despite it being within the normal time period for lunch specials, they had a tiny tiny message on the menu that said "not available on holidays".  We should have been informed of this fact up front, that being said we decided to make the best of it. We ended up ordering off the dinner menu, which, we did not mind.  The food was good, I ordered Chicken Pattaya Ginger and my husband had Chicken Basil Fried. Rice did not come with my food had to order a bowl of rice. Our check came to $51 for lunch, a $25 lunch at some of the restaurants that we have visited would be a deal.  So I am annoyed  ESPECIALLY more than anything being charged for rice.   Maybe this is common some places, but I don't remember the last time I was charged for rice in a Thai restaurant. To add to it all a tip of 15% was added to our check, this is also a tiny tiny message in their menu. I will not eat there again and I will let my friends know.
