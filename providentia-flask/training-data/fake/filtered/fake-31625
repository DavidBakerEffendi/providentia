Went in this morning for a first time. The barista behind Â counter did not even greet me. She looked like she just woke up under the counter. When I asked her a question she mumbled something I had to ask her again to repeat herself. When I thanked her for the beverage she did not even acknowledge me. Coffee is for 10, service not so much. 02/06/2013
