I dont really understand how can people go to places like this living in NYC. Expensive, just normal food and deco is so ugly. I have the feeling just for the sake of being in Upper East is at least twice the price you would get anywhere else. Mediocre sandwich, mediocre tuna salad, same for a simple coffee for which u have to pay 5 buck??? Hello??
