El Vez = El Fun! Great food, fun atmosphere and yummy drinks. Sure, it's a Stephen Starr "production" so you can expect the crowds and the hype, but why not relax and just roll with it. The nachos are great for sharing with the table while you sip on a drink and watch the crowd go by. Undeniably, this is a great spot for people watching.
