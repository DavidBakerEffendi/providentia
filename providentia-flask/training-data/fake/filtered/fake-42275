So I searched online for the best places to eat in chinatown. Prosperity dumpling gets tons of positive reviews. BUT- -If you're looking for clean (or even cleanish) -somewhere to sit- its a glorified store front stand not a restaurant. There was one old folding table and two dumpster dive chairs on the sidewalk. -somewhere you can even stand without feeling claustrophobic or feel as if you can breathe the air. -anyone friendly THEN SKIP THIS PLACE! We got there and were underwhelmed and skeeved out. There was another couple with their phone out in front. We just looked at each other and commiserated that we both followed reviews but no way were we trying it. The dumplings might be great. They might be cheap. But this should be known as take out only and only if the condition of the place won't deter you. Our group didn't want to risk it. Neither did the couple we ran into. We wished each other luck and cleared out. Still searching for a good, clean, sit down restaurant in Chinatown.....I'll post when we find it! -
