i personally like Effies place because of there great food and homely style. They have breakfast all day I like this because I am a breakfast person and I am not the lunch type. The atmosphere is great there is also a very lovely outdoor area with lots of plants which I personally like. They have also added a guitarist to play outside in the patio every Thursday afternoon. If you are ever to go there I recommend for you to ask for Roberto to attend you he is very helpful and kind :)
