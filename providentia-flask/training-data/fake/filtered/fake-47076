What's a true wonder is how this stingy little place has so many good reviews. The eggs were hard, the portions small and fattening, and despite a trendy limited menu, it's gimmicky, w/ few if any moderately healthy choices. The waiter was a creep, wouldn't give me a bit more coffee to heat up a cold cup (Everyone does that!). And then came for the tip without clearing a thing from the table. For a cash-only place overpriced. And why does my receipt have the name of another restaurant on it?
