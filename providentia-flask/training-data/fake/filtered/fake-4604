I LOVED this place!! We came here for our 11th Anniversary because when I googled "romantic places in NYC" this was in the top 10. And it claimed to have an outdoor garden area to eat. The decor was fabulous with beautiful flowers everywhere and the waiters were attentive and polite. We had the patatas bravas which were phenomenal, the goat cheese foie gras which was an orgasm in the mouth, and shared the veggie rice dish. The wine was good- was it $45 worth of good? Meh. But I was super happy with the place and that's all that counts. I didn't give it 5 stars because the roof of the "outdoor garden" had a cover so it didn't feel much like dining al fresco. I don't know why they did that...maybe to prevent birds from crapping on us? Still...a fabulous place I would recommend to anyone.
