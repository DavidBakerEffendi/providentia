I guess my review didn't post last night. The bartender working last night is extremely rude! Seriously, just get that guy outta there. This is my neighborhood go to and I would hate to switch it up. I simply asked him what song was playing and he was super nasty about it. I was the third patron there, it would have hardly been a hardship for him. Then as I was leaving he remarked on how happy he was that I was taking my leave. He was clearly drunk and just being unnecessarily nasty. Like I said, why would you have someone like that working there. You should clone Austin so that he can work every night. He's awesome!
