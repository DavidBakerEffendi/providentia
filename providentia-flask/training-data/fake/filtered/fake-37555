I really like this place. Everything about it! I haven't been here in a while, unfortunately, BUT I just created a yelp profile and wanted to write reviews for my favorite and least favorite restaurants, and this is one of my favorites. Yelp has helped me find some of my favorite places, including this one, so it is only fair if I return the favor by adding my review to help someone else find this fabulous place. =) I would definitely get the Falafel if you end up coming here, amazing! I recommend the Popeye Falafel, so good! And of course, the pickles are so delicious, as expected. Everything here is so good, and you can tell they truly care about their restaurant.
