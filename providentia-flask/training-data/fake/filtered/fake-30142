We have passed this restaurant often, but never went in until tonight after reading yelp comments. ..have to tell you they did not exaggerate. The food was delicious. I had the special homemade ravioli stuffed with salmon and robiola cheese topped with mushrooms and truffle oil..omg!! My husband had the Linguine Nere frutii de mare ...exceptional ...we ended with an expresso ,  cappuccino and a home made strawberry napoleon. ..to die for!! We will come back for the brick oven pizza that smells delicious. Service was good, and the price reasonable, especially for the quality of food. Did I mention they deliver! !  One of the other great thing is you can bring your own wine..no corkage charge.  Great new find.
