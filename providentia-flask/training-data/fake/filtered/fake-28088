My favorite place in all of Philadelphia.  I highly recommend the pernil asado (pork) and patata bravas along with the gambas al alijo (garlic shrimp).  You will not find friendlier staff nor better eats in Society Hill and I dare say all of Philly.  There is a little something for everyone including a large selection of veggie dishes.  We live around the corner and love to pop in on a weeknight to grab a spot at the back bar.  Their seasonal cocktail menu is superb.  Amada can't be beat.
