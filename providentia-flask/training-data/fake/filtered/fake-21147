I used to go there quite often, very close to my home. All of a sudden it was closed down. From the reviews I read, perhaps that was the problem, although I had hardly any complaints. Too bad I miss going there. Met some nice people and the staff was pleasant and helpful. Guess the problem was in the kitchen. A great chef is the main attraction, you get what you pay for!!!!!
