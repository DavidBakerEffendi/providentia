This is, by far, the best restaurant in the area.  Seven of us went and each of our meals were delicious.  Not a single complaint about any of the food,. all were complete raves from the appetizers to the dessert.. I would love to know where the owners found this chef because he prepared the most amazing meal I have ever had.. The menu was fixed priced. We all chose the 3 course meals @ $52.  There was also a 5 course meal for $80ish. The appetizers were wonderful...pork belly, scallops, gnocchi, soft shell crabs were all mouthwatering.  The entrees were even better...duck, lobster, and filet mignon all of which melted in your mouth.  the toffee cake dessert was scrumptious.  The presentation of every plate was consistently beautiful. We ate everything and were stuffed, (actually had to force down the dessert, but just couldn't pass it up) so the portion sizes were spot on.   The service was impeccable. The tables were set correctly,  The waiters and waitresses were dressed appropriately, friendly, knowledgeable, served correctly, and extremely attentive without ever making us feel hovered over or at all rushed.  Our water glasses were always full without ever having to ask and the only time our bread dishes were empty was by our own design. The decor was luxurious too.  The chairs were comfortable, the ambiance so pleasant and relaxing, the ceiling was a delight. Parking was by valet, not a problem at all, and we were there on a Friday night. Given the very high quality of food, service and surroundings the menu pricing was extraordinarily reasonable.  I'm thrilled that, in my opinion, the Princeton/Lawrenceville/Trenton/Central New Jersey area finally has a restaurant with a much deserved  5-star rating. I will definitely be back with large groups for special occasions and with smaller parties for intimate, fine-dining experiences.  Thank you so much, Peacock Inn!
