I like to think of myself as an articulate person, but I just can't describe how much I love this menu. If I was designing one for my own restaurant I don't think I could do better. The salads are the most memorable part for me, and I am definitely not a salad person. But the beet with arugla and goat cheese blew me away and I salivate when I think about the grilled watermelon and feta salad. My favorite thing here is hands down the fishtown stew, which is saying a lot because I'm a big fan of salmon BLTs and they do a great one. Service is excellent, food is excellent, location is excellent. I always leave wishing I could have tipped more, or high-fived the chef or something.
