The food here is good, but I would strongly recommend getting it to go because the service is terrible. The time I went with a few friends, we were the only people eating in and the waiter acted impersonal and rude. He never came to check up on us or refill our glasses even though we were literally the only customers in the restaurant. What's more. at the end of the meal, when my friend gave him a tip, he asked, "Is the food not good?" When she asked why, he said, "The tip is too low." I've never heard a waiter complaining directly to a customer that the tip was too low. Having worked in the food service industry myself, I nor anyone else I know would ever say that to a customer's face. We considered leaving him no tip since he was such a bad server, but my friend was gracious enough to leave him something and that was what he said to her. Again, the food is good, but never eat in here. While we were eating, we saw several people come in just to pick up the food they ordered and leave. Now I can see why they did that.
