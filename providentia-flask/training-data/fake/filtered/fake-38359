To whomever this concerns, Some of you claim to have consumed a large amount of sushi in your lifetime however, that proves nothing. You might have consumed terrible sushi for your whole life and/or just decided somewhere along the line that a certain flavor or temperature is the "right" setting for that meal. You fail to stop for a moment to think, "hmmm, maybe I'm not a sushi analyst, nor have I ever been taught what sushi should really taste like". I personally know the store owner and I know for a fact that he is a very generous and honest man that has made sushi for almost his whole life in America. He does his own job, and on top of that, he looks to innovate his food. I have personally gone there and I've been eating sushi regularly ever since i was a "wee lad" and I can tell you for a fact that the sushi here is not bad at all. It is very fresh and good. I know this also because I have personally been trained to know what is good and bad sushi from several experts that are friends of my family. There you go. Also to the person that complained about delivery having a minimum charge, you must be new to the world of delivered foods. think about it this way. would you want to deliver someone like 6 pcs of sushi thats worth like 5-7 bucks to a snotty person like you? i thought not. in almost any food place that delivers, there is minimum fee. the food is good the price is good and guys, all this man wants to do is make people happy with his good sushi. go and have a good time eating great food. :)
