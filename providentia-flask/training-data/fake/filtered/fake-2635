Pio Pio Riko "the best Peruvian rotisserie chicken." I kid you not, this is not an understatement. I gave this place a try based off a recommendation of a friend and ordered the quarter rotisserie chicken with rice and beans. Hands down the main attraction here is the chicken. It was tender, juicy, and flavorful and I was honestly taken aback by this delightful combination. The rice and beans were good as well but I was more focused on the chicken. Â  The portions here are large; you can split your meal in half and save it for the next day. Customer service is good and the price is right. $6.50 for lunch in Manhattan and no attitude... rare commodity.
