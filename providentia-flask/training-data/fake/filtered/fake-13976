This is the home of the most phenomenal dessert I've ever had in my life.  It's called the Salted Caramel Budino.  You literally get high from it, it's a total body experience.  One time I literally fainted at Barbuzzo and the Budino brought me back to life.    Everyone order your own! It's seems like you'll want to share it but you really won't. I also highly recommend the Late Night Happy Hours!  Starts at 10:30 PM and includes a good selection of Barbuzzo faves for a reasonable price.
