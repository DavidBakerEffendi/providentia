What I liked the most about RATS is the  unique  beautiful peaceful setting. Each room is beautiful and the outside pond and sculpture peaceful and lovely.  I only went there for lunch   - the selections were an interesting mix.  The food was good not excellent. I was not a fan of the onion soup, the special mushroom soup was much more interesting. The home made pasta was good but not outstanding. That being said - I did enjoy my meal. I found the surroundings special and soothing . Have to say , I had tried to make an earlier reservation and they were booked but when we went past at that time it was almost empty. That bothered me a bit. We easily got a table by walking in earlier.  I hate the name !
