was there on 6/29/13 my husband and my daughter got there about 9:30.  it is very pretty inside.  we had clams casino definately very sandy and tough.   the asian scallops on the specials menu very good.  the pork lollipops in yougurt sauce aahhh so so.  the comment about craft beer is true its all budweiser products and japanese beer??? how about sam adams, brooklyn lager, bronx ale?  michelob corona heineken they are almost unheard of today with all the craft beer.  anyway we did not order dinner just too late and the appetizers were enough. however dont order apps and dinner at once i see the food is pushed and rushed.  it s an uncomfortable feeling.  we were asked 7 times are we ready to order dinner when clearly we had not picked up our menus since serving of apps. nice for a drink  but very very pushy.
