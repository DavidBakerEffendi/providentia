I live around the corner from this new cafe.  I have eaten at Green Eggs three times, and regularly hang out in the lounge area with my morning coffee.  Throughout the renovation of the building, I have anticipated the grand opening.  I am happy to say that my experiences at this new neighborhood spot have been well worth the wait. On all three occasions, I ate with groups of people, and was able to have a taste of everyone's meal.  Of 12 items, I liked 11.  There are no restaurants in this neighborhood (or beyond) where I could say the same thing.  This is particularly impressive because they have only been open for a few weeks.  The coffee is strong and good, and they keep filling your cup. The menu offers a lot of choices, but it is not overwhelming.  The omelet was fresh and delightful.  The pancakes were hard to stop eating.  The breakfast burrito (which I usually consider a dull choice) was so special.  The mixed sweet potato fries were a welcome surprise, and perfectly done.  No one ordered "the kitchen sink" but I have heard many others talk about how amazing it is.  It just looked too big for one person.  The one item I didn't work for me was a souped up BLT that a friend ordered.  He also noted the lack of interesting vegetarian options. I think it's important to try a place a few times (especially when it is new) before you write a review. In regard to "floaters" in water glasses: I have worked in a dozen Philadelphia restaurants in 20 years and have experienced an imperfect water glass at everyone of them.  This is a measure of nothing.  Simply (and politely) ask for a new glass, and move on. Greeen Eggs is a great combination of a magical physical location, nice people, and great food.
