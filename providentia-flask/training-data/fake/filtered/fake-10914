I have been a customer at Domenic's for the last 15 years normally eating there once a week.  Additionally, I have had many parties there over the years as well.  In the past the atmosphere has been warm and friendly, recently it seems that things have changed.  In the past (since I am at the restraurant frequently) the staff would all come over and speak to me, now it appears that they were told not to do so unless they are your waiter/waitress. Interacting with the staff in addition to the quality food is the primarily reason I have enjoyed this restaurant over the years.  Although the food is a better quality than most chain restaurants, it seems that the atmosphere is trending toward an Olive Garden.
