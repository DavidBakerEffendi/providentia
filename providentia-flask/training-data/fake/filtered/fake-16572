first of all; I was bewildered by witnessing authentic middle eastern cafe making such good progress in west Philadelphia! I stepped into the outragesly packed cafe yet to see  glamorous  decor and shining deserts which resembled jewels. Various items from syurp dipped fried dough, numerous types of freshly baked cookies, and several types of baklava. That was just the deserts. Over on the savory side I was welcomed warmley by manakeesh's manager (Abed Ghazzawi). I went for shawarmah, so I can tast a srait up Lebanese dish. After one bite the sandwich and were making love. The fresh tomatoes, onion, and a touch of parsley worked to perfection with tahini sause, warm soft bread, and excellently spiced meat. From me manakeesh deserves  much more than five stars.
