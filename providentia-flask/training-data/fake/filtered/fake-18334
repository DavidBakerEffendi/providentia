i ordered  fried calamari and a burger the calamari tasted like rubber bands and the hamburger was nothing to talk about , the wait staff was standoffish ,this restaurant is more concerned  about the making money at bar then good quality food, i guess if your wasted the taste of the food doesn't matter ,typical church street
