The chicken tenders are very fresh and not too salty or over-seasoned.  They were a big hit with my kids as well.  We also had the potato slices, which were all delicious and nicely seasoned.  When I went to pick up my food, the credit card machine was broken and I didn't have cash on me.  I went to leave to find an ATM and the owner brought the food out to my car, saying that I could just bring the payment by tomorrow...after all, I'm a neighbor.  We've ordered a few times and the food is always fresh and tasty, but now they have a customer for life.  Hard to find that type of trust and kindness these days.  Please patronize this restaurant!
