This place is wonderful. Yes, the food is terrific and the prices are lower than they should be, but the staff is also one of the friendliest in Philadelphia: fun, cool people. The atmosphere alone makes this one of the most pleasant spots to spend an evening in the city. Seriously, if you haven't eaten here, you've really missed a special experience.
