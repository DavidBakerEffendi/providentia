I chose another Chinese food Â restaurant a block down from this spot and I threw my entire meal in the trash it was so bad. Lotus will have my $$ anytime I have the taste for Chinese. The food had great flavor and the restaurant was clean and did not look like your regular Chinese restaurant. I had beef and broccoli and hope to try many other dishes... Here is their website. chineseline.com
