I never wrote any review for any restaurant before, but for Amalia's cafe I'm doing it. I love this place !!!  A very friendly ambiance. I love the people over there. I went there several times, I used to eat and enjoy Falafel (sandwich or platters) and the Middle Eastern cookie or the delicious tiramisu  cake (Yes ! the tiramisu is amazing !! ) I recommend this restaurant for all people (Family, group of friends or lovers). We finally have a great Middle Eastern restaurant in south Philly !!!
