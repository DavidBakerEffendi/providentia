Have mixed feelings about this place. The space is great, very homely yet not too rustic, just the perfect blend to make one feel comftable. The food thou, is another thing. Knowing this cuisine, it's just outright lying, calling menu items what they are. I ordered Hummus Masabacha, and after thousands of those in the past, all around the world, this is NOT a hummus masabach. It was tasty, just not hummus. This also goes for the Shakshuka other people in my table ordered, or the Fatush. It wasnt a veriation of the plate, just something very different. I felt disappointed
