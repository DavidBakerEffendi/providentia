We ordered take out for our typical Friday lunch. the food was okay, a little pricey. Upon reviewing the bill , we noticed we were charged twice for tax, also they overcharged one of the meals. We notified the establishment and the girl said she was going to tell the manager. for reimbursement. I mentioned that the driver made an additional $4.00 dollar tip on top of the $3.00 dollar delivery charge so returning the overcharged amount shouldn't be an issue. Of course, it was not returned. We will not be ordering there again and all be aware.
