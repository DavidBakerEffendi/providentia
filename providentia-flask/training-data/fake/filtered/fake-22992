The worst Indian food we ever had. I picked up this place for a friend's anniversary and completely regret. Â The Uthappam and paneer dosa were bad, the chicken and gobhi manchurian were even worse with taste of cheap oil, and worst was Gulab Jamun were served in a bowl with Garlic smell. When we complained, they did nothing about it and just put the same gulab jamun in another bowl. Worst chef and poor management. The only good thing was the helpless server was at least nice and polite, who couldn't help much. He was probably himself thinking why did you select this restaurant. Avoid this place.
