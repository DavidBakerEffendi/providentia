While the vibe is relaxed and open, the food is surely a "meh" and also, not nearly hot enough. The problem today but the tepid temps indicate a lot of reheating in the microwave. Folks next to me had cold soup, my curry was on the cool side, and my table mate had an expensive small salad, surely not worth the price tag. The chix in my curry was not worthy of a star but of the trash -- cut up thigh meet filled with those gruesome fatty and gristly bits that make you gag a little...or in my case, making it inedible. I saw the burger and wished I'd ordered that -- it at least looked hot.
