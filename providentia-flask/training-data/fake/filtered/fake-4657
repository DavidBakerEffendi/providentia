Been to Rouge a couple of times, but recently noticed that it has gone downhill considerably.  We were grossly overcharged for a beer and a glass of wine.  Had to get the manager to straighten things out.  And watch out if you pay in cash.  They round UP to the nearest dollar (our bill of $26.40 was rounded up to $27.00).  Also the waitstaff in general are rude and unfriendly.  Don't bother to go here when there are so  many other worthwhile places in the area to spend your money.
