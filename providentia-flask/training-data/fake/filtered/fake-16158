This is my favorite restaurant in NYC. Did I say.....love love love love love... Always my fave recommend! The food was so good! I had the Kimolos Greek Salad, a mix of delicious veggies on focaccia, paired with a Riesling.  This was a great combination on a warm summer day; I must also mention the melon mimosa.  This cocktail is such a simple idea, but so refreshing and good. (Watermelon Juice mixed with champagne)  All the other food choices looked delicious and next time I want to try the Moroccan Couscous! Roasted Organic Chicken :$11.50:: Chipotle Mayonnaise, Roasted Tomatoes. Simple but definitely hits the spot. I love Cafe Gitane :)
