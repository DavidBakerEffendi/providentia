hi my name is chef P Ramos and i have  alot to say about Bridgid's restaurant, i am really picky were i go to eat. thank god my wife chose this place to eat, this  little gem of a place has one of the finest foods i have ever tasted, iam not a bar person although i have been to other bar restaurants this place is by far the best!!!!!  i traveled to other countries and all over the united states  and have eaten in many well known bar restaurants  and left disappointed . well  7 of us set out to our little adventure to Philadelphia and before we went to eastern state penitentiary we had reservations at Bridgids as soon as we went in everyone was friendly we all placed our orders with a wonderful beautiful enthusiastic  waitress named Brook she helped us all with our orders. she  made many great suggestions to us because the section was really good and we would of ordered all of them each , BRook our waitress has a great passion for food and has a lot of knowledge on the food they sell.i was very impressed with her. believe me when i tell you it takes a lot to impress me a pretty face is not one of them to impress me, you have to be good at what you do and personality is one of them .well then the food comes out everything looked awesome our mouths were drooling over the food and we haven't even tasted it yet , bite after bite every one on the table stared to share  some of us who are not daring even tasted the other food, i have to say the food left me speechless what passion and love that goes into the food the chef just puts his heart and soul into the food and its an explosion of flavors that shocks your brain and palette. the price of the food was well worth it.thank god they are not in new york we would have to pay triple the price from great food like this... very reasonable price George  is another great guy there he greet you like you are a regular everyone at Bridgid's made me a happy chef   my whole group was more than happy we all left there very impressed.they take pride  in their food and service everyone  there should be very proud of themselves.                                                                   they are so good i put this place on my group page i will be back there to eat again when ever i go to Philadelphia                                                                    yours truly                                                                                   CHEF P RAMOS facebook.com/ontou?fref=…
