Who cares if it is gluten free or vegan friendly -- the point is this risotto is delicious. To complain because a tiny restaurant is crowded and busy is ridiculous. Ice is slippery, rain is wet, and small restaurants with delicious food are crowded. And when you are paying 12.95 for a heavenly bowl, expect for the restaurant to make up their business with the liquor. We discovered this restaurant in the afternoon and are now fans of the late lunch, with relaxed and happy staff and great music.
