WOW! Eating here was a totally unique experience. This is the most amazing restaurant I've ever been to in Montclair. It's clear that the owners have established a restaurant that is uniquely their own, and not inspired in any way, shape, or form by any other restaurant in this country. Once you try the food, you will see that there is no way to confuse this restaurant with any other place. PS - try the brunch. You'll love it or my name isn't Sal. P. of Passaic, NJ!
