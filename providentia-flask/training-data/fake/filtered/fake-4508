The new space is more spacious and also a bit more cozy, which is a nice change. The menu was mostly familiar, with some new options, which is nice. Our server was a little strange and pushy, demanding that we let him arrange the table how he thought fit, and the food was good, but not great. Pastas are still the strong point (the wild boar bolognese was great, but the steak was not). Â Definitely pricier than I expected - we spent $45 plus tip for two courses, no dessert. So all in all, good, but not the Melograno of the old days ...
