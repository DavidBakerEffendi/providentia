The service was poor. We waited over one hour for eggplant fries and asian salad.  My friend did not care for the granola on her ahi tuna asian salad. It made no sense to me either.  I had to ask the manager and waitress twice about our food.  Looking back we should have left after our sangria.  The eggplant fries were bland and unimpressive.  The only thing redeeming about this place is the outdoor seating area as many other reviewers mentioned.  The indoor dining area was completely empty on a Sat. evening.  That should tell you something as well.  If you want a drink before a show, OK.. it'll do.. but skip the food both for the taste and service.
