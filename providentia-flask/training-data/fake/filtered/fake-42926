The new Benares is a amazing addition to this neighborhood. As a foodie, my expectations are high and yes, they rock!! The food was graciously presented and super delicious, the service was top of the line. The Maître-D took care of us so well, the waiters were cordial and just enough, the flair-bartender/sommelier  took care of wine and drinks like no other.. We were amazed and will recommend this Indian fine dining to all of you guys!! For the first week open, they really gave us a superb experience at a normal NYC price, incredible. If you like being taking care of, you have to try it.
