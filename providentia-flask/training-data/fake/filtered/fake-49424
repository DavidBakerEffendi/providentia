The guacamole was fantastic, the atmosphere was nice,and the food was authentic. I was recently hospitalized for a stomach issue, and this was the first place I went to after my stay. I found options which were healthy, gentle on my stomach, and were delicious! They were very busy, as usual, so the server was not as attentive as she could be. A few mistakes were made on my order, but they were quickly corrected. I heard the margaritas are great so that's what I will be getting on my next visit.
