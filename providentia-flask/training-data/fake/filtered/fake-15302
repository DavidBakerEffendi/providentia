Pinto offers a cozy, intimate setting which is perfect for those who prefer to dine sans crowds. The food they serve is delightful both visually and gastronomically. Start off with their Thai iced tea, dumplings, crab cake, and potato fries with chili mayo. Then move on to some orange duck, flat iron steak, pad thai or  PCU noodles. For dessert,  go ahead and indulge in some chocolate cake with custard cream. The food is reasonably priced, and service is polite and attentive. Pinto lives up to its high ratings, and is well worth giving a try.
