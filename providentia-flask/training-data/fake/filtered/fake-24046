I like Brooklyn Pizza, the girl that answers the phone is always respectful which I like. The Pizza is good and the delivery guys are cool. I've read below, people complaining that it isn't THE REAL Brooklyn style pizza. Well guess what? Your'e not in Brooklyn, you're in Rahway NJ and as far as Rahway goes, this is the best place that I have found in my 6 years of living here.
