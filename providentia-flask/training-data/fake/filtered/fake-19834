Went here for dinner last night with my boyfriend.  I really had an urge for fried chicken and mac n cheese.  Both were okay--nothing spectacular.  I also had the sugar honey vodka concoction.  It was refreshing and not too strong.  The best part of our meal was definitely dessert.  We got the Bailey's bread pudding and it was deliciously sweet. I really enjoyed the décor and atmosphere at Sugar Freak.  My boyfriend dubbed it "crustic"--don't get us wrong--the restaurant and bathrooms were nice and clean.  The place just has a worn country charm to it--picture mason jar lamps and old wooden doors framing the bar.  The bathroom has a particularly crustic vibe to it.  I would go back just to have coffee and dessert and enjoy the ambiance.
