Delicious!! When you first enter there are so many choices to pick from, they are all wonderful. Also, not your typical toppings either, these are creative combinations that taste ideal. The portion is perfect too; one slice and you are more than satisfied. The pizza is made differently, meaning in a much healthier way, without sugar and with very fresh ingredients. It's noticeable in the great taste. They offer so many choices that I always look forward to trying a new slice. The staff and management are all very nice and the location is very pleasant. Since I first went there I find myself choosing to buy my lunch from there more and more. The pizza is simply delicious. great place and I recomend it to all of my friends
