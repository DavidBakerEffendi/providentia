I came here with a few friends on a Sunday night. The restaurant was empty. There were 3 parties when we walked in. The four of us became party number 4. The good: Danni, our waitress was extremely polite and attentive. The bread was very fresh The Bad: With only 3 other tables in the restaurant, I'm not sure why they sat us right next to another party. There were at least 20 other empty tables there! The service was slow. Took over 30 minutes for 4 simple pasta dishes to arrive after we placed the order. My friend's strawberry lemonade wasn't fizzy at all (like it should be) My chicken wasn't lean at all. Not much flavor. Just lots of sauce to cover up the tasteless chicken. My buddy's meal was lukewarm at best.
