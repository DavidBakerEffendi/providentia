I recently dined at blend on the water . I must say I was in aw with the restaurant it self it was beautiful with breath taking views . The service is extremely attentive from the moment you walk in and your greeted by Syeda at the deskshe is  very sweet welcoming efficient and professional . I was accommodated as promptly as possible considering it was a Saturday night and my party did not have a reservation . We even received a text when our table was ready . The server Michelle was truly awesome very knowledgeable of the menu and friendly and made us feel comfortable .Michelle even noticed our food was taking too  long and with out us having to ask she came told us that she would find out what was taking so long . I've been in the hospitality industry for quite sometime  and that kind of initiative could turn a bad situation right around which it did . The spiced shrimp were to die for I honestly think it should be an entree as I could not get enough, next time I go I  will just order three of those. We ordered the churrasco and the pollo a la plancha . The churrasco was cooked just as I ordered and it was succulent and juicy  but smaller than I had imagined very thin but other wise yummy.  The pollo a la plancha which by definition should be grilled, it was not , might of been poached (truth in menu laws people) but my friend said it was still very good although she preferred my chimichurri sauce to her mystery sauce.  Over all it was a great experience, I did forget to mention how delicious they're passion fruit margaritas are OMG . I would definitely return and recommend it to my friends .
