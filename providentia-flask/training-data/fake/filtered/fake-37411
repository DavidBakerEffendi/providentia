I usually dont write reviews but didnt want to miss a chance on writing a review for Urban Spice. We went to Urban Spice on a weekday evening to celebrate my husbands birthday!! I'm so glad we chose this place. The food was superb, the service excellent. The staff is just great and the entire experience was simply amazing. When I asked them to light a candle on the cake, they not only graciously accepted my request but they surprised us with an unique creation of orange kulfi ice cream!! The Kulfi was out the world and absolutely fantastic. Me and my husband are total foodies and love to eat out, but this is the best restaurant we have ever been to by far!! This is on our list now for every special occasion and more!!
