Arrived just before 8pm without a reservation to a pretty busy restaurant on a Wednesday night. The hostess said it would be about 30 minutes for a table. We went to the bar. The bartenders were attentive, and the drinks were delicious. A little pricey, but they felt special. We were not seated for 50 minutes, at which point we were finished with cocktails at the bar and had started Googling other restaurants in the neighborhood. Just then, we got seated, and they sent over an appetizer on the house. So at least they had the sense to try and make up for their hostess' poor estimation. The food is well prepared, and seasonal, which was appreciated. But the portions are quite small, especially for the price. The menu is brief and not good for vegetarians, or even pescetarians for that matter. Most of the dishes feature meat, or have a meat component. We each had seafood, and were generally disappointed by the overall entree composition and presentation. The fish is served as-is on white dishes, with a more complex side of either vegetable or meat and veg pairings with sauce. Ham seemed to be a component of many dishes. The wait staff seemed junior, confused about whether drinks had been ordered, and reliant on servers and hosts to truly serve and describe the dishes. There is a main room where the atmosphere is enjoyable, but the back room where we sat felt loud and unpleasant. There are also some tables quite near the entrance to the toilets, which I am happy we were not seated at. All in, we spent over $100 per person for drinks, appetizers and entrees. There are restaurants within walking distance of this place where you can get a better meal for that price. I would only go back for drinks at the bar.
