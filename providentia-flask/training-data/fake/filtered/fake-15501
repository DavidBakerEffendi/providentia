Love this place... the vegan and vegetarian food is hearty and filling. Many places make these bean sprout alfalfa bland foods that are just nasty or they overdo it with the nasty tofu, which I am not a fan of and there are many other options aside from tofu... this place rocks... Their brussel sprouts in marinara sauce is one of my favorites...
