As buffets go, pretty good. Food quality is probably one or two notches above a typical Chinese buffet, but the staff go overboard on cleanliness...constantly looking for opportunities to keep it sparkling. When one section was practically empty, they were wiping down the walls and the chairs, too. I was impressed with that. Prices will definitely keep me coming back. Fried flounder filets were particularly good. Lots of selection, but can be a bit noisy at peak times.
