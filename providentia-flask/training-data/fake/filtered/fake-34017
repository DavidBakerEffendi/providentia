I had the distinct pleasure of dining at VITAL yesterday for lunch. What a treat!  The food selection is high level, varied and down-right delicious. I dined on the salmon burger -- mmmm, good. And I have raise my hand in voting for VITAL to package its black-eye peas hummus. What!  Off the hook. So good I had to order the side dish. And serving it with sliced fried plantains was genius. This is what I loved about my experience - no detail was overlooked. The hot tea, mine was cinnamon apple, was piping hot, loose tea with real apple bits and served in a diffuser kettle. The aroma was intoxicating alone. There are so many items I am looking forward to enjoying going forward. And they do take-out!  I have found my new top spot for great, fresh, wholesome food. Thank you. Debra Spruill A confirmed fan
