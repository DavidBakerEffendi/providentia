Grew up on Foxy, Olympic and Gino's pizza. Olympic changed when it went across the street, Gino's has departed but Foxy is here to stay! Foxy Pizza is consistent and it is great! Is it new age? Do they have a ton of creative new pizza's? Nope! It is exactly like it has always been and I love it! Don't ever change!!!
