I've been here for dinner a few times with my family before and the food was good and pretty authentic, so we decided to try their dim sum today. Big mistake. The reviews that complained about the Beef Chow Fun and other dishes running out quickly were true. They were even short on utensils too! We waited a long time for tea because they didn't have enough tea pots, and we were only given two forks instead of four because apparently they didn't have enough of those either. When we asked for the Beef Chow Fun, the waiter rudely told us we should have ordered half an hour earlier, and then walked away before we could begin to order another dish. They seem to be very understaffed, too. Needless to say, the service was absolutely horrible. Despite that, the food was decent and it wasn't too pricey. But I probably wouldn't come back for dim sum again.
