The Employee's are HORRIBLE & VERY RUDE which lead's to VERY POOR customer service, not to mention the Steak & Cheese Sandwiches were over rated. I would much rather have a super delicious Steak & Cheese with the work's from the regular Bodega which knock's them out the box! Never ever will this place get any business from me nor anyone that I know EVER!!! this place is HORRIBLE & It TOTALLY SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
