I love wings and I've been to all the wing places around from crap like hooters to good places like buffalo wild wings and this place by far is the best. Every flavor is frickin phenomenal. Not to mention their fries best fries I've ever tasted...unless you don't like black pepper. They season them with black pepper and salt which i love.
