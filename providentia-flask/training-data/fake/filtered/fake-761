Me and my wife order the Margherita pizza and the Banana Nutella and Walnut Calzone. The pizza was ok. Even when the ingredients are fresh, the crust is charred over the edge and too soggy in the middle. Plus there is a lot of crust, than ingredients. The dessert was a different story... Pretty good! Totally recommend. The service was just ok. Our waiter was kind but he disappeared just when we wanted the check. Take five minutes to returned. Overall was a good experience. 3.5 stars if I could. I think they can do better.
