I love Toast! The food choices are fantastic - I love that they serve brunch all day, and their coffee is well brewed and prepared. I'm a fan of the large windows - it's the perfect location to sit and people watch for a little while. Nestled in Center City, Toast provides people like me who travel into the city for work a little haven to de-stress and kick back a little bit. The staff is wonderfully friendly and always eager to provide their own suggestions when you're not sure what to get. Â Now that school is starting back up it also makes it the perfect environment to settle down and do some studying. I love the fact that they play Maps by the Yeah Yeah Yeah's - and related Pandora stations - it really sets the mood to unwind or have casual conversation with some friends. Can't wait to go back!
