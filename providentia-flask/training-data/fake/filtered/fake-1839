A friend and I read a very good review in the paper and decided to try Sorella.  We parked in the lot near the restaurant and the ticket clocked in at 1:44 pm.  We each had something different.  My friend had the mushroom risotto and I had the pizza with leeks, mushrooms and goat cheese.  The risotto was wonderful.  The flavor was rich with many different layers.  The pizza was okay but not something I would order again. There should have been more leeks and maybe braising them to enhance their sweetness before being added  to the pizza would have helped.  There were several other items we would have liked to try but unfortunately that won't be happening.  When we got back to our car and went to pay it was 2:50 and we had to pay $10.00 on top of our $36 lunch.  We normally like to eat leisurely but that probably would have cost another $10.00.  You may or may not have anything to do with parking fees but it is certainly discouraging and a rip off.
