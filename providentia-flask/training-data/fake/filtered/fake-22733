This is my favourite place in nyc by far! Customer service is excellent they go above and beyond in every way!! Been here several times and love it so much staff are amazing especially Alexander who works there is an absolute diamond and such a credit to the place! Cannot fault any of the food at all the meatball starter is to die for!! All I can say is you won't be disappointed!
