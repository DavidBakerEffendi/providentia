Go to Mesob for the novelty. Not so much for the food. It really is simple commoner food, given the illusion of exotic gourmet due to the poshness of the restaurant and the Ethiopian label. But really nothing more than simple Ethiopian bread (Indira) and strewd meats which are liberally spiced. Other typical vegetarian dishes served as well - cabbage, potatoes, lentils, etc. It's a nice choice for a new experience and I would definitely recommend eating there at least once but there are places with much better food at much more reasonable prices where your money would be better spent.
