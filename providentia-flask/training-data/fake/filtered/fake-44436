Great atmosphere.  Great food.  Great drinks.  Amazing place. Been a fan since the place opened up last summer.  It's a very nice restuarant and it fits in perfectly with Fort Greene and the people who live here. The food is a bit pricier.  Not outrageous but not cheap enough for frequent family dinners.  Frozen mojitos and sangrias cost about 8 bucks.  Are they worth is?  Depends on how crappy your day has been. The corn is great, I've heard.  Not my thing, but I know several people who are slightly addicted to it.   I'd swear by the white-cheese and avocado burrito.  Amazing.   Under no circumstance should you order the fries.  TERRIBLE.  Tasteless and hard and just...no.  Definitely the black-spot on the menu.  The only thing that's practically inedible. Everything is eco-friendly.  The entire restaurant runs on Solar-Energy and all cutlery is made of recyclable material. But Habana is best for it's atmosphere, for the outdoor lounge, the music, the Fort Greene residents. It's really a lovely place to hang out and meet people.
