After a long-needed hiatus from Chinatown restaurants, this establishment was on our list to experience. Dishes included Dan Dan noodles, Mapo Tofu, Double-cooked pork and Chongqing spicy chicken. This restaurant has the spice, taste and authenticity of Han Dynasty, with an unarguably better ambiance (no dingy basement (high school cafeteria style) seating arrangement) with larger portions for less $$$ with just the locals enjoying this gem (Not every restaurant-goer from the suburbs needing a diversion from the "hottest" Stephen star mutant) In summary, an unassuming Chinese/Szechuan restaurant essentially indistinguishable from the multitude of adjacent shops, except for the phenomenal taste.
