We went last night for a Valentine's Day Dinner with friends. We had a super delicious meal but this review is about the wait staff which really out did themselves: one of our friends is allergic to soy, dairy, cured things, vinegar, red wine. The staff, three of them, were super knowledgeable about what was in each tapas and what she could eat and how they could modify it for the rest of us. Some of the tapas we all ate and some she avoided. We all enjoyed our meal, our friend was fine, the wine was great and we were so impressed by the care everyone took to insure our friend a delicious dining experience. Thanks!
