After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to go check it out, see what all the fuss was about.  I called to see when I could come in, was told there was a 2 hour wait.  I headed over a little early so I wouldn't miss my chance, and had to wait about 30 minutes.  I'm going to name the con's first, which explain why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.  First, we were put at the table right in front of the door, in front of the host stand.  This table was tight, and the people piling into the restaurant and holding the door open make me feel extremely claustrophobic and uneasy.  I mean, they were practically sitting in my lap, and I felt like I had to lean into the wall to get enough distance. It didn't help that it was about 20 degrees outside.  But as I looked around at the other diners, I noticed everyone else seeming calm, serene and happy.  So I think my discomfort was based solely on the fact that we were so close to the door.  Also, because we were right in front of the host stand, I could hear her conversations more clearly then that of my dinner companion, which was frustrating.   Now onto the pros:  The ambiance (my table aside) is lovely.  Low lighting, candles, sappy Italian music...I'm a sucker for atmosphere.  The server was very friendly and seemed happy to be talking to us. The pizza was very good, and we devoured it in record time.  But the creme de la creme of the experience was the calzone.  It was hands down the best calzone I have ever had.  The prices were very good, our check came out to $42, which is almost unheard of in New York City.   All in all, I'm happy I went and would love to go again, and hopefully have a better table next time so I can fully appreciate the experience without having to worry about whats going around me.
