I recently went to Cuban Pete's for the first time. We've heard the food was great from a few people... well they must not ever had real authentic Cuban food before. Although the restaurant itself was nice and the service was great, the food was horrible (and what's more important than the food). I ordered the pollo Cubano, which had absolutely no flavor except for a huge wad of raw garlic right in the center of the chicken. My husband had the Churrasco which was definitely not worth $17 at all. The rice was dry and hard, and the sweet plantains were burnt. Also they have no waiting area. So while waiting for a table you have to watch your back to make sure you don't get trampled by the other people and waiters passing by. I will not recommend anyone to this restaurant nor will I ever go and waste my money on such a horrible meal again.
