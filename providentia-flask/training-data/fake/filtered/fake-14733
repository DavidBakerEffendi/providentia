Low fat tuna salad, AND it's delicious. Pizzas on display so you can decide what you're in the mood for once you walk in, delicious snickerdoodle coffee, good prices, and free delivery for breakfast too? I'm a big fan of this place. I've tried their bagels, breakfast wraps, pizzas and sandwiches- all of which were quite good. The service is wonderful and always provided with a smile. Huge, clean atmosphere with TVs so you aren't missing the big game while ordering/eating. They urge you to sit down and relax-even of you order at the counter so they can bring your food to you, always attentivie once you've taken a seat. Casual and obviously kid friendly, a good spot to go for a slice with the family or a even a quick bite for breakfast before work.
