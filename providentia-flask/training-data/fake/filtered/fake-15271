Wandered in here with a couple of friends looking for a late lunch and it was a great find! The food was good and the price was right! $15 for a drink, an appetizer and an entree. That's a tough deal to beat. Highlights: My friend ordered the roasted pork butt*, which tasted great, but, more importantly, satisfied my childish sense of humor. I ordered the chicken satay and the beef in garlic sauce. Less fun to order, but just as fun to eat! For "dessert" we had white chocolate martinis. After one sip, my friend declared that she was planning to change her Facebook status to "in a relationship with my chocolate martini." I couldn't really argue. They were seriously that good. *Not actually from the butt. Irrelevant but true.
