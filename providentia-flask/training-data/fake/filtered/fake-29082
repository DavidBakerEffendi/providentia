I can always appreciate when a chef or any person stands by creation.  What i mean by this if you want the subway experience of selecting your bread and condiments this is not the place.  These guys pump out tasty affordable sandwiches and take full accountability by making one eat it the way they intended it to be. I respect that.  The Cat fish sandwich is one of my faves.  This place blows baoguette out of water IMO.  sorry all you bao fans, but my experience there is for another post.  If you have the time and the patience to stand in line give this place a shot.
