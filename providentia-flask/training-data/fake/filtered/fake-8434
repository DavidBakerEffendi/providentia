First visit to Jones was a Monday around 1:15. Lunch crowd was just thinning out. Noise level can be high when the place is full. Staff was very friendly. Our waitress, Casey, was awesome. Very pleasant and answered all of our questions and made recommendations. Since the 4 guys next to me had the Sesame Tuna, I figured it had to be good. And it was!!! It came on a bed of coconut rice and was very tender and tasty. My wife had the turkey burger, which was also excellent. We would have gotten the Mac & Cheese but one of us is on a diet and didn't want to be tempted. I would definitely go back. Lots of great sounding food on the menu!
