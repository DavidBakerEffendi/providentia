Honestly Calle Ocho touched all my taste buds in all the right ways. The service was just amazing. The sangria's were even better. The food was so good. While I had no reservation, there was no problem for my friend and me to be seated. I don't know about you, but when I go out I automatically get a strong vibe. When I walked in Calle Ocho I was greeted in the friendliest manner. When I saw the menu, I was overwhelmed. So many choices from burritos and steak to the sangria's bar that I've heard everybody talking about so much. Personally I like to try new things so I started with the sangria's. There were like eight different flavors to choose from, and there was a self serve bar at brunch, so if your trying have a good time, that's the time to go. I mean they have glasses just sitting at the table, waiting for the next lucky guest to try what the bar has to offer. Â Luckily I went at brunch, who knew you could have such a great time at noon. I mean the restaurant itself is a vibrant environment, ideal to relax and have a good time, who knows you might meet someone new. Now drinks are always good right, but when you're hungry you need something worth the money. The Pork Shank hit the spot. I never had pork that was so tasty. That first bite made my day. I'm talking tender, fall of the bone kind of pork, cooked just right. The knew I would like this place. There Mexican sweet breads were too good, a perfect end to the meal.Im the type of person that needs something sweet after I eat. We couldn't stop but to think how good everything was. With Calle Ocho you won't be disappointed. I think I found my new favorite restaurant.
