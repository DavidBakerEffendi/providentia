This is the best Italian food I have ever had The food was immaculate.  The peppery meat lasagna was the high point for me, with dipping the delicious bread in the remaining sauce being a close second.  My wife spoke with the owner for some time and when she found out it was my birthday, she treated us with 4-5 Italian dessert pastries, which were each better than any that I had at any other point on the trip...and we were regulars at the Plaza Food Hall, which is great in its own right (for a price).  The owner is the sweetest lady and was literally calling out to us as we left wishing me a happy birthday.  Ignore reviews that claim she is anything but nice - those people must suck. I will absolutely be back.
