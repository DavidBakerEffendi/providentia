The staff was super friendly which is the only reason why I gave it 2 stars. The "handcrafted" chicken was sub par. I liked the crunchiness of the chicken but for $8.95 per pound, I would have passed. It really wasn't that flavorful. They only offer chicken tenders and wings. If this is supposed to be a handcrafted chicken restaurant, where's the other parts of the chicken? The Mac N Cheese is also offered at $8.95 per pound but who the heck charges $8.95 per pound for Mac N Cheese? I can't eat a pound but geesh but really? It was too many flavors in the Mac N Cheese. The sandwiches are ok but I rather go to Subway and I don't even eat at Subway.. The only reason I would ever go back is for the biscuits. Those biscuits were delicious.
