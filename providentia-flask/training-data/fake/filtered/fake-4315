Food: 2 stars Service: 3 stars Value: 1 star I had Fond at the top of my list of restaurants to visit for over a year. After looking at their latest menu online, I decided to finally try it out. Boy was I disappointed. I ordered the chilled melon and cucumber soup as my starter. It was a hot day, so the idea of a cold soup sounded perfect. The description sounded great, too. Unfortunately, it was downright bad. I have no idea why this is on the menu. The cod entree was ok, not good and definitely not great. The fish was well-cooked, but the rest of the entree's flavors did not combine well. One ingredient in particular had a very sharp taste, so I ate the fish and left most else. I didn't bother to order dessert. The bread that came with the meal was just OK. One other reviewer raved about the olive bread, but I didn't find anything special about it. The best part of the meal was the amuse bouche. I wanted a great meal and left disappointed.
