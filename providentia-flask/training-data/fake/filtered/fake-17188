decided to try the chicken and waffels. first of all the price was 11.50 for wingeetes and 4 small waffels.  , the chicken was refried. It was not fresh.  Worst of all, there were 2 or 3  black "pellets " in the waffels that in my opinion  looked like droppings. Did not look like pieces of burnt left over pancake like the lady who works therre described it when i called to tell them.  It appears to me that something coul have fell into the batter. I threw it away.  So what they got an A in the window, the chicken an waffels were , expensive, refried and tasteless with suspicious black pellets that was fried in the waffle.  will never buy from this spot again.
