Wow, I have tryed other arepas from other countries, but nothing comes even close to the Venezuelan arepas. The avocado and chorizo inside makes them extra tasty. I agree with Elizabeth, their back patio is romantic, full of candles and perfect for hanging out with friends. I'm not giving 5 stars, due that it took around 20min to get our order...and the place wansn't that full...but still I'll come back when I visit NYC again.
