What a wonderful little gem of a restaurant!  My friends and I were in town on Easter Sunday to see a Cirque Du Soleil show and asked Siri on my iphone for Italian restaurants in the area.  We called this one and asked if we needed reservations being that it was Easter Sunday - of course the answer was yes but they didn't open til noon and that was too late for us as we would not be back in time for our show.  So I thanked them and was moving on to find another restaurant when my phone rang back with the very friendly voice of Mario - the owner - inviting us to come down right then - that he would open up just for us!!!  Who does this?  What a guy!  We quickly went over and enjoyed a fantabulous meal and most importantly the experience with Mario and his staff.  Everyone was so friendly and welcoming.  The food was phenominal - the atmosphere in this quaint little restaurant is awesome!  I sooooo wish I lived closer!  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to everyone who loves Italian food and fabulous service!
