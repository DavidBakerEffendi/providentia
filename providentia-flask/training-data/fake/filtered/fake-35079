wow.. don't know how they get 4 stars. maybe so fake reviews or what. good things first. price was decent, food was ok, not so bad but , the fish quality r diff can't compare to some decent grades others offered. they tuna they had was a little on the lower side. as for the kitchens they offered, nothing special . just a whole bunch Japanese dishes, nothing fancy to talk about, u can get them at any japanese restaurant. and the servers , omg~~~ just OMG,   sounds like they r still learning in English, sometimes hard to understand what they r explaining, or sometime i knows even more than they r telling me. looks like i am an expert to them lol. anyway, if u r looking for some cheap sushi or kitchen main dishes , than it's really not a bad place for u to go, but if u want some with better quality fish, go elswhere n find another one. and also. i found the Miso soup they offer had way SO much   MSGs. MSG. i am a little too effective with MSG's. they made my through feel bad  and thirsty, so i can feel it, if any food contains MSG. beware of MSG fellas.
