I heard great things about Clinton St. Baking Company, and finally decided to check it out one weekend with my girlfriend. Got there around 11ish am, and the waiter told us that there was a ridiculous 1-2 half hour wait for table for 2. It ended up being only a 20 minute hour wait. We got the Smoked Salmon Scramble, Clinton St. Omelette and their famous Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes. The Wild Maine Blueberry Pancakes were amazing, probably the best pancakes I ever had. The Clinton St. Omelette was okay, tasted like nothing special. Their Smoked Salmon Scramble however was my favorite. A bit expensive for brunch but it was worth it. Just remember to bring cash since they don't accept card. Definitely one of my favorite brunch spots.
