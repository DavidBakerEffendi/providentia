On the advice of a co-worker I went to Benito's  while in New York. 4.5 stars ?????? No way ! We got the lunch special. a chicken parm and an eggplant parm and we we disappointed in everything we got. Salad, looked like previous nights left-overs. Chicken parm, tasty but a little tough, Eggplant parm was great if you like sauce and breading ! If you actually want eggplant in it you really have to look hard for it. Paper thin , one layer deep surrounded by double thick breading. We ordered clams on the half-shell but the waiter said they were bad and did not serve them. On a positive note the waiter was pleasant and obliging { plus he would not serve bad clams }. Overall I would pick any neighborhood Italian place in Philly  over Benito's in Little Italy It might just be a big tourist trap overall !
