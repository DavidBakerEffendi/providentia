I have been going to RAYS for over a decade! Doobie, the fabulous owner, and his crew are friendly and absolute pizza experts! Going over the there for pizza or calling them on the phone for an order is ALWAYS A DELIGHT AND A HUGE JOY! Why bother going anywhere else? We at home don't EVER get our pizza from anywhere else! The pizza is hearty and tremendous with big impressive slices to satisfy your cravings. Their special eggplant is made with Ricotta cheese and the recipe is unique to this shoppe only. It is really amazing! Their buffalo chicken is Â awesome and their famous "grandma's" Sicilian basil pizza is so light and fresh. Their sausage with peppers and onions is bursting with flavor and true transportation! They also have delicious garlicky garlic knots and yummy calzones. If you haven't tried Rays yet, you don't know what you're missing! Give Doobie and the boys a call, or stop by for one of their killer slices and say Johnny sent you!
