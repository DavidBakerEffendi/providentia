My children gave me a gift card for Max Brenner's for my birthday.  Max is the chocolate specialist and my kids know I'm a chcoholic.  I ordered the sesame salmon with garlic spinach as my main course. I also ordered a Mexican martini.  The dinner and the drink arr5ived at the same time, which is fine.  The drink was wonderful with chocolate, cinnamin, nutmeg, etc.  My dinner was fine, however, rather than sesame salmon it was blackened salmon.  Although there was a little bit of spinach on the plate, it was a  mixture of vegetables.  I was especailly disappointed about the spinach.  Then came dessert.  Ah yes, what to choose?  I settled on the Maxwich.   What a wonderful choice.  Delicious chocoate icecream between two brownies.  Plus a warm chocolate ganache for dipping.  I found the restaurant rather noisy, and that was besides the fact that there was a table of young teens close by our table.  Next time I go, I would probably go for dessert rather than a meal.
