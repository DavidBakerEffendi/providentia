I've had several terrible experiences here.   I suspect my review will be buried in the "not recommended" pile with the other one-star reviews because even though Yelp claims it does not hide reviews for paying customers, it does.   I have found the food here to be OK at best but in considering what they charge, it gets drastically downgraded.  If I were paying a couple of bucks for these crepes at a farmer's market I'd be satisfied.  When I have to go out of my way to visit, deal with the pompous staff, and overpay for my food it becomes a bad experience. I could rattle off the experiences I have had involving dirty tables, wrong food, rude staff, etc. but as I mentioned before, Yelp will delegate this as not recommended on behalf of the owner who does what he can to keep up appearances for the tourists who think this place accurately represents Burlington.
