After arriving into Princeton my team and I asked the concierge of our hotel about a good recommendation for a restaurant close to our hotel. They suggested Big Fish. We looked around at a couple different restaurant selections and settled on Big Fish and made our reservation. Luckily I did not peruse Yelp prior to make my decision on this restaurant. If I had, i probably would not have gone at all, but luckily I didn't. My team and I had a great experience and the food was pretty good. We travel all around the world with our job and I am not saying this is the best restaurant we have ever eat en at, but it was not bad like some of the reviews here. The service was good, our waitress was very knowledgeable and her recommendations were spot on. When one of our party informed her of her shellfish allergy, she made sure to recommend items that were not prepared on or near where other shellfish were prepped/cooked. Â The food was fresh, tasteful and the portion sizes were acceptable as well. We had the Tuna appetizer which came out two ways. It was flavorful and the portion size was good for all of us to share. I would definitely return with this team or any of my other teams that I travel with.
