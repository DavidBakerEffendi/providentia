The food was awesome and the drinks was amazing, I definitely will come back again. The salmon is amazing if your looking for seafood. I tried the mac & cheese which is also good as a appetizer. I came from happy hour and the drinks weren't bad. The view by the water was spectacular. The service was great & music was very good
