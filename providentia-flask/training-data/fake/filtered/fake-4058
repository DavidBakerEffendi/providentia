I had an absolutely sensational dining experience last weekend at this delightful restaurant.  I ordered a chick pea dish seasoned with cream, cilantro, garlic, and lemon along with accompanying basmati rice and cheese and onion nan.  My boyfriend and I enjoyed the upstairs dining area late night by ourselves; we felt like royalty dining in a Punjabi palace tower. Zaroka should be even more popular than it is--it blows neighboring similarly themed restaurants out of the Indian Ocean.
