I think I have eaten here at least 50 times over the last year and with all due respect, I have never ever been treated so royally at another establishment as my guests and I are ALWAYS treated here at this wonderful, aggressively recommended restaurant. Bathrooms are immaculate, atmosphere casual and loving, service to die for, just beautiful everything everywhere always. Thank you so much Vietnam! You are a credit to what a fine dining out experience should always be. I will miss you so much upon my moving away! Recommended: DRINKS. DRINKS. DRINKS! Try the Flaming Volcano with a friend, enemy or pending lover.
