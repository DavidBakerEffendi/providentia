When I'm in Philly, I stop at Jones.  Whether supper or lunch, I can always rely on food that's consistently delicious, pulchritudinous and served hot (as applicable). I'm partial to fish, so I go for sesame seared tuna with coconut rice - a side as rich and good as dessert.  The chef prepares the sushi grade fish with care--ambrosial splendor, that dish. Chicken Pot Pie stands out as another winner--the immaculate puff pastry housing savory flavors blended full of bright veggies, chock-stuffed with large chunks of tender poultry in outstanding gravy of an appropriate, happy density.  Far above satisfactory.  You cannot go wrong. Last time I dropped by 'round happy hr, the awesome rockin' multi-talented Manager Stephen concocted up a Pink Mustache, like a gin fizz, but His post-prohib. twist features berries and zest.  It blew me away.  Of course, not as much as Stephen's quick witted tabletalk.  There's quite a lot more than meets the comely eye behind Jones'  sincerely warm, kind and charming mixologist/menu-innovator/all-around incredibly creative and caring individual. He sees to it that each person's dining experience meets or surpasses hir expectations. He's also got impeccable  taste, recommending distinctively decadent appetizers. My favorites that I've tried at Stephen's suggestion: the flavorful seared tuna tacos, creamy Mac & cheese, and super-fresh plus crunchy fish sticks. Nachos great bet too. That time, I had a lucky chance to experience a fantastic daily-special--a classic cookie sundae, yet this dish was composed as close to perfection as possible. The dough cookie featured sweet and slightly salty flavors and moist, most gooey, density, the consistency one ideally expects from this type chocolate-chip confection, paired with a refreshingly cool ice cream scoop.  I'll be ordering that next time it's offered. All in all, Jones restaurant's wonderful.  Service great.  Atmosphere safe as well.
