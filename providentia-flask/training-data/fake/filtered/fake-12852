The service was poor and the food was nothing special.  We were expecting to have a nice leisurely dinner with friends.  It was anything but.  The first bit of trouble was that our server forgot to tell us about the specials.  Good thing we asked.  Half-way through eating our salads, all of our dinners arrived!  We're not slow eaters and this was ridiculous.  We asked the server to hold the meals in the kitchen and to keep them warm until we were ready.  She took them all back but returned minutes later to say that she could no longer keep our meals in the kitchen because "other meals were coming out."  She offered to place all of our meals on an empty table behind us until we were ready for them.  Really?!!! Having no real choice, we accepted the meals.  It was clear that they hadn't been kept warm.  The food itself was good, but nothing special. While we were still eating, the server returned to ask whether we were ready to have our meals cleared and wrapped.  No, we were certainly not ready.  When we were ready, two of us were still finishing wine when she asked if we would like coffee and dessert.   Making this all the more interesting was that while we were being rushed, a couple across from us was quite upset because they never got their meals.  Eventually, they asked for the "to go" and left. This is a poorly run restaurant.  I won't be returning.  One more thing... there was a bottle of supposed olive oil on the table.  It tasted like vegetable oil.  It wouldn't have gone well with good bread but was even worse with the sweet-dough bread at the table. My advice: go somewhere else.
