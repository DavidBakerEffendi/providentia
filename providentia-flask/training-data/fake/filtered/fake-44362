I LOVE this place! It has great food cheap. I have been going here for years. The only drawback is the service - the waiters are loud and sometimes rude. But the food is so good you probably won't mind the noise. Expect to share a table with strangers. Definetly try the roast duck and roast pork. I usually get the wonton roast duck noodles. YUMMY! The congee is good also.
