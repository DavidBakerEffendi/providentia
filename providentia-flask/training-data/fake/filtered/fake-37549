Absolutely horrible! I order 2 hamburgers, and a pasta dish. It takes over an 1hr and 20 minutes for it to get to my house(mind you I live in the same town as this restaurant.) On top of that they forget one of the burgers I ordered, so I have to call the restaurant let them know they forgot one of my burgers, it takes another hour and 20 minutes(by this time my mom still hasn't eaten anything-waiting for the food) and finally they arrive. When my mom received the food it looked as if there was cigarette ashes thrown into the food and smelled like ashes. They tried to make up for their bad service with a free soda, but honestly a soda only costs a dollar and some change at the store. The only reason why I'm even ok with giving this one star is because the delivery guy was extremely nice and gave me good instruction on what I needed to do to let the restaurant know of my order.
