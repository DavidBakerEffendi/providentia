I have been to this store twice: one for lunch and one for brunch. The food is good. And they have free Wireless internet access so you can bring your laptop there. The brunch is good,too. They  have live music. The service on Sunday ( brunch) is better than the weekday lunch time. I guess it's because lots family would go there for brunch. I noticed there were some seniors and some children there.   Something to mention is that they don't have changing table in their restroom. To whoever comes with a baby, this may be very inconvenient .( But the waitress was very kind to babies)
