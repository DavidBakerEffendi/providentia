As a fan of Mexican food, this restaurant definitely didn't let me down. We were only looking for some churros, but we found much more. On a nice sunny afternoon, we ventured to the restaurant, about nine people including myself. We were immediately welcomed by the owner and given ample time to order. I believe the owners wife was working the register and she was able to answer all of our questions about specific items on the menu. We decided to eat in to escape the heat. The atmosphere was very welcoming. It was nice and cool and they had a baseball game on the tv. We were catching up, so I'm not sure exactly how long it took for our food to come out, but for such a large group in addition to online orders and other walk-in customers, I would say the service was pretty quick. The food was great, we each had something different; I think we basically got to taste the whole menu. We enjoyed our meals and were very satisfied with our experience. When we paid (after eating, pretty nice) the owner asked each of us how we enjoyed our food. I love this kind of experience. Small businesses treating their customers with the kind of friendliness you expect in a tv show. Oh and the churros were hot and fresh. We will definitely be back.
