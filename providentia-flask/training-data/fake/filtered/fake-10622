Atticus is a New Haven classic. It has a great environment, excellent home-made soups, breads (breads!!), sandwiches, and desserts, and a nice independent bookstore with a helpful and knowledgeable staff. Bookstore employees have done a great job of recommending books for my son. He feels welcome and comfortable there and loves stopping by when we're downtown. New Haven would not be New Haven without Atticus. Oh, and their black bean soup is wonderful!
