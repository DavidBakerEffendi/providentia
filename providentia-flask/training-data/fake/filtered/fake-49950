I love a good Dog.  And Rutt's ranks on the top ten list, beating out many Chi-town supposed greats.  The truth however is this.  I have been going 3x a year for 20 years, and the quality continues to erode..with one exception The Relish which will make any dog or burger taste great.  Oh and cheap cheap beer doesn't hurt. Rings get a C-, Fries get a B, Burgers get a D.
