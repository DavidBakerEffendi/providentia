Stopped here on the way from NY to NH for lunch. My wife and I both had the french onion soup and salad bar and were very pleased. The salad bar was exceptionally fresh and well stocked. Soup was above average. We visited relatively early on a Sunday and the place was busy with an older crowd for lunch but we were seated very quickly. Service was excellent. Out waitress was friendly, polite, and prompt.
