While the food was great, the service was not .  One of the waiters, who was not ours, told us that we had to get out of our seats and leave after a little over an hour because he "needed" the chef's counter seats (which were no reservation seats).  He essentially kicked us out, which was the opposite of a relaxed byob.  Disappointed!
