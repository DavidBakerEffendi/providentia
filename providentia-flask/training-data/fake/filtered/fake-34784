This is one of the best restaurants I have been in NYC.  The food is amazing and the service is very good and fast. Most of the food I had so far (I had a big party there too, so we ordered various dishes there) was excellent.(BTW, you must try pork belly :))  As you know, It is very hard to find the place that has good quality for most of the menu. All of the cocktails are amazing, too! We had three different shots in a row. It was that great. (try a cocktail with green tea ice cream in - forgot the name) The interior design is great as well. I love their big chandeliers with high ceiling so much! I love to have romantic dinner, girl's night out, or big parties. I saw there was TV, so people can watch sports there too. I've already introduced this place some of my co-workers and apparently one of them had her anniversary with her husband there and they both loved it. Now all of us are going to go there soon again. If you want to go to the restaurant that is managed by people who have a professional mindset for their business,  this is the place!
