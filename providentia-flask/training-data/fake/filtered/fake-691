I'm from the Midwest, and these are the best chilli dogs i've ever had. Nice to see a small, family owned and run business making good food at a decent price. Welllllllllll worth the trek up from Yale's campus if you like hot dogs or mac and cheese--you just can't really get this kind of food down there.
