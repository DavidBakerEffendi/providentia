Just went back for the second time in two weeks.  This is a great place for a fun group dinner if you've got loud or rowdy friends.  The service is not out of this world but the friendliness of the staff more than makes up for having to wait a few minutes for another pitcher of free homemade margarita mix.  To be fair, this is exactly what service is like in Latin America so it's really just adds to the laid back family-style vibe you get.  We got tons of delicious food, were there hanging out for several hours and paid something like 17 bucks a person.  Can't beat that.
