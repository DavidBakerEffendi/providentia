Great Pizza or Greatest Pizza? Well, greatest pizza my fellow bretheren. My friend introduced me to Spumoni Gardens. One Ftriday night in Decmeber shortly before Christmas my friend invited to go to Dyker Heights in Brooklyn (we live in New Jersey). So when we got to the resturant finally, my friend ordered 3 trays of scillian pizza, it was the most fabulous pizza ever -my friend nor I even had the round pizza. Either way it was great; the secret is that the cheese is underneath the gravy (He says gravy not sauce). There after we had Rainbow Spumoni ice cream, he had the vanilla chip ice, which he recomends is the best ice cream there. That to was the greatest. Overall it's a great resturant, worth driving through Staten Island, and the Slossan AVE. turn which is a b&!@#. The End.
