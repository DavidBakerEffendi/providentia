We ordered the new york strip and it came out burnt black on both sides so we asked the waiter (very politely) to take it back b/c it was really bitter and not edible. So he calmly exclaims, "send it back?!" without even acknowledging the fact that the steak looked like a black rock. The waiter then proceeds to tell the bus boy that he doesn't know why, but the customer wants to "send it back". This was all said right in front of me where I can hear EVERYTHING. When the check came out, we paid with a gift card and left a cash tip. The waiter then discreetly, but obviously not too discreetly because I saw him, pockets the cash and walks over to the counter! Overall, horrible experience! Never will go back!
