I see that this place is under new ownership, so I'll chalk this one up to "still figuring things out." We ordered delivery from this place: the vindaloo chicken and chicken kali mirch (both mild, per the recommendation of the Guy On The Phone), as well as two vegetable samosas as appetizers. The samosas were clearly re-heated frozen samosas, based on the congealed insides and hard, tasteless outer shell--the sauces accompanying them were also store-bought: I have never seen chutney glow a brighter hue of neon green. The rice was clearly handmade, with coriander seeds and leaves mixed in, and the chicken kali mirch was pretty good, but for a mild dish, lacking in ANY spice whatsoever. The WORST, however, was the chicken vindaloo, which traditionally tastes like a proper curry, and traditionally is screaming-spicy (which is another reason why I opted for the mild). What we received, instead, was LITERALLY tomato paste, with bits of cubed chicken breast thrown in. There was no spice, no heat, and certainly no flavor, beyond tomato paste: I might as well have opened a can of Campbell's soup. This was as far from chicken vindaloo as a Cheeto would be from a sirloin steak. Terribly disappointed.
