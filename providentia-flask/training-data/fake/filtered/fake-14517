Have been hearing about this really awesome pizza  place Osteria Procaccini in Princeton/Kingston and we finally found it and went there last Friday! Absolutely loved it ! One of the best Brick Oven Pizza's we have eaten.....and we have eaten a whole lot of different ones! We are a foodie family!!! Had their antipasto selection was very good. Also had their dessert pie a variation of a Cannoli  which was so different yet so familiar! Loved it too! Overall had a good time, thanks to Sanjay for his research and insisting we go there! Fresh local ingredients used and pizzas are thin crust and crispy. Sauce is tangy and fresh tasting, very interesting combinations. We had their arugula pie, sausage pie n mushroom pie loved all of them! Friendly  and knowledgeable staff and efficient service. Space is a little small but cozy plenty of parking available in the rear! It is also a BYOB place so pick up your favorite red or white and head there to  enjoy a good pie!
