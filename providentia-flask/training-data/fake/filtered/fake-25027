So far Ive been here 2 days straight on a one week trip to new york.  If that doesnt say much I dont know what will.  If youre on a tight budget visiting NYC (like me) this is a must.  Dumplings are good and filling... wonton soup is awesome, and the stuffed pancake with pork is amazing... just dont order the hot soy milk "soup" if youre expecting an actual soup...because its more like a warm bowl of soy milk... kind of what mommy gives you before going to bed.  Other than that, this place is gold... gonna head down there again for sure before leaving NY, for sure.
