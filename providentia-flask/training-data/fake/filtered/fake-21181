You will never be disappointed here.  This is the best Italian food in Philly, if not the country.  And the service is just as good as the food.  I love veal, and have had overcooked, chewy piccata at other places, but here the veal cuts like butter.  I'm sure the tiramisu is good, but I can't resist the cannoli - it is awesome.  Usually take some home with me, too.
