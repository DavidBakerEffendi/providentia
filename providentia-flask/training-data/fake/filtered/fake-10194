The food is very good, at least considering how cheap it is ($5-6 per entree makes it the best dinner deal in town). The service, though generally friendly, can be very slow.  I think it's because at busy times (i.e. dinner times) it's packed with people and they don't have enough cooks or waitstaff to keep things moving.  Also, they have two levels.  The main (upper) level is very pleasant but the basement (where you usually end up sitting) is kind of cold, dank, and unpleasant.   But overall, it's a great value and really good food.  Just avoid it during peak dinner times if you're in a hurry.
