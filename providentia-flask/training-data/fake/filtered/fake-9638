Hello folks! I'm sorry to report that this was a very mixed experience for me. I guess the large, wide bread (tasty) that is barely filled with meat (pastrami) left me guessing what all the rage was about?!? I expect raves when the filling is equal to or exceeds the width of the bread. I have had many sandwiches all over the USA that significantly exceeded my experience here. I would recommend looking elsewhere.
