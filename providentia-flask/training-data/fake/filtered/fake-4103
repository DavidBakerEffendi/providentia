One of the only "fancy restaurant" where I've looke around and seen people of many different walks of life enjoying a meal. There were full families, business types, young couples, old couples, college guy at the bar. You can spend conservatively and get a good deal of food. We ordered several appetizers, and beers, and were full. We had the single best waiter in the world. He stayed late past closing time, and let us sample wines, and scotches, and did not even hint that we should leave in a hurry, orthst he was fishing for a tip. Great atmosphere. Top notch decor, and yet colorful and fun. Also great for lunch.
