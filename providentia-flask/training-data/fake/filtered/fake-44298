Pickup service horrible.  I received a flyer in the mail from Concetta's, so I ordered some chicken wings and a salad from the restaurant for pickup.  When I went in, there was only one waiter.  He was clearly busy.  I stood at the front counter for some minutes, then the waiter comes over to the counter and doesn't even look at me, continues what he is doing and walks away.  Finally, I sat down in a chair off to the side.  It took probably 10 minutes for a girl to come out the back and ask me if I needed help. I explained I was here to pickup my food. She went to go get my food and another girl came out and asked me if I needed help, meanwhile the waiter came over to her to use the register, he commented oh I don't know what she is here for. Obviously I am here to patronize your restaurant....duh.  But, I will never again because apparently my patronage wasn't really needed or valued based on the time it took for someone to ask me if I needed help.   Plus, the wings were bland as well as the salad.
