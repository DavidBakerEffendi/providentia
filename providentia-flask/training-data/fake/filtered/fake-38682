My friends who took me here professed that they absolutely adored place (knew the menu by heart, ordered from there often, etc.). For a lebanese restaurant, it's quite upscale and the decor was nice despite it's out of the way location. Our waiter was a little off... when we ordered sangria for the table, he brought us one glass. When we asked for the pitcher, he kept asking if it was suppose to be for the table. I'm not sure what that even meant. I tried the hummus with jalepeno which was really delicious as were the amazing fries which come with this garlic dipping sauce. The pita was warm and fresh baked, and when I asked the manager to put some pre-bought cakes we had from Dominique Ansel Bakery in the fridge, he was very kind to do that for us. Overall, I would say this is a solid restaurant. Not sure if I would make a special trip just for it though.
