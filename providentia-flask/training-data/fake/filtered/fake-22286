How did quiet little West Lebanon get such a terrific Korean place?! We had a great caterpillar roll. Beautifully presented and the avocado melted in your mouth. Hot beef bibimbap was a large portion and delicious. Farmer's stir fry with tofu had loads of perfectly-cooked vegetables and tasty tofu. The small plates of vegetables as "apps" that came with the dinner were nicely done and gave a nice spread of spicy and sweet flavors. The decor was full of local flavor (lots of sketches by patrons/fans), and a wall of family-friendly kid pictures. The service was quite good, even though the place was packed.
