One of the best places for inexpensive dumplings and sesame pancakes - but greasy. The dumplings are made w/this sauce/spice which gives it flavor. And the sesame pancakes taste so fluffy, the ones with duck are so good. The food is greasy, but the portions are inexpensive AND filling (the most expensive thing is $4.00 and the dumplings are 8 for 2.50) . Â It was crowded when I went here on Friday night, and it has few chairs...but there was only an 8 minute wait for my order. It also got an A rating from the Dept of Sanitation, which means their cooking space is hygienic. Definitely go here!
