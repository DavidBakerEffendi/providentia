Today a couple friends and I decided to go to Grimaldi's. When I got there I was very skeptical and annoyed with the long line outside. But my friends talked me into standing in it because, "It goes really quick." and, "It's the "BEST" pizza in New York" Soooooo, we stood in the line (for 30 minutes) when we finally got inside, it was cramped and a bit uncomfortable but who am I to judge. Besides, it's the "BEST" pizza in New York, so I decided to grit and bare it. We started out with the Antipasto plate (and I really liked it). Okay so on to the pizza, it was really good. Was it the "Best" pizza in New York??? I am not sure. I mean what classifies it as the best? It was good but c'mon. The service was bad to say the least. Once you are in the door they try to get you out like a woman that's been in labor for 34 hours. I asked for water 40 times before I got it and my waiter seemed to be annoyed every time we asked for anything. I guess you should ask, "Should I go?" Well the answer, "Yes!" Grimaldi's is a staple in NY and I think that you should go just to say that you went, but please put your expectations in check. If you plan on having the "Best" pizza in New york, you may not find it here; and if you want the best service you also will miss it. But what you will find are interesting people to talk to in line, a cute little old man that will tell you are beautiful and good times with friends.
