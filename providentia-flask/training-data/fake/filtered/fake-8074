Out with the old and in with the new is not working for China Pan right now. I have been a customer for over 20 years. Since the change of ownership, the food quality has declined. Some of my favorite items on the menu have been deleted or changed. We received "extra on the house" food that was clearly left overs that they were going to throw out from the sushi bar. Too bad.
