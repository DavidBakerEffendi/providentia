Sometimes Yelp is about the food, sometimes it's about the service, but rarely is about the hard work and dedication that goes into running a small business. The food here wins every time, Â try their meatballs, eggplant, egg sandwiches. But even better than the food; you get to meet the man who makes it, designs it, rings it up and pays his state taxes. Brooklyn, support dedication, community and small business.
