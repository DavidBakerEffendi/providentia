Very casual, friendly owner burger joint. Tried for first time today, bacon jam fries delicious, had bacon jam burger and my husband had the classic burger, very good overall. My only complaints, and not to take away from a very good meal, were the following, the overpowering garlic in the burger, not so apparent when eating the burger as much as after the meal the severe stomach ache, just the garlic burn and (burps) that lasted the rest of the day, ease up on that. Number two, burgers were very well done even though medium rare was ordered, definitely dried out the burger a bit. Now these "complaints" are meant to be used as constructive not destructive comments, Â a good place to get your burger fix. I always believe to pay attention to the local family owned businesses in your area, they are there to please.
