Wish there were 1/2 stars, I'd rate it 2.5. Or I'd rate the food 4 and the service 2.   I've heard great things about Westville and was very excited to finally try it.   I was there for brunch on 3/20/11.  The food was very good.  The service lacked luster.  The surly woman who sat us (dark hair, dark glasses, you know who you are) couldn't have been more indifferent if she tried.  She was annoyed when we asked her about specific choices on the menu and even gave us attitude.  If I hadn't been as hungry as I was, I'd have left just because of her.  I'm actually regretting tipping the waitress as well as I did. .  There are enough restaurants in the city that have both good food and good service Probably won't go back to eat in but will try delivery that there isn't a reason to go to a restaurant and be insulted.
