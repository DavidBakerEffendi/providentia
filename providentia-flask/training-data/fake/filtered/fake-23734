Came here for drinks the other night before heading across the street to Hudson Clearwater for dinner (so can't really comment on the food). This is a newly opened restaurant, and seemed like it would be a great place to meet friends for dinner. The interior is very classily decorated, and has a cool/calm and inviting atmosphere. The bartenders make great drinks, and seem to take great pride in the preparation and presentation (as do many upscale bars/lounges in NYC). Overall, I will definitely be back here in the future for drinks / dinner.
