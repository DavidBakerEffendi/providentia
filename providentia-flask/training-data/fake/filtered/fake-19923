The food is amazing, but our hostess was very rude.  I own a business and I would not tolerate a member of my team who could be so rude to costumers.  We had brought to the attention of our hostess that we had missed a course for a five course new years eve meal and she informed us that we were incorrect and had to come back and tell us the "chef made a mistake" and we were right.   The better approach would have been to apologize and let us know she would look into it and get back to us............I am quite sure the other servers heard us bitch about her attitude and then we were offered another glass of wine on the house, so they tried to make up for their error.  Overall the food is great.
