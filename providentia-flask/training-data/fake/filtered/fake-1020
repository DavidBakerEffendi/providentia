As a Southerner from NC, I know good barbeque!  NC does have the BEST vinegar based pork BBQ anywhere to be found:) Visiting my daughter, she suggested we go check out this place, Morgan's Barbecue she had found.  We were greeted by a friendly staff - later in conversation about their method of preparing the sauce, we found out out waiter was from Lousiana and also was familiar with good Southern BBQ. I tried the pulled pork BBQ and the Brisket with green beans and mac and cheese. Having eaten a considerable amount of Texas beef BBQ and NC pork BBQ, I can attest that Morgan's certainly is true to the Texas style BBQ and Brisket. Their sauce was a bit on the sweet side for me but it is quite good. The BBQ itself is 100% true Texas style - rubbed in a tasty pepper mix that brings out the flavor of any slow cooked BBQ. Brisket was tender and had the same pepper based rub. I found the meal on the pricy side - certainly not in the range of prices we are used to in NC for the portions. This is true Texas BBQ so if you are in the mood check out Morgan's - your taste buds will jump for joy.
