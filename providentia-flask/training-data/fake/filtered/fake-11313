I just came back from spending 2 weeks in northern Italy. When I arrived back home I was delighted to discover the pizza at Eatly. I felt like I never left Florence. Try the lemon and porcine mushroom ravioli an appetizer. The pizza is super thin and will melt in your mouth. Incredibly fresh. Downside to this joint is the long line to get in, but it's worth the wait.
