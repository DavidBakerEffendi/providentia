We were greeted nicely by a server/host as we sat at he counter we ordered salad with steak which was good and the turkey burger also good. I had also ordered a chili which was just about the worst chili I ever had, so I took 2 spoonfuls and left the bowl full. What I found amusing is nobody bothered to ask how it was nor could we get our waters refilled. I know service is a thing of the pass but the basics I would think are still important to keep customers satisfied. I will give them another chance because the burgers looked marvelous.And maybe the staff wont have a chip on their shoulders this time.
