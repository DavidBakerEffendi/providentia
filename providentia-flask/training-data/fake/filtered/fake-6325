Best pizza in town.   Thin crust pizza with a great taste.  They just renovated the place in the last year or so. So everything is all nice and new.  It's a family restaurant so there are usually rowdy kids, and the environment is always busy. It's always hustle and bustle in here, but it's 100% worth it.
