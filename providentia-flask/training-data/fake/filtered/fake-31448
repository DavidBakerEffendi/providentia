I've eaten portuguese/brazilian style BBQ all over the country and Paul's BBQ is top notch! Had a sampling of various dishes and was impressed with all including the made to order BBQ chicken which was moist and very well seasoned, succulent ribs and my favorite the Picadinho. Paul uses the best cuts of pork and large shrimp and builds a masterpiece when it's all said and done. Cooked to order with all the fix'ns! If you're a soccer fan, he's always got the best games on the screen so that you can Â enjoy your meal while watching this great sport. Was also surprised that this restaurant offers free wi-fi so that you can check your email or surf the web while waiting for your meal to arrive at your table. Paul gave me a tour of the kitchen and it was the cleanest commercial kitchen I've ever seen! Be confident that when you visit Paul's BBQ, you will feel like family! I'll be back to eat some more of Paul's BBQ whenever I'm in the area!
