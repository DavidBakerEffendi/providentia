Luca's I had to go back!! I first order my appetizer I had the mozzarella Di bufala witch I loved because of the freshness of the chese and the sun dried tomatoes, prosciutto that melts in your mouth and thee other ingredients that make it perfect.. I then saw a nother table have the braised short rib so I gave it a try, I was surprised with the short rib laying in the tagine and wow it was tasty my mouth was having a party! I recommend everyone should go you'll have a nice experience ahead!!!!!!!!
