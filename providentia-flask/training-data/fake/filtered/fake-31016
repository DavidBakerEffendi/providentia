This is hands down the best restaurant I have ever eaten at. Everything I've ordered off the menu has made me go "oh my god" at the first taste. Service has always been great. Tonight, Travis was a great friendly face and knowledgable about the menu, like all my other servers have been. I come back here weekly!! And they have an awesome awesome beer selection that changes around all the time.
