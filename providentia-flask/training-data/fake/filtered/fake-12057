Service was good, but food was very disappointed. We ordered char and pork for entry, both are very salty and temperature wasn't right. I ordered char at other restaurants a couple of times and it's one of my favorite fish, but at this restaurant, it tastes fishy, not fresh. For pork, again, too salty and hard. It was like eating bacon or something. Both were $24-, not worth for this price. I definitely can find much better food at same price. I don't know why this restaurant was so popular and busy. It's ok just for drinks!! I don't eat junk food, I love fresh ingredients and organic. If you know what the good food is, I definitely DON'T recommend this restaurant.
