The old Khyber was more my speed, but I have to admit, despite my initial skepticism, the revised Khyber Pass Pub continues to be one of my favorite bars in the city. They still have one of the best happy hours in the city, albeit slightly more expensive than the old days and shorter (it used to go until 8), but let's not linger nostalgically on the past, but forge ahead with the new. The bathrooms are now cleaner. The serving staff is friendlier and more helpful. The beer list is longer. The food is excellent, but be forewarned, it is very rich. They do have light foods if you're on a diet, but it's hard to resist the more substantial offerings. I'm a regular here and I've tried most everything on the menu. The duck, cashew nut and jelly sandwich is a unique option that I would recommend. The crayfish etouffe is a bit too pungently fishy for my tastes, but if you're into that, it's another rarity on the menu. All of their soups and chilies are excellent with portions large enough to suffice for a meal. Brisket chili is my usual choice. The hush puppies are a great appetizer with unique dipping sauces. These are all on the specials board, but I've found the specials board almost never changes, which is one negative thing in my opinion. Most everything on the regular menu is great and for the most part will exceed your expectations although I personally found the Cornmeal Crusted Gulf Oysters to be boring and the Muffuletta to be stuffed with meat to the point of disgustingness and not very authentic based on what I've had in Nola. I couldn't finish it and wished I hadn't tried. The atmosphere here is rustic and casual. All told the Khyber Pass Pub is a great dinner spot.
