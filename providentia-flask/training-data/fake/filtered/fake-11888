The service here is top-notch.  The guys who served us were awesome; super down to earth, reliable, friendly, and at our every request.  Among the best service I have ever gotten anywhere. Every dish we ordered was good - I have salad every day, and yet I found the arugula different and perfectly seasoned. The mixed seafood with lobster came in a huge portion and everything was delicious and flavorful. For dessert, we shared the family style strawberry shortcake which was more than enough to feed 6 of us, especially after a meal here. This place offers great value for large groups and I would definitely come back to try some of the other dishes! I would strongly recommend reservations. It was so nice to walk in and here, "come this way, your table is ready"
