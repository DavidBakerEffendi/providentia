My friend and I recently ate here.  I have eaten here many times before and service was never anything close to efficient or even ok, but this time service was atrocious.  We were left waiting 30 minutes for our food, while others who arrived after us, received their food promptly (I must also note that these people had fairly complicated skillet orders, and eggs benedict, etc...) (we ordered simple french toast, pork roll and pancakes).  When our food arrived it was cold.  When we told the waitress, she passed our food along to the manager who took it back to the kitchen.  When he returned we saw him place his hands on our food to check the temperature.  This grossed us out so much that we decided not to eat the food brought back to our table.  When we went to pay our check I complained to the manager, who offered to do nothing and quite frankly seemed to care less about our situation.  They took the french toast off our bill (the food item that was touched by the restaurant staff), but we still had to pay for the pancakes which I never ate and the soft drinks (which we drank and I didn't mind paying for).  The manager just tried to get us out of the restaurant, he didn't want us to make a scene.  Overall I was so disatisfied with the customer service that I will never return here again.
