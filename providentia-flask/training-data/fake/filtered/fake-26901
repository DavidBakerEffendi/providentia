I was super hungry the other day and my friend and I thought Butcher Bar would be a good spot to satiate my hunger pangs.  I've heard good things about the place and was ultimately surprised at how bad the BBQ was. I ordered 3 items ala carte.   Brisket, burnt ends and the pork belly.   The brisket was gray with no smoke rings at all... seemed like they boiled the meat instead of barbequing it.   The "burnt ends", burnt brisket ends where not burnt at all... just cubed pieces of brisket.   The pork belly was okay, I mean it's really hard to get pork belly wrong. I didn't get a chance to try the other items, like the pulled pork or ribs. If you call yourself a bbq place with word SMOKE emblazoned on the side of your building you should offer a good brisket or not offer it at all. NYC is a BBQ town and there's plenty better. 1/2 star for what they call brisket. 4 stars for the service and atmosphere.
