Normally, I'm not allowed to eat my lunch at Pommes Frites.  This is a personal restriction, based on thigh to denim ratios, but I was really pissy  this one day, so I had the Poutine - AKA disco fries.  Well, let me tell you, they rock!   Fried potatoes, chicken gravy,&  cheese. What?  Did somone say extra salt?  What a perfect guilty treat.  Get  the extra hot sauce & chalk it up to penance....
