I had dinner last night at Graffiti to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Graffiti, hands down, was THE BEST CULINARY EXPERIENCE I have ever had.  Jehangir Mehta was the most down to earth chef I have ever met. When you know of his credentials, it's even more impressive.  Although the place was tiny, it gave the restaurant a cozy feel as if you were in someone's living room having dinner with a lot of friends.  The food is paramount not having sufficient words to give it justice.  Just go - you won't be disappointed! Since it is small, you may need to call in for a reservation.  It's worth the wait.
