Good Recommendation from a friend and Yelp reviews.  Horrified that they can give this place a 4*s First there was only 2 adults at the restaurant we ordered Mariquitas starter.  That came cold after 15min.  We usually get it hot fresh.   The dishes we ordered the Ropa Vieja was just terrible, red tomato sauce with pepper, eek!!!! Just terrible and taste worse! We had the Lechon Asado was not as we used to have Cuban food.   Very bland, not the usual delicious home cooking Cuban dishes we used to get.   They are Expensive.  for the above we paid $45.00.  Not worth it.  This is impossible to be Rahway prices, this is NY prices.   Not worth the money and not worth the taste.  The foods tastes like they are frozen, defrosted food and offered to guest.   Very bad night!
