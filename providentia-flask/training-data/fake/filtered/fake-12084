Love it, love it, love it!!!  Diner has everything you want in a Brooklyn restaurant, with out too much of the hispter sass.  The bartenders are awesome, relaxed and fun, and they make a good drink to boot.  The food is always good, although I have trouble remember the ingredients to the ever changing dishes as the servers recite the menu and write it on the table... but it's okay, just remember one, order the meal, and you won't be disappointed!
