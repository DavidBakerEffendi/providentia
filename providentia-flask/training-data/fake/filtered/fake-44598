Food and wine were good here. Locanda Verde's attitude, hype and posh clientele get in the way a bit of the quality it offers. We were faced with waiting an hour, so went down the street for a few drinks then came back. We were seated fairly quickly upon return. There were loads of very drunk Brits buzzing around the bar. The bartender even cut several of them off. This made the restaurant rather noisy and feel more like a pub. We ordered the steak tartar, which was excellent but incredibly rich. So rich that we abruptly experienced a food coma shortly thereafter and canceled our ravioli order. Loads of great reds on the wine list.
