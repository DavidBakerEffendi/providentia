First let me say I've visited tunxis grill 10+ times for both lunch and dinner and was always blown away- awesome food, great atmosphere and prompt service. We visited for dinner this evening and we could not have had a worse experience. Our waitress was the best part of a very poor evening. I must blame all of my issues on the kitchen. Our food took FOREVER  - 20-25 minutes for our app and another 30 minutes for our dinner. Both of our dinners were not tasty. My husbands meatball grinder was bland and overloaded with peppers. My crab cakes were inedible - took one bite of each and spit each bite back out in my napkin. Not sure whether it was bad fish or the spices were so obscene- but could not keep it down. One of my sides was bland and the other was very salty. I mixed the two so I could have something to eat!!  The waitress didn't charge us for my meal after she saw I didn't eat the crab cakes and told her they were "off" and she should let the kitchen know. I'm very surprised because we love this place and have direct others to eat there also. We may try it one more time in a few weeks so hopefully it was just a bad night.   Writing in hopes management will see and fix the issue(s) - so few awesome places on the berlin tnpk these days.
