Atmosphere is an a+.  Nice local place place with very friendly servers.  The food Was not so good.  I had the Cioppino with white sauce. The white sauce was  a watery oil blend without flavor. Someone else in our group had the calamari and it was very tender.  The meatballs tasted burnt.  It seemed as if they were fired in old oil. I would not have written this review as we were enjoying the evening with friends and the servers were so friendly.  BUT, how do you top off a bad meal with an ice cold cup of coffee?  As a server when you pour the coffee and realize its cold and may have been sitting there for hours why wouldn't you make a fresh pot? Sorry, but not worth the trip.
