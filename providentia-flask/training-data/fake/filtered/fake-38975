Yes, it IS small, but don't let that fool you.  The food is amazing, the place is cozy and comfortable...very laid back.  And they were able to accommodate our party of six on a Saturday night (NOTE:  arrive at 6:00.  Unfashionable, maybe, but it's the only time to score a sitting for a large party.)  The hostess was very welcoming, and let us sit and wait for two latecomers even though she informed us the policy was not seating incomplete parties.   We knew about the BYOB and cash-only policy before we came (and BYOB was one of the main reasons for choosing Tartine) so there were no awkward surprises.  We were all very, very appreciative of the informal-but-attentive service (water bottles replaced as soon as they were emptied), even when the room filled up and things became rushed (for the staff, not for the diners).   The food?  Outstanding.  Fresh, beautifully presented, thoughtfully prepared with excellent ingredients...a quality and standard not expected from the size and vibe of this place.  Pacing was perfect; our starters arrived soon after we ordered, and everyone was served at the same time, but there was no rush for us to finish before entrees came.  We all ordered from the regular menu and we all enjoyed everything (there was much sharing of plates).   Will definitely go again (not in a party of six...this was a 30th birthday celebration), and again, and again, even if we have to wait for a table on another visit.
