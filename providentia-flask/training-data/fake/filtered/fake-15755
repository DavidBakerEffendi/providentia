I live in Madison and have visited Angelonis approximately 5 times. I'm not sure where all the negativity is coming from. Is there a wait sometimes, yes,, all good restaurants have a wait,, this place is a quality, local establishment,, the service has NEVER been snobby,, the staff is indeed Â busy, but pleasant,, if you are going here to have your napkin folded every ten seconds, you're in the wrong place,,, during our last visit, in addition to the delicious pizza I had a wonderful hot pepper and sausage appetizer that was simply tremendous,, my son had a chicken scarpiella (sp?) dish that was not only plentiful but rivaled some of the dishes I've experienced on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. Great stuff,, our waitress was extremely pleasant, made helpful suggestions,, from my 75 year old father to my 11 year old daughter,,,we can not wait until our next visit! Plus it is a BYOB making it even more attractive,,
