Had a delicious lunch yesterday at Escape on Bloomfield Ave. in Montclair. (I think the name of the place means Escape as in Escape to Food Heaven. JMHO) I had the pricey Evian water in the big bottle and drank every bit; it was as cold and refreshing as the well water I have at home. The maitre d was personable and welcoming. Lots of tempting choices on the menu. I had scallops with mushrooms and okra, and a root beer float for desert. My friend had a pulled chicken sandwhich, in a roll made on the premises, served with cold slaw that I was surprised to learn had been flavored with jalapeno peppers. Since she couldn't finish it, I helped. So good. Our food was beautifully prepared and served by friendly staff. A sophisticated, subtle decor: two brick walls with great texture, great goblets for water or your own wine, black and white photos featuring the farms that supply the chef, Bryan Gregg, with the ingredients for his savory, and surprising creations. The pris fixe of 3 choices was $15, which meant smaller, but certainly satisfying portions. When my friend and I left, relaxed and full, I felt like I had eaten the best food I've had in years. If this place wasn't 50 miles in lots of traffic from where I live in Hillsborough, I would be eating at Escape every week.
