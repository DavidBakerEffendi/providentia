I go to DelMonicos for their happy hour. It's Monday through Friday, 4-7 and Sunday from 1-5 (They got rid of the happy hour at night). They have a 4$ tapas menu that includes small appetizer items such as boneless buffalo wings, tuna, tomato mozzarella and prosciutto salad, clams, stuffed mushrooms, shrimp and scallops, French onion soup, chicken noodle soup, penne vodka... Just to name a few. They also have 3$ house wine and all draft beer, 5$ sangria, and 6$ martinis. Oh and the vibe is pretty chill on Sundays to watch football which also includes $1 sliders! The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that the service is just okay and the food is decent but not great.
