This food was terrible! The service was decent but the main server (tall Asian man) was dismissive. The food was bland and flavorless. When we attempted to speak to the server to change our order. He assured us the 100-200 orders of pad Thai is taken everyday. He did not attempt to remedy the situation. Â The only highlight of this meal was the Thai Ice tea. The ambiance was beautiful ,however, it did not help the food. Please pray for the chefs in the kitchen to the flavor Gods.
