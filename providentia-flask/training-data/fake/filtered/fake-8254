I ate here at the end of February for the first time. It was around 5pm on a weeknight and it wasn't too busy when my dinner partner and I showed up. As we wrapped up our meal there were a considerable amount of people there. We got: 1. Onion rings: the best I've ever had... seriously. the special sauce complements the batter and onions very well (slightly creamy and mustardy). you can take a bite of the ring and the the onion doesn't pull out of the batter --- THANK YOU LORD. 2. Falafel sandwich: big portion for the price. it wasn't bad but it didn't wow me. the falafel tasted like the kind you make out of the boxed mix from the grocery store. 3. Brussel sprouts: i am a huge fun of brussel sprouts in general and these didn't disappoint. watch out for taking a bite with too many peppers because your mouth will be on fire like mine was. sprouts were very flavorful, well seasoned, not too soft or tough.. pretty damn delicious! 4.side salad: for a side salad this was a good sized salad, especially when 10$ gets you a few pieces of lettuce elsewher
