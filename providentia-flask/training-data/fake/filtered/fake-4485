Cantina always seems to be busy so I avoided it. I choose not to wait over 30 minutes for a table.  Last week, we were able to work our way in with less than a 10 minute wait.   Great pitchers of margaritas and decent food.  The servers were a little un-enthusiastic for my taste.  However, Cantina attracts a solid "hipster" crowd so I guess it's fitting.   When I asked what the specials were - I was told by the server to "read the board".  Not the best way to present your specials. Overall, it was a decent experience and fairly priced.  I'd definitely go back - especially for a pitcher of margaritas.
