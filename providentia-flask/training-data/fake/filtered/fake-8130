Overrated. I went to this restaurant (BASTA) with my sister after seeing the reviews on Yelp. Unfortunately, the service is pathetic. The food takes much longer than normal to get out. Indeed my sister and I timed it: it took 30 minutes between the appetizer and the entree for the table next to us. Once we realized this, we asked them to bring out our appetizers but to pack up our entrees to go. It took over 45 minutes from the time we arrived to the time we obtained the entree! Unbelievable! It is not the only place that makes food from scratch, but it is about the only place I've been to where there is a quiet assumption that customers have nothing else to do but sit in a restaurant waiting for service. I've been to fresh-food restaurants with a similar philosophy, even in a place with a cut-throat restaurant industry, such as New York. And I admit I have never come across anything as slow as this. Slow service is not synonymous with careful service: don't conflate the two! The food, while good-tasting, was not off-the-charts good either. First crime: the calamari was covered in hot sauce! That's a definite red flag and it made my sister and I laugh out loud. The flip side, however, was the polenta I had here. It is the best polenta I have ever had (thick, rich, creamy). The rest of the food was good, too - the pasta dishes were excellent. However, the waiter kept coming over every 5 minutes to ask how the calamari tasted, if we were enjoying the food, etc. I think he, too, was embarrassed about the snail-slow service and was trying to pass the time, but he soon became a pest. It was an utter disaster. As a place to eat, Basta is decent because the food is good. As a restaurant, it is a disaster because of the service! What a shame!
