I give them 4 star and recommend the place. This place is cheap, the food is authentic, and their serving speed is very fast. I go to the place quite often, mostly because the price.  During weekday, the lunch menu is $5.25-$6.25(if i remember correctly).  And they also have 3dish with soup, and sweet soup for about $22.  These price are hard to beat around the area.   And they let me order off lunch menu when it's not lunch hour. Their dim sum on weekend is also  very authentic.  It used to be super crowed on weekend and you have to wait 10, 20 minutes before you get seated.  However after the of Qin Dynasty opened, which is across rt 46, their business went down quite a bit.   As for food quality, I think they are authentic but only average.   Nothing i ate there is particularly bad or disappointing.   The same time, nothing i ate there has a wow factor either.
