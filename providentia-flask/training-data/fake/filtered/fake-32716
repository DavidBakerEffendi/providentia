A friend brought me here to try their infamous Baby Jesus Cake... Oh Baby Jesus it was good!  The food was excellent, although I found the Crispy parmigiana Brussels sprouts a little burnt so it tasted bitter.  Tried their Margherita and Ricotta pizza, both good.  Only problem?  It's a long walk from the 30th Ave subway station.
