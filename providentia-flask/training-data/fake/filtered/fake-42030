after waiting over 30 mins for 2 order of take out i finally gaved up,cashier was rude saying i was at fault for never asking how long it would take them to cook,i been to many places and orders would be out within 15 mins and all i asked for was just a simple beef chow fun,and a wonton soup.this place is just over rated with bad service.
