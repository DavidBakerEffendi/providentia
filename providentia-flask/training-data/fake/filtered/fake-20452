I ate at Jack's Wife Freda several times. Every time I am more impressed with the great atmosphere, the excellent customer care, and the excellent food. The staff attended to me as if Â I was the only customer (while the place was packed). The serving time was prompt with no delays, and matched my order to the detail (with all the extras I asked for). The presentation of the dishes were beautiful and it was obvious it was done with care and paying attention to the little details. The food was delicious, and was in the right size. I loved everything I ate including the coffee and desserts! I will definitely go there as many times as I can, to experience other menu dishes (which all looked so good), and to enjoy a relaxing and great atmosphere. A place to come back to!
