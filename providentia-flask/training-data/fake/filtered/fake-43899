I am so impressed with cozy, comfy atmostphere inside and super friendly staff.  Unfortunately it was raining so we had to eat indoors but it's was still great.  Our server/the owner recommended great beers and the best food.  We got the fondue (which says its for two but fed 4 of us) and shared a great Mac and cheese.  So grateful to be better places opening up in this neighborhood!
