This is the worst representation of authentic Italian food. How a place like this survives in a location such as "The Italian Market" is beyond me. Lousy food, terrible service...and no espresso/cappuccino machine. What a scam! Â I feel the worse for the people who think the food is great, because they dont know what good Italian cooking is. Bottom line...this place SUCKED! Yes I was born in Italy, I'm a 100% Sicilian from Sciacca. Thats the other thing I forgot...not one person that worked there spoke Italian, I know because I asked. They are wanna-be's!...SCAM I tell ya!!!!!
