This is worth a trip to Hartford from the Hudson Valley. Everything about the experience was par excellence. The wait staff is terrific. Our server was fun, upbeat, informative and punctual. They all made us feel like family. Dishes suggested were as described - the sweet potato ravioli was heavenly. Loved the butternut squash salad - right down to the last pistachio. The bread serving has smoked tomato butter spread - unique! Menu has great variety including some well-known items like chicken parm. Kudos to the chef - tasty and good presentation! cappuccino was super and came with a rockcandy stirrer! Marvelous. Lovely atmosphere. Furnishings just right! Â Lunch prices were very reasonable. Thanks for the biscotti! Hope to be back soon! And to use the patio in the summer!!!
