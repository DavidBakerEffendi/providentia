I had stopped by after some drinks at the owner's place next door 116 Crown and was intrigued by the cool vibe the place was giving off. I had the PLT and it was fairly good but I cant justify the price tag for the amount of food I received. They either need to up the portions or lower the price, I may visit again to try a different sandwich as their menu looks quite good but on a college student budget this is a once a semester type treat.
