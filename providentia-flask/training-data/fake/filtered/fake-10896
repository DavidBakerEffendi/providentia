I don't do this often, but I saw a review mentioning the possibility of food poisoning. I live near here and, as a student, often need a quick meal to fill me up on my way to class. I've eaten at La Cosinita about 30 times in the last two months and haven't once become sick because of their food. This is a good thing, because the food they make is spectacular. Every dish is not only delicious but it has character. A burrito is not just chicken, beans and rice - they add their own wonderful salsa to give it a kick. The Al Pastor is not just pork - they add pineapple the way it's supposed to be done. And their veggie tamales are out of this world (great if you like spicy dishes). In the Downtown New Haven area you will not find a family-owned Mexican establishment with comparable food, prices and service. I couldn't give this restaurant anything less than five stars.
