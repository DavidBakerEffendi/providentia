The owners are the most friendly and accommodating hosts in town.  You won't have trouble finding them, either; They will greet you at the door. If you go to Sazon for only one thing, the chocolates are a must-have.  There is hot chocolate and there are chocolate truffles.  Ask the waiter/owner for the special chocolate menu.  He makes it every night from the raw ingredients (you'll see them displayed on the bar).  Savor them.  Each item is complex, delicious and worth the experience. The food is delicious and affordable.  The effort and planning put into every dish is evident as well.  Some things are very unique and the presentation is always charming. My favorite dish is the Asado Negro.  Beef sweetened with a carmelized sugar coating.  I order it almost every time we visit. The atmosphere is happy and clean.  It is BYOB, and if you bring a bottle of beer or wine, they will open and pour it for you while they chill the rest. I can tell it is growing in popularity.  These days, I would recommend reservations, especially on the weekends. See you there!
