Three cheers for Jungsik as it immediately joins the pantheon of NYC's very finest dining establishments! Jungsik is a knock out, home run! My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night and we were blown away. One of the best meals we've ever had. The service, the food, the presentation, the brilliant way the menu has been constructed, the ingenious and endless Amuse Bouches... it was a dining tour de force. We had the five course menu. Everything was delicious. The portion sizes were nice, more than just "tastes". The pacing was excellent. I've nearly fallen asleep trying to get through a multi-courser at Bouley or Daniel. But, at Jungsik, the pace moved along just right. Not hurried, but never lagging. (And, yes, Jungsik is in that league.) We had a waiter that deserves his own review, if not his own restaurant. He must have gone to English butler school or something. He was a hoot in a really good way. If you get him, you'll know exactly what and who I mean. We loved him! Only a few things you should know in advance... Â  - The tastes are very korean. Some times hot and spicy. Sometimes with tastes of sea weed, oysters, etc. Be ready for that. - The atmosphere is beautiful, but in a very understated, minimalist way. Think Perry Street, not Bouley. - The wine list by-the-glass is a bit lacking. We can't wait to go back! Bravo Jungsik!
