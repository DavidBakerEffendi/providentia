I used to love the food, the quaint, romantic vibe of the restaurant and of course, the BYOB.  We came to La Sirene for our anniversary because we always were guaranteed to have a wonderful evening. Not this time. The place has changed and unfortunately not for the better. Okay, so no BYOB. Not happy about that especially since we lugged two of our own bottles from Queens but I understand. Another change was  the atmosphere in the place.  The decor was not as cozy and romantic as it used to be. Also the waiter we had was wearing jeans and tee shirt and playing loud reggae music. I love reggae but when I am eating in a expensive French restaurant I don't think it's the right choice of music. Now to the food. Thankfully that was still delicious but  have the portions gotten smaller or is it my imagination ?  Also, they were stingy with the bread. I hate that. All in all, La Sirene used to be a great place to go for a special night out. Now, they are just like all of the other overpriced restaurants in the city.
