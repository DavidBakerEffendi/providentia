Oysters, mussels, fondue, ravioli, and even the bread were all incredible! My boyfriend still raves about how good the mussels and oysters were. Bartender was very nice, and the coat checker searched the whole restaurant for me when I dropped my phone out of my pocket without noticing. They are also open super late so it's a great place to go if you're a night owl! You will, however, be waiting for about an hour even at 10 and 11pm. But it is totally worth the wait and you can always enjoy a drink or 2 in that time.
