I have been eating here since 2011 and I can honestly say this is one of best and most friendliest pizzeria's I have ever ate at. Customer service is excellent and I have tried almost everything on menu I think the pepperoni roll,the wings  and the desserts are my favorites.  I heard they just introduced TURKEY BURGERS, cannot wait to go in and try them.  They are family owned business, so you get a family atmosphere when you walk in. If everyone who has tried New World food and wrote a review there will be overwhelming number of positive reviews on here, I guarantee that.  Fridays and Saturdays are their busiest days so people who order need to have an open mind and understand that. If you have not tried New World I strongly recommend you go in and try it.
