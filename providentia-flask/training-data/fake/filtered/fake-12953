I recently returned to Calandra's Village restaurant for the 3rd time; Â My first 2 experiences were just OK. thought maybe it was just 2 bad nights.... WRONG!! This time was worse!! The food was horrible!! To explain it best.... Olive Garden is more Italian than the food they were serving... The bill for me, my husband & 4 year old son (NO Alcoholic beverages) was over $100. (WITHOUT TIP) & trust me we are always willing to pay & tip well with no questions... but when the food SUX and u pay that kind of money... it's very ANNOYING!!! NEVER AGAIN!!!
