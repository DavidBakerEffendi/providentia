Sandwich Theory is the best.  It's the best!  I've been coming here for a few years and I always try the specials, or whatever is new on the menu - I'm NEVER disappointed!  Ben (works/owns? the place) is a really funny guy and always has creative and clever ways to tweak dishes, whether it be a breakfast burrito or a Cobb salad.  He really puts the theory in Sandwich Theory.  Go Ben, and go ST!!!
