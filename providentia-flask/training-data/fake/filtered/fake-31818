My bigest regret in Life? That I don't get back to the Ivy Inn regularly anymore! Okay - so that might be stretching it a bit. But for almost ten years I spent a month every summer in Princeton. The Ivy was an almost nightly affair. Princeton is a pretty buttoned up kind of place, but the Ivy was somewhere I could always go and let it all hang out, so to speak. The price is right on the beer. Justin, Mikey and the rest of the gang that run the place are cool, make you feel right at home and know how to take care of you. What's really nice about the place is that you can find everything you're looking for. If I wanted to just chill out with my friends and colleagues (all a group of professors) at a table and shoot the breeze, it was an excellent place to do it. If I was up for some pool, there's never any shortage of competition and conversation at the pool table. If I needed to tie one on, knock back a few shots and sing karaoke till my voice was hoarse, I had ample opportunity. Seriously though, some of my best memories are from the Ivy. When you want somewhere to go in Princeton that's not like everywhere else, when you want a place where you can just relax, chill out and have fun - the Ivy Inn is the place to do it! I don't think I've ever had more good times, in one place, for so long than being at the IVY Inn!
