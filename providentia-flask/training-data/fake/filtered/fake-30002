I wish I could post a picture of the aaloo kati roll that I ordered. First it was cold and as soon as I took a bite there was no taste at all. It basically had a mashed boiled potato with absolutely no masala and a lot of onions wrapped up in a maida paratha. Â Plus they charged me $9.95 for it!!! Not going back again!
