Hands down my favorite restaurant in New York City.  (And this is saying something, as I've lived here for ten years.)  It is unfortunately not in season at the moment -- waiters have ASSURED me that it has not disappeared forever -- but the Buta Kakuni (simmered lump pork) is a most amazing edible gift from God.  Imagine meat that literally melts in your mouth... Also fantastic is the ankimo (monkfish liver with ponzu) that is also unfortunately out of season until the colder months.  As of summer '07, I've been enjoying the Uni delicacy and the old standby Sakuraebi (tiny shrimp and mitsuba) soba/udon.  Also incredible is any rice dish with 15 grains substituting for the traditional white.  A few bucks extra but worth it.
