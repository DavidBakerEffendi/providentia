I would give this place zero stars if Yelp would let me. 1) They ran out of tuna. At 7pm. At a sushi restaurant?? 2) Took 56 minutes from ordering to getting food. No comp, apologies, or anything. 3) Rolls were tiny, overpriced, and had barely any actual fish inside of them. Rice was soggy, sticky (not in the good way). My yellowtail looked grey. I've actually never had such a bad sushi experience in my life. Thank god I don't live in Burlington, so will never have to pass this god forsaken place again.
