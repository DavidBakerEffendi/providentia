I was there last time with my family and experienced the worst service ever. The waitresses weren't very friendly and one of the waitresses was taking shots with another customer. I didn't think that was very professional for a classy looking Yakitori place. Our server barely checked up on us and they've forgot some of our food. The food is average for the price. Could be better.
