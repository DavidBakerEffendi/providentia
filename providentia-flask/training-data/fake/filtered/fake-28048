Really great food -- just not really into the whole stuffy atmosphere (although, it quite possibly could have been the people I went with). It was neat experience and you definitely didn't leave hungry. We didn't get to choose our meal as we were there to celebrate a birthday and had a planned menu. To be honest, it's been about a year since I have been there, so, I don't quite remember what we had! Yikes!! But I would love to try it again. Perhaps being with different people with make it more enjoyable. :)
