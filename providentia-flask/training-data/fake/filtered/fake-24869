First of all the place is TINY my girlfriend and i felt like we were sitting on top of each other.  The food was bad the pernil had no flavor at all and was very greasy. the rice was not cooked through  and the beans were salty. this place was recommended by a good friend... apparently they have to taste buds. i would never go again
