A hot , humiliating and uncomfortable experience if you're older or without beautiful people in tow.  I've brought and recommended this place to younger friends and had a good experience.   However, I went with four male friends my own age - early fifties - and the four of us were ostracized and squished into the "VIP" room, a tiny, sweaty hole complete with supplies, and curtains drawn to hide our hideousness from the young and comely.  The restaurant, however, remained half empty.  We could easily have been accommodated without showing such disrespect.
