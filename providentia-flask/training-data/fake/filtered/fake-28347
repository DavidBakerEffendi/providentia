Taverna Kyclades is truly what Greek food in Astoria / LIC is all about. As a loyal fan of Opa! Opa! for years, migrating with carloads of friends hungry for souvlaki and gyro from the Bronx, Opa was the gold standard for me. Until I discovered Kyclades. Firstly, don't be thrown off by the wait, when you're talking about the best of something, there's going to be alot of people clamoring for their Greek salads, impeccable cold dips, and perfectly grilled meat and fish, for sub-market costs. To quench the clamoring, the lovely Greek woman who greets you at the door, and is extremely good at her job, hands you some wine and tells you to have a drink while you wait. Never saw that anywhere, and hooked me from the first time. Last night was my 4th visit, and as always, there's some new thing I discover there and swear will be the only thing I order next time because I over-ordered. First, it was the char-broiled, yet somehow impeccably juicy chicken kabob, the size of my forearm, and served with their tzatziki. The time after that, the Greek style shrimp, with a light tomato sauce, crumbled feta and large broiled shrimp that combined to form a somewhat melted, feta-ey tomato cream sauce while the grilled shrimp bathed in it, really good stuff. Last night, it was the swordfish kabob. Basically everything I said about the chicken, but better if that's possible. Tender in the middle, charred on the edges, and fall apart flaky, with a dollop of tzatiki, doesn't get any better. It also comes with a nicely prepared rice pilaf, loaded with flavor and not dry at all. The dessert is a custard wrapped in filo, smothered with honey and cinnamon, that creates the perfect sweet bite after all the savoriness. And it's complimentary, but I would gladly pay for it. All in all, go with a group, have some wine, and have a great time at Astoria's best Greek spot, hands down.
