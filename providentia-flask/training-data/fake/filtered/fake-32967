Love Mompou, perfect place to go for good food and the BEST sangria you will ever try.  For some reason it doesnt even give me a headache the next day.  Love it.  Also the tapas are wonderful just make sure you ask for the double serving if you're sharing otherwise you will leave hungry.... Tres leches is the best I have ever had.  EVER. Atmosphere is modern and neat, perfect date place, or perfect girls night out place.   Just love it here, staff always pleasant as well!  It may be smaller than some of the other spots in Ironbound but it really is great.
