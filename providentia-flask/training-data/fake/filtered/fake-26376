Great ambiance &bread! 1st visit enjoyed some kind of salad months ago. Returned about 2 wks.ago,ordered salad Nicoise,started to eat& saw anchovies, which I do NOT care for,they were NOT listed in description I , Informed server&manager, told 'traditional Nicoise salad'!not acceptable ridiculous explanation ! Listing all ingredients a must, hope menu revised!
