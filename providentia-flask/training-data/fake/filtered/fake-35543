New haven has great pizza, but Modern is my favorite.  The pizza is amazing!  Our favorite is the white pie with fried eggplant.  So good and best served with some Foxon Park White Birch Beer.  They need to figure out a better way to take names when you're sitting in the waiting room.  People just cut in front of one another and it's pretty annoying.  Other than that, you can't get much better than Modern.
