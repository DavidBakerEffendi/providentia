I wish I could give it a higher rating, but it was too mixed to do so. Unlike others who have reviewed it, I never heard of the place. I tried to drop into Peter Luger's but could not get in edgewise, and had to look around. I pulled out my iPhone, hit Yelp, and found this place a couple of blocks away with great reviews. The place is as funky as they get. An old trailer type diner that must have been early 20th century. A lot of atmosphere, but it was so unlevel that it was hard to stay on the hard wooden seats. Wait staff was friendly and helpful, but seemed focused on something other than service. People - apparently friends of the folks working there - kept shuffling in and out of the kitchen, making me wonder about what was going on in there. Meanwhile, we ordered a kale salad and a flatbread appetizer. The salad was OUTSTANDING. Kale with goat cheese and dried cranberries. Unbelievable. The flatbread was remarkable. Then we waited for something that must have been close to an hour. When we got a little more persistent, our food suddenly appeared - steak, chicken and pasta dishes - and most of it was cold. Apparently the waiter had simply forgotten to check, and with all the people in and out of the kitchen, it just got pushed aside. They reheated the steaks and brought a fresh pasta; it was not that good, certainly nothing exceptional. The waiter readily knocked the entrees off the bill and gave a couple of complimentary desserts, bringing the bills for four people down from around $200 to about half that. All said, if the food had been consistent and the service better, it would certainly have rated three or possibley four Yelp stars, but to be fair, we had a disappointing dinner, made bearable only by the discount and the laughs.
