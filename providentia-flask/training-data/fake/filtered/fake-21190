It started with a nasty bartender snapping at my girlfriend when she nicely asked if he heard that she wanted a Gibson martini as opposed to olives " I heard you" he said. Then our inexperienced waitress asked how our short ribs were. We ate none of it and didn't complain and when she asked why we didn't eat it we told her it was very dry (dry short ribs??) and she said "I've never heard THAT before" in a snotty tone. Next she came out and in her silly way, interrupted our conversation to say that "since your short ribs were VERY dry the chef would like to offer you desert "which we politely declined. We were a party of three and we ordered Prime Rib Tuesday. It was inedible, as raw and tough as can be. So hard to believe and so disappointing. We didn't say a word, we paid our $250 bill and left never to return. The space is beautiful and the Pellegrino was cold and refreshing. Sorry to sound like a snob but it was HORRIBLE.
