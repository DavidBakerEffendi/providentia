One of the best meals I've had in Manhattan.  Holds 20% of their tables for walk-ins.  What's not to like? My faves: - Sheep's Milk Ricotta...  Best thing on the menu.  Only 4 1/2 stars though, as the bread was a little burnt (it's supposed to be grilled, but this was actually burnt in parts).  They brought us more, and it was perfect the second time. - Lamb meatball sliders - Pumpkin Agnotti - Beef Spare Ribs (a special)
