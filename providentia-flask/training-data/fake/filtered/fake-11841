Well, first of all we were going to go to Carmine's but they did not accept reservations, so someone recommended Tony's instead. That being said, I would definitely wait at Carmine's next time. The place was loud and crowded. The waiter had a heavy accent, yet non-Italian as one may expect at an "authentic Italian" restaurant, if you added something or changed your mind, he became annoyed. All he wanted was a quick turnover on his tables.....the menu says each plate serves 2-3 people, so with 4 people we decided to order a pasta dish (since each entree comes solo, no sides), chicken piccata, and a calamari/shrimp combo appetizer. The calamari was tough. What a disappointment. I mean rubbery, chewy tough. Seemed to take a while before the entrees came after that. Don't know if that was the crappy waiters fault or the kitchen. The chicken came with 4 half breasts, and the pasta was a single piling across the plate, not the heaping platefuls we were used to at Carmine's. Did I mention that the food was luke warm at best? It seems the suaces had flavor but the temperature of the food took away from that.Very disappointing. Once we had placed our entree orders our waiter became non-existent. We had to flag him down to ask for dessert and then again to get the check to get the heck out of there. I do have to say, the tiramasu was authentic and one of the best I have had. And I have sampled a lot across the country. Dessert was the saving grace with this place. It, too, was enough for the table to share. In closing, I would say for approximately 29.00 an entree, even though it is supposed to be enough for 2-3, it was disappointing. I would def. reco, the wait at Carmine's over this joint.
