First to the reply that they went b/c his girlfriend wanted a steak dinner, IT'S A VEGETARIAN restaurant.   The wine list is awesome, you can get a tour of their wine cellar if you ask. This is not to be missed.   What's wrong with 40+ crowds.  We're not obnoxious, loud or rude. This place is great for those that know.  It's not an upscale, NY place, but you should realize that when you're researching places to eat. The food can't be beat and they'll gladly customize anything that you want.
