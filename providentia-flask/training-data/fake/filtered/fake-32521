The service and food here are laughably bad. We recently ate there and waited 90 minutes for our dinners to arrive (2 of which were dinner salads). Our server never brought water and we had to flag down a busboy to get them for us. The management repeatedly came over to tell us that the food would be out shortly but after an hour of waiting the manager just stopped making eye contact with us (or other angry patrons). We had to get the busboy to bring the manager so that we could complain. The meals were terrible. I've had frozen dinners with more taste. My dinner companion ordered a tropical salad with fruit and was brought a plate full of apples and pears and oranges that were only partially cut up. The management apologized for the poor service because they said a large party had been seated just before us, however the restaurant wasn't even full. If you take reservations you should be able to accommodate all of the food orders! In the end they offered us free dessert which we declined. Then the manager gave us what he said were gift certificates for a future meal (like we'd ever go back!) but they turned out just to be sign up forms for their rewards club. Stay away from this place unless you want to leave hungry and angry.
