always been a sol-mar fan  food good service better Carlos such a nice waiter very personable  been  going for years...now an issue went on sunday sangria which was always great has become an ice and orange rind packed picture that cost $25 dollars and barely gave the 4 of us at table a small glass  no one on the street gives so little for so much  i hope this bartending does not continue because there are other places to go
