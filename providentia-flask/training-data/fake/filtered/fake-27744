New location on 14th between 2nd and 1st is even closer to me, so even better! I think their spicy sauce is stronger now. Other then that best halal you will ever find. The staff is so friendly and chill. Only downside is when you order inside the restaurant it costs more, I believe $7 and some change, but hey that's what happens when you have to pay rent in the city.
