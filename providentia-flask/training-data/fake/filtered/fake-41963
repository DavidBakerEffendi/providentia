If you're looking for something indigenous and delicious do yourself a favor and try My Pie! There are so many good things to say about this wonderfully small and quaint pizza shop! It is hands down one of the best pizza shops in Midtown. The pizza is Roman Style using the finest ingredients from Rome. With so many different toppings to choose from I guarantee one slice won't be enough.
