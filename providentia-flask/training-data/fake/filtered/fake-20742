First off the service is incredible.  Within the first 5 minutes the chef/owner introduced himself and visited with us for a few minutes.  The wait staff is extremely attentive but not overly so. What I ordered:   Goat cheese tart with truffles:  Freakin love goat cheese!!!  So warm, so soft, so gooood. A seafood Shepard's Pie:  Fish mixed with white wine, curry, and cream thats topped with mash potatoes and bread crumbs.   It was truly a great dining experience!
