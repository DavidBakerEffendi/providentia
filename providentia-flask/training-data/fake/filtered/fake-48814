EEEKKK - a mouse!!!  We saw a large mouse coming from behind the seating bench against the wall on the 2nd floor.  I saw it a few times and my girlfriend was sitting on that bench and we told the waitress.  While we were speaking with her, she saw it too and she rounded up someone to block any possible entries so the mouse couldn't come back into the dining room.  Not what you want to see on your first visit!  The food was overpriced and so-so, but the mouse stole the show and we won't return ever again!
