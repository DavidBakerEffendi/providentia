We have been to Sampan several times since they opened.  We have always had a great meal with great friendly service.  Our favorite dishes are the tuna tacos, dumplings, lamb satay, brussel sprouts, and bahn mi sandwich.  The small cones for dessert are always a hit and we look forward to see the flavors of the night. Lately, we have been going there to sit outside, either in the front (they have about 5-6 tables) or we love the Graffiti Bar in the back of the restaurant.  How many restaurants can you really go to and sit outside and eat without being on the sidewalk?  It is a really funky bar and eating area with a great vibe!  We sometimes have to wait on weekends to be seated for a few minutes, however I do not mind because the drinks are good and the manager and hostesses are all friendly. It is our new favorite restaurant in Philly and we will keep going back to see Chef Schulson's new menu additions.
