Worth the hype.  Worth the trip.  Worth the wait.  One of the best restaurants I've been to in Manhattan.  Spicy pork sausage and rice cakes and pork buns were incredible.  Apple kimchi with bacon and maple was a nice balance of flavors, temperatures and textures.  Relatively friendly service with an approachable bar and a cozy dining area.  I'll be back.
