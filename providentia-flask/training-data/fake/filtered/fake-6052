First - the pizza is great. We went with a group and tried a number of items. In order, my favorite (not including the pizza) were: pork belly, vasi (we tried all 4, and I liked them all + great bread) and the mussels. And the pizza was great. I liked the atmosphere, and while others weren't into the music, I liked it. I will admit, a little loud, but a good mix I felt I could sing along with. It was fun, which is what I want when going for out. Cool community table with lighting instillation. The bathrooms have a different vibe, kinda Italian meets punk. Overall, I give it 5 stars. Despite the noise and pricy drinks, they have it where it matters. The food and service are standout, and this restaurant is sure to become a regular of mine!
