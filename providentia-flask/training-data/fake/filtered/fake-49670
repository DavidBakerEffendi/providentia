Came in on Saturday night and absolutely loved the place! The atmosphere is cozy, waiters are attentive, and the food is great. Perfect place for a date, as you get to try and share like 9 or 10 different things. We ordered Farmer's Feast: goat cheese tart with mushrooms was incredible, squash ravioli - tender and buttery,  desert - one of those when you're too full to have anything else, but you can't help yourself and finish it anyway))   Good selection of wine and beer. And honestly, the whole place feels like they really care! (While writing this - I saw other's reviews that say Farmer's Feast is all vegetarian! Did not realize that at all and WOW)
