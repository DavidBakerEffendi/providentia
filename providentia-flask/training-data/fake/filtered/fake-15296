cannot express how AWESOME this place is! the decor is hip/stylish but not pretentious. the food is better than anything you'd find in those throw away thai restaurants in hell's kitchen. but best of all is the PRICE! they have a lunch menu for $8 (salad, appetizer, and entree). also i think the owner is a hottie so even more reason for me to go there on my lunch break. :D
