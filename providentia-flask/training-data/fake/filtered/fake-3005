What a fun little restaurant! I went there with a couple friends for a "Ladies Night" and had a wonderful time. Bring your own wine for sangria. Food was very good, a little too buttery for me but I enjoyed it all the same. Our waiter was very nice and definitely made this girls night out a special one!
