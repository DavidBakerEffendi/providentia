This is my first time writing a yelp review, so that should say something about my experience last night. Casa Mono is cute and cozy. Bar Jamon is their bar next door which is also cute, but both establishments are super small. Went to meet a friend for some wine and tapas last night at Bar Jamon. Place was packed! You could barely stand in there. There were about 7 people against the bar just standing and eating/drinking which wasnt what I wanted to do. The seats were all taken so my friend and I decided to go next door and sit at the bar. Luckily, there were 7 or 8 spots open at the bar in Casa Mono. The lady asked if wed be eating and we said yes wed get some small dishes. We ordered 2 dishes for both of us and got a bottle of wine. #1 - Our waiters breath smelled. I know we all suffer from this sometimes but really? Make sure you do something about that before getting into peoples faces. #2. We ordered 2 dishes total and a bottle of wine. Waiter made a point to tell us that the dishes are small (like I've never eaten tapas before), and that they suggest we order 2 dishes per person. We said we werent that hungry. He proceeds to tell us that he has to talk to the hostess. The hostess comes and tells us they prefer 2 dishes per person and that theres a bar next door we can go to etc... I asked if thats required and whether its written somewhere and of course she said no. She made sort of a stink about it and let us be. Mind you - the place had like 4 tables that were open at the time. The food is super good but the service just sucked. We ended up ordering a second bottle cuz we were in the mood but they sort of ruined my dining experience. I hope this gets addresses cuz chances are I wont be going back despite the delicious food. Our bill was around $150. Someone might want to teach them that good service gets people to come back.
