OK, now, I've never left a Yelp review before, but after my experience with Mayfield last night, I was motivated to actually create an account based on three factors: 1. SO FAR, "Mayfield" seems like one of the best restaurants in Brooklyn, and I wanted to give them a shout and say good job and beg them to KEEP IT UP! Don't let the quality slip like happens to so many new endeavors. 2. I wanted to say that whoever the owner of this restaurant is is basically a hero for investing in a REAL, un-gentrified community and likely single-handedly raising property values. 3. I was so taken aback by the reviewer "DAN S." below, that I simply had to come online to laugh at him. Dude: You're complaining about a FOUR dollar beer because you can get them cheaper in bulk at Target? Classy. I wanna click the "follow this reviewer" button next to your name so that I can see which Ruby Tuesday's and Applebees you feel have the best Riblets. You say you could "barely understand the menu?" So, in Uttica y'all don't have terms like "BURGER?" Stick to upstate my man - don't come to my hood and order a drink at this brave and (literally) ground-breaking new restaurant and think that entitles you to leave a review bashing the place. In summary, fantastic food, great people, and a proud moment for my neighborhood. Thanks to the owner - much appreciated and we pledge to support you.
