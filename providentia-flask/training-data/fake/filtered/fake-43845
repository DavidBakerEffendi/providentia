Yum!!! My first "gourmet" food truck eats. I'm not very familiar with Jamaican food, but what I got was totally delish! I ordered curry shrimp with a side of sweet potatoes and mac and cheese. Here is the deconstructed review: Curry shrimp - huge shrimp and perfectly cooked. The sauce was perfectly seasoned and not too spicy. When I got home, I actually had to take some bread and use it to sop up the rest of the sauce- can't have it go to waste (it was that good)! Sweet potatoes - mashed. It was sweet and had a hint of amaretto (I think). It was very flavorful and could be a dessert by itself. My only complain is that it had traces of the roots, so some bites were a bit stringy. Mac and cheese - tough to go wrong with mac and cheese. I thought it tasted good, mainly because it was smothered in curry. The sweet potatoes and mac and cheese were an odd combination as sides (and because they were all pretty much mushed together0, but I had hard time hearing the guy in the truck. I kind of just quickly picked the sides. But I have ot admit, they were perfect together! Price-wise, I thought it was a bit pricey, but it was definately a lot of food. They actually gave me an option of 3 sides (for the same price), but I didn't take it. I actually had to put away the other half away because I was too full to finish. To make this a 5-star: guys on the truck need to speak just a bit louder (it was tough to hear with the motor), strain the mashed sweet potatoes, better/more sturdy food container. Definately worth checking out and coming back to!
