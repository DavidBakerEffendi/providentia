i have been eating at the blue ribbon for maybe 20 years now. i have never had a bad experience there. the food is excellent, and the fact that you can roll in at 3:55 a.m. and order anything you want has always been the coolest thing. having once worked in the restaurant and club industry in NYC, being able to get an excellent meal in the middle of the night is beyond excellent. however, the last time i was there, which was two weeks ago, i was disappointed. the food was, as usual, great! on the other hand, the service dropped the ball "big time". the manager was not magnus who is "the man". the manager was dan. what a chump! he had the nerve to ask me to relocate in the middle of my meal because i was interfering with the couple sitting next to me and my girlfriend. this was absurd as the couple sitting next to us when we sat down had no problem with the seating situation. we did not move. there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way we were sitting, and at $200 for dinner for two, why would we be asked to move at all. quite simply, dan was being a bitch. the bartender, who i have never seen before, had the personality of a metal folding chair. lastly, the waiter was a jerk. the oyster guy and busboys were excellent. in closing, fire dan. he is a bitch. hire a better bartender to fill in for the regular, whose name escapes me, but is cool as hell. cut loose the waiter with the shorts. do these things and i will continue to eat at the blue ribbon.
