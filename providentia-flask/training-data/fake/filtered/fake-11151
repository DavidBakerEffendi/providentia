I love CHOCOLATE !!  BUT DON'T BUY IT HERE !!  This was my first visit to Eataly and I decided to try their chocolates, they LOOKED pretty and there were a few people buying a few pieces. I always buy 2 of almost everything so I can get a second opinion from a friend. It was a shame to spend $45/lb and have the chocolates tossed into a cellophane bag ! They ran out of boxes, it was only 1:00pm ! I purchased about 1 lb and had the chocolates placed in 2 bags. Thankfully it wasn't too hot outside and I didn't have to worry about melting sweets. Little did I know, there was NO WAY my purchase would have melted !  Why??? Because they were STALE and DRY ! These chocolates make GODIVA boxed chocolates seem FRESH ! And we all know GODIVA is overly processed and has a long shelf life, unless you buy them from Europe - GODIVA from Europe is heavenly ! Eataly will have to make MANY changes to this counter's product, packaging and presentations. I rank this 0 stars but the system forces me to give at least 1 star.
