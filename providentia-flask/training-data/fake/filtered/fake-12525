Excellent coal oven pizza! Maybe the best pizzeria in Montclair.   I would have given 5 stars, however we did encounter one small problem. When you charge an additional $3 for a mushroom topping, I expect the mushrooms to be FRESH, not from a can.  It is an insult to your delicious pizza, and it deserves better!  With that being said - EVERYTHING else was perfect... Sauce, dough, the array of cheeses, basil, olive oil - FANTASTIC!!! I will definitely be back, if I have to sacrifice the mushrooms, so be it!
