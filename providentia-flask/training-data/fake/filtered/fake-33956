We went there to celebrate my high school graduation, and I have to say, my entire high school experience was better. Eating at the high school cafeteria was better. You'll wait outside forever, which will make you hungry enough that you'll be confused into thinking the pizza is great when you are, in fact, merely starving. After that, you'll expect service will be quicker, but instead it will take forever to get even your drinks. If you endure the experience you may be rewarded with pizza that will turn your hands black as pitch. If they give you the wrong pizza, they will ever so generously allow you to not pay for the additional cost of the toppings you didn't even order. You might feel after this that you must consider the experience positively, otherwise you have wasted several hours, money, and an opportunity to go anywhere else -- but deep down you will know that if you could change history the first thing you would do would be to never have gone there. Don't reward mediocrity.
