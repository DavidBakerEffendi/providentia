I have eaten at Dough several times and every time has been great.  I highly recommend the pancetta farm egg and potato pizza, and the gnocci is awesome too.  I'm an adventurous eater and even tried the chicken liver toast tips. Honestly everything I've tried so far has been top notch.   I love that it's BYOB and it's a great place to go with a group of friends on a friday or saturday night to share some great italian style dishes and enjoy a great casual, yet classy atmosphere with some drinks. The place is busy, but the staff are so attentive and friendly that you truly feel welcomed and appreciated. I love that the owner came out and personally asked me what I thought of my dish.  This is not a place where they simply throw things together, there is thought and careful preparation put into every dish, which is what makes the fresh menu so great.  I would highly recommend Dough both for the quality of food, the awesome atmosphere and the excellent service, and I am definitely a new loyal customer!
