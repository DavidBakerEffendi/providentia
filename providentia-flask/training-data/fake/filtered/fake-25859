I went here with my friend and his family on a whim when we were passing through. The food was pretty good, the main issue is the pricing. They charge a lot for a pretty small glass for a drink and don't offer free refills. When my friend's mother confronted the manager about this she became very rude and defensive and that soured the experience.
