The space itself was kind of too small for my liking, but the service was good. Honestly, my friends and I went to xochitl because we were craving mexican and we left very satisfied. Based on the food itself, it probably was one of the best Mexican meals Ive had in a while. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a good Mexican dish and I especially recommend the homemade guacamole!
