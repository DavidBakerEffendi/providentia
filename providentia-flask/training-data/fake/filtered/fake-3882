not very cool unless you're in with the bouncers.  very crowded dance floor.  fights break out (you'll lose unless you're friends with the bouncers - evidently they're not there for the protection of the general crowd).  even the dj, dj deejay, talks this smack about wanting everyone to have a good time and how they're watching out for the ladies, but turns a blind eye when it's his buddies starting stuff on the dance floor.  saw a guy shove a girl across the dance floor (something about how she elbowed him when he was dancing behind her) and the bouncer was unbelievably dismissive.  especially, do not recommend this place to girls - crazy to see a bouncer ignore the way in which a friend of his treated a woman.  it was one of the most unacceptable behaviors i've witnessed in a bar.  management seemed at a loss for keeping it under control.  unsafe, disrespectful, disgraceful.  go elsewhere.
