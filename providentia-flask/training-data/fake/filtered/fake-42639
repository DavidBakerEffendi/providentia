I decided to bring my parents to diner as a Christmas Gift. Â I am overally upset at the service, because the service sucks! The waitress was impolite, grouchy, rude and doesn't treat customers equally. The cashier was rude and doesn't even say thank you. I agree with half the post on here. The waitress stare was down and sounds like they don't want my family to be here and think we are stupid. This is the first time I've been back there after 3 years, I thought it will be better, but it just get worse! I will never go back there again, I didn't even want to give her a tip, but my parents did. IF YOU WANT GOOD SERVICE AND FEEL COMFORTABLE, I HIGHLY ADVISE DO NOT GO THERE, STAY FAR AWAY FROM THERE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE.
