I have to share my bad experience, We had a private party at Guru Palace and enjoyed the party well. Here is the twist, Next day morning 95% of them reported sick by Diarrhea whoever ate non-veg, of course I am also one of them. This completely spoiled my happiness and so embarrassed getting calls from loved ones. Guru Palace guys took this very lite. Think twice before you go there... you know, nothing is important than health.
