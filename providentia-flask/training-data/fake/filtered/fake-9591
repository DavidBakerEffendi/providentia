This place is a hidden gem! My husband and I decided to go after watching a show where this diner was mentioned for the (monkey french toast).  We went on a Wednesday around 3pm (an hour before closing). There was no one else there and we were sat immediately.  My husband ordered the potato leek soup and turkey meatloaf sandwhich with the roasted potatoes. The soup was amazing, the sandwhich was surprisingly incredible. I kept stealing bites. It was seasoned like I cannot even describe. I loved it! His side of roasted potatoes were also scrumptious! I had the monkey french toast. It is made with challah bread and has carmelized bananas and soft mangoes in between the slices; it is then drizzled in caramel sauce. I ordered this since I love french toast, but I was sort of wary about the mangoes and caramel. I was so surprised at how delicious it was. The flavors that I thought would not go together were so complementary. I was so shocked and delighted at the flavor.  I had a side of the breakfast ham which was also good. The service was great and the food was prepared perfectly! The only thing that I didn't like was the Iced Mint Tea. It tasted like plain unsweetened tea. I saw the one mint leaf floating in it, but there was no mint flavor to it.  When we were leaving, since it was closing time, the waitress offered us 2 cups of homemade hot chocolate to-go and a strawberry chocolate chip muffin that I am enjoying now at work (toasted with butter).  I loved it there and we are planning to go back soon and bring friends with. I love that everything there is homemade (even the ketchup, which by the way is also sooo good!)  I only wish their hours were later. :) Never thought I'd spend so much time reviewing a "diner". :) Enjoy!!!
