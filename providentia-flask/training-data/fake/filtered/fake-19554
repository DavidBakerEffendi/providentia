Went here when I visited my friend in the area.  Let's say Wayne is far from being a culinary heaven.  For that reason, I think that's how restaurant like this stays in business.  The best term I can use for this place is that they like to be pretenders.  They want to go upscale from the average pizzeria, and so the menu has seafood and veal.  For what you get and the level of decor, the price is a bit steep.  There's a big rip in the bench cushion.  Tilapia for $22.  We waited a while for the food to come out, and it was just okay.  Nothing you can't get in your average diner.  For all these issues that I'm pointing out objectively we are charged in NYC prices.  Come on, r-e-a-l-l-y!  The only reason I'm not giving it a 1-star is because my waiter is a nice kid and he really tried.
