I was looking for a nice sushi place and someone said sake sushi is good place to try. I really like the place It's a small cute place right next to Rita's Ice across Nutley dinner. The owner is pretty cool so as his workers. Food wise pretty fresh and great tasting. Ever since I tried there sushi I was hooked I usually order there Cailfornia Roll,Spicy Tuna,and Unagi (Eel) whenever I go there. If you want to try out there rolls Mon-Fri (12pm-2:30pm) you can get the lunch Special (2 rolls w/ Miso Soup) for $8.00~$10.00. Oh and there closed on Sundays just so you know I hope my review helps :D
