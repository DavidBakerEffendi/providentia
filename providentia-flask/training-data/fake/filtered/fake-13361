Horrible food and overpriced drinks. The staff is rude and not very good at their jobs; the manager isn't any better. Don't expect good service, and don't eat the food unless you're trying to make yourself sick; last time I ate anything at this place I was bent over the patio railing and dry heaving for a good ten minutes.
