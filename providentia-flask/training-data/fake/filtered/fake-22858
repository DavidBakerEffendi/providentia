This had became my best choice for Pho's craving recently ! The other favorite Pho noodle houses around Philly have went down hill with their qualities and services. Trust me the Pho broth and meat here is the tastiest of them all. The service is so quick, about 3-5 mins, because they have alot of waiters to help with the order process. I also love the rice and chops plate dishes which are delicious. I wish they expand their menu more with special dishes into their small menu, but that just me. Everything is fresh, tasty, big portion, and low price. I will always come here with friends and family to enjoy authentic Vietnamese cousine . Best around Philly for a quick meals !!!!!
