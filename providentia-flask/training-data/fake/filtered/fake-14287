Love this place! Drinks are incredible, food is great, ambiance is sexy and the staff is more than exceptional. If it's your first time going I wouldn't suggest a Friday or Saturday after 7 because you'll have to wait a while for a table unless you're with a party of five or six otherwise you'll be waiting at the bar and that can get annoying fast. Come here early or really late (about an hour before the kitchen closes) to really enjoy the food. If you're coming for drinks and the ambiance then you'll enjoy the bar area. This restaurant is definitely a first date or romantic date place you want to bring a woman to. *Sometimes parking is an issue but drive up Stuyvesant Place there should be a spot or two.
