SATURDAY NIGHT REVIEW.   OK food (not at all great) BUT so poorly organized: No reservations No call in for waiting list: Resulting in predictably HORRIBLE WAITING TIMES ON THE STREET - OVER 2 HOURS We had been there twice during the week, and it was wonderful. So it was a Saturday night and we decided to go. Its over an hour drive, and we called to see if they took reservations. They said they didn't. They said when you arrived they'd put our name on a list. We asked if they could out our name on the list now (with a phone call) and they said no. Its against their policy. We asked about the wait, and they said at that time it was 30 minutes, but they couldn't predict the wait when we arrived. When we arrived the street side  in front of the restaurant was swamped with people. They said the wait was 2 hours - but we had come a long way - and neither us (nor others) really believed it. Its true. Its apparently their norm on Friday and Saturday night - 2+ hours wait !!! The impression is they feel they get more business by this form of disorganization. But its terrible and ruined the night. They should take reservations. Failing that - if they want a waiting list on the night of the dinner - you should at least be able to call in your name. They refuse both. Instead, if you want to eat there on Friday or Saturday night you are stuck on the street waiting for hours. They can't manage the volume wither. The food, which was truly excellent on a weeknight - was at least 3 notches worse. Food is a delicate balance of flavor and cooking, and the balance was lost. For instance - way too much raw garlic. Overcooked chicken. The experience was so off-putting we simply won't go back - not even on a weeknight, when we had a so much better experience. I recommend you stay away from this place on the weekend.
