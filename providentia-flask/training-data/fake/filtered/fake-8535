Stopped here for a quick bite with my boyfriend during our layover. Yes, very average Chinese-American fare, but the best value for your money at this airport. I got lo mein and for my sides, egg drop soup and orange chicken. I tried a sample of their bourbon chicken before ordering and it was delicious--healthier than orange chicken but I'd been craving the latter for some time. I kind of regret not adding the bourbon chicken to my meal for an additional 99 cents. Their hot sauce was pretty good, and being able to have a soup as one of the sides was VERY satisfying. Nothing to write home about but quick and basic, cheaper than the rest of the food at this airport.
