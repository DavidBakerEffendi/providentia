Now this is a sandwich. Unlike the nast that Geno's and Pat's calls a...whatever they call it, DiNic's does sandwich/hoagie/sub/whatever-you-want-to-call-Â­meat-between-two-pieces-of-bear right. The roast pork with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe is phenomenal. I could eat that thing on a daily basis. I'd be poor and probably have a serious heart condition, but don't dare me to do it, because I just may.
