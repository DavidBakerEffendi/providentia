The most adorable place visited so far. When I run out of ideas, this is one of the places that pops up in my head. Haven't visited for a while, but wanted to say how happy I am, that such a wonderful place can be also affordable, so cozy, sweet.. and the bar next door with the jazz is just unbelievable!
