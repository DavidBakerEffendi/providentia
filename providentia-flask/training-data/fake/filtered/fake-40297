My family and I just had thanksgiving dinner at Cheryl's and it was excellent! We are from New Orleans so it's hard to beat our southern cuisine. we decided this year that we didn't want to do all the work. This place did not disappoint. If you are looking for great food in Brooklyn, check it out. Â I see some reviews say a Cheryl the owner is not as warm and friendly as some would like. well maybe, she is busy making that kick ass Mac n cheese or her delicious salmon. I will be going back and recommending to friends.
