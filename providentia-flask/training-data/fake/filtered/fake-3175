The restaurant is located in a not very pleasant neighborhood and getting there is a challenge; you better have a decent SUV since the roads are all in a pretty bad shape. Good thing is that the restaurant has its own parking. The staff is nice and friendly. The atmosphere is warm and somewhat noisy. The menu (judged by the list of dishes) is truly outstanding. Now, why I cannot give it more than "two starts". The restaurant marked at having slightly above average price. This (I assumed) should come with something "above average". Â However... and this is where I have to warn those who want to visit this place: either reserve/ask for a table which is NOT the closest to the kitchen, or be brave enough to ask for a cut nex to the surface when you are ordering Rodizio. I've got a table which was the first on the way from the kitchen and I didn't have guts to ask for a slice of meat which is not the burned-and-spiced surface one. As a result, I didn't get a single decent piece to taste. Was it my fault? Possibly...
