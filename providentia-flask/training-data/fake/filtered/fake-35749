One of my two favorite places to eat in Astoria.  I am on a mission to eat every single one of their grilled cheeses, but this place makes it hard on me because a., their "classic"-ish sandwich (sharp cheddar and mozzarella on half-inch thick slices of buttery brioche, served with homemade tomato soup and curried pumpkin seeds) is soooo amazing, and b., they keep adding new things to the menu!  I'm also a big fan of their gouda sandwich with guava jam, the 3-cheese mac and cheese, and the brownie affogato, which is soaked in coffee.   I'd happily come here any time of day (and have).  If you're here during off-peak hours, it's a great place to read a book or play board game with a friend.  If you come at night, you've got an incredible selection of craft beers (similar in Astoria only to Sunswick, but the food at Kickshaw is incomparably better).  There's nothing else quite like it.
