Perhaps I should preface this lofty review by noting that every meal, whether brunch or breakfast, be laden with a side of fruit. One might think, yum, fruit. But this is a cop out. Regardless of the dish, you will get, doubt it not, grapes, cantaloupe, and pineapple. And probably like one piece of cantaloupe. Like an entire, well proportioned third of your plate is going to have the same three fruit that everybody else in the whole entire restaurant has, Maybe this wouldn't be such a bad idea if the food was even decent. But how could this unasked for and I suspect mandatory side add to my dining experience? Perhaps grapes, cantaloupe, and pineapples complement everything on N. 3rd's enticing and varied menu. The food itself is meager and bland. And boring.
