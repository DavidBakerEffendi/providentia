On the outside you know you're in Queens but on the inside it feels like Manhattan. I love this bar. It has great atmosphere and great music. It's more of a chill spot than a pickup spot but that's what adds to the cozy feel. If you have to try a vegetarian option on the menu, definitely try the mac and cheese. It's always amazing!
