Went to Fiorinos with friends because of its great reputation. It was absolutely excellent and both the service and food were exceptional! We were truly wowed right from the start with the delicious bruschetta and fresh bread. Each of us ordered a different entree and we were all delighted with our meal. The chef came out to greet us, and from start to finish it was a memorable evening.
