Very interesting stuff here.  If you like exploring a wide array of food ethnicities in NYC, you should really try this place.  This is an Alsatian restaurant.  Alsace is a region of France on the German border (it as passed back and forth between the two countries for years).  And the cuisine reflects it's bi-national heritage.  The restaurant's specialty (and raison d'etre) is the tarte flambe.  It is similar to a flatbread pizza but without tomato sauce.  It has a cream sauce with cheese and various toppings.  It is quite delicious, especially with a good beer or wine accompaniment. The waiters are from the region, with very heavy accents (which is both good and bad). The place is very small, so it can fill up fast, especially in peak times. My four year old daughter enjoyed the place and the "Alsatian pizza" so I think it's good for kids.  The waiter even gave her a little chalkboard and chalk to draw on while we waited.
