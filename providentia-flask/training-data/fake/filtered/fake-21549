I was very disappointed in Claires this past weekend.  It is one of the few vegetarian/vegan restaurants in the area and I hadn't been there in years.  They also advertise on the website that they offer "gluten free options."  Well apparently this is a lie.  I went in this weekend and after waiting in line 20 minutes was told by the idiot at the counter that she didn't know what was gluten free or not.   Why a person would be hired to work at a restaurant counter and not know the basic ingredients of the food is beyond me!! I asked if the risotto was gluten free (it ususally is being that the base ingredient of the dish is rice)..this person looks at me like I am from MARS and mumbles some response that sounded like no.  Overall it was a terrible experience, I ended up ordering nothing and stormed out of the restaurant.  Pleasehire and train some individuals who know the business and have basic customer service skills.  I will never return to this place.
