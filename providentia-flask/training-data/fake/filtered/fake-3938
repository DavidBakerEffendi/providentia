We used to have brunch at Juventino fairly regularly.  We eventually stopped because the proprietor, Juventino, was incredibly rude.  He was very anti-child, anti-stroller, and once told us that we should hurry up and eat so that he could turn over the table (and then said, "Oh, I'm just kidding.")    We had just gotten our food.  On another occasion, the restaurant was empty and Juventino just stood inside the door holding menus, waiting for me to enter while he watched me struggle with the stroller and the heavy door.  He couldn't be bothered to get the door.   It then came as no surprise to learn that he sexually harasses and verbally abuses his employees.  He has a total creepy/bad guy vibe.
