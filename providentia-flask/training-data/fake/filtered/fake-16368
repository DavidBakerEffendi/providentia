I can not fathom why people would give this restaurant more than a star or two. I'm starting to find Yelp reviews unreliable. This was our first time ordering from Peppino's and we will never eat their food again. Overpriced for the quality. I gave one star for prompt delivery and one star because the food wasn't horrible. It was just bad. Their bread is tasteless- this goes for their crust and garlic crisps. No flavor whatsoever. Same with the plain pizza. We couldn't even finish a slice. The marina sauce is coated with a layer of oil and tastes burnt. The penne a'la vodka was fine, but again, lacked flavor. The eggplant parm roll tasted old. If you want good pizza on 5th Ave go to Brooklyn Central or La Villa, which also has amazing pasta and appetizers.
