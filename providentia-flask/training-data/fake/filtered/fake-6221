The place was nice however the Food was tasteless and overpriced, I ordered the Tilapia w/side of greens and potatoes. The fish was not tasty, the potatoes under cooked and soaked in olive oil. I will not recommend this place to anyone. I also got sick from the fish and I wasn't the only one from the dinner party!
