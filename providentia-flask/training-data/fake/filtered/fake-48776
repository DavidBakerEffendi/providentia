My husband and I dined here last night.  As always with a Garces restaurant, the service was very good.  The pecan "snack" was incredible.  I enjoyed the tuna appetizer along with the crab gratin.  My husband loved the Iron Chef pork ribs and the pumpkin croquettes.  The redecorating of the space has softened the it as much as possible.  The open kitchen was incredibly calm on what appeared to be a very busy Sat night.
