I have never reviewed an establishment in my life but please be advised Do NOT come here!! The food took almost two hours only for the manager to tell me that, "they were having trouble with my pork because it was still frozen." They proceeded to substitute my meal with a fatty flank steak. We decided just to pay our $240 bill and leave only to get to our car in THEIR parking lot and noticed we were blocked in by a car that the parking attendant allowed there!! The owner, manager, and club security provided beyond terrible customer service and didn't help us at all not to mention they kept pawning our complaint on the other!! Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant and I will be sure that everyone knows about it!!
