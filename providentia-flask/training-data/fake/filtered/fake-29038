In my life I have never been so horrified. First the MORON Generation X IDIOT behind the counter would not tell the sandwich maker NO MAYONNAISE who was standing 2 feet from him so I get my sandwich with something I'm allergic to. "NO SUBSTITUTIONS" was all the pathetic ASS could manage to muster out of his mouth. Then I get to my desk to eat the sandwich and there is a BUG in it. I'll be contacting the department of health but if you're smart you will STAY AWAY from this village idiot SCUMMY dive.
