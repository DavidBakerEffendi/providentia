My teens cannot get enough of this place! We have been driving out to Neshaminy for Chipotle and this little gem has saved me on much gas. The boys love that they can build their own tacos and burritos, and I love the fresh vegetarian options as well. The younger kids call it 'a Mexican subway', and they love picking out just what they want.
