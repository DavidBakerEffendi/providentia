Beware!   We made a reservation on Open Table.    When we arrived, we were told our table was just finishing dessert.    We were offered spots at the Chef's counter.   We did not want to sit crammed in together at a loud crowded restaurant.    The chef's counter is for walk ins.   A few minutes later we were told it would be a 40 minute wait for a table.  Again, they suggested we sit at the Chef's counter.   The hostess also told us that we need to specify that we want a table next time we make a reservation.   We walked out.   There will not be a next time.
