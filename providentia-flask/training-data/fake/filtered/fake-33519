I have been to Chaps several times since I've moved to new haven and always have a great experience. The reason I love this restaurant is because they are the only restaurant that I know of downtown that serves breakfast all day. My favorite is their Stuffed French toast, with fresh fruit served Inbetween to pieces of French toast with cream cheese. If I'm in a hurry I grab a fresh baked bagel sandwich, with bacon, egg and cheese for only $4. Last week they had a special with chocolate and banana pancakes, scrambled eggs and bacon side for $8, my parents enjoyed it very much. For lunch my favorite is the new haven cheese steak with onions, peppers, and mushrooms, or one of their panini's. I like the lunch menu because there is a choice of vegetarian items along with the burgers, gyros and sandwiches. The service is always pleasant and quick, the waitstaff is always upbeat and efficient. I plan on eating at chaps this weekend, and have recommended it to several friends.
