My girlfriend, best friend and I went to Traif last week and we all were huge fans! We order the tasting menu which was a great deal at $50 a person. We had 13 courses (3 of them were desserts) and all were fantastic. The star item for me was the strawberry-cinnamon glazed ribs. It was the right balance of flavour and the ribs were so tender and the meat fell right off the bone. Definitely an A+ joint with great service!
