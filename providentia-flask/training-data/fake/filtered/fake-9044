This place is literally a shack but you cant help but notice the long lines pouring out in the street. (especially when there are similar establishments on the same street with no one eating there). We live in jersey but when we crave a good shwarma sandwich or their irresistable baklava with creme we sit in bumper to bumper traffic then wait on line to get a yummy bite!
