I had my birthday dinner here with a group of 11. I made the original reservation for 8, and had a few extras show up. The staff accommodated my party with a larger table on a busy Friday night. The sangria was amazing, and the food was absolutely delicious. Everyone at the table raved. I'll definitely be back.
