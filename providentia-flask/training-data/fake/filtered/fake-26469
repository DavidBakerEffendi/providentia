This place is a waste of money, there are way better versions of the dishes on this menu pretty much anywhere else you might try in downtown Burlington. The restaurant commented on a review from two months ago that they would rework the ridiculous $6 surcharge on shared plates (not split plates - just shared dishes), but they haven't. What they never seemed to deny is that they're using pre-chopped and frozen vegetables and that the food tastes bad. I spent a lot of money on a small amount of food, and it was so bad I didn't even finish it. I was charged $5 extra for seafood in my soup and received one shrimp, one mussel, and three pieces of squid. Not to mention barely thawed large-dice onions. To future customers - save yourselves. To the restaurant owners - seriously, gross and insulting, the people in this town might try your food once and leave annoyed, but that won't keep you running.
