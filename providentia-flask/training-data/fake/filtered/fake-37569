I can't believe it. I wholeheartedly cannot believe what just happened to my friend and I. Me and this poor SOB Mike are standing at the bar ordering our sandwiches from this man. He didn't even get to us for about ten minutes. That was 50 minutes ago. I'm sitting here looking around at all the weird art in the building an hour later and this man walks up to my table. TO CONFIRM MY ORDER. Yes sir I did order the steak special, yes sir my friend did order the Cuban pork. 1 hour ago, 60 minutes, 3600 seconds ago. I'm still sitting here, waiting patiently. There's a picture of a dismembered mangirl next to me. There's a genie staring me down. There's a weird old woman painting. There's a terrible painting of a trench and a naked person, there's a naked person. Someone come into this place and kill me. I'll be here for approximately 1 more hour. Never come here. If I could rate this place less than 1 star I would.
