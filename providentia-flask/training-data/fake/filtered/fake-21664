We went to The Green Table twice last year and loved it. After that it just became a restaurant you love but hardly get to visit.  I wish it had stayed that way but we went there this Friday night and now I don't know if I will ever go back there. The food is still as good. My grilled cheese and summer squash soup with buttermilk was great. But the service was very, very bad.  Very impersonal and almost rude and condescending. The server was too curt for a good Friday night meal and we never got a smile, or a hi, but I can live with that.  I finished my my plate before my girlfriend and the server cleared my plate. Within a minute, without asking my girlfriend if she had finished her dinner or without caring to ask if we wanted desert she dropped off the check at our table. My girlfriend asked for her her leftover to be packed up and the server handed her a box saying, "I brought you this so you can handle that." OK, not that bad  by itself. But we asked her for a bag. The answer: We don't really have any bags right now. Me: None? Her: Well, we don't have any small bags. Me: Do you have any big bags? Her: Yes, the really big ones. Do you still want those? Going by  the portion sizes of that place, I can imagine not many people take their food back with them. But, really, no bags in the kitchen? Then she said "Oh, let me check if we have any brown paper bags." We never heard anything of it after that.  They forgot the pen for the check and when I asked for one, they acted as if I was the one who forgot the pen. I don't know if we were special and got this treatment, or is that how it works in The Green Table these days? But I wish it didn't work that way because we love their food and the fact that they use local ingredients.  Maybe put a little bit of good service on the side?
