Been here for drinks with friends after work .........not that crowded...though food not bad. Â Staff nice....older atmosphere and inside looks very old, tired and bit dirty looking- withlow ceilings etc.The outside small,with alot furniture....too much all over. Just simply an older crowd........30's, 40's music....ugh
