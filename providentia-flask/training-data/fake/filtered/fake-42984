"Best Indian Food in the Princeton area" Flavor Of India Â  PrincetonFoodLover Princeton, NJSep 25, 2007 2/3 found this review helpful While the exterior of this restaurant - in a somewhat non-descript shopping center off Scudders Mill Road - may not appear to indicate fantastic food, if you let appeances lead you to a place on Nassau St. instead, you'll really be missing out. This is the kind of Indian restaurant where you bring your friends who grew up eating Indian food.... where "spicy" actually means *spicy*, and a wide variety of authentic choices abound. (Though they can make anything "mild" too.) I highly recommend the Lamb Pasanda (lamb in a slightly sweet, nutty, creamy sauce), Paneer Makahni (Indian cheese in a sweet and rich tomato based sauce), Paneer Korma (Indian cheese in a coconut and cashew sauce), and Lamb Kushta (lamb and peppers served in a puri - fried Indian bread). And of course, no meal would be complete without an order of naan (Indian flat bread, cooked in a tandoori oven). The prices are more reasonable than most Indian places in the area - between $9-$14 for an entree, and less than $2 for an order of naan - and you will leave full and content for that amount. The service is great - the owner is friendly and eager to please his customers.... and the food simply can not be beat. Must go!! (you'll probably see me there - we go at least once a week :))
