overrated on many dimensions called ahead on a sunday night , was told seats available in bar- got there in five minutes tables were available, but we were led to the communal table which is hi stools with no backs we said we would like to move as soon as a table opens up so we wouldnt be uncomfortable throughout our meal people came and left Â in the bar but the host never offerred them to us i did get up and walk over to him at one point and he looked past me! waitress forgot to put our drink order in and we had to ask 10 minutes later where the wine was! then the red wine was served way too cold (had to warm it up with our hands)-lest you think i just dont know anything i am long seasoned nyc and food person and my daughter went thru the cornell wine program and the wine was way too cold-some restaurants store the reds next to the whites which are on ice and because it is usually a stainless sink, the chill can transfer as it does in other places- FIX THAT requested bread and water multiple times before it was attended to food that did arrive was tasty but the service was so far below what we expect at a danny meyer restaurant kept waiting for a manager to come by and ask how we were doing never happened i saw staff talking amongst themselves all night but no interactions with diiners on way out i approached the manager to tell him they had a lot of work to do on many dimensions and he offerred me his card i told him i didnt want the card , i was just alerting him to pay attention i wouldnt go back there and i did go to their website to see if i could send a private message to them with my experience and the site was all about marketing-maybe they dont want feedback i dont know just wondering.... really disappointed and it was expensive to be so let down
