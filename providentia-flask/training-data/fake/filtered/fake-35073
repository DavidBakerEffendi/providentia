Place was a ghost town but we walked around the neighborhood and ended up back here. menu very limited...but everything our party of three ate was great. Service excellent (maybe due to very few people there). Calamari tasty and not chewy. Mac and cheese wonderful and the ribs were great. Burger sort of average...nothing special. Atmosphere decent....seems like the nicest resteraunt around.They do need a liquor license.
