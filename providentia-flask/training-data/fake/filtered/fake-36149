This place is just what the neighborhood needed: perfect price range, perfect type of cuisine. I've eaten there many times already and love the Oxtail Stew, Arroz con Pollo, and Cubano (both the sandwich and salad versions). I haven't tried the fish tacos yet, but my boyfriend always gets them and supposedly they are very good. What I look forward to most: the desserts. All of their regular menu desserts are amazing, but we had a key lime tart recently that was to die for. I think it might have been some kind of special, but I really, REALLY hope there's enough demand to add it to the regular menu. Anyway, love Blue Cat and can definitely see becoming a regular!
