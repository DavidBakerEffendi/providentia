I'm so glad I live around this place! I usually order the #1 sandwich and an iced milk tea or iced honey tea.  I buy from this place so many times that the people there recognize me haha. However, I realized the prices have increased by a lot over the years.  I remember a sandwich used to cost only $3.25.  Now it's almost close to $5.  Anyhow, the sandwiches are still delicious so I will still order from this place regardless of the price.
