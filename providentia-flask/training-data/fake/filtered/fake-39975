As another reviewer pointed out, it really is difficult to find good, fresh Mexican food in this area, especially if you frequent places in NYC. I wanted to like this place, but everything I had was heavy-handed, sweet, salty and just wrong. Tortilla soup should be a light soup, more broth, with tortilla strips and cilantro, chicken. Their's was a horrid tomato sauce base, sweet and thick like it should be covering pasta. I mentioned it to the server, who did inquire why I had only eaten a small amount. Hope they can figure another way. The Â veggie burrito came out smothered in melted cheese and suace, like a quesadilla. Really?? Veggies were pretty good, but loaded with salt. Too bad. Servers were nice and the salsa and chips were excellent. Not surprised though that the place was empty. Besides, the space smelled like the deodorant used in anti-dampness powders for wet basement. Yuck. Sorry, keep moving, don't stop here.
