Scott absolutely knows his pizza. He is a wealth of information about all things pizza and is the ultimate resource about where to go and what to eat. Couple that with his enthusiasm, sense of humor and vibrant personality and you have a great NY experience for both New Yorkers and out of towners. The day proved to be the perfect unique and enjoyable way to celebrate my pizza loving husband's birthday with my entire pizza loving family. Highly recommend devouring delicious pizza while touring with Scott.
