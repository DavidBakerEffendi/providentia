I made reservations early on a Saturday evening.  I am well-dressed, well-groomed, and have never truncated an adverb in my life, so I was flabergasted when the two men at the door simply looked at me with cold stares.  Then one walked me to the back of the almost empty restaurant and said hostiley, "you can sit THERE (pointing to the table near the kitchen door) or THERE (the far corner).  Fortunately my friend arrived a few minutes later and said, 'this won't do,' and had us moved to another table.  If Palazzo's food justified its attitude, I might be forgiving.  Although my appetizer, Seafood Risotto, was excellent, the Pasta Bolognese was inedible, pure wallpaper paste that even cheese couldn't help.   My family owned a retail business in Montclair for 30 years, known for the courtesy with which its treated its customers.  Although the wait staff was very nice, there is something off about the management.  I say send the two pallbearers at the front door back to do the dishes, and bring the dishwasher out to greet the customers.  I'm sure he has infinitely better manners.
