The Absolute best place for brunch on sunday. Every crepe they make from the savory to the sweet is absolutely delicious. Also, if you happen to be there on a weekend when they are serving their couscous, it is a must try. There is pretty much nothing wrong with this place except that it can get a little crowded and cramped because it is a pretty small restaurant. Once winter rolls around outdoor seating no longer becomes an option.
