This is one of my staple places to go in Philly. I bring my friends and family there whenever someone out of town comes to visit or whenever I get a chance to go out. They have a great owner and some great people on their staff. It is a unique place with unique food & drinks. It's a one of a kind burger joint with adventurous options. It is also one of my favorite things about Philadelphia.
