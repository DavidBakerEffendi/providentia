Awesome Thai food! Great Ambiance and the prices were great! The only downer is the cash only policy, but if you remember to hit the ATM before hand this place is worth checking out. If you do go you must have the fried calamari, mussels in spicy Thai sauce and the mango salad (so cool and refreshing...delicioso) You will not be disappointed! Can't wait to go back and sample the rest of menu!
