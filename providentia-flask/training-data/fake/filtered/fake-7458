The best steak I have ever eaten in my life! Simple as. Service = cool and unobtrusive. Atmosphere = To a European New York supercool! Price = Pricey (I think Â I didn't pay. Cheers Raf!) Learning point = Why McDonald's stack their fries vertically. Speaking to a New Yorker when I arrived back in Berlin = In New York I had the best steak I have ever eaten. Balthazar? Yes!
