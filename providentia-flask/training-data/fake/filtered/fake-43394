Hawthorns is an amazing find in south Philly. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, the beer and cider selection is great. The menu is simple but delicious. The specials never disappoint and the desserts are top notch. Slightly more than I like to spend regularly on eating out so this is a "once in a while" experience for me. I get there as often as I can.
