We go here more often than I thought we would due its proximity to our home and delicious food, plus it's on Savored and Scout mob so that makes it better value for money - without those it is a little on the pricy side for what you get. I ordered the rack of lamb, it was slightly overlooked but the flavors of this dish made up for that fact. It was a savory, delectable meal. I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant and was pleasantly pleased with my lunch experience. Â As other Yelpers have cited, this restaurant is desolate around 2ish. I had the entire restaurant to myself which was awesome. Service was good (just one waitress), decor is blegh in my opinion, and prices are reasonable. JUST GET SOME DAMN SHAWARMA ON THE MENU!
