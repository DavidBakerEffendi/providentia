Around early May 2011  finally went to try the much-praised lobster roll.  It, despite the HIGH price, had no taste.   What a major disappointment, to say the least.  I'm a very non-confrontational person but when the maitre d'-type person asked my opinion, I told him exactly that - "no taste" - lots of "lobster" but no taste.  He sent a complimentary warm & tasty bread pudding to me but....that's not what I went there for. I won't be going back.
