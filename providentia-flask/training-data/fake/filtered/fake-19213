Don't waste your time anywhere else...Stowe's is THE seafood place to go!  Everything I've tried is absolutely delicious!  I live in New Jersey, but I am in town every two weeks and as soon as my fiancé picks me up at the train station - I say to him "To Stowe's, we goes!".  Truthfully, we really love the place!
