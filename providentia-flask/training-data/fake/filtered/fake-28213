Their buffalo mac and cheese is amazing. I hope they add this to their permanent menu. What I like about this place is you can tell they use quality ingredients - they use real moist chicken, not just that typical dry grilled chicken you get at most restaurants. Also loved the manchego sticks. Honestly the food was delicious and sizeable portions, no idea why there are so many bad reviews.
