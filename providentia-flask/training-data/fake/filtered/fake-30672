I have been to the Bishops Collar a lot over the past 10 years. They have changed as businesses tend to do but although I still like to sit outside on a nice weekend day, I would be lying if I didn't say that I missed some of their recently departed employees. My understanding is that they moved on and was no doing of the ownership but their departure has left me realizing their positive impact on my experience. I wish them well and will continue to sit outside and enjoy their Philadelphia/ Art Museum atmosphere. On a more positive side note they do normally have a nice selection of beers.
