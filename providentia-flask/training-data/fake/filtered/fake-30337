The worst service ever!  We waited 40 minutes for our market salad to arrive.  FORTY!  The salad was simple - mescalun and tomatoes in a vinaigrette.  How long would an elaborate salad take? We had to ask for bread after waiting 30 minutes with nothing on our table. When the food finally arrived 45 minutes later, the best I can say is that it was hot and did not taste bad.  But we were starving at this point, so anything would have tasted good.  I had to get up to get my own fresh black pepper as none of the numerous waitstaff offered some with the salad or the entrees.   The restaurant has a great decor and great potential, but I will not eat there again and will tell all my friends in the neighbourhood to stay away unless they don't mind the above.  Good Luck. P.S.  They were at about 60-70% capacity with this late, shoddy service.  What is it like when full?
