The food here is quite good.  Very tasty and expertly prepared.  I have only good things to say about the meal.  We started off with the fried oysters and salmon carpaccio; perfect.  For the main course, my wife had the clams which were amazing, and I had the Thai curry cod; not to be missed.  The textures were just right, each taste unique.      It being small wasn't really a problem other than having to wait 20 minutes for a seat.  We brought our own wine.     Two things stopped me from giving this place 5 stars, service and decor.   We didn't get any bread while waiting until we asked, and our water wasn't re-filled until the end of the meal.       I love the way the place looks and not so snobby that I can't enjoy simplicity, but one wall is decorated with old stuff your half blind grandma would be embarrassed to take out of her attic.     But don't let that stop you; eat here.
