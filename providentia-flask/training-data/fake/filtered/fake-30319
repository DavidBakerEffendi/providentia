Food is good, ambiance is very nice, tea is good (except of the assam chai -- way too bitter). However... I have to agree with Katelyn about being weirded-out by the owners, Mary and Mike.  Every time I've been in there, they are bickering or talking to each other very passive-aggressively, and right in front of customers.  The way they handle their staff is also pretty atrocious.  I've seen Mary come out from behind the counter and be super nice to customers, spending lots of time talking to them and charming them in various ways, then go back and snap at her employees in a very mean way.  One time she got to talking to me about teas (a conversation I really didn't want to be having, as I was in the middle of an essay -- but she didn't seem to notice) and a line started to build with only one employee there to take care of everyone.  The kid seemed like a new hire, and looked to be struggling behind the counter.  He came over to ask her a question, and instead of helping him out she totally ignored him and kept on talking to me, even though I was clearly trying to let her know of his presence there.  Finally she whipped her head around and said, "what do you want" in a very rude way.  And when she noticed the long line she seemed to get mad at him.... a very odd situation, and it made me feel very uncomfortable.  Not the way to run a business, in my opinion. I wish this place the best, but if the owners continue to treat each other and their employees in this way, I don't see it lasting all that long.
