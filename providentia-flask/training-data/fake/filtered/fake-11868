based on it's reputation, i took my girlfriend here for her birthday dinner.  i would suggest making reservations well ahead of time.  i made our's almost a week a head of time and still everything between 4:30pm-8:30pm was taken on a saturday night.  so we went with the 8:30, got in and seated with no problems. our waiter was very nice, not fake but still very polite.  we both shared a plate of stuffed mushrooms and eggplant parm.  the mushrooms were pretty good although the stuffing seemed a tad bland compared to what we've had at other places.  the eggplant parm was very good.  i'm picky with eggplant, like a lot of sauce and cheese and they delivered with a lot of tasty sauce and smothered in melted cheese.  we also shared a bottle of their cheaper merlot (Red Rock) which was good, we're far from experienced wine drinkers.  overall everything was good and only costs us i believe $68. the only negative about our night there was the group of people next to us.  they were beyond loud.  not only loud, but obnoxious with what they were saying.  maybe they had a few before coming to dinner, i don't know.  we could tell we were not the only ones annoyed with them.  i'm not one to make a big deal about things unless it really gets out of hand so we just let it go but it would have been nice if someone from the restaurant asked them to keep it down a bit.
