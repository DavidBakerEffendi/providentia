Don't live near Little Owl anymore but still one of our favorite restaurants by far. The inside is adorable, service is a bit snooty but good, and the food is divine. Fancy comfort food. There is very little we do not like here. The gravy meatball sliders (the only food I like veal in anywhere), the bibb and beets salad, the risotto bianco with that egg yolk and truffle, the brussels sprouts-- all incredible. Always so hard to choose apps and sides for only two people! We love the famous pork chop, always cooked perfectly and so flavorful, and my husband raves about the fish. The best entree there, though, proves how good they are and that is because they have elevated chicken to such a heavenly level. Their crispy chicken dish is aptly named. The texture of the skin is perfect, the meat itself is impossibly juicy, and the seasoning is aggressive and bold. A must try. The only downsides here are that we were not impressed with our food the one time we went for lunch with a group of friends, which was surprising and disappointing, and the fact that whenever we wanted dinner here, we had to make a 5 pm reservation weeks or a month in advance if we didn't want to come in and wait for a table for over an hour. They do have a cute elevated bench for you to wait on, though, which overlooks the restaurant and makes for great people/food watching. Thank you, Little Owl, for countless wonderful dining experiences! We can't wait to return to our old home and visit you again.
