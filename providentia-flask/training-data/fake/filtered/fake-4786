I would go so far as to say this is one of the best restaurants in New York City - outstanding enough to make me actually write my first Yelp review. I have been twice now, and both times the service was impeccable and all aspects of the meal delicious and enjoyable. I suppose it gets a bit loud with large parties sitting nearby, or at the bar, but it's a trendy spot in New York City, what else can you expect? Everything we've ordered (Toro Taquitos, Short Rib Arepas, Brisket Tacos, Tacos de Pescado, Arroz con Pollo, Lechon Confitado, and a steak special) has been delicious, and I would recommend, but standouts (like I actually dream about them) include the Short Rib Arepas (mmmmm), the Brisket Tacos, and the Arroz con Pollo. I can't figure out what makes this Arroz con Pollo different and more flavorful from any other Arroz con Pollo I've ever had. For dessert, I've only had the churros, which were perfectly fried and covered with cinnamon. It came with a very generous portion that was hard to make a dent on after such a large meal...but I definitely tried. Haven't tried the avocado fries, but they're next on my list! The drinks are great, too. The Yerba Mate drink was really interesting. The food is incredible, but the thing that really sets this restaurant apart from any other New York City restaurant I've been to is the service. From start to end, all servers are incredibly helpful and attentive. The host, Angel, couldn't be more friendly - from the complimentary glass of Moscato at the end of the meal, to the handshake as we walked out the door. He really makes the experience, on top of a great meal. I'm going to keep coming back until I've made it through the menu.
