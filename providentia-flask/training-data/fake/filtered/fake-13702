Grimaldi's and Juliana's Pizza Prepare for Pizza Face-off in Dumbo? Please...what a joke these two places are. I've tried both joints more than once and conclude they are almost clones of each other. To be fair Juliana's has a different taste but is it worth it? Answer : NO!  The sauce does not taste like they use San Marzano tomatos. Even the dough is not from stone ground wheat and the yeast is not from a wild variety. They use commercial ingredients to make their pizza and charge you a high price for it. If you really know what goes on behind making a pie. Then you should know the process is a long and complicated one. As a local I can say that if you really want Pizza made by real Artisans then look at WILD RISE, EMILY and Mario Batali for a start. These reviews I've  read are made by tourist and what do they know...nothing. I know because I'm from Napoli ...trained to be a pizza artisan and work as Pizza Chef in a Manhattan 3 star Restaurant.
