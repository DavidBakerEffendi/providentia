After finding Lillie's on Yelp, we made reservations for after the show.  We came up on a bus for the day & wanted someplace fun & different to go.  It was awesome & all we were hoping for.  The staff was welcoming & so fun!  The music was lively & just perfect for the period.  The food was perfect - good selection, variety, quantity & prices.  It's a keeper!  Loved it!
