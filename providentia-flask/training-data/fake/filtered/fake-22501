This is one of the best restaurants we have been too and we came from NYC. The service, decor and food was all excellent. It's rare to find a restaurant that has perfected all three areas and more. We def recommend it and look forward to our next trip to Roia. It's worth the 2 hour drive! We especially liked how welcoming they were and attentive to our needs. Very professional and courteous. The food is outstanding!
