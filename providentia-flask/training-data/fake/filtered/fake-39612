Soooo, I took the advice of others on here to check out Sripraphai. Originally was in the mood to find an excellent Chinese Buffet in Woodside, then came along all the stars for this neighborhood Thai restaurant. I was lured by the online rating. Since it was only a 5 minute drive my house, I dragged my  husband and off we went with just a Yelp review and hungry bellies. We couldn't have been more delighted. The food was great!  We started off with the Crunchy Watercress Salad and Beef Satay sticks with peanut sauce.  Excellent! We both had beef dishes, his being the Stewed Beef and I had the Ground Beef with Garlic and Peppers. Nice portions, served with a mound of steamed rice. We capped off with coconut ice cream in the shell. We left well-fed but not feeling heavy or  weighed down. We must have picked the right night, cause food came quickly,   Final words.. the staff was sweet and the bill even sweeter, appetizers and dessert included:  $40.00 for 2. great deal!
