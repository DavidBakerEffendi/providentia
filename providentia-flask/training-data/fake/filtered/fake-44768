This place is AMAZING! I didn't know I was a latin food fan until I ate there this past wknd. We went on a Sat night with no reservations and enjoyed a delicious spicy pepper cocktail at the bar while we waited for our table. The hostess worked fast to seat us within 20 min and the servers were very fast, efficient, and attentive. We got the ceviche, arapas, guacamole, and fish tacos. The Fish tacos have to be in the top 10 best things I've ever eaten. The guac was also the best guac I've ever had. The manager came over to make sure we enjoyed everything, shook my bf's hand, and even helped me put my coat on before we left. I will def add this restaurant to my group of regulars in NYC. Plus somehow our bill was only $105 after all those appetizers and drinks. Loved it!
