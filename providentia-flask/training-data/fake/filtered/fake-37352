I just came from a delightful lunch at Cafe La Maude.  The food was amazing and the service was excellent.  I work in No. Libs and have exhausted most of the usual lunch spots in the area.  I feel lucky to have discovered this place.  They are small and only accept cash so keep that in mind when going... but definitely go!
