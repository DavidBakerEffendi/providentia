Went in there for a happy hour drink / appetizer-which-is-actually-dinner.   Wasn't so bad - pricey, obviously.    My wife and I shared a table with a couple of  Princeton people and found the conversation next to us quite interesting.  I'm from the West Coast and had never heard the word "offshore" used as a verb, but the people next to me were quite  comfortable with it.
