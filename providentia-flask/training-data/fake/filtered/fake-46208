Despite all the power that goes into the seating hostess' head while you wait for a table, this is the place to grab some Hitachino beer and get something yelled at you in Japanese when you walk in. Other than that, the taste of ramen has slipped a lot.  Too salty and you don't hear that slurping sound like you should when you go into a ramen joint.  You know what I'm saying??!!
