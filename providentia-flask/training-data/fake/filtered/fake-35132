I've been here a couple of times since it opened and can say I've never had a bad time!  Be sure to check it out this Friday 3/25 as the Dark Horse will have live music from John Malone!  Anyway, this place is everything I need in a bar, plenty of TV's, great service, full menu and reasonable prices.  The guys who run this place now have done a great job.  And the downstairs space is a great size and is perfect for parties.  All in all just a very cool place!
