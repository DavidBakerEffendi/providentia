My adult daughter and adult son recently spent 4 days in the city,so time was very valuable.We choose this restaurant as our last place to dine before heading to the airport.Absolutely wonderful experience.The atmosphere,the service and the food!! Not to forget we saw Tony Bennett walk in..I think this man should certainly know good food from poor! I had their Gondoletta Pasta..it was amazing...like heaven!! I will certainly be back.Thank you Villagio...you left a great memory with this foodie!!
