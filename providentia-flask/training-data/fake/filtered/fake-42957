Went today with colleagues from work for Lunch buffet. few of us were vegetarians and there were few items for vegetarian people. The food was so cold and also the restaurant was cold. When we went there, they said our heater is not working. inside temperature was 60 degree when we got there but they are not shutting down the place. At least we could have gone somewhere else. Â Food was cold. only 3 items (rajma, dal makhni and Panner sabji) for vegetarian people. and everything was out of refrigerator. They just put all the left over out there from the weekend. Naans were all like crackers. My Russian friend was making fun of the bread too. She only came for the Naan...They didn't even bother making fresh Naan for us. Dal Makhani was so blend tested just cream. Paneer sabji was like a soup with few peaces of paneer in it. I will never go back to this place and not recommend anyone else to go.
