I went to brunch and wasn't real satisfied. I always thought the food must be good here because there are usually a lot of cars. Waited about 10 minutes for a table then another 40 for the food. I don't mind the waiting as it's more time to socialize. As soon as the food was put in front of me I was not impressed on the portions. I had the Islander which was 2 pancakes/eggs/potato wedges and bacon. I also got a side of toast. The eggs were so greasy I couldn't eat them. The pancakes were the skinny/hard to cut ones which are probably bought/heated up. The wedges and bacon were good. The $1.50 side of toast was 1 piece of toast cut in half. I ended up leaving hungry. I'd avoid this place for brunch. Go somewhere like Apollo in Milton where you get more/better food for less money.
