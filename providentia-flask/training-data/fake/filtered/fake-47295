Definitely my favorite Asian food in Orange.  They have great lunch specials too.  I would highly recommend the Chicken Shanghai Noodle Soup with udon noodles and the Szechuan dumplings.  The owners are very gracious and accommodating.  It seems like they use the freshest ingredients and everything is made to order.
