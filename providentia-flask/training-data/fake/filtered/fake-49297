What they said. Better than Nicky's. They've gotten better on their wait times I have noticed, in the last few months, but just to be on the safe side I do call ahead and have still gotten stuck waiting even when there are seemingly no orders ahead of me. But I can deal with it, a craving is a craving and it is not like I'm that skilled at creating banh mi on my own otherwise I wouldn't be walking over 2 blocks every 3 days or so. I suggest the classic, spicy. My friend raves about the tofu, but I have to take her word for it. :)
