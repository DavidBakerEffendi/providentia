Their bacon sliders a like a little piece of heaven. Perfectly cooked burger with little bits of bacon and onion on them. The service was pretty good. Nice and quick and very polite, but I could tell us having her go back and forth for water refills annoyed her a bit haha. I don't know what type of cheese they use on the cheese fries but it's not my type. It's too smoky for the fries imo. All in all this is a good place to stop by for relatively cheap food.
