Looks like the scenery of From Dusk Till Dawn which I think is awesome! The food is phenomenal; great priced to! You'll get a lot of bang for your buck here believe me! The Â only drawback to this restaurant I have is the fact that, you cannot make any reservations. Never fails that whatever time or day it is; I wait from the span of 30 minutes to a little above an hour. Well worth it though!
