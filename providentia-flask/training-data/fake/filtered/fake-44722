Started out @ the bar with some friends.What started out as 4 ended up as 8. We downed the Poquito Picantes and fish tacos! What an amazing time with the bartender who was sooooo accomodating! Well I had such a blast that I came back with my fiance! She loved the black cod I had the ribeye steak and of course the spicy cocktail i loved! My fiance had a red drink with a rose in it very nice but to girly for me! The funny thing is I look over and I see that actor from NY Undercover and Tyler Perry movie Malik Yoba! My fiance asked me if I knew everyone here I said i came here a few days ago and had to bring you with me .The way they made me feel as if i was a VIP with my lady I appreciate that!! I will be back! Too bad I live in Long Island it a heck of a ride....but its sooo worth it
