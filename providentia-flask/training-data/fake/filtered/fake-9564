I have been to this restaurant on a number of occasions  and have never been disappointed.  The food is always extraordinary  and the staff is extremely welcoming and attentive.    The swordfish is one of the best I've had and their eggplant appetizer they offer as a special is out of this world.  If you're in the Princeton area, definitely give this restaurant a try!
