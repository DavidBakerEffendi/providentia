I thought the food was decent for brunch but the hostess and staff are lacking. I mean the hostess seated other people that just walked in without a reservation or anything just because they walked to the front (which wouldn't be a big deal if the wait time for brunch wasn't so long and they ended up getting a booth when we had to sit at an awkward position facing the sun). I did really like the crab cake benedict--if you don't like cheese make sure to ask for no cheese!
