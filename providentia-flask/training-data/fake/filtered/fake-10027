It would have been nice to have been sat, but it's too bad the "hostess" and "ma√Ætre d'" decided to allow their friends to sit before my friend and I. We got there and waited in a claustrophobic, chaotic, box of a restaurant with a "hostess" who barely acknowledged us outside of writing down our name. As a former waiter of many years, I watched the two of them and saw how they sat three tables with all of their friends after we had been waiting for 25 minutes (was told 15-20 minute wait). Then, I saw a waitress coax the hostess into allowing her to seat HER friends at HER table. Shocking. I had enough and was about to leave. Suddenly! Acknowledgement! The hostess grabs my arm and says "Your table is almost ready... but you can leave if you want." As if to say, "I'm doing YOU a favor... you should be so lucky." I've got two words for you, but I'll bite my tongue. Unethical, immoral, and a bloody disgrace that they disregard their customers in order to take care of their friends who prance in. Don't give me that "they had a reservation" crap because I was told they don't give reservations for parties less than 6 and these were 2 tops. Too bad we'll never go back again and be sure to let everyone know. Disgruntled customer? Yeah, probably. But, had it not been for the complete disregard for people who had been waiting almost a half hour, I would have waited patiently and quietly for another 15-20.
