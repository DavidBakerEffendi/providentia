I am a little shocked at how bad some of the reviews are for this place. I have been going here since it opened and it is definitely one of my favorites. Here is why: 1. It is such a neighborhood place and the owners are very community-oriented. 2. This place is not a chain--they are not going to kiss your butt if you think that you are somehow entitled to be rude because you are being "waited" on. If you act like a jerk, you shouldn't be surprised if the server is getting annoyed. Sometimes it is you that is a problem. 3. The food is good and it is a fair price. There are many places in West Philadelphia (esp. the ones that try to cater to the richer students) that are much more expensive and not as good. 4. They catered a wedding for me recently and gave me such a fair price on the food. They even threw in a bunch of extras that no other catering place would have done for a wedding. The catering staff was excellent and everything turned out great. 5. I have worked in catering and have been a waitress and I can say that it is not easy to find places like The Gold Standard, a place that is owned by people with such ties to the community. I am glad that places like this are still around this neighborhood.
