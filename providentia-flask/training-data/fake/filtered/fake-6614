The menus and bill case was filthy and worn out, I was afraid to touch the menu and put my credit card in the case. I'm shocked they're not embarrassed by this! Â  As I was eating a fly kept buzzing round the food. My advice to Thai Essence is CLEAN properly and stop over looking the details!! Stop being gross and replace those nasty menus and bill cases!! And get rid of those breeding flies......But on the up side the food was delicious at good prices.
