This restaurant is all hype and it is a pity because we were really excited to check it out. We were a party of seven so with appetizers, seconds, entrees and desserts we were able to try a variety of dishes on the menu from pizza to steak to apple pie.  None of it was impressive, in fact, the artichoke appetizer was tasteless and not cooked, the calamari appetizer barely had any calamari in it and was fishy, the scallop entree had only 3 scallops and the steak dinner was over cooked even though it was ordered rare.  But that wasn't the worst part, the service was terrible. While our waitress was sweet and she did a fine job the people who were helping were way too quick to take our plates away. In fact they took one plate while one of us still had a fork in his mouth.We were unable to finish.  In addition there was one waitress that was completely rude to the other wait staff and customers.  I am not sure about the rest of our party but I am sure my husband and I will never go to this restaurant again.  And we have been to a number of Chef Garces Restaurants.
