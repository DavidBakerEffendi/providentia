Instead of going to my usual Saturday brunch haunt I decided to try the newly re-opened Khyber Pass Pub. The menu is southern style with some pub fare.     They certainly changed things around, the new dining room with benches lining the walls and mixed chairs has a very homey feeling. Pails of hot sauce and napkins arrive at your table when you sit,  Although they have a new extensive beer list I decided to have a Bloody Mary to start with.     I checked out the menu and was really in the mood for the fried chicken, you get two sides with the entrees, I picked the bbq baked beans and some mashed potatoes. Even though on the menu it said that it would be a 20 min wait, it came out quick and hot. The servers checked up on me and were very nice, i'll have to try many more things before it takes over my fav  Saturday spot, but I will surely be back for more.
