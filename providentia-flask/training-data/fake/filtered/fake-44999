I came across this place one night when my boyfriend and I were searching for a good place to have a "Date Night". The food they serve is spectacular! Their specialty is Flammekueche, an Alsatian specialty which is basically like a thin crust pizza with onions, bacon, creamy cheese and many other toppings. The food is crazy cheap (about 10$ for a HUGE pie) and my boyfriend and I shared 2 of them for our main meal. One was the standard cheese, bacon and onions and the other had goat cheese, bacon, onions, honey and creamy cheese. The one with the honey and goat cheese was my favorite (AMAZING). We also ordered a sweet version for dessert that was delicious and could barely finish it (I think 2 is enough for 2 people) This location is small and charming, very well laid out and cozy. The owner/manager came over to introduce himself and his place, considering that it's a relatively new spot, and made us feel very welcome and appreciated as customers. The waitress was also extremely helpful and friendly and they even refilled my coke like 3 times (I thought it was just the price of one can of soda but they kept bringing me more!). HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!! This place saved our date night after another restaurant kept us waiting for 20 minutes, WITH a reservation. I'm so glad we came here instead and will be coming back again and again!! Thanks!
