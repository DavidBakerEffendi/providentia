They've been advertising their 3 lb lobster specials in the local paper so we came here to see what they were all about.  We have come here a 2X.  The food was good but the service left much to be desired-it was like campng out. They forgot to serve certain items that were part of their offer. Both times that we were there were on Saturday evenings. The restaurant was quite noisy. Their location is off the beaten path in the Ironbound section of Newark.
