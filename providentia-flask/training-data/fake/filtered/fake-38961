GREAT food!! BYOB is a major plus!! Always crowded around dinner time so make sure to make a reservation!! There was just one huge problem.   My group of four total was ready too pay our bill. The manager came and accepted our cash. She took it from us and gave it to our waitress.  Now at this point, we were expecting our waitress to be polite and ask us if we wanted change back.  Well thats not what happened.  She hid around the corner and was watching us.  We sat there waiting and waiting for some type of money back.  We never got anything and ended up being escorted out because our table was needed for new guests. We tried to explain what happened to both the manager and the waitress and the waitress played it off like nothing was wrong. We had to leave, didn't feel welcome, and left realizing that a 42% tip on a $117.00 bill was a little tooooo much. All and all, great meal and great food, just look out for waitresses and managers coming to you and be specific what you want done, You are the customer and the customer is always right.
