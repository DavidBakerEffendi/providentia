Kelly is a server at Hellz Kitchen in Newark and she's very unprofessional. The staff at this lovely establishment are very nice and welcoming except for Kelly. She has such an attitude and even the guards tell people to watch out for her because she's "like that". Uhm sorry but if she works there, then her being "like that" should not be part of her job description. She should be more welcoming and not yell at the customers or give them attitude and curse at them as if she's out with her friends. If you're working then act like it and Kelly definitely is the most obnoxious, rude, and disrespectful server at Hellz Kitchen. So if anyone wants to go there then make sure she's not there because I guarantee she'll disrespect you also. Other than this unprofessional server, Hellz Kitchen is a great place to go.
