I love the food there it is so good that I could eat there everyday!! Great for parties because they have a pool table and somewhat good service!! I am a really fan, don't go there often but I go there sometimes to have something junky to eat or healthy. But over all I would go there with your kids and friends and also when it is guys night out and the girls are taken of they house they could go there and have a nice beer and enjoy the football game or baseball game with there friends!! Great place to hangout!
