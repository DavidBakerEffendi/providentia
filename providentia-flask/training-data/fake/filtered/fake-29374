GREAT sandwiches!!!!! Brian and his crew are very polite, and will even have a conversation with you while he makes your sub (as long as it doesn't have a line out the door, which it usually does). And the subs!!! They are known for their Steak & cheese, and if you re not a huge eater, 1 sub could be lunch and dinner... And of course, when it comes to the cold cuts or cheese, nothing but Boars Head for his customer's. All i can say is if you re hungry and in New Haven, stop by and tell them Craig sent you!
