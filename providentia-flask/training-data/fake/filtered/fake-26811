RIP OFF!!!! This burrito, that claims to be in the San Francisco mission style is lacking one important thing: SIZE.   The chicken burrito that I got tasted decent, but was about 1/3 the size of those I have gotten in San Fran.  It was considerably smaller than Chipotle, and didn't taste much better.  In fact, I ate the burrito with one hand while standing on the R train, and finished in two stops.  If hungry, I would need two of these to satisfy me, which at $9 a pop, is NOT worth it.
