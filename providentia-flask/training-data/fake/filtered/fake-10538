As somebody who has worked in Korean restaurants before, I can honestly say that Seoul is mediocre at best. The first time I went there I just got a small order of dukk bokki to go and a side of kimchi. Wasn't horrible but was certainly not Â great. Second time I dined in with 2 friends we order a kimchi pajun which was crisp but very thin and didn't seem to have much substance to it. The ban chan were also mediocre and not very generous of portions considering our over $100 bill. I had Spicy pork loin for my dinner which was good however when I asked for lettuce and bean paste to make lettuce wraps they said that I couldn't and that was only if you did table barbecue(which they didnt have many options for). My friends got spicy stir-fried squid and jap chae for dinner, both were decent. However the stir fry was hardly spicy. I ordered a order of duk bokki to bring home as Seoul is the only restaurant in the area that offers it. As the only place in New Haven to really serve Korean food you have to give them some credit, wasn't the worst Korean food I've ever had. The female owner is very sweet and I would love to see them do better in the future
