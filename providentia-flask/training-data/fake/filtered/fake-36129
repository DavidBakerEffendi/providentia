I visited The Pantry for the first time--and it won't be the last!  The Salmon Eggs Benedict and home fries were fantastic; tasted like the best home cooking.  I couldn't resist ordering one of the carrot cake pancakes, and I'm glad I did, because it was delicious.  (I come from a family of great cooks, and am not easily impressed.) Once I was seated, the service was very fast, and EXTREMELY friendly.  I wonder whether the people who called the staff "rude" and "unfriendly" were rude THEMSELVES.  Here's a hint:  Greet your server with a smile and say you've heard great things about the place.  It will pay off. The Pantry is a cozy little corner eatery.  If you want slick decor and more elbow room, go to some chain outfit like The Cheesecake Factory.  If you want to feel at home, go to The Pantry.
