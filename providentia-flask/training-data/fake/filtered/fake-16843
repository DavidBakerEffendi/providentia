Actual star rating is 4.5! I have been to ABC Kitchen 5 times now and will continue to come back for more. The food is fantastic!   All of their entrees are sensational and the ambiance is great. My advice would be to order something from each part of the menu. Some highlights: Roasted Carrot and Avocado Salad, the Mushroom Egg Pizza and the Akaushi Cheeseburger. Soooo delicious! If you tell your server that you are splitting courses, they will do it for you in the kitchen.   Sometimes the service isn't great but I have never had bad service. Can't wait to come back here again soon!
