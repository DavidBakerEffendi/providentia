On our way to NY with my son to  look at a venue for his wedding and decided to stop in West Haven for dinner.   Found this restaurant by chance.  This is the best restaurant I have been to in years.....I could go on an on for days!  They have a Prime Rib I have not even seen at Morton's in Boston.  The Seafood Special with Lobster was exceptional! The Bar staff was attentive and the customers were so welcoming and friendly to us!  The home made soup and salad are included with the entrees.  You will be amazed at all this restaurant has to offer.  I am going to have to go back there for dinner soon....this restaurant is worth a 3 hour drive!!!!!!! AWESOME!!!!!!
