Was there a few weeks ago with  a group of people.  Won't go back. First, the food: mediocre at best, and I am unsure why other customers have raved about the beef in their hamburgers, which is under seasoned and mine had gristle in it.   We all ordered various types of hamburgers, prepared to varying levels of doneness -- none rare.  All came back undercooked.   It would seem that the kitchen, in violation of health code, puts returned burgers (already nibbled on and condimented)  BACK on the grill to cook them more, after scraping the cheese and other condiments off, and then returns said piece of meat back to the customer!!!! Upon return to us, the hamburgers looked massacred and the cheese was like plastic.  Shame on them. We also had buffalo wingers, which were oily and soggy, and they served some of the most insipid fries I have ever had in my life. Second, the service was surly to unhelpful and the waitress seemed to get a bit of an attitude when we returned our undercooked hamburgers and requested extra napkins. Last, the volume of the restaurant was just too loud for comfortable conversation. Maybe Prime 16's food is good if you do not really like food  or  you like slop with your alcohol. Never again.
