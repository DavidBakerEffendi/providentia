Pepe's is great, sure, as is Modern.  But the single greatest pizza on the face of the planet can be found here.  Basically if you've never had Sally's you've really never had pizza. Yes, there's the wait, the bad service...but suck it up and deal...it's part of the experience.  (Is your time REALLY that important?  NO!  It's not.) Just get a plain old cheese pie...small...ALWAYS order small...anything else and you start messing with the integrity of the pizza.  Then savor the greatest taste experience of your life. Really...THIS IS IT.  And either you get it, or you don't.
