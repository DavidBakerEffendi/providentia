Just ok- didn't live up to the hype. We frequent the sushi restaurant across the street, and have always noticed that this place is packed. We also read many of the positive yelp reviews about it. Went on a Tuesday night to try to avoid the crowd, we still had to wait but ended up being seated in about 10 min. The food was just ok. We ordered the calamari with marinara sauce as an appetizer- it was fine but nothing special. I had the salmon- same story, perfectly fine but nothing special, really fairly bland. It was, however, huge- I only ate half. I tried my wife's shrimp stuffed with crab meat, which was better than the salmon as there was more flavor to it. The busboy brought us custard on the house, which was appreciated (it looked like everyone in the restaurant was getting it). This was the best part of the meal. What was really lacking was the service. The hostess was fairly rude, which I find forgivable- not being able to get my water glass refiled was not. The waiter mixed our order up, though that was quickly fixed, but after that we never saw him again. The side dishes came a while after the entrees. No one asked how our meal was or if we wanted anything else (like refills). Not particularly cheap, and you cannot put the tip on a credit card- which I find to be both inconvenient and shady. It wasn't horrible, but we probably won't be back anytime soon.
