Baby Blues is an interesting and unique find, located conveniently between Drexel's and Penn's campus.  I wasn't sure what to expect when going in for the first time, as I've never been a big barbecue person but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I got the pulled pork platter (there was a lot of meat for your money) with the sweet potatoes and mac n cheese.  The pulled pork was absolutely amazing (very juicy and flavorful), especially with the apple cider vinegar which was definitely the perfect compliment to it.  The sweet potatoes were probably the best I've had so far, they were quite sweet and had the ideal consistency for mashed potatoes.  And although I've never been much of a mac n cheese person, my waitress had advised me to give a try because it was really good and she was right!  It was very unique with the different cheeses they used and I liked the little extra oomph it had. Clearly, I now am a regular of Baby Blues.  The place is almost always buzzing with energy along with good music.  You always get a lot of food for your money and the menu has an insane amount of new things to try.  The staff have always been very personable and attentive and they definitely make you feel welcome. All of the waitresses and waiters are very good about answering questions concerning the food and drinks.  I continue to be impressed and I highly recommend you give it a try!
