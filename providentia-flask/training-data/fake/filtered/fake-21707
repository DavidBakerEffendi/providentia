I have no idea where these awesome reviews are coming from. We went to celebrate a friends birthday in Aug. (I'm a little late with this review) The bread for the table was totally stale. I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich was down right disgusting. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and get this...the waitress placed the bottle on the table and said they only have "limited wine service" and that she would leave it up to us to pour our own wine!! WTF? I never heard of such a thing!!! If you want to have a drink or celebrity watch Joe Allen might be worth a stop but that's about all folks.
