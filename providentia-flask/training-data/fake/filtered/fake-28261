I wandered what happened to the old man who was in the BBQ section. I can't help but miss that guy. He always gave me the best part of BBQ. It was delicious. I would go there once a week. Then I relocated. When I came back, I've seen that new guy at BBQ section. OMG a disaster!!! He doesn't even know how to slice the meat. He always gave me the worst part of the meat. Once I complained and said, "No I don't want that part" then he looked at the cashier( they look alike, they might be brother or something) and he said "what's wrong with that part?" " I said "that part has lots of fat and black like hell" I sat down there to eat ,my brazilian friend walked in and sat next to me . he said he heard them laughing and talking behind my back. Can you believe it?
