I've gotten take-out from this location several times. I'm a HUGE burger fan so I like most hamburgers. However, their burgers do not particularly stand out. Depending on what size/style burger you get, they are your typical better-than-fast-food burgers. They taste good on an empty stomach and definitely scream all-American. Regrettably, I would have to say that it does not really hold a candle to Bobby's Burger Palace. BBP's burgers would win out every time. Though, I was excited to find that this is one of the few restaurants anywhere (not on the Shore) that sells really well made fried pickles. (They also have fried mushrooms, but I didn't try those.) Overall, their menu is really focused on burgers, made to order in whichever combination you would like. You get to choose the meat, the toppings, the sauces, the cheese, etc. (Unlike BBP where they have pre-designed burgers). Â  Take-out service is about 10-15 minutes if you order in store. Not bad for a quick bite of burger and fries.
