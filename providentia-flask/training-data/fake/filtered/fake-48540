oh man i love pats cheesesteaks they're amazing. i drove up to philly from maryland with a couple of friends for this and after the 2 1/2 hour drive we got to pats and man it was worth it. the meat is so good and the peppers they have compliment it very well along with their other sauce. the service that i and my friends received was simply outstanding along with how quickly our food came (it was almost instant) every one should defidently try one of these things before they die its a MUST!!! I plan on coming back soon with more of my friends :)
