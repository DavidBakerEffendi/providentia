This is a great place, good value for the money with generous portions!  The owner is super nice and always comes around to check on everyone...personalized service and recognition which encourages customer loyalty!   The portions are large, lots of fresh bread, and a free yummy dessert....like most people here b'coz the place is small seating is limited therefore there is a long wait.  Best bet, go there when you are not dying of hunger because it will only put you in a cranky mood....go there when you are willing to enjoy a leisurely and late dining experience!!! :-) Enjoyyyyyyyyyyyy
