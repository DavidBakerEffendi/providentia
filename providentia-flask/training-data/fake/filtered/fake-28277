Yum, yum, yummy! Delicious! The food was really good. I come from a west indian family, and my dad is an amazing cook, so my pallet is definitely spoiled. I must say the food here is great! A wonderful place to take your girlfriends, or a special somebody. The only con was my waiter (Nick) was stressed, so he was less than pleasant, but not so grumpy that it ruined my visit. I will go back very soon :) Oh yea, I did ask him for a side of the lemon potatoes when my dinner came out, because the side dish we ordered for the table was smaller than I expected, and he said "No". When he should have said, "Yes, but it will take a while to come out". Hopefully I will get someone who can actually handle stress gracefully.... or whatever his issue was... In my opinion, it doesn't matter what kind of white people they are, they still hold a chip on their shoulders about blacks. They need to get use to us, and enlighten themselves, so pathetic.
