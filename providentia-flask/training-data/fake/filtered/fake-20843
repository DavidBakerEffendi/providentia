I came here for Happy Hour and I enjoyed it.  We didn't really have to wait to get a table in the bar and we got waiter service too.  Happy hour runs from 4-7PM and then 10PM until closing great prices for food and selected drinks (Nick's Infusion Jars for $4 and $5 and $6 martinis).  This is actually my first time at the bar so I was really blessed since my visiting friends often found it to be quite classy.  The service was attentive and friendly.  My friend's drink (fruit infusion) was actually a bit too "alcoholic" for her taste so they fixed it up again.
