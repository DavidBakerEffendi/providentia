Believe the hype--these guys rule. I honestly believe this is the best value in the city. The food is outstanding (better than what you'd find at most comparable sit-down restaurants) and amazingly inexpensive. The guys are friendly in a no-nonsense way and will sometimes give you a free (and delicious!) falafel patty while you wait.
