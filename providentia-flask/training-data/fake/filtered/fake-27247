We recently have dinner at Russillo. They were offering a speical of veal ostombucca with vegetable rissotto. I have had this dish often. its one of my favorites. one of the owners came up to me and asked me how it was. I responded it was so good that i ate it as slow as possible.. It was the best I ever had! The service is always good and the place has a causal confortable feeling. For this type of resturant Â the food could not be better!!
