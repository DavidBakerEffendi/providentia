I am so excited I finally open a yelp account. My friends and I are always dinning and having fun around the great city of NY and now I get to write some of our amazing experiences. So we always go to yuca for drinks and then we hit some club or a lounge, depends on the mood but this last tuesday we decided to eat here. It was half tapas and happy hour, of course we only knew about the happy happy hour so after two pitchers of sangria at the bar we went and ask the hostess for a table for seven. Wow a 45 min wait. The place was packed I have to say, so we continue sipping our sangria's and waiting. The hostess looked kind of confused but was really nice, she call the manager for a more accurate time and 40 min later we got seated, Was past 8 so the half price tapas was over but we were able to grab some tapas at this price. Thanks Yuca bar. Service was good, the food amazing. See you next tuesday for sure.
