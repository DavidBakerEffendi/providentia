A not-so good indian restaurant..The quality of food was just ok..One of the waiter was rude..We ordered BIRYANI along with the main order of Butter chicken and butter naan, but we were served with order without biryani, on asking the waiter for the biryani , we were served with rude tone of "its coming"
