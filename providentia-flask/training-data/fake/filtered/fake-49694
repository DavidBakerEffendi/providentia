Expected this to be much better...especially for the price. Showed up at 4pm in support of our local top chef contestant. My wife and i were seated at the smallest table available despite a crowd of maybe 5 customers. Waitress was impatient and seemed "bothered" to be serving us. We were informed that dinner menu was not available until after 5:30 (disappointing but understandable). I had the escabeche of olives and my wife had the charcuterie. Olives were great and the hint of thyme was fantastic....but seriously, it was just a little plate of olives. The charcuterie was a few slices of deli meat slapped on a plate. I was shocked at how sloppy the presentation was. Meats were good but could get the same quality at shop-rite. We followed the apps with confit chicken salad and hanger steak. Only word I can use to describe the food is "institutional". Menu selection was terrible (sandwich, fries, salad was about the only choices). Chicken overcooked and under seasoned....steak WAY undercooked, and terribly fatty. Sauce on the steak was divine though. Service continued to be bad as our waitress and another waiter CONSTANTLY adjusted table settings at neighboring tables. We were the only 2 people in the section and did not get more than thirty seconds of privacy at a time. Not to mention that it took about ten minutes to be offered our first drink and menus. Finally, we received our check and to our surprise this ho-hum meal cost over $110! Granted, we had 2 beer flights (over priced for the selection) but still, this meal reminded me of well done cafeteria food, not Top Chef caliber cuisine. As everyone else mentioned, the grounds were beautiful and the decor of Rat's is pretty nice. Also, we stopped back at the bar later in the day/evening and had a terrific experience. Bar staff was pleasant and knowledgeable and made everyone feel at home. The home-made sangria is tops!
