After living in Belgium for three years with my husband, finding this place when we got back home to NYC was a miracle! The menu is basic, as in fries and all fries, but they are so dang good. I recommend going classic as it hits the spot like none other, but my husband always tries their other fun creations and says they are delish. Definitely worth a try!
