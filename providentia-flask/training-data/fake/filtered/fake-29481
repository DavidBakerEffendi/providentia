The food was very good but the service was terrible. Â The shrimp was great and the chicken was awesome. There was 15 of us and after we sat we waited 20 minutes to get waited on. We waited another 20 minutes to get our drinks. You couldn't even get another cup of coffee. It wasn't worth the terrible service.
