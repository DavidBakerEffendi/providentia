Friend and I decided on this place due to the fact that they supposedly have a great burger. I make it a point to always find one place in a city that prides itself on its burger and check it out. I have eaten burgers from east coast to west, found many that a fast food place does better but mostly just good burgers. This place does an exceptional job, mine was cooked med rare , crusted on outside , toasted bun , flavored , no complaints ... except the price .  The service was exceptional .. have found none better. Both my friend and I have been in the food industry for over 30 years and I have not been more impressed.  The place was packed but we were seated after a short wait and during that wait , we were updated twice that our table would be coming open shortly .. a star just for that simple gesture .. truly enjoyed this restaurant and will go back .
