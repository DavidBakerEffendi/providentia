I ate at Fornos this past weekend and my experience was horrible.  I was enjoying a nice dinner when a brawl broke out and it took about ten minutes to clear the group of people who were fighting in the middle of the dining room. Management responded but seemed to be in shock and moved extremely slow. Newark P.D. responded and eventually made an arrest for the apparent stabbing!!!   The entire dining room cleared during the fight but I chose to stay because I felt the problems would just spill out to the parking lot.  Two tables remained from a full dining room of people and all management was concerned about was seating more tables.  No one approached the remaining customers to check how anyone was doing. All I saw was a manager urging his waiter staff to re-seat the tables with new customers and move on like knives weren't flying around five minutes ago.   I was very disappointed and after receiving my bill, I left with a very bad taste in my mouth from this horrible dining experience.  I will never go back there and I will tell all my friends to avoid this place.
