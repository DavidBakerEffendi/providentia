Went here because I got a groupon deal..the services is great...BUT the portions are small the place is beyond hot felt like I was sitting in HELL...had to take the rest of my food to go because it was so hot in the place. Â They are cheap with the rice but there isn't a storage of beans. Prices are to high for the lack of food that you get. Wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy over priced.
