I'm a huge fan of Mexican restaurants and when breakfast is served, I'm there! After reading the reviews in favor of Cisco's breakfast, my family and I (including two out-of-state Mexican foodies too!) decided to try Cisco's---even though it was quite a drive for us. We were so disappointed. After being served a mediocre breakfast (my family had wished we went to the DINER instead!), my son was actually given spoiled milk. The servings were not anything out of the ordinary, quite sparse actually. They must have been low on stock that morning because I ordered the veggie burrito and it was basically filled with potatoes and a scarce amount of spinach and mushrooms. Not to mention with hardly any kick to it at all. I really wanted to find a gem hidden in Newington, certainly wouldn't mind the ride if it was worth it but next time, we'll stay local and go to the diner.
