I gave this place more than 2 stars because 2/4 people in my party really enjoyed their meal. Also the service and atmosphere was excellent. Maybe I struck out with my choices but my appetizer and dinner were 2 stars at best. My wife got filet mignon and said it was ok. I got a lamb belly appetizer which had an ok flavor but I couldn't stomach the meat. For the main course I had tilefish which was ok, but the sauce it was in just didn't compliment the taste of the fish. I was almost repulsed by both dishes. My parents on the other hand enjoyed their meals so I can't give this place a terrible review. On the other hand the bread was out of this world. It felt like I was taking a bite out of a cloud. It was also rather expensive but I knew that going in. I will not be returning to this restaurant, my parents however probably will.
