i love it! the only down side is the long wait but thats just because its so amazing and its also huge like if your not completly starving or under the influence you can not finish the slice its just impossible but i will not quit trying beause i just want it all in my belly!! warning my sister isnt a huge fan because she says it reminds her of alfrado sauce which doesnt sit well with her so if you have those problems then get a margarita other then that go artichoke!
