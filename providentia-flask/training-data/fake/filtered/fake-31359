We got a comment card from the server Sam but I wasn't sure he would turn it in if I gave it to him. We were there in the early morning. My meal ( Bubby's breakfast) was cold -- room temperature at best. Toast like cardboard, potatoes in a cold lump and eggs that sat for quite awhile before delivery. And, cold bacon that was like jerky. Really, that's what you serve? I would have sent it back but Sam never came back to table until everyone was finished. No one asked, "how is everything?" And no one brought more coffee. My grandson's pancakes were warmer and satisfactory. The restaurant was not busy when we arrived around 8:15 AM so that is not a reasonable excuse. I assume my breakfast was finished before the rest of my party and it sat on a counter for awhile. Based on reputation and prices (our tab was over $100 for 4), I expected a lot more from Bubby's. I sent them an E-mail and got no reply. Kinda like being ignored while I was there. Clark Harrison from PA
