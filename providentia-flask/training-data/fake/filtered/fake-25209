when they get it together i think it could be a nice neighborhood go-to, but if i need to bring something special, i'm better off making it myself.   i've been in 3 times now -- once to look and the other two to buy.  their presentation is totally inconsistent.  one day, the cakes and cupcakes are tantalizing and well done, another they look like a 2nd grader brought goodies in for b'day party. i only got cupcakes once (on a day they looked pretty, a walnut ginger chai -- and tasty!   but also kinda meh...) but i can guess that the look of them probably says a lot about how much care goes into making them... i hope they figure it out.  aside from a superb berry scone, nothing impressed me that much.  if i can do it better in my kitchen, i will.  they need to get some inventive and pro recipes/presentation under their belt.
