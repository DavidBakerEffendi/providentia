My Â daughter, who studied at NYU for 4 years, suggested this place for lunch. The place has a good ambience, with cozy atmosphere. The waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. The menu has most of our meals which my wife prepares at home and as Filipinos. Nothing out of the ordinary. I ordered the tapa, which disappointed me, because the meat was chewy and hard to cut. I did not finish the entree, and we were given 50% discount for a meal that was not eaten. I would give good points for the ambience and the waiter staff, but low grade on the food. I do not intend to go back or take another look at this restaurant.
