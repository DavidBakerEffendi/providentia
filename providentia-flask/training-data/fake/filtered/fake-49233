I dined at Dragonfly with my boyfriend a few days ago. We were happy to find out that they had live jazz in their bar area which could be heard throughout the restaurant. They had a nice menu with a lot of great choices and a very creative drink list. We split a yummy bottle of Sauvignon Blanc for $20 which is really affordable for a restaurant. I had the crab topped salmon which was recommended by our waitress and loved it! My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon and was impressed by the quality of the meat and how well it was cooked. For dessert we split the fried cheesecake with ice cream and thoroughly enjoyed it. The atmosphere was lovely with different pieces of interesting decor throughout. The fish tank which was lit blue was cool looking although it needed some more fish for such a large tank. Great new spot, we'll be back again.
