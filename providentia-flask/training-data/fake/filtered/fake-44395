Have eaten at Jersey Mac's several times for lunch and recently tried dinner. Â The food we ordered was very good; my wife and I had the butternut squash soup, spinach salad, pulled pork sandwich, chili and desserts. All was fresh and delicious, reasonably priced, and the service was fine. This place must have turned the corner from earlier reviews - it is one of our favorites.
