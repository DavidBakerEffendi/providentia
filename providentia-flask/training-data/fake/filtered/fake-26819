I have been scouring the city for good, cheap mexican and may just have set the bar impossibly high. however, dos toros ranks high on the list of where I've been. cheap, fast, quality meats and trappings. it's barely more than a taco stand, so seating is limited. get in and get out, and you may confuse it with a mini-chipotle without the corporate stigma.
