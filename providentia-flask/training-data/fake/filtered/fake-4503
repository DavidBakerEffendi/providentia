At first I wasn't very eager to eat here as I'm not a HUGE fan of Mexican food. After my 1st trip to Los Caballitos, I am now sold! The cocktail list had several intriguing options. We decided to order the prickly pear mohito and the blood orange margarita (extra salt!) The former was really good however the margarita was the favorite choice on successive rounds. I strongly suggest you to try the margaritas if you do decide to eat here (on the rocks and opt for the whole pitcher...it will save you $$$ because you will want to order another after you have the 1st-it's THAT good!). I can't leave out my favorite part of the drink which was the neon straw that came with it (yes, I get excited by neon straws... super fun! LOL) The place is very clean and has a wonderful vibe with the jukebox and the neon lights on the ceiling. Very hipster-ISH. You have both outside and inside seating options which is great, especially on a nice day like it was today! It is indeed quite loud inside, but I found it fun. Our waiter was very friendly and offered up recommendations (I'm sorry I didn't get his name so I could give him a 'yelp' shout out). Overall: Highly recommend to everyone (especially if you are trying to have a foodie adventure!!)
