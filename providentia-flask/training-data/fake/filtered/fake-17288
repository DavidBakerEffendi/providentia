I was having one of those lazy sundays and was not about to leave my apartment or cook food. I had gotten a take out menu left under my door so i figured i would give it a shot. I decided on the chili burrito after much deliberation because everything looks so good. The food came really quickly and it even came with free chips and salsa! Score!! The burrito was delicious, the chips and and salsa were decent but you cant complain about free food. All in all i highly recommend at least their take out.
