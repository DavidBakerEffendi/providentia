I ordered take-out through the link on their website (chownow). They called me about 20 minutes later telling me that they are out of salmon and I needed to change my order, already paid and accepted, in Chownow. I go the website and there is no way to cancel an item out of an accepted order. I call them, explain the issue, and tell them I would be fine ordering something else, which is actually cheaper than the the out-of-stock dish. Â  When we get to the restaurant we explain the problem again and they tell us that we need to dispute the price difference with Chownow, that "that was not Sabrina's problem." We ask to talk to the manager and he confirms that they cannot do anything: not giving the overpaid money back, not giving an additional item (even if we paid for the difference). A take-out order system in Sabrina's website that lead customers to order out-of-stock items and lose money is surprising, a manager that denies their responsibility and, more importantly, their capacity to restitute the customer is shocking. There goes customer service.
