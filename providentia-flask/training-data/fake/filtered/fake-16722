I'm a carnivore and I love Miss Rachel's cooking.  The fact that all of the options are vegan should NOT dissuade you from trying out her restaurant.  You'll be too busy enjoying your pastry or sandwich to notice that there aren't any animal products. Her lunch club meals are super filling (I sometimes can't finish them because the portions are so generous) and delicious.  My favorites are The Barb and The Wingman and I order them as often as possible.  She delivers them herself and she is super sweet. Recently I had breakfast at her new cafe in South Philly.  It difficult to decide what to order so I ended up taking some pastries home after getting a tofu scramble.  The community table is a little daunting since I'm not a very social person, but the other customers are very friendly and welcoming and I really enjoyed chatting with new people over breakfast.  The food is fantastic and the environment is cozy and friendly.  I will definitely be returning!
