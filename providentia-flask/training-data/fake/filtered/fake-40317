The food here is amazing!  They have tons of variety in food, you can order buffalo wings, fried chicken, or get a typical Spanish dish with rice, beans and pernil or ask for grilled porkchops or chicken francese cooked right in front of you.  Everything is reasonably priced and it is a cash only place so something to keep in mind if you don't have $5 in your pocket. It's a very nice atmosphere where the chef is also the owner so you know the food is cooked with love and passion.  I've definitely eaten here more than once and look forward to the next time I stop in.
