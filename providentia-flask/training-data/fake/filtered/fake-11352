This place can be overwhelming but completely worth the effort and time. The employees provide wonderful service and information. Had the butternut squash ravioli with browned butter - fresh and delicious. I could have easily spent lots of money buying recipe books and cooking utensils. Only negative interaction was with employee at dessert/coffee station. A bit of attitude.
