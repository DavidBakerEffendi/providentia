Love, love, love! Came here with my GNO group and had an exceptional time. Server Bailey was so helpful and recommended a great bottle of wine. We loved our mains: lamb, venison, snapper, and a burger. All cooked perfectly. Plus, Mark Simmons came out to see how we were enjoying our meal. Classy. Â Also, he's easy on the eyes. We ended the meal with a shared pavlova. Delish!
