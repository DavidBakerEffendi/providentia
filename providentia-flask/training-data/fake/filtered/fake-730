Was at Ocean Prime last night for restaurant week and can't say enougn about it.  The food was absolutely delicious.  We began with lobster bisque then crab cakes on a bed of corn,  These were not tiny portions as we all had doggie bags.  Also there specialty drink was a blackberry mule.  Also delicious.  Our server was Mike - very attentive.  Would I come back hell yeah !!!!!!  Oh I forgot the ten layer carrot cake - can't say enough about that either   Pat M
