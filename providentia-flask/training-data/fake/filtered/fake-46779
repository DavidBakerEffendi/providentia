I am honestly overjoyed to have such an excellent restaurant on my block! Delicious and unique menu, friendly staff, plenty of vegetarian options and amazing atmosphere. The only recommendation I would have is that the seats are uncomfortable (although they look really cool) and could use some cushions. I am dumbfounded that another reviewer didn't like the veggie burger! I would say it is one of the best I have ever tasted... and I know veggie burgers.
