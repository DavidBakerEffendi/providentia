I am a big fan of veggie heaven, its simply the best vegan chinese ever hands down!!!! the food and service are always at the highest level, they truly value their customers. I have been going there for the last 4 years and have never been let down, I think they strive to have a good repport with their customers always making you feel like family. I cannot say enough how good the food is, and the coconut/blueberry vegan cake is a must!!!!!!! i love this place and it also has another location in denville that is owned and operated by the same family, Veggie Heaven is a golden gem!!!!!!!!
