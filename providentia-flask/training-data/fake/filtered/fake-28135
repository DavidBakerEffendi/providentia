The first comment I want to make it the hostess was very nice.  The waiter on the other hand seemed like we were putting him out by sitting at his table.  That aside, we found the food to be not great.  For the prices I would expect great or at least good.  The menu is very small so don't expect a huge variety.  I ordered the one steak they had (it was a strip steak $32).  The other people at my table had Mahi and Salmon.  For all three dishes it seemed like they were REALLY trying quite hard to do something unusual with the recipes.  I think they tried too hard because they did a very poor job on all three dishes.  My steak was for some reason cut in to three triangles prior to cooking and then over cooked.  It was dry, tough and lacked flavor.  I did get boiled spinach which was the best thing on the plate.  They gave me a whole tablespoon of the spinach.  Even the presentation was over-done.  The salmon had good flavor but the beans and peanut side was very odd and not very tasty.  The portion was sufficient for the two women eating it but would not have been for me.  The Mahi came in this HUGE bowl/plate, it was a very small piece of fish and came with THREE pieces of bok choy, yes THREE pieces.  Since it was my birthday we had asked the waiter to take a picture of us at the table.  He took the phone/camera and took one look and handed it back and stated it was too dark.  The hostess came by and we asked her and she was more than happy to snap 3-4 pictures for us, they turned out great. My suggestion to BLU would be get back to the basics with the menu.  Learn how to cook a steak, make some nice garlic mashed potatoes and serve more vegetables with each dish.  And of course let your wait staff know that without customers they would have no work. What I don't understand is the restaurant "Next Door" from what I understand shares the same kitchen.  They have a great menu, staff and the food is wonderful.  All that at a lot less cost.  Next Door is a winner.
