Excellent for Japanese-sushi etc. I had a big bowl of the udon soup and a california roll. It was amazing.  We came close to closing time, and they still served us, and told us to take our time, even though we were the only people left in the restaurant.  Excellent service, would recommend! The owners are also a very nice family.
