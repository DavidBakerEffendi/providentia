I gotta tell you, I can not figure out why ANYONE in their right mind would go to Salley's I love tradition, charm, History and all that stuff but this place just sucks. First off I server was either drunk or Mentally Challenge. We ordered drinks and Pizza and got maybe a grunt.. I kid you not...We Waited at least an hour and 45 minutes for our food...and as I looked around EVERYONE was just staring at each other waiting for their food... The place is filthy, the service sucks and the pizza is marginal at best. Say what you want about Pepe's and Modern, but at least you get treated like a human being. AND wtf Â CASH ONLY...GOD I wish I could run my business that way. ..Every order scribbled on a piece of scrap paper..No receipt ....I'd love to see their books. Salleys may have been good years ago and I'm saying 20 30 years ago about the last time the place was cleaned. STAY AWAY...
