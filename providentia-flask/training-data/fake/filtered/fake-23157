Eating here was a complete spur-of-the-moment choice for my family and I. It was our first time eating here. It was a Friday night @ 7pm and it was fairly empty although they do have A LOT of tables. Walking in my first impression was that the decor was really dated.  The manager greeted us in the front from his seated position and seemed bothered that he had to get up. My wife ordered a piña colada and sent it back because it was tasteless and bland. We ordered Mac and cheese for our 2yr old and it looked like Mac and cheese soup when it came out. We had to drain out the watery cheese sauce onto another plate. I ordered the fish & chips. The waitress admitted they were frozen which I appreciated but I stuck with my choice. I wasn't in the mood for a steak. Overall our waitress was nice, the decor was dated, the food was average at best. Admittedly none of us had the steak though so I can't comment on that. Being that it is a steak house that is important to note.
