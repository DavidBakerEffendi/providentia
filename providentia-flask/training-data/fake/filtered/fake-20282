Today we went for dinner at Saffron's Place ... The locale is not fancy at all, don't expect this... It is very simple and non-ostentatious, but very clean and neat ... About the menu, we asked for somosas (with meat and vegetables; we liked the meat one best), Saffron's place soup has been one of the most delicious plates I've tasted in Indian restaurants around Hartford, West Hartford and Bloomfield... For main dish we ordered chicken tikka masala and chicken chana masala it was amazingly delicious!!!, very good taste!!... for dessert we ordered rice pudding, that was also delicious. The price is almost the same as other Indian restaurants... About the quantity, maybe they serve less than other restaurants, but what are you looking for? Quality or quantity... We prefer quality, so for us it was a very good experience... Â ahh, I almost forgot, the chef and the owner are the same person, who is a kind guy, he talked with us and made us feel at home :)
