Okay so I'm positive everyone is going to disagree with me, BUT every time I've been to Pat's I've had horrible food and service. I usually go with the "late night" crowd. I know the slang to order and every time my steak is DRY!!! I make better cheese steaks than they do! I'm sorry but cheese steaks are suppose to be dripping with grease!!!!! Do I have to pay extra to get it?? I mean give be a break AND the people who work there are always so damn rude! Just stop going there, your wasting your money and time. I'm sure at one point they were the best, but now they are just over rated. I'd rather go to Geno's, I've never had a problem getting good greasy cheese steaks or good service.
