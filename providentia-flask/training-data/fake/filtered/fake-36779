I have to disagree with most of these reviews. I liked the space and the staff is great but the food, I'm sorry, the food itself just isn't good. Everything we had sounded great on the menu but never materialized on the plate. The kitchen staff can't even tell the difference between cilantro and parsley. Yikes. One and done for us.
