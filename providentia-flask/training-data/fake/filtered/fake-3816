Last evening, June 18, 2012, I had the pleasure of dining at Mes Reves, one of the finest restaurants I have ever had the pleasure of visiting.  On this occasion, a splendid party to celebrate the upcoming wedding of my nephew and his incredible fiance, we were presented with wonderfully creative dishes that were a feast for the eyes as well as the palate.  I should mention that I am a vegetarian, a very finicky vegetarian, and my needs were not only met, but exceeded by tenfold - not an easy task.  Quang Tran, the chef/owner is brilliant, my taste buds have never been more thrilled.  Rather than explain individual dishes, I feel confident in saying whatever menu items you decide to order will be the right ones.  I would be remiss if I neglected to mention some of the most attentive, personable wait staff I have ever experienced.  I must mention also the decor, which immediately upon entering Mes Reves, welcomed me with open arms.  I do hope you have the opportunity very soon to reward yourself and those you care for with a memorable visit to Mes Reves, you will not be disappointed.
