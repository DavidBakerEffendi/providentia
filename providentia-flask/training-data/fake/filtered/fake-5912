Solid, cheap(er) Italian. Super super tiny, been here twice, both times have been consistently good. Going to the bathroom there is an adventure however (through the kitchen you go ... ) ... not sure how sanitary that is? Regardless, I know I'll be back if my fave Tribeca Italian is not available and I'm craving carbs!
