I have been a regular for quite sometime now which is a rarity. Dough is an impeccable restaurant from "head to toe". The passion of the chef/owner and the staff shows through the food and atmosphere. I highly recommend the margarita, the fresh basil grown in their garden along with the house made mozzarella & tomato sauce speaks for itself, but above all the dough is spectacular. The restaurant also excels in delicious specials, I enjoyed great ceviche and hanger steaks on occasions which were just as impressive, unique and fresh as the pizza. The service is astounding as well, which is very important to me when I go out to eat. Highly recommend this place with your favorite bottle of wine or brew because it is BYO!!
