Visited Burlington this past weekend to visit a friend and had dinner at The Scuffer.  For starters, it was around 8pm, and every other restaurant around was jam packed and couldn't seat our group...so we ended up here as a last resort since the restaurant was empty and they could accommodate us....this should've set off an alert immediately.  Then we get our waitress, who seemed pleasant at first, but must be bi-polar as b the end of our dinner, she was super rude and down-right insulted our entire table.  She definitely made the dining experience there miserable. On top of all of that, she must've been in her 30's and acted like a revengeful high-schooler.  The restaurant left us comment cards with our bill, so we filled them out.  As we were leaving the restaurant, she looks at us, holding our comment cards, and tears them in half. Then she proceeds to give us all the finger. Needless to say, she has much maturing to do, and we will be contacting the owner immediately.  On a side note, food was ok.  Definitely not anything worth putting up with terrible service for. Steak was overdone, mac and cheese dish was bland.  And most importantly, no one there seemed to care about customer service.  Would not recommend if you are in the area.
