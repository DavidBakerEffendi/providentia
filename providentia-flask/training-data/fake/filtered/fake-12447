for a long time i posed (unprompted) and answered the question, 'if i could only have one taste on my tongue for the rest of my life, what would it be?' and i answered it with 'Johnny Walker Blue' scotch. the black currant macarons of Lauduree give it a run for it's money. too very different flavors, obviously, and i don't expect anyone to necessarily share my tastes, not that i care, 'cause i know i have great taste. But my point is, this place is worth a try, the quality and luxury and extravagance and superiority will be self-explanatory. If you can get past the atmosphere, which i will admit might be offputting. Funnily enough, the first time i tried this place, on the recommendation of a friend, there was NO wait, there were like 4 other people in the store, so i didn't have to overcome a lot of negativity about long lines and rude service and clientele. It was awesome. The vanilla was my fave from that first trip. It was only when i went back with that recommending friend, with the lines and everything, that i tried the black currant, and sampled what was one of the two most delightful combination of flavors i have yet to experience. 5 stars, 5 very big, very tasty stars!
