I've lived in the neighborhood for a number of years, and for a while I trekked to Good Karma for my coffee shop needs and walked completely past La Va. But I started going to La Va a few years ago and haven't gone anywhere else for coffee and pastries since. I see some negative reviews of the staff here, but I guess if you're a regular it's different, because I've never had anything but positive experiences with the baristas, and one of them even remembers my regular order if he's on shift when I arrive. The atmosphere is comfortable and laidback, and I love the artwork in rotation on the walls.
