The best!!! Head and shoulders above every other BBQ place in the city. The only problem I've ever had at Baby Blues is everything is so good I never know what I want to order. The servers are always very friendly and get you everything in a timely manner. Great place to go before a hoops game at the palaestra. Hight recommended!!!
