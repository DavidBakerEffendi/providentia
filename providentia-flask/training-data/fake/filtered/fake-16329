I have been here a couple of times, and there is always a wait - the place is not huge.  However, the food is fantastic!  I got breakfast both times (omelet with home fries, the last time) and it was fantastic!  Plus, they have apple cider donuts.  They're not the off-the-farm kind, but they are fresh and delicious.  I love little breakfast places; kinda wish this one was closer to home.
