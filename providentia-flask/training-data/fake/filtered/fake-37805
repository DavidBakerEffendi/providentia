I got ripped off on a Friday night dinner. My fiance and I went for what we thought would be a good italian meal out.  We ordered a salad each, a stuffed ravioli to share and a branzino fish to share.  The ravioloi and the branzino were on their special list.  Neither which had a price listed, but given that everything on the regular menu was about $15, I thought that each would be about $15.  I was very surprised to see that each entree was $30, and since we split them, they added insult to injury and added an additional $4 to each entree.  I guess we should have been informed consumers and asked what the price was before we ordered off their special menu, but we didn't think to ask. The food was ok, but given that the bill came out to be over $100 for 2, it should have been better than just ok.  It should have been fine italian dining.  I don't want sound cheep, but we it was not what we paid for.
