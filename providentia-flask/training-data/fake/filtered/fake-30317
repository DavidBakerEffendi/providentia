I invited my husband to the Peacock Inn for his birthday dinner. We were quite disappointed. First the setting. Our table was pushed up against a glass door that led to the foyer. Although the glass had thin curtains so we could not see the activity there we could hear everything including loud noise from the bar. Then a large party was seated next to us. All wearing sloppy sweaters ripped jeans and dirty sneakers. I thought this was an elegant place but I guess not. Now the food. It was barely OK. We are small eaters but the portions were minute even for our tastes. My salad was passable but nothing special, the potato soup was just pretty good. I ordered the salmon entree and it was served practically raw. I sent it back. The second try was cooked a bit more but it was just OK. ( the Arctic char  I had a few nights before at Big Fish was much tastier).  The portion size was extremely skimpy. Four small bites. That was it. My husband's experience mirrored mine although he ordered different selections. He too sent his minute filet mignon back to be cooked again. The desserts were the highlight. Both excellent. Despite good desserts this dinner was definite not worth the $200.00 plus tip that it cost. If you want to spend an exorbitant amount of money for mediocre food and sit next to a bunch of slobs then this is the place for you.
