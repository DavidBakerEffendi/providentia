I went to Sabor Peru today with high hopes. There aren't many Latin food restaurants in the area and I always wanted to try this place. I don't review restaurants regularly but I had to after going there. I'm Ecuadorean and my husband is Italian. We love food and are familiar with the Peruvian cuisine. The staff was friendly welcoming and helpful, but the food took quite a while to come out considering the fact that we ordered two specials only one a la carte dish and we were the only customers there. While the menu items are very creative and sounded great, the food was very obviously not fresh at all. Which made me wonder again why it took so long. The seafood special was overpriced at $30 which we didn't know until we got the bill. It was the red snapper which my husband described it as dry as a piece of cardboard. My husband's biggest pet peeve is paying for food that is not worth the price. He doesn't mind paying a high price for high quality. For the kind of money we spent here, I would've much rather gotten dressed up and went to my favorite fancy restaurant. Don't waste your money it was a bad experience. We won't be coming back here. My husband's tip...if there aren't any customers there, don't bother going inside! Better off going to McDonald's!
