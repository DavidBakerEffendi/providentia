Although food was not as hot as it should be, it became the only descent thing in our experience there. Sangria, caipirinha and service were terrible. It will be very hard to go back and suggest this place to family and friends. Drinks took so long to arrive at our table, so none of our drinks, 1 orange juice, 1 large red sangria and 1 regular caipirinha tasted how they should taste. The reason why drinks took so long: one loud girl working at the bar got in an argument with others about soccer, as she kept shouting the word 'futibol' a dozen times, and apparently forgot about finishing our drinks. The waiters seemed very lost and failed to explained how rodizio there worked. The meat guy seemed drunk! Really! I was scared to death every time he came with that knife to slice the overcooked picanha. Unfortunately, English doesn't even seem to be the second language spoken there so you have to suck it up, pay the bill to never go back. It's a shame! The info I had about them was that they had a pretty good staff back like a year ago.
