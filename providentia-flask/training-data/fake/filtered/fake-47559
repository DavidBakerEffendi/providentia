Shit service great pizza, bad waiters and attitude, awesome pizza, beeb going several times a year now for 10 years.  U can tip well be nice be kind polite or tell them they r great.  They dont care, boat loads of cash coming in.  No credit cards, no reservations great pizza.  One time there was charcoal on the pie and we told the waiter.  He grabbed it off the pie with his hand and walked away.  Breathtaking freekin pizza. Man they suck, best pizza in the world. Another time i had like 5 big guys there and we ordered 4 pies.  They brought 2, we waited, they started closing, we asked for the rest of our food, they were done cooking, we left hungry.  The manager guy said that they brought the pizzas.  I said no, u didnt.  We didnt eat two large pizzas that we never got. He said he would take them off the final bill which we already had at the table.  Thanks for not charging us for food we didnt get or eat but did order.  Now they moved and the lines r to damn long due to being on tv so much.  Deferras is better now and no one makes that trip and Patsys in East Harlem is up there too.  Thank for being great and the worst all at once.  So god damn good though!!!!!!
