I LOVE THIS PLACE .Service is GOOD and efficient, and there's always a wait for dinner. I usually come on weekdays for the lunch special and don't have to wait. I've had the japchae here,  it's a bit too sweet for my tastes. Loved the food so much, I might become a real connoisseur of this stuff going forward
