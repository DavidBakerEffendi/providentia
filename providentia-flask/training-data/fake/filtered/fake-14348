i will never get another hoagie from this place ever again. i will travel the extra 15 minutes and go to hogback. i called in a sandwhich and a small potato salad for my son the other day, i went to go pick it up and the order was not ready which was fine so i waited the guy behind the counter picked up the receipt and decided to call me out in front of the whole store filled with customers. and i quote " this order wasn't even worth me picking up they phone" and i quote" you see how quickly we got on that one" how ignorant and rude can you be? i said nothing because i knew my son was at home and hungry so i just sat and waited paid and graciously left. but i will tell you one thing i will never ever step foot into this place again if that is how they treat customers. i have never experienced service like that before, but will never do it again!
