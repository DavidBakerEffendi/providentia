Horrible service. I stood around an no one even talked to me. I finally flagged down a waiter to ask "is this self seating" and all he said was "wait" ... 15 minutes later that was the ONLY word any one in the restaurant had said to me. I was completely ignored. 3 parties came in after me and walked right past me They were greeted and seated. All three of them, seated before me. Not just seated before me, but before anyone had even attempted to talk to me! 20 minute walk from my Hotel to Friedman's. It was pouring rain and I got soaked. And a sad, hungry, cold, wet, 20 minute walk back to my Hotel. After being treated like garbage. And no time left to find another good Gluten Free place to eat nearby. I spent the rest of my day hungry and miserable. I will never come back and I will never bring friends and I will be certain to talk a -LOT- about my experience. I cannot comment on the food here as I was never greeted or seated or served. I come in from San Diego, California and I was excited to find Freidman's near my Hotel because Freidman's Lunch is so incredible for Gluten Free food. Unfortunately I will not be able to say anything good about Freidman's and honestly the whole experience puts me completely off anything with the Freidman's name on it. /sarcasm Thanks for the wonderful experience. /sarcasm
