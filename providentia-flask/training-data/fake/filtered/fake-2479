This cafe is a gem. Nestled in the historic chace mill of Burlington right on the beautiful Winooski river, the location is just the beginning. When you walk in, it feels inviting, warm, funky, and sweet; it feels like home. There's a colorful mural covering an entire wall depicting a classic VT Fall scene and the rest of the walls host quirky but tasteful details (like a chair hanging from one wall with Buddha sitting on it!). Here's the best part though: the food! Menu is extensive (they just updated the menu a couple weeks ago and they have nailed it) and whether you're vegan, gluten-free, or neither, it's delicious. My go-to items are the grilled kale salad, sweet potato quesadilla, spring rolls, and breakfast sandwich (not to mention the awesome baked goods...ALL of which are vegan/gf but you'd never guess because they're just straight up delectable). I go a couple times a week and always feel welcome by the wonderful and friendly staff. I'm so grateful for Pingala; the food, the atmosphere, and the ripple effect of the plant-based food on my own health, the animals, and the Earth.
