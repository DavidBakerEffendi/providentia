When you are looking for a filipino restaurant in NYC, Grill 21 is a great place to go. It also is a nice place to spend time with family and friends. They're food is the most amazing filipino food that I've ever tasted. almost every one of my birthdays we go to Grill 21. I would reccomend Grill 21 as a restauant that you want to go to.
