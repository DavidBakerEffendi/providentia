Food was OK. Bought Groupon for $30 and was informed that it can be used for lunch buffet which is priced $11.99 . So for 2 of us its $24 and they told us that we can order something else to use other $6. After eating lunch buffet we were told that 2 orders of naan come with the buffet and third is charged for extra $3. He said that this is the standard in every restaurant where they charge for extra naan. Please make sure to check their policies before going to this restaurant.
