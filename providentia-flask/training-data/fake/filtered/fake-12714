On a recent trip to New York, my daughter and I had the pleasure of dining at Lupa.  Our experience there was most enjoyable ; the staff was warm and welcoming, but not overbearingly so.  Our dinner service was excellent.  The courses arrived with perfect timing and any extra request was attended to immediately despite a full dining room.  Their suggested wine pairings proved to be superb.  Overall, the food was good.  We'll look forward to a return visit on our next trip to New York.
