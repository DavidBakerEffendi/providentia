Be careful - Â I've been overcharged on three different occasions. The latest was this morning: I went in and got a breakfast sandwich. Cost $3.95. The woman at the counter asked me if I wanted a coffee because "the sandwich comes with a small coffee." I said sure, she then charged me $4.70. I was too tired to get "into it" with her. Last time I get "forked" at the Fork & Spoon.
