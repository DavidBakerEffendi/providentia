I decided to impress my new mother and father in-law by taking them to a nice dinner. I didn't have to think too much before I knew Nai Tapas would be the PERFECT place. I was DEFINITELY right! From the minute we walked in we were greeted and sat right away. We had a table right in front of the live Flamenco band which was a plus. We ordered a variety of tapas and each one out did the next. The tropical sangria was also very good and the entertainment was amazing! I know I scored some extra points with the in-laws by bringing them to Nai Tapas!
