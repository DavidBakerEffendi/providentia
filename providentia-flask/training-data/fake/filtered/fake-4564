Green Eggs Cafe has always been one of my favorite breakfast spots on this Earth!  Today it has became the holy grail for lunch.  My husband and mother-in-law went there for lunch today and what he got was so fantastic that my mother-in-law bought it for me as well and they drove all the way to where I work to deliver it to me.  What they brought to me was  the The Lambwich!! It doesn't sound like much, but it is a life changing work of art.  This sandwich includes: braised lamb shouulder, vadouvan raisin jam, harissa aioli, arugula, shredded carrots, red onions, served on toasted ciabatta bread.  My mind has been blown, from this day on I will never be fully satisfied with any other sandwich, not to mention their jalapeno bacon mac and cheese was utterly amazing.  This perfect lunch is pretty much as good as it gets!
