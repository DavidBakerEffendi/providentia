The best restaurant we've been to this year. Best tapas we've ever had. Each dish an amazing burst of flavor; not a single disappointment. Basically, AS GOOD AS IT GETS!! Note: I've never previously troubled myself to write a Yelp review of anything. This is a place not to be missed! They even had Ommegang ale ON TAP!! Servers are extremely earnest, caring and informative. Ours had been with the restaurant from almost the beginning - an incredibly good sign. We were in from LI, NY and when we get back to Philly, this is the first restaurant I'm going to. 6 stars on a 5 star rating system.
