In a city known for its quaint pubs, this one is by far our favorite. We stumbled on this gem during a recent anniversary trip to the city, nestled in a quiet neighborhood. Being from the midwest, we expect subpar service at most NYC establishments but we were VERY pleased with the quality of service we received from Abby our server. There is a great selection of beer and although we did not have time to experience the food, we spent an hour talking to the owner Darren about business and family. It's great to know there are still places in this city that want to get to know you and The Malt House is one of those places that make you feel like home. We can't wait until next year to go back.
