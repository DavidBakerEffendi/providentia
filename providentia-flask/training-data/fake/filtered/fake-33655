this place is HORRRRIBLLEEE! Â i just went there for the first time last night. its honestly crowded for no reason. the staff is SO RUDE and nasty. from the moment we walked in they treated us like crap. I'm guessing because its a large party and they are getting their tip added regardless of how they treat us. there were fruit flies in our drinks, the food sucked i couldnt even eat it. the managers and waiters are so nasty and mean to their customers. in the end, like i said we had a large party, and wanted to split up the bill and pay with a couple credit cards (we do this everywhere we go and its never a problem), the manager called the cops on us and told them we refused to pay. which NEVER happened, we just didnt all have cash to pay, we wanted to use cards. it was a horrible experience overall. I will never come here again, and make sure i tell everyone to never go here. its disgusting.
