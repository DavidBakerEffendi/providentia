The low reviews are very surprising.. If you're looking for a variety of pizza, this is the place to go.  The pies are replaced hourly and very fresh.  The white pizza was super good, not too much garlic but enough to taste yummy.  The garlic knots are delicious.  Not to mention, the young gentlemen working were very personable and friendly as soon as I entered the pizzeria.  I recommend going, and I'll be back again to try something new!-K.S.
