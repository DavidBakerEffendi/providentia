My friend and I ate here for restaurant week and really felt like we were being treated like second class citizens because we ate the restaurant week menu. The beef and salmon were noticeably lower quality than what I would expect from this type of restaurant. Based on this experience, I would never recommend or return. There are plenty of other similar restaurants in Manhattan that are better.
