Food is ok.  I only go here since its a close walk from e.garden apts where I live.  Owner can be grumpy and irratable sometimes especially the older guy.  He even was a prick to me when I did'nt have money in my wallet and had to use my debit card.  He said $10 minimum and said have another slice and coke.  food is'nt bad but the forli owners are crooks.
