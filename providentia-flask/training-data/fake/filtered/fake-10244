I went here Friday night with my husband and my sister.  We had such a good time!  The waitress, Janet was extremely friendly. She let us know it was going to be a few minutes and she kept coming over to update us on how much longer the wait would be. The service was wonderful, friendly and knowledgeable of the menu items. We had the Fried Calamari appetizer which was very tasty. I ordered the Tagliatelle ai Gamberi (Shrimp, fresh tomato & arugula in a light tomato sauce$11.95). It was excellent. The pasta was cooked perfectly and they did not skimp on the shrimp at all! My husband ordered from the specials, he had the Smoked Salmon and Asparagus in a light cream sauce over Farfalle. He loved it and I had a taste of it and I must admit I was a bit jealous! My sister ordered the Penne Alla Fiorentina (Spinach cream sauce finished with fresh ricotta cheese $8.95).  It's such a simple dish but don't let that fool you, it was excellent. For dessert we had the Chocolate Mousse and the Tiramisu'. Wonderful choices. We will definitely be back. You can't beat the prices or the service. Plus, the food is AUTHENTIC and that's hard to find these days!!
