Would I say anything bad about Fin? Thats what my son was asking me last night on our way home. My answer was "great choice of restaurant". But this morning I was thinking about the all evening and I have to say, It was more than great, from the welcoming to the thank you for coming at Fin. What really and I say really was impressive was the fact that a middle age man with a great personality, confidant in any step he made and with the communication he had with the servers in the dining room, it was looking on dance rehearsal or better say a theater play. one look, one hand signal and voila' done. The service was great, knowledgeable and had a flare of fine/casual confidences. Â The food was just an A plus, the guy in the kitchen has a work cut for himself, dishes coming hot on time and deliciously composited. I am going back, I waited long time just because our first 2 times didn't impressed any of us. ( over 6 months ago )
