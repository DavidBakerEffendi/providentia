What a great little find.  I had the penne with vodka sauce.  Simple dish, but done right.  Not really that much sitting room, but if you don't mind getting a little close to a stranger and maybe sharing the parmesian shaker, its fine. The skinny:  The food gets a decent 3.5 - 4 stars.  Not bad at all, not astounding either.  Overall though, given the great price and the rapid speed at which the food came out, Pepe Rosso gets 5 stars.
