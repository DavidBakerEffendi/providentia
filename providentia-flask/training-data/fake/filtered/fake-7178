Probably the best Ramen I've had in New York, loved the Ippudo Special Ramen. It's amazing that their boiled egg is always perfectly salty and liquidy-oozy in the center. The broth was also delicious on it's own. $13 for Ramen may be a tad steep but considering the location and comparable food you can get in NY with $13, this place is definitely hands down worth the price. The only reason why I am not rating this place 5 stars is because of the wait. The hostess indicated about half an hour for two but it really turned out to be Â an hour.
