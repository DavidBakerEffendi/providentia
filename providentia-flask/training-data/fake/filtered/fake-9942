I'm pretty picky about my pizza and overall I'm a fan of Reno's. If you like thin crust, which I do, they make a decent pie. They also have a good variety of specialty pizzas. My husband enjoys their wings as well. We usually get take out, so I can't really speak for the dine-in experience, but we have no complaints about the service we've received.
