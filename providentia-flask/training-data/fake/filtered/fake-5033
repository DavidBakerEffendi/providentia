BCD Tofu House can be a popular joint during dinner time, so be prepared to wait a few minutes if you have a larger party because they won't take reservations. It never takes very long to get seated, so this shouldn't be a problem. As the name of the establishment may suggest, they specialize in tofu soups, so their menu might seem limited in comparison to other Korean restaurants. I've enjoyed several different entrees and tofu soups, so their entire menu is solid. Be careful if you're considering ordering your tofu soup at the "dangerous" spiciness level because it WILL hurt and such delicious food shouldn't go to waste. Excellent food and service
