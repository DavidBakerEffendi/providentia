Upon walking in, there was only one other couple in the place. You'd think the food would come quick, but NO!. After my gf and I ordered tacos and fajitas, there were 2 more groups of people that came in and they got their food before us. We figured they wanted to bring out everything at the same time so we patiently waited. But when we got our food, we realized that the extra time we waited wasn't for our benefit but it was the time they took to overcook our chicken and make it dry and barely edible. Plus, the gravy that came with the black beans was too thick. Pros - Well there are some but not enough to make me go back here. The presentation was good. Everything on the plate looked very nice but like I mentioned above not everything tasted that great. The avocado was great! but lets thank mother nature for that. The place was clean and the service was decent. Their bathroom was also clean. Service - The waitress we had seemed to have disappeared when we were close to done eating. But we didn't miss her one bit! The other girl was more than happy to take care of the rest of our requests.
