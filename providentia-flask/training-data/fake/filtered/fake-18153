I went to Kelly's on Memorial Day to have a nice lunch as this with my friends and sat outside on the patio. For a holiday it was surprisingly very busy. The waitresses were very friendly and extremely attentive. My meal was absolutely to die for, all our food came out perfect and promptly. The patio was comfortable and I felt like I was in central park. A perfect day and an awesome meal. It looks like we found our new hotspot. I'm recommending this restaurant to anyone who wants a nice meal and great service.
