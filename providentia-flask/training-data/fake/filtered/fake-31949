My favorite brick oven pizza in NYC.  My fiancee and I go there whenever we're in the mood for pizza.  We LOVE the portobello pizza with caramelized onions. Absolutely delicious.  I wish the tables were a drop bigger, but it still works for a local neighborhood place.  Really great spot during the summer when the outdoor picnic tables are out.  I like their salads too.
