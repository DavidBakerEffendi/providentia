My sister recommended Pylos to me years ago and I fell in love. The decor is so beautiful, the staff is so helpful, and the food is truly authentic greek cuisine. The meatballs are outstanding. And the octopus was wonderfully seasoned and cooked. Of course, the pita/dip is a must when dining here. Perfect for a date, dinner with the inlaws, girls night out...great for any occasion really...
