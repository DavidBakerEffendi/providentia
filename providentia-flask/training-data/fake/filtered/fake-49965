I have a love affair with their relish. Went here all the time as a kid when visiting family. The rippers are great, but the real gem is the relish- Sweet, tangy, and savory. Just recently had a friend visit, and he over-nighted me 2 jars of that delicious crack. At this very moment, I'm sitting in California eating it with a spoon.
