Village Whiskey is the only place that can make me starve myself all day just so that I can get there before 5pm in hopes of sitting down right away. The burgers kill Rouge, don't care what anyone says. I love that they've stayed so small rather than expanding. The place has character. The wait also isn't bad if you sit and watch the bartenders (which are actually amazing at what they do.) It's like watching a doctor put together a concoction to make everything around you better. VW I love ya.
