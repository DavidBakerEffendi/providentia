good - not as mind-blowing as i had hoped but still good.  not glamorous by any means - seemed clean enough. decent service. average prices. the egg-drop was good, the fried dumplings were huge and good, fried rice - good, seafood (happy family  or triple delight or something). it was decent - but i wouldn't make it a point to go there again (i dont live in philly)
