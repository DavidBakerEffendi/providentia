Fantastic newly expanded menu this year with English descriptions of the meals. Upon a recent visit, we noted that the retaurant has been redecorated, a bit too contemporary for me, I was sad to see the beautiful hand-painted murals gone!   My husband and I have gone here for years and have always experienced fast service and friendly wait staff (it probably helps that my husband speaks to them in Spanish, I do not).  The food choices are vast and very delicious and the prices are reasonable.
