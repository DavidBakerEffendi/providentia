Seriously...where did you come from Rubirosa? I am a pizza girl through and through. Have traveled all through the states and Italy in search for the best pizza and this is a serious contender. No, it's not traditional Neapolitan pizza and is thin crust but the combination of the cornmeal bottom and fresh toppings was super surprising and left me wanting more.
