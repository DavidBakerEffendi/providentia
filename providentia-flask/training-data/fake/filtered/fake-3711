While joining two friends for lunch today, I was very disappointed in my lunch at Holsten's. I have patronized this establishment for over 50 years, and today was the worst. After being seated, we ordered our selections. I chose a very simple hamburger; which certainly did not taste like it should...a very thin patty with two tiny pickle slices. I also ordered an iced tea, which was served with a lemon wedge. I did not ask for the black spots on the lemon however! Not wanting to make my friends feel uneasy, I chose not to mention it to the server. In hindsight, I should have. It is unfortunate that this negative experience will no longer find me going to, or recommending Holsten's.
