I had a great meal at The Marshal. It's a cute, cozy, exposed brick type of place, but not was not cramped like smaller restaurants can sometimes be. The candlelit table allowed for intimate conversations with my friend. The food is farm-to-table American fare prepared in a wood oven that gives everything a juicy, smoky flavor that we really enjoyed. The waitress was really attentive and we didn't have to wait or want for anything. The best part was getting the bill, realizing that it was far less than we anticipated! All this makes it a pretty unique for Hell's Kitchen. We'll be back!
