This place is 2 blocks from my house and i was pretty excited when it opened because i lived in Texas for 20 years and i LOVE BBQ! I don't know where most of you writing good reviews are from, but this place is no good man. DavidM from 14 days ago is probably being paid by Morgans or just hasn't had good bbq. If you're gonna charge $20-22/lb for brisket, I expect a certain quality. If they charged $12/lb that would be about right. The brisket wasn't even as good as Rudy's(Texans get it) and the turkey was juicy but rubbery and didn't taste good. Sausage was dry and horribly average. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I will not go back. The staff is friendly, that's the only positive I can think of. The best bbq I've had in Brooklyn, without a doubt, is Fetta Sau. Expensive as s@#t but kinda worth it. Brisket is great, sides are pretty awesome
