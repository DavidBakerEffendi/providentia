I don't go to the Thai Awesome restaurant, but to the cart at Ingals Rink - it's around from about 11:30 to 3:30 on weekdays.   The garlic chicken is simply the best.  Juicy, tender, lightly spiced, charred in all the right places, and comes with whatever sauce you like (peanut, sweet/sour, spicy).  My order is Double chicken with Drunken noodle and white rice ($6 for 3 items, white rice doesn't count) and boy is it filling.  Easily makes two meals if I can control myself at lunchtime.  Also, the man who runs the cart has been there for years, and always serves with a great smiling enthusiasm.  Recently, he has even enlisted a bit of help so the slow moving line is an issue no longer.
