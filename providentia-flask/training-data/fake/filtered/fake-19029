To start off we got lost trying to get there and when we finally got there we had to wait. The bathrooms were disgusting and people who came in after us got waited on before us. The fries were wimpy, overpriced and shoestring. The burgers were good but I was so hungry I would have amen anything. I was VERY disappointed and would not go back again!
