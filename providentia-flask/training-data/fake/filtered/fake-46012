This place is great for all scenarios. Went there for dinner with friends and thoroughly enjoyed the Skate. The drinks are good and they even have brunch which is also amazing. Love the Lobster scrambled eggs & ricotta stacks. Place had great energy and staff was super friendly. I will Def be a regular here. Ask about the PBLT sliders & Spicy shrimp FB.
