Double Windsor? More like Clip on Tie. Unprofessional, Hostile, and Overpriced. Spent two evenings there and both ended with yucky feelings. Despite the Manhattan-grade pricing scheme on tap beers. Both nights started ok until the staff got wasted and weird. Night 1 : Seemingly generous owner/manager ingratiated everyone with free shots and then acted like a pervy uncle by tickling and groping his cute young employee. Result: Left Night 2: Just recently my pal was escorted out by a young gentleman barkeep made irrationally furious by his playful suggestion of a menu redesign. (the award winner designer and artist found it hard to read) Result: Left - too bad we didn't have a tab open. HA!
