We live in the neighborhood and we don't go out to eat a lot (because my boyfriend thinks I'm such a great cook!), but when we do, we go to Mamma's. The ambiance can't be beat -- cozy, friendly, very much like the little trattorias I loved so much in Italy. In other words, not fancy, but very welcoming. In fact, Gino, the owner, is almost always there and he makes a point of coming around and talking with everyone sometime during your meal. He is genuinely interested in how you like your food and wants to ensure that you enjoy your dinner. The food is great -- not fancy, not "over-produced," just good simple southern Italian cooking (like Mama made -- no pun intended)! We especially love the shrimp mumola (appetizer) -- I would serve it on pasta, if I could! Also, the chicken parm, the lasagna, the baked ziti, the veal & peppers, the meatballs... well, just about everything, really. And the house salad with the house balsamic dressing is the perfect counterpoint. In addition, they bake their own bread and serve it up with an olive oil, fresh basil and fresh garlic dip that is habit-forming. We like Mamma's so much that we decided to have our wedding reception there at the end of next month. Nothing fancy... just good friends and good food, and lots of love. Just like Mamma Rosa's. :o)
