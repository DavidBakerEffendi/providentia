I love to cook, but I love more finding a place that I adore the food. Nicola's atmosphere, service and decor are all top notch.  However none of that really matters.  Their food is on an entirely different level! Everything is prepared in such detail. The bread is served crusty and warm and a big load is given to each table.  You are also given plenty of fresh individually wrapped butter. They put two plates of bruschetta and an eggplant tapanade that are absolutely delicious. For my entree I ordered the Rigatoni and sausage with white cannelini beans and red chilis.  I love spicy food, when I ordered this I had no idea of whether it would be in a red sauce or a white one. I was so pleasantly surprised when it came in a red sauce.  I had no idea of what was to follow.  The sauce was thin and not heavy, it packed a punch like I have never seen.  Immediately I could taste the sausage, I could taste the chilis, also tasted a hint of hot sauce, I also tasted the most fabulous aroma of a burgundy wine.  All of these flavors came together at once and could not have been any more complimentary to one another.  This meal was so fabulous it was over the top good.  The rigatonis were cooked to perfection! This meal will be remembered for a long time.  I don't think this can be topped anytime soon. Thank you Nicola!!!
