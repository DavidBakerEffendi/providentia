Dining yesterday at the restaurant with another family member was an excellent experience. The test of the restaurant for me were the basics of the Italian culinary repertoire: pasta fagioli, a house dinner salad, as well as chicken parmigiana with spaghetti. Everything was prepared as it should be with great taste, and with balanced portions. Usually, I have found that most restaurants somehow compose a spaghetti side dish that seems to come off as an afterthought. However, the sauce, and pasta here showed that the business works at all aspects of dinner to please. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a nice small place to dine in with good friends, and family, as well as an original cooking.
