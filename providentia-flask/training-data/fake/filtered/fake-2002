AWFUL experience - STAY AWAY. To keep it short, the food was decent but the service was the worst I had experienced in some time. After having been sat, we had to ask the bartenders 3 different times if we had a server as we wanted to place an order. I know, very ridiculous that we would want to order food and drinks at a restaurant. Despite the servers delay, we were very polite and placed our order. Throughout the experience, she continued to be rude as if we had ruined her night and failed to provide any service whatsoever. Also, let it be known that the place was only about 1/3 full. Lastly, when it was time to pay, my girlfriend had to chase the waitress down and here's the kicker - this waitress was talking S*** about us to the other servers when my girlfriend was standing right behind her. Flat out - stay away unless you like awful service, rude and pretentious waitstaff, and being made fun of.
