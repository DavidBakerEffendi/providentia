Had one of the best nights in here! Great music playing on the ipod - lots of cool 80's and 90's - blondie, new order, the cure, echo & the bunnymen, amy winehouse ( yeah 2008 - I know I know!  ) - bartenders are cool, genuine Irish and UK, all get along here in this cozy, hot ( maybe a little too hot - get that ac sorted out pleeeez ) little east village den. Drinks are a decent price compared to elsewhere in the neighborhood - $3 pbr, $5 vodka, $6 draft beer - gotta get there before too late they won't serve after 3.45 am !  Friendly staff, nice to look at too .... a treat for the guys and the ladieees - if you like a pretty face with  a real pretty dublin accent serving you your whisky then come on in here on the weekends - for the chicks they've got a Bloke with a sexy UK accent just to melt your butter - All bases covered. Did I  mention the cheap drinks, the great music ? Top marks for the Scratcher !!!
