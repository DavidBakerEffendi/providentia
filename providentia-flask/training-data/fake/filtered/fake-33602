Being Nepali n from NYC this joint disappoints me everytime I go there., Food is just horrible, I would never ever wanna try food here. I am not  criticizing, place is fairly clean n happening, but it amazes me why owner spend so much money on decor n cant get a decent chef? If the band was not there I would never put my feet in there. The Phiroj and the band is the only thing that's holding this place down and everyone knows that. I will guaranty, without band this place is a close down. I see everyone here rambling about services, well, very simple, if you are here expecting fine dinning services, you at the wrong zone. Queens doesn't have fine dinning e.t. in her vocabulary (well, some). Servers are very hard working  and very polite. It's obvious, esp on weekends, it gets crazy for them to handle, when table of 20 are demanding 50 things at a time. I give props to them, I always see them smiling. As night falls deeper, usually people start to get drunk n be rowdy. So imagine trying to work there. But I hope to return soon n just chill n listen to music n drink rather than FOOD
