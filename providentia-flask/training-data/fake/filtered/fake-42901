My husband and I just happened to be in the neighborhood looking for a different place to eat, but when we came upon this one, we were too tired to walk anymore.  Boy am I glad we stayed here.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere was great.  When talking to the waiter, he said that they just were taken over by new owners and was totally renovated.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone.
