If I could give this place 0 stars I would have because it is pathetic to have pizza this gross at an establishment so well known. I hope more people start to realize how disgusting this place is so that they don't waste there time. I was told this would be the best pizza I've ever had in my life by my girlfriend but a recent trip to Modern Apizza today has shown me what I have NOT been missing! The pizza tasted like something I would get at Sbarro in the mall! There was no line and we sat immediately but the service was terrible the waitress took 15 minutes to realize we were done eating and needed to pay our tab...
