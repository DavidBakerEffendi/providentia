In NYC for the holiday weekend.  Food, Drinks, and fun!! Visited Despana on a friends recommendation. Fantastic.  I felt like I was in Spain again.Very authentic. Serrano ham was delish and the picante bocadilla was perfectly spiced and had a great presentation. The hot chocolate was good, but not amazing. Looking forward to more food adventures in the big apple!
