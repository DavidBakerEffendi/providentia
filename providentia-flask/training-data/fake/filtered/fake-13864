The food is good, but the wait time to get the food is extremely long given the food they are making (i.e. a grilled cheese).  Recently went and ordered my meal along with a drink, 15 mins later I get the meal but no drink.  I ask for said drink, employee asks the other employee at register to re-print my receipt to show me that I did not order/pay for a drink and then slammed the window in my face.  So lets recap that, I DID order a drink, your own employee messed my order up, then you accuse me of trying to scam you out of a free drink and then slam window in customer's face.  Pretty much the worst customer service I have experienced in NYC in awhile.  Will not go back.
