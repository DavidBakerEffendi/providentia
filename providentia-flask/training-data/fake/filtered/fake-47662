Oh Grimaldi's...so close to pizza perfection, for wood/coal oven pizza! Yummmmm The crust is cooked yet not charred, it has a good bite and great taste. The sauce is well seasoned but not overpowering. The cheese is very fresh. It is worth the long wait outside, but if you want a little tip - just call ahead and get it to go. Thanks Grimaldi's you do not disappoint!
