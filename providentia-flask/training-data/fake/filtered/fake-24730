I followed the reviews and thought this place was going to be great and the food was terrible and the place was completely dirty.  I think i saw a cockroach in the bathroom as well and the host ( a chubby mid 40's guy) was also trying to start a fight with this asian guy in the restaurant because hw anted to borrow a chair for his friends. What a loser. If this is the owner, he need to learn some customer service.  Terrible place and terrible customer service.  Dont go here !!!!
