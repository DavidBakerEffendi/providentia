DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS. i've tried ordering from this place three times. the owner, (who answers the phone for deliveries) clearly does not care about service. the first day the food took an hour and a half to get 2 blocks away. the second day the wrong food was sent altogether. when i placed the orders each time,  he's too busy talking to whomever else in the background and doesn't even seem to be listening to the order being placed.  i often had to repeat myself when he didn't hear me. When i called back to address the fact that the food was running really late, he said "What do you want me to do about it?"  i politely asked for a discount.  his response was "I'M JEWISH, I DON'T GIVE DISCOUNTS" and laughed...   after the 2nd failed order, I called him and let him know that 1) the order was mess-up and 2) that it would be appreciated if he LISTENED to me when i originally placed the order, as he was clearly talking to other people at the same time. His response; "Well, SOMETIMES PEOPLE DONT NEED TO WORK TOGETHER, i don't need you to tell me how to run my business" I was simply (and respectfully) telling him that it has been 3 days in a row that his business was not running efficiently, and what might help is to listen carefully to the order being placed.   this man is clearly not interested in business.  it may be a 'cute little sandwich shop', but cuteness does not make a good business.
