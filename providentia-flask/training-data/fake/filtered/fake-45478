Dear Hummus Grill, Thank you for the long wait tonight for the food I never got. I waited for over 40 minutes for just 2 platters and as I waited I watched about 2 dozen people behind me and ahead of me receive there orders as I was just stared at by your employees. Thank you for stealing 40 minutes of life that i will never get back, I hadn't been to your restaurant in 2 years because of the bad service and I'll probably never go back again. And Ill make sure to remove it from the list of restaurants my unit at HUP gets catering from. Have a good night,
