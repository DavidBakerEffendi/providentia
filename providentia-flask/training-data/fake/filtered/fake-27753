The menue is tricked up with things like testicales (UGH) Sheep head, chicken hearts and more.   I did have the veal tail wghich was very tasty almost like a mini osso bucco. Nice try and i give credit for that but... The place is small and set up very tight making it tought to relax and enjoy.  With a party of 5 we were sat by the door.  People came and went without a reservation despite the fact 4 tables were open. The owner waited for my dinner to arrive and told me i had to move somehow. Telling me the door cannot be blocked AFTER they moved a table of two next to me.  I offered him to take my food away and allow me to become his doorman The ownner said  FINE There comes a point when you want out of a place.  We ordered the check and left in a hurry NEVER to go back
