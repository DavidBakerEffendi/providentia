This place was really good. When I went it wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be. Thank goodness. The food was great. The people were nice. Only thing was that it seemed like all the noise kind of echoed so it was pretty loud. If you don't mind the noise, it's a really nice place. Good food that isn't expensive = good deal.
