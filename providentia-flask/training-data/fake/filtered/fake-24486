Came here a month ago for Chinese New Year with my sister's friends who were raving about the little pork dumplings aka shao long boa so I tagged along to see if they really were the best. It was relatively empty considering it was still early (5-6 pm) and the dinner rush didn't start yet. The waiter gave us about 5 mins to look over the extensive menu and kept rushing us to order by pacing back and fourth. It took a while for the food to come and when it did, they got one of my orders WRONG and instead of taking it back, they said "this is what you ordered". OK FINE I didn't make a big deal out of it....until they slapped the check on our table BEFORE we finished eating. Then the waiter came back 5 mins later and asked us if we were ready to pay. I didn't appreciate being rushed out of there before I finished my meal...it wasn't even busy and no one was waiting on a table so I don't know why the waiter rushed us out of there. I noticed that they let the caucasian tourists extend their stay and were just rude to asian customers. That being said, they're lucky I even left a tip...$4 t be exact (an unlucky number and gesture according to the Chinese) especially on Chinese New Year. NEVER going back
