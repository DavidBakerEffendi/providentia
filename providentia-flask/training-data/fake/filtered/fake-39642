I went here a couple months ago and I could never remember the name. All I remember is getting out of the car, glancing at the restaurant's name, and running into a haven from terrible Thai restaurants around my campus that were supposedly "really good." They were terrible and this was a very, very, VERY satisfying and refreshing choice! When I think of a good Thai restaurant, I think Sripraphai and I crave it so much even though I'm far far away now. The flavors weren't fake and muted like how many Thai restaurants are and I pretty much ate everything straight through. I ordered the Massaman curry (which is my go-to in Thai if I'm not sure what's good) and I MUST say that it was simply delish. I had a bite of the pad thai, and it had a nice texture and lightness of flavor with a kick of spicy. I also had other dishes but I can't say I remember except that they tasted WONDERFUL. Although I don't know what truly authentic Thai food is, I could tell that this place was "for real" Thai. The ingredients were fresh, and the food seemed like something my imaginary Thai mother would make. :)
