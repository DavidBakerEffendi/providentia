We had a lunch at Petite Crevette that was superb. we were the only ones in this tiny restaurant and had the full attention of the owner, a gregarious and delightful man, clearly well-schooled and highly talented in seafood preparation. We had fresh mozzarilla and heirloom tomatoes for an appetizer- flavorful and perfectly balanced; fried oysters that were fresh, tasty and crispy, and a simple paillard of salmon, perfectly cooked in a way that let the fresh flavorful taste of the salmon really shine. French fries and salad were great too. If this lunch is any indication, we can't wait to return for dinner. This is simple seafood, shining in its own quality and at its best.
