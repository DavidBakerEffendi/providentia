This place has it all from the friendly people to the delicious foods. Everything from there baked good to their spinach pie is magical. I never get tired of eating from here even though its a bit pricey, it is definitely worth the money and trip. You can't go wrong with any of the food item choices here because they are all just that good. I tried about everything on the menu and it just completely amazed me. This place is definitely the spot!
