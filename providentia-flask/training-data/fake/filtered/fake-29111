Kitchen; a place to gather and feast on delicious meals. The Kitchen; hands down one of my favorite places for lunch. I work in the Frog Hollow community and have gone to The Kitchen several times. Each time I have absolutely loved my lunch. We don't need to mention that one time I went there around 2 p.m. for the sole purpose of getting an afternoon treat of iced coffee and a salted chocolate chip cookie. That will stay between us. But, if you stop in might I recommend the SALTED CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIE?! I might also recommend "The Grown Up" sandwich and the "Mexican Mama" salad. The Grown up is absolutely ridiculous, in the best way possible. The Grown Up: Smoked Gouda, Braised Kale, Apple Chutney and carmelized onions, nestled between two slices of freshly baked grain bread. What are you still reading this for? You should be going to The Kitchen. The Mexican Mama, although perhaps less decadent, is equally delicious. A salad with vegetarian protein and delicious tortilla strips? I'll take it. Typically lunch there costs me between $10 and $13. Psst, I think it's all the iced coffee and salted chocolate chip cookies. Did I mention the cookies? In my opinion, though, I will gladly pay more for lunch knowing that the ingredients are fresh, that the community benefits when people eat there and that people are being given job-training and opportunity. If you haven't been to The Kitchen, definitely stop in. Get there early because it's a small place and gets crowded; a pretty good sign that the food is good.
