After moving away from the Philadelphia area five years ago, I've always had a craving for one of the best pho, in my opinion, outside of Vietnam.  I often comeback and visit my best friend, who lives in Fishtown, but was never able to stop on by to grab a quick delicious meal.  This past September I had a couple of hours to spare and the first thought on my mind was "I'm gonna have me some PHO GA."  However, the experience was not what I had remembered it to be.  The broth, although still delicious, was not WOW.  I remember craving for this pho, but now it was just another pho.  I don't know if my taste buds have changed over these past five years, or the flavor of the soup that's changed, or it was just one of those days that the kitchen staff was not on their "A" game.  Whatever the reason was, i still had a good, not great meal.  The food alone would merit a four star rating.  I only gave it one star because I would never go there again.  I know you shouldn't expect great service from places like this, but the service I received that day was beyond terrible.  Not only was the wait staff rude, they were having a little argument and "spilled" on to me, their customer.  When the waitress brought out my pho she could have just thrown it on the table.  The soup spilled out, dirtied my shirt, and there was no apology from her.  The young man in the knit hat (don't know why he's wearing a knit hat in ninety degree heat?), I believe to be the owner or manager, does nothing about the situation.  He didn't even seem to know what's going on with his staff or he just don't care.  I finish my meal, pay the bill and left.  This is my first time writing a review of any restaurant. The only reason I am doing it, is because I used to love this place and hope management would read this and better trained their staff. It's a shame!
