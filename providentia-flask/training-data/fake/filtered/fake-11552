I got a large Sampler tray for a family function which my family and I thought was awesome. I called for the tray to be picked up at 3:00pm and when I got there it was all ready for me to go, counter girl was great they got a man from the kitchen to help me out with the tray, which I was so thankful becuase the tray was really heavy. I was even more impress with the food. There was crazy amount of each item and the food was super fresh. I will be going back to this primos every time I have a family or work function!
