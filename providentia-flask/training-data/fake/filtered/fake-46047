I have been here twice in the past month and intend on going again tomorrow! I live in the city and am more than happy to make the trip out because it is really worth it (really only takes about 25min on the N from 59th st). The space is open and beautiful, great looking bar with TVs and a great craft beer selection. The seafood paella is amazing, and the octopus is out of this world. We also ordered the meatballs and dips as appetizers and yum! the sauce on the meatballs is so tasty. I have also had the branzino which was cooked perfectly and such a generous portion, it is not just 1 fillet, it is the whole fish! Much appreciated. All the courses were out on time, friendly service and everything tasted amazing for a really great value. I can't wait to go back again soon, every time I go back with friends they love it too.
