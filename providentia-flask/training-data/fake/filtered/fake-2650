Went here Monday after seeing Traces in Union Square. Thought it looked clean, and we were freezing, so we went in to get a couple of bowls to go. The place looked so nice we decided to stay. Ordered two green teas plus the beef bowl and the shrimp bowl not expecting anything special. Well they were exceptional, made to order I believe with the freshest, tastiest ingredients. We enjoyed them so much we ended up ordering two bottles of Saki, ( was in a blueish bottle and it was good ) the sashimi, spicy tuna roll plus the pork bun ( I never thought it possible, but better than momofuku's imo ). Everything we had was fantastic and the bathrooms are spotless as well. Ended up being the perfect ending to a great night.
