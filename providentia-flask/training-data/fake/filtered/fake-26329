Went to the comedy club at the hyatt with my wife a couple of years ago and had dinner at Crystal Garden. It felt a little strange for a nice place to be in a hotel but yes, it's a nice place. We liked he decoration. The service was great and she still talks about the pistachio encrusted salmon she had that night.  I dont remember what I had but I remember that I liked it. I'm writing about it now because I'm thinking about going back in May, for her birthday. it's an hour ride for us, but worth it. Within one hour we can go to AC, New Brunswick, Newark, NY and anywhere in between so you know this place rates pretty high to us.  I wonder if it's possible to request that salmon again?
