I don't like shopping in an area where I can't get a quick and delicious bite to eat.  I've been hearing about Noodles and Company for a long time from friends in other parts of the country.  It was a delight to learn they were coming to a shopping area nearby.  I went online and signed up to get information about Noodles & Company.  I went to a pre-opening event and my expectations were exceeded.   The food was great and clearly defined in terms of ingredients and calories.  The staff was helpful answering any questions we had about the menu.  We each chose different dishes so we could experience a good selection.  I had the Bangkok Curry with shrimp.  I'm making my mouth water thinking about it.  I'm going back soon to have it again but will also try another selection on the menu.  Two thumbs up from me and another six thumbs up from my friends.
