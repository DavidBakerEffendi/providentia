I have eaten here several times, however my recent venture 10 days ago was a disaster.  The food was not as excellent as usual.  In fact, the chicken satay I order was not good at all.  My son usually eats several helpings but barely got through one this time.  The roti kanai, which I love also left a lot to be desired.  And the service just plain sucked.  I might give it one more chance due to past experience, but I was highly disappointed on this visit.
