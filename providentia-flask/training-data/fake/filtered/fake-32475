Inconsistency with food orders. I used to order from this place almost weekly with a group from work, but NO MORE!!  Crappy service from the Owner on a recent order placed is unacceptable. Ordered 4 sandwiches, but only received 3.  Spoke to the Owner who frankly called me a liar.  You would think the Owner would care about their business, but I guess not. I have better things to do than cheat a small establishment out of a $6 sandwich especially when cheese steaks are a dime a dozen around here. Customer service is what makes or breaks a small restaurant business. AVOID AT ALL COST!!
