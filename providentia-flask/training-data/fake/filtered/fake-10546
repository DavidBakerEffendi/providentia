I eat a variety of traditional korean meals everyday at home thanks to my  talented wife. However, the food at Seoul is simply delicious - the best I have had in New England  - sorry honey ;). The service at Seoul is excellent and friendly. I love the renovations they have made - the environment is warm and inviting. I will definitely be returning again and again. When I want a greater variety of korean food options I will head down to The City  but until then Seoul saves me a lot of traveling and sends me home smiling every time.
