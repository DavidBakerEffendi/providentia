Do not go here! The food might be decent but the owner has a horrible attitude. More than once I have left there annoyed. They move very slow, and they do not treat their customers with respect. If it were not for the customers they would not be in business. They are snotty and talk very sarcastic. I would rather drive out of the way and go to Giovanni's in Secaucus which is 1,000 times better anyway. Listen to what happened today. I just recently moved and got a welcome packet from my town. Inside was a $20 certificate to Annabella's. So my brother and I went there today and I figured I would use this certificate before it expired. My brother has never been there befroe and has never eaten their food but he knows my other brother gets a sandwich with "pink sauce" on it. So when I walked in I asked the man who is the owner what is the pink sauce called. He replied very rudely "Uh it's realy hard it's called Annabellas sauce, you know the name of the place". I guess he was trying to make a joke but it wasn't funny it was rude. So we order our two sandwiches. Then he was ringing me up and I handed him the certificate and he said "Oh no you cannot use this". I said how come? He said because I wasn't a new customer. He pointed out that it said only for new customers. So I said well I just moved and I wanted to use it. He said nope can't use it. I said Ok well my brother will use it because he has never been here before. He told the man I have never been here ever. He still would not let us use the certificate because he knew me. He said why would I give anyone $20 to my place. At this point I couldn't believe he was making such a big deal about two sandwiches. I said I don't want the food then. He said fine. I walked out and I will never ever go back. I will tell everyone I know not to go there. This man has a serious attitude problem. Not to mention I was going to use his place as one of the venues for my wedding. Think again Annabella's. DO NOT GO THERE!!
