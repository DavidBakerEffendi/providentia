Honestly, this is the kind of restaurant that every neighborhood should have.  My friends and I went in for dinner (the burger melted in my mouth!), everything we had was exceptional and well thought out.  The attention from the staff was warm and attentive and the vibe of the whole place just buzzes.  We left so happy that I even snuck back in for brunch the next morning!  The yogurt dish with grapefruit and honey is so simple but delicious!  Jack's Wife Freda just knows what she's doing.  LOVE!
