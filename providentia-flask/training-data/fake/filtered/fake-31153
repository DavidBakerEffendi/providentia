Wafa's is adequate. Nothing more, nothing less. People seem to have associated it with the end all be all of Mediterranean food, and maybe for the area it is the best option, but there is much much better mediterranean (especially Lebanese) food in New York. The place seems to have a lot of loyalists and thats great for them and the family that owns the place, but 4.5 overall seems kind of ridiculous. The Hummus and Bab-Ghanoush are plain, and most of the food is un-adventurous, the same kind of food that you would get almost any place in Astoria or Bayridge. I am just trying to do yelp justice by showing this place is average, definitely not the best mediterranean meal I have ever had. I bumped them up from 2 to 3 stars because the service was good, not for the food.
