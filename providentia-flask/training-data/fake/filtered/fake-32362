We went in for a late breakfast Sunday afternoon and wow I'm glad we did! I found about cafe chorba on yelp. My boyfriend and I were looking for a new  local place to have breakfast so we decided to give this place a try based on all the positive reviews.  I have to say it lived up to the great reputation! I only live 5 minutes away and had no idea the place was even here.  The food was outstanding and service was great!  Even though our waitress was noticeably busy she seemed to have no problem keeping up with us and being awesome! My only disappointment is not knowing about this cafe before sunday.  I would definitely recommend more advertising to get the word out.  We look forward to coming back again and again!
