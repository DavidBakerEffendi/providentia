We went to Buddakan, another asian fusion restaurant (maybe competitor of theirs) and were so impressed we decided to do asian fusion again the next weekend.  Sampan was equally delicious.  The dumplings (gyoza) were so tasty, and after living in Thailand I am addicted to fried rice.  Sampan did not disappoint.  And because the dishes are heavy you can get a few appetizers for less than $15 and basically have a full meal.
