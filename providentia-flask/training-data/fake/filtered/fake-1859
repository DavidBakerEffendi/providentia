I'm so happy to be back in NY, and back to one of my favorite haunts, The Ear Inn. I felt like I was immediately at home when I was greeted with a rousing "Good Morning" as I walked in, at 9 pm! That was Angela the Bartender. Â She made our night amazing from beginning to end. She had great recommendations for us. From bourbon to beer, to trying the organic heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad. Yum! (The tomatoes are from their farm) The Ear was super busy that night , but we never felt neglected, Each customer was greeted as a regular, and we felt we were part of the many jokes and banter This is the Local bar scene I've missed so much. See you next week Ear Inn.
