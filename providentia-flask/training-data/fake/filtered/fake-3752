My favorite place for take out sushi.  Great rolls - Valentine and Godzilla are great - just tried the "Fancy" today and loved it.  Friendly staff, very quick with orders, great sushi and sashimi.  They also make a tuna sashimi "salad" called Tsunami Tuna which is outstanding. - Also looks like they are under new ownership, still outstanding.
