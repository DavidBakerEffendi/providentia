Best middle eastern food in the area This place will serve you hummus as it should taste, and salads as they should taste.  Everything is so fresh, they clearly take pride in their ingredients. You will come out so satisfied eating anything from here, because its made properly, and tastes so good.   The area around soho has quite a few places that have the same thing on the menu, but not as fresh, genuine and tasty as here.  Honest good food. Bigger plus is they use recyclable materials for all take out packaging and they're extremely nice people who work there.   I can't remember which one, but I was a bit alarmed about the oil leaving a mark on the paper towel. That said, the oil wasn't the usual 'nasty'.  These guys cook properly so I trust they use a pure oil that adds to the flavour.   Overall, a good taste, trust in that they are using ingredients that satisfy an appetite in a way that is made healthier than other (cheaper) places in the area. Try and enjoy.
