Love this place. Tried many different dishes and I have to say...pretty hard to choose which was my favorite. The Brussels sprouts were absolutely amazing and the meatballs in yogurt sauce was deeelicious. I also had the sardines which were okay, but wouldn't try them again. Besides the food, the place and ambiance is really nice and fun, if you're looking for a quiet place-don't come here-it is very lively. Still an incredible place to get top notch Mediterranean!
