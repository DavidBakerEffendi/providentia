The bright green sign caught my eye. I'm always fan of vietnamese food, specially their sandwich and pho. I've been to brookyln and chinatown for a better sandwich. This place is OK. They package it well, it looks nice. But the taste is average. People go there because the place looks cool. There's no competition around. There are a couple of pho places down the block. Â But for sandwich, not many. Should open a couple of more.
