They have great hot dogs, but they will try to steal from you.  I ordered several items.  A man who called himself Lamaz told me the price was $18.10.  When I replied that the price seemed high, he said that I wasn't including the tax.  I told him the tax was not $4.00.  He said he would ring it up on the register.  He placed his body between me and the register, tapped in the order, then pointed at the display, which read $18.10, and said "See, $18.10, the register don't lie."  Having been born in Newark, I knew better.  I demanded the register tape, on which was printed an extra $2.00 charge.  When I pointed this out to Lamaz, he said that anybody could make a mistake.  Of course, it wasn't a mistake, since he had told me $18.10 before he rang it up.  When I told him that I didn't believe him, he asked if I wanted the food or not.  I said I wanted the food and my two dollars.  He gave me both.  I let him keep the tax on the extra two dollars because I did not want to look at the creep any longer.  BUYER BEWARE!
