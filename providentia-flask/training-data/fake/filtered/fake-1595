I have been in the food service business for close to 40 years and I have yet to find a place that offers top notch food and a quality that exceeds the prices like Johnny Prete's Deli A Go Go! Deli-a Go Go is everything your parents used to talk about: good honest food, great service; you know that old neighborhood joint where you are family the first time you walk in. The quality and the portions are unbelievable. I only use these guys for my office catering, and family get togethers. If you haven't been here you are missing out.
