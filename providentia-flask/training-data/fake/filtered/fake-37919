I think the place is a gourmand's dream come true.  I bought their jarred sauce because it was discounted with a pound of fresh pasta.  I chose the vodka and was disappointed.  It tasted strange, like none other I have ever had.  Could it have been that there was more prosciutto than I am used to?  There was not only the strange flavor, but we also decided it needed doctoring due to lack of flavor.  Will someone please comment?
