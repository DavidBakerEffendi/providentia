Loved it. I was a little hesitant to go because of the previous reviews about the customer service (or the lack of it), but since I pass it on McCarter Hwy several times a week, I guess my nosiness got the best of me. My husband and I went for our 18th anniversary on Oct 30.  It was a Thursday night and we just wanted to keep it simple and local. It was not very crowded and we were seated right away. The menu was simple but plentiful.  There were several steakhouse options as well as an unlimited Rodizio option. Not ever experiencing Rodizio before, my husband and I were a bit confused.  Our server Nelson was more than happy to help us.  He was the best. My husband ended up ordering a HUGE rib eye(his fav) with several sides and I ordered the Rodizio with unlimited hot and cold salad bar to accommodate the unlimited meat. We ordered apps (Clams & Chirizo / Shrimp & Garlic Sauce) which we typically do but if we would have known better we wouldn't have. The portions were huge and we didn't really need them. Although, the apps came out quickly after we ordered (steaming hot, not luke warm) , the entrees were ready pretty quickly as well. OMG. So much food.  Too much food.(Not a bad thing) We prefer our meat medium well so a previous comment that I saw about the meat not being rare enough went right over our head.  The Rodizio guy was non-stop.  Not annoying at all. All the meat was tender, juicy and delicious. My favs were the short ribs and the lamb.  My husband's Rib Eye was cooked to perfection and the sides(mac & cheese, creamed spinach, baked potato) were nice portions and very good. But best of all was the service. Nelson was great.  There was another server, Dee, which tried to help us as well, but Nelson had it covered.  But thanks Dee to you too. And the Rodizio guy was on point as well. Why not 5 stars?  The salad bar was okay, but I think it needs to be extended a bit. Overall, it was a good time and a good experience.
