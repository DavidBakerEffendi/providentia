The food was delicious. I ordered two Prince Edward raw oysters and one crab cake appetizer, and the flavors were perfectly balanced and complemented the seafood beautifully. My problem was the service (on a Tuesday night, mind you). It's a small place and was already packed when I came in as a party of one. I was seated at the counter in the window. They might have been short-staffed this particular night because the server/bartender was running back and forth like crazy. I took this with a grain of salt... until it took at least 20 minutes for my order of two raw oysters to be brought to my table... and another 20 for my crab cake to come out. After finishing my food, I waited another 20 minutes for the check (about which I reminded both servers *twice*). I had my credit card in my hand, but by the time I got the check and turned around while putting the card in the check folder, the server had already disappeared. I waited another 5 minutes for him to come back after getting his attention and hand-delivered the signed receipt to the bar. Look, maybe I caught them on an off night, but I was still disappointed with what should have been a painless service for a very patient, low-maintenance customer. All that said, I would give it another shot, as the seafood was fresh and delicious. I'm just passing along my first experience for consideration...
