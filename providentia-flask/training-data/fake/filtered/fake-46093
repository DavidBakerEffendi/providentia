Nothing new that I am adding that hasn't already been said in past reviews, but may needs to be reiterated.  We were a group of 5 more than willing to be separated into two groups to be seated, but was kicked out.  I will not be returning and will have to settle for a different place for sushi.  I urge others to not patron Ajihei. If you do go knowing that they treat customers with disrespect and no consideration, you are rewarding and encouraging this kind of rude behavior.  I for one will be wiping my hands of Ajihei even if good food in Princeton is few and far between.
