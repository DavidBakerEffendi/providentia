Having had the pleasure of not only dining here, but being shortly employed as well, I have an inside and unvarnished opinion.  No where else can an establishment have such great highs and also sustain some incredibly low lows.  In general here the management is less than enthusiastic about the guests.  The ongoing joke is is usually on the native princetonians (like myself).  Somehow they all forget, that the "needly" locals are the same individual who fund their paychecks!  Past reviews have been spot on!  The food poisoned burger review specifically shows how little the general manager cares.  The lastest review about the female manager yelling at the server in front of guests is an oh too familiar account of everyday moornic occurances from her management style.  In general the managers are more worried about their % bonuses then actual happy guests.  Trust me, the staff hears about it, whenever a managers bonus is possibly hurt! The food however is holding steady.  My family eats there almost religiously, and we have learned to overlook the bad service.  The food has always been decent, even though multiple kitchen management changes.  Love the crabcakes, sweet mama desserts, and salads.  Beef has been better
