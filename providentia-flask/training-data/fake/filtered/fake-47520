The best part about this place is the view of the Brooklyn Bridge while you wait in line...a very long line. I was kept entertained for a while taking pictures but we waited for over an hour to get into a cramped table. Because there were 5 of us it took even longer for a table to be available. The pizza was good but, really, how can you ruin pizza? If ordering ahead to pick it up is an option I would suggest that. Like I said the pizza was good but the atmosphere wasn't worth the wait.
