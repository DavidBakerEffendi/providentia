I'm sorry Steve T. did you just say that you had an hour to eat dinner at a steakhouse and then you ordered THREE COURSES?  Are you insane?  I'm sorry for the rest of your bad experience, and service doesn't end when the check is down OR paid for, even though it was a prefix dinner, which is a way for people to spend less when they go out for dinner and that makes servers annoyed, but really.  Use that head of yours.   The manager should have told the server that you had ordered dessert, had you in fact made that clear with said manager.  The server should have been more attentive.  You should have ordered one course.   Bottom line, their steaks are pretty darn good.  I'm not usually one for crusted steaks, but I'll take it here.  Also, if you sit at the bar and order the steak sandwich, you will not be disappointed.  The booths look like crazy 18th century dining experiences at the palace.  A little out of place, which is why I prefer the bar.  It's more real.
