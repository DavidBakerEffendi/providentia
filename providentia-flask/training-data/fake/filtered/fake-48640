Decent but not stellar empanadas; $7 glasses of bland sangria with no fruit other than apples and grapes and, apparently, water cutting the wine rather than brandy enhancing it; appetizers which were only brought after everything else had reached the table; and an 18-percent gratuity added to the bill because we were a "party of four," even though the fourth person was my 15-month-old daughter, who sat on my wife's lap and had no special service other than a plastic cup of tap water with a straw. Â  Better can be found at any empanada joint in Bushwick - but beyond that, the signature item is better at Ruben's, which isn't something to accept if you're standing in line to get in the door at Empanada Mama.
