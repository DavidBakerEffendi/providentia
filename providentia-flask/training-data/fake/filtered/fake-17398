A great addition to the neighbourhood, with the friendliest staff of a restaurant we've been to. The food is delicious, simply put. The tartes flamb√©s are a personal favorite of mine, but I'm determined to try the entire menu over time. There's also a great selection of beers and wines. Try the Demi-peche! Jeremy and Damien are excellent hosts, and myself and partner thoroughly enjoy each visit here. I highly recommend a trip to La Cigogne.
