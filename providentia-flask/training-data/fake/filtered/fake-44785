One of the best late-night pizza restaurants around. Super fast, too. Also the eggplant is good here, not bitter so they must soak in salt water for a bit. I absolutely love eggplant parm so I notice this and have a list. Also, City Pizza has good desserts - nice surprise! The Cheesecake is fresh and is a lovely late-night treat.
