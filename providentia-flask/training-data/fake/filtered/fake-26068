we have been to the mustard seed a handful of times however this morning it was very busy and the tables were full we had a short wait not bad we ordered our coffee and the waitress made me an iceed coffee which is not on the menu after we ordered and received our food our waitress never came back to the table until i caught her eye she assumed we wanted our check which see brought with her i however wanted another iced coffee which she brought me in a togo cup with the lid on so our impression was heres your coffee get out you can rest assured we will never return as we assume that that is how the waitresses are told to work get em in get em out
