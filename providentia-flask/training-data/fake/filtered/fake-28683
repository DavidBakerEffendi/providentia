I stumbled in here on a Monday night after work, craving fries!! This place is a gem, for a chip shop the service is really outstanding. As it was my first time here I was taken aback by the variety of sauces, so the guy behind the counter gave me a few fries and about 10 samples which were all delicious! In the end I went with the mango chutney and horseradish, the second was a little overpowering so I would recommend purchasing 2 to try. The portions are huge and the medium is enough to share. The fries are homemade and really tasty! After leaving the guy a few dollars tip he was kind enough to give me a Mexican ketchup to take home, which was really nice of him. The only downside is that this place has limited seating, but then again I came at night time so can't really complain. Pommes frites, you have earned a new customer. 99 miles to Philly used to be my usual hangover station for their waffle fries, but this place is supreme!!!
