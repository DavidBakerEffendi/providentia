LOVE THIS PLACE AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT! Food and drinks COULD NOT be better. Well above your average bar food (Truffle Burger... AMAZING... drinks... PERFECTLY STRONG). Found the service to be top notch, food and drinks came in a very timely manner and the staff was pleasant, and good looking. Atmosphere is just what I was looking for... a bar, but clean and well decorated/maintained. Perfect place to catch a game, host a party or grab food with friends/dates. Fun when there is live music too!!! Can't wait to go back!
