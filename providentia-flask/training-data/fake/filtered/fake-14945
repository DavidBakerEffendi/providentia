I love this place- we moved to Philly 6 months ago and have eaten here probably almost a dozen times. It's our go-to for take out or casual date night since it's just around the corner from our apt. Â I like the BYO factor, and they always have our order ready when they say they will for take out. I'll second the opinion on here that the dine-in service is so-so, although certainly no more or less friendly than anywhere else I've eaten in this city, as far as casual dining goes.
