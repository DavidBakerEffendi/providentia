My boyfriend says mediocre at best for standard american chinese food. I was a little disappointed that the General Tso's chicken didn't come with any broccoli. The portions are magnanumus!! The sauces we were served were okay. Overall the experience was decent and we'll go back, believing that every restaurant (take out or not) deserves three tries...We were told twice to try the ginger beef with string beans. That's the next attempt!
