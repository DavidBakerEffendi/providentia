Drove down today from Somerset County base on yelp rating as the highest rated Indian restaurant in the area; we were not disappointed! The food was excellent, including the ggplant curry, Lamb Korma, and Garlic Chicken. Vegetable Biryani was great too. The waiter had a little trouble with our order at the beginning but I wouldn't rate the restaurant any worse - the food tasted superb.
