This diner has a great dinner menu - most of the meals I choose are around $15 and with that you get a drink, salad, soup, an entree, a few sides and a dessert. How can you go wrong? Plus, the owner is amazing - at Christmas time he came up to our table and said our entire meal was on the house and to enjoy the holidays. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for good, inexpensive food.
