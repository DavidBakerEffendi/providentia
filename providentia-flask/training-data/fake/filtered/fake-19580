2 stars for service/delivery. We love Tres Jalapenos' wet burritos, although a little on the pricey side, they are huge and delicious. As much as I love the idea of my food being delivered by a man on a bike, it is not so appealing to have my food being thrown around like it was put in the dryer on tumble cycle. The sauce to the burritos had exploded outside of the to go containers and disbursed all over the bag! It breaks your appetite to have to clean up your food before eating. This has happened twice and they said it was due to the lack of having a delivery person with a car. Overall, their food is delicious, just beware of delivery.
