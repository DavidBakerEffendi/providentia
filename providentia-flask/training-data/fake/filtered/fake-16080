All the time that I spent in this restaurant I never expected what happen on New Year's Day to occur. Well, due to the need of racial profiling I was put in to the demographic of the typical untamed  African American where Me and my friend (2) both  females were  not allowed in to the restaurant but a group of 4 non colored females was allowed in, even though they were behind us in the line. Because of this experience I'm will never step my foot in this restaurant again. My rating is 5 thumbs down.
