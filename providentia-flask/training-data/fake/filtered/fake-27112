A perfect meal!  Since it was a weekday and my birthday I asked for a round table within the chain mail curtains... Yes, of course! wonderful!   My 3 different sushi's were perfect.  I have food allergy's and there was NO PROBLEM making substitutions in the sushi for me. [this is much bigger than you may know!]  The green tea was kept filled and yummy.  I had had take out ONCE from there and yet, they remembered me. My husband had beef bulgogi that was flavorful and had a perfect balance of meat and vegetables.  The side "salads" were perfect. While the Miso soup was not the best ever, it was HOT on a cold night and that was good. The atmosphere is wonderful.  As soon as you walk through the heavy velvet drapes, you are transported out of the strip mall, hole in the wall restaurant, into an impeccably decorated atmosphere.  The staff is friendly and helpful, always there without hovering. Also for my birthday, I got a green tea fried ice cream; opened as a flower; it was beautiful and delicious.  And plenty for two!  It may be my new favorite flavor. We had a perfect evening at Hon Sushi!
