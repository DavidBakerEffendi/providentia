Despite what many other reviewers allude to, tourists can have discriminating tastes.  Even though we did eat here as tourists staying in Times Square and going pre-show, we do know enough about good service and good food to give this place a good review.  We came in as a party of five without a reservation and the very friendly staff scrambled to accommodate us.  It took a few minutes to get a waiter assigned to us, but once that happened he and the "bus boy" were very attentive and speedy.  My husband had the squid ink pasta which was cooked well and very flavorful. The salads were fresh and not overly dressed.   I had the scallop and shrimp risotto which was FULL of shellfish and very delicious.  Wished we had saved room for dessert which looked great.
