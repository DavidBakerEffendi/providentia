TOTALLY KILLER SUSHI! Â If you are a "TRUE" sushi sashimi gourmand you will be blown away by the freshness and portions of SAKURA EXPRESS sushi...simply by far the best quality for the buck and you won't have to stop for a burger on the way home because you are still hungry. The nigiri rolls, even though they are not my bag are also "Top of the Crop and heads above any other place. Seating is limited, however, the ambience is very NYC back street style and the two Chef Owners are a blast and can deal with anything you can dish out to them. After 35 years of eating sushi and living in Tokyo as a teen I will call this AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME...bring a bottle of saki and have a blast and an experience you will never forget. KAMPI !
