This is my first five-star review. We had heard this place was good for brunch so on a really rainy, stormy Saturday we decided to give it a try.  It was a bout 1pm when we walked up to it to find the line coming out the door.  As I asked the hostess how much the wait time was, one of the other customers waiting seroiusly and enthusiastically told me it was worth the wait. She was right.  The place is slick-looking, very modern and has pleasant low lighting, but it is also inviting and warm.  Maybe if this place was somewhere in Manhattan it would get pegged as pretentious, but the diversity among customers is just a testament to the good, welcoming vibe and excellent food. We sat at the bar and ordered the $13 prix fixe brunch, which included 2 hangover drinks (champagne, mimosa, bloody mary), choice of coffee or tea, and an entree.  For entrees, we got the skirt steak platter and the burger.  They were both awesome.  The chopped skirt steak was really soft and well-marinated.  The burger came with this really nice aioli and cajun fries, which were served out of a stainless steel cup instead of just scatttered on the plate.   Overall, the staff was attentive, the place was clean, the food was good, the vibe and decor were simply awesome, and the brunch prix fixe price simply can't be beat.  It is right next to the Broadway stop in Astoria, which is only four stops from the Upper East side, so very easily worth the trip.  I almost don't want to post this enthusiastic review for fear our table wait will double the next time we go; and there will be a next time.
