We went to Barrio Chino last night (Monday) with our 2 year old.  We had the best authentic Mexican food ever!  We were skeptical of the place since it is small, however as soon as we walked in, we felt welcomed! Romantic and hip!  We will definitely return (- our baby).  Go to experience it, and get there early. Expect to wait because it's small, but worth it! The service was fast and friendly.  We had a very friendly and accommodating waitress; she gave us a bigger table and made us feel welcomed.  I had the enchiladas and the cazuela - YUMMY!
