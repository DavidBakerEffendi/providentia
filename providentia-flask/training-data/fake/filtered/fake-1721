The food is amazing, when i asked what was their best appetizer, the waiter recommended the beef marrow and oxtail marmalade. I was extremely hesitant considering i was on a first date and I'm creature of habit but let me tell u it was awesome. It's a small place with limited lighting which makes it calm and romantic for any date. They stay open till at least 4 am which is great for late night eats if you wanna spend the dough. Don't go there for the burger it sucks, but then again why would go there for a burger.
