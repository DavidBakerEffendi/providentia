I went to Locanda Verde today for lunch. I've eaten there several times.  The food is typically very good.  And the overall experience is pretty average to good. Their one major down-fault is service. Typically I find the host staff to be very rude and arrogant. Today I was asked to wait 15 minutes for a table at nearly 2pm. There were plenty of open tables but they would not seat us. Finally after the wait we were brought to a terrible table that was open the entire time. The wait and attitude where uncalled for. Furthermore, as a very clearly pregnant lady I did not appreciate having to stand around or being offered the smallest 2 top with the most uncomfortable seats when there were several other better options available. Shameful. There are plenty of good options in the area that will serve you a nice meal with a lot less attitude. Another downside is they are not on Opentable.  If they are going to be so particular about their seating you'd think they would manage the process better.
