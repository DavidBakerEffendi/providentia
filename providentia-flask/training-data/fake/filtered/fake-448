A cheesesteak can only be so good. And it doesn't quite get better than Geno's. Their steak is sliced, not shredded like Pat's across the street, and many other locations would. Everyone compares this to Pat's, so here's my answer; I ordered "American without" at both locations; you get your steak with american cheese on a bun, nothing else included. Not sure who honestly likes cheeze whiz, so I can't comment on the quality of those, but whether it be the steak itself or the cheese, this sandwich is the best I've had. Anyone can cook the shredded steak like Pat's. Honestly, go to your local pizza shop and order a cheesesteak. You won't really tell the difference between that and Pat's. Find a place that makes sliced steak sandwiches like Geno's, with American cheese that tastes this good, and you let me know. A word of advice; this places serves probably thousands of customers every week. They do not need your business. They need to get you out of the way so the 50 people in line behind you don't leave. Figure out what you're ordering before you get to the door and have your cash ready. Speak clearly and you'll get what you want. And of course, since their menu is written in English and all of the staff only speaks English, order in English. That's not racism, it's common sense.
