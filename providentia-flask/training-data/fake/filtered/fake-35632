While visiting My Son at UVM I came across this fantastic breakfast joint.   My claim to fame is sausage gravy so when my son told me that their vegetarian herb gravy & biscuits were just as good I had to try them!  I was blown away by the gravy, it was the first time in my life when I thought I could easily become a vegetarian.  My sons omelette was perfect and the fruit side was incredibly fresh and had 6-7 unique fruit varieties.
