this is the second time i went there and though the beer selection is fantastic......we walk in the hostess seats us and we waited about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us....when the waitress finally came out she said she didnt even know we were there and the table next to us was having the same problem.....the food was good definetly worth coming back again for but the service leaves me to question whether id go back again.....
