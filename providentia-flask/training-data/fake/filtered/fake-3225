Okay so I walked in after work on Tuesday. I was greeted by a warm welcome and a young woman with a great sense of humor. I sat at the bar because I felt like the dining room was too formal. As I glanced the menu I asked what was good? The woman on the door suggested 4 -5 dishes in detail. So I took her advice. I had the toy box tomatoes and the ravioli and the peekytoe crab. OUT OF THIS WORLD...she even suggested drinks and helped me pick out carpet for my new apartment here in NYC. To be a first timer dining out aline she made me feel welcomed. The FOOD, SERVICE, AND DRINKS ROCKED! CHEF SHAUN AND NATASHA GET A 5++++ STARS FROM ME FOR SERVICE AND FOOD.... Do not pass up the experience!!!
