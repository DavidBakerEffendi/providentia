This is probably the BEST dumplings in nyc. No, not Vanessa's (which is more tourist-y and have thicker dumpling skin) and not the ones I tried in Elmhurst Queens either. Prosperity is so good that I feel bad for going to other Â dumpling places. First because I have established loyalty and second, I curse at myself for getting lower quality dumplings than I deserve from elsewhere. The skin is soft and crisp and with each bite, you'll get juicy mouth-watering meat. For those thick-dumpling skin lovers, I'm sorry but thin dumpling skin is the way to go. I swear 95% of the time Prosperity delivers awesome dumplings (5% off so I don't seem like I'm exaggerating and also, I get 'leftover' dumplings have been pan fried and left out for an hour or so..but who am I kidding, even those ones are good and because there are always customers, they're constantly making fresh, juicy dumplings for your satisfaction.) Scallion pancakes are excellent too with beef and vegetables. Some people might be detracted from the hole-in-the-wall appearance, but hey, if its good stuff you want, you gotta go to the right place.
