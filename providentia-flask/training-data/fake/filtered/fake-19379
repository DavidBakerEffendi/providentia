The start of a new year brings an amazing new pizzeria to Staten Island, Crispy Pizza.  Simply outstanding, the atmosphere, the staff, and most of all their plain crispy pizza. My favorite appetizer so far is their hot chicken wings.  Their wraps are healthy, their salads are fresh and their soup of the day is amazing.
