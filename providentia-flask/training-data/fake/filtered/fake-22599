The restaurant is lovely.  The bar has wonderful charm and is immaculate.  We have sat at the bar about 4 times and haven't been back now for well over a year.  This is a husband and wife owned business.  The wife is the executive chef and the husband holds court over the bar.  The husband and his sidekick bartenders are what we call "THE BAR NAZIS" who we find extremely strange and boorish.  We have never seen anything like it.  If one does not order their drink exactly as the recipe calls for you will be told about it.  We have never sat at any bar and been lectured and drilled about the rules of the bar and the rules of making cocktails.    We were speaking with a woman who was also seated at the bar and she told us they had actually refused to make her cocktail because she deviated from the original recipe.  Unbelievable.  We are fairly knowledgeable about wine, but certainly are not familiar with every vineyard on the planet.  We found that we couldn't even ask a question of the bartenders regarding wines listed without again, a lecture.  The strangeness on the part of the bartenders took away from what could have been a wonderful experience as far as the cuisine.  The wife should send the husband and his sidekicks over to the Four Seasons for training on how to act and how to treat customers.  For that fact, they could be sent over to  a number of bar/taverns in the City, who I suspect they would never set foot in, who have the most wonderful bartenders.  Actually, they could start their training with the bartenders at For Pete's Sake who are outstanding.  People go out to have conversation, not to be lectured.  It makes no sense to aggravate and insult the customers when a large part of your pay comes from tips.
