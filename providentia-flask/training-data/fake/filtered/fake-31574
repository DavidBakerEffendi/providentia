What a great experience! Our waitress Kayla was helpful, upbeat and polite. The service was top notch and so was the food. The arepas were absolutely delicious as well as everything else. The view is stunning and overall Blend on the Water has a great ambience. I would like to thank Kayla for making my birthday dinner very pleasant. She was attentive and it was nice to see that she really loved her job. I will come back just to see her! Thank you again Kayla.
