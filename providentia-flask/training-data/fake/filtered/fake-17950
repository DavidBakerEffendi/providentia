Worst Chinese Place Ever!! Don't have their seafood. You'll get sick! (I did!!) So my buddy and I randomly decided to check out this place. From the start, our experience was horrible! When I sat down, I discovered there was soup on my chair. The table cloth had stains in it. The place was really dirty! If you're planning to dine here, be sure to check the table and chars really carefully! Then rude waiter messed up our order twice! He was amazingly rude to us for some reason. I think he was a racist or something. My buddy ordered the shrimp and broccoli (definitely below average). I had the clam with minced meat. The clams were definitely not fresh. I don't know where these people buy there meat/seafood from. But, something didn't taste right. I made the mistake of continuing to eat... Later at night, I threw up and had to go to the bathroom several time! I've never written a bad review before, but this place has made be furious! People, this is one filthy restaurant. I'm never going back!
