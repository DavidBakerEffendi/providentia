Good food and service and not that expensive for a Michelin Star restaurant.  The nice touch was when we were seated close to the bar area I asked to be moved to a quieter table, the Maitre d' found a table away from the bar for us.  So I would suggest unless you like a very noisy spot to eat ask for a table away from the bar.  Would return.
