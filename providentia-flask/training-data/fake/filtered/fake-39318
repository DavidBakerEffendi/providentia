Aggie's is my new "go to" lunch spot, since I work in Trenton.  It has a humble facade but the food is ALL good and very reasonable.  Their ingredients are fresh and the daily soup, in season, is fantastic.  I am quite fond of their cheesesteaks as well.  Watch for daily specials posted on the billboard outside.  I definitely recommend this deli, if you are looking for good, fresh food that won't break your bank account!!
