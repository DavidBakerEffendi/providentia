We ate there twice after moving to the area...figured the first time the cooking or my taste buds were just off. Not so! The pancakes tasted like bricks, scrambled eggs were overcooked and the coffee just bleh! My husband had a turkey burger and greasy french fries. We do not recommend this place at all for anyone who enjoys tasty food. If you're in the area, Tops Diner is a great place to eat! Worth the extra 10 min. drive south of the Stack. Heading east? try the Schyuler Diner - their food is delicious also!
