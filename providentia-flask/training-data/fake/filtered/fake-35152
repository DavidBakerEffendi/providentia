The managers and employees at this establishment are nothing but UNPROFESSIONAL. I am a manager at a very successful restaurant chain and these people need to take a lesson or two in customer service. Besides the point, I booked a VIP section for my birthday. I was told that I would pay 150 dollars, my friends would get in for free, I would get a bottle of my choice, and I would get two mixers. I told the women I would arrive at 10pm and she said okay. When I arrived, the man at the counter told me the women handling my VIP section left at 9 because I told her I was going to show up at 9, NOPE! They gave away my section because I was "late" and they wanted my friends to pay 5 dollars to get in. The man at the counter, who I'm pretty sure he is a manager. He did not understand how to deal with an upset customer and was nothing but rude to me. I ended up leaving and taking my business elsewhere. This place is very close to my apartment and I would of been a returning customer. Instead I received horrible service and myself, nor my friends will ever return again. Whenever you think Rho, just say NHO
