Just ordered delivery, was frickin awesome. It was at my door within 20 minutes. I tried the tortas(mexican sandwich) and it was the best most flavorful sandwich I have EVER tried. The horchata(water with rice flavoring) was to say the least orgasmic. Great prices even better food. This place is my new Friday night restaurant. Please don't miss out on this place!!!
