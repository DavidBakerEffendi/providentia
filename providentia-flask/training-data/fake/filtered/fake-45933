I drove by one day,  stopped just to see what they have ... 3 fish orders and 4 sides later .... I drove away. On my way  home I was salivating .... WOW,  The food is delish.....  I couldn't  get enough . Fish was lightly breaded, very nicely done and very well cooked, not salty, not too oily and/or not over cooked and dry,  just right.   Seasoning on the fish was fine, very delicate and  again not salty.   The collard greens were perfect , potato salad, coleslaw and the mac and cheese were divine and  good  portions and again  non of the above were loaded with salt .... went back again and must say ... it's addictive... Staff very  patient and nice. Nice clean waiting /dining area, oh and let's not forget  the music, background music is unbelievable...(you have to be dead no to feel it ) ....
