Went last night for dinner after Yale-Harvard Soccer game, we were greeted by Lucille and told it would be a 15 minute wait. As we waited a party of four came in, had no reservations and were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Five minutes later this party of four was seated ahead of us, we inquired as to why as we were clearly before them and were told by a waitress who was extremely vocal that they had reservations... which was clearly a lie. At that point we walked out in disbelief.
