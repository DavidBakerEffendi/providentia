It's a chain. I was hungry so I ordered Chips and Salsa plus Coconut Shrimp appetizer and my friend ordered a salad before dinner. House salad was great. The Chips and Salsa were SO hot without being able to identify the heat source. OMG gag me hot, jalapenos-no, shiracha (SP)-no, what the heck?  We had no idea where the heat came from-I just know it wasn't in the salsa itself. Not my kind of salsa, it is not really salsa at all,  but for 2.99 not THAT bad, but I've had better for free, (I usually like hot don't get me wrong). The coconut shrimp were good but dry, cooked way ahead of time and I make so much better with a raspberry sauce that would blow your mind. This comes with a mustard/they say citrus sauce that is eh -ok. We weren't even halfway done with our apps when our meals came out. I hate that. I ordered the Mahi/Shrimp with coconut w/lemongrass sauce that would have been good except it was so sweet and could have used a little of the hot that the salsa had. My companion had the Calypso Shrimp and Linguine which I have to admit -she loved. Our server couldn't have been nicer and we as always tipped well. Just wish it had been spaced better as not to push us out the door at under an hour.  That's all I have to say. It's ok. Won't be back anytime soon  Not impressed.
