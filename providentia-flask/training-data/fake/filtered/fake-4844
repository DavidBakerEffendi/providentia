Redstone just launched a new menu. Their cooking has always been good, hinting at potentially 'really good"--but the chef is really showing his talent. He obviously has excellent training, and knows how to make the good stuff--the mushroom cream sauce on the chicken i ordered was as good as anything I could make myself out of Julia Child--(Yes, I am a very, very good cook) no thickeners, no flavorings--he makes the real thing.     In addition, the menu is expanded, including specials (one of today's was grilled shrimp on skewers with watermelon) and sandwiches including a Reuben with beautiful, thinly shaved pastrami. And the desserts, including a banana phylo, have caused me to order dessert for the first time in years. There is nothing pre-fabricated here. Steaks, pastas, burgers, sandwiches, all display a skill and originality rare in NJ, especially at this price range. Friendly staff, inexpensive drinks, great, great food I hope Morris County wakes up to this place.
