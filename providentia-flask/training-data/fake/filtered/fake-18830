The good: Beer list. The staff.  The drink prices. The bad: The food is mediocre and WAY WAY WAY overpriced. The atmosphere is horrible. I went in the day they opened and have been back 3 times. Each time the place is more empty, and their corner booth is always looking used for something other than dining/drinking (I once saw a printer and laptop set up and being used by the staff around dinner time). It's an alright place to get a drink and watch a game. But it's boring for anything else. Oh yeah, did I mention the food (a constantly changing menu) is mediocre and ridiculously overpriced?   Fix this guys, your flying dangerously close to being Bella Vista's second Vesuvio.
