The new Executive Chef of Lloyds is someone we know personally. Four years ago, in perhaps  his first big culinary foray,  he decided to serve up Thanksgiving dinner for our extended family of 11. We knew he was talented in basic cooking. But we were just astonished when with passion he dished up a  5-course tour de force gourmet treat for 12. His sweet potato biscuits, braised spinach squares, crab meat bacon rolls, and  buttermilk corn fritters complemented his  succulent turkey and stuffing. That evening's triumph started him on his professional career that's now included culinary schools, experience in multiple fine restaurants, and now Lloyd's. We haven't been there yet. But our first stop when next in Philadelphia will be to take his proud parents to dinner  at this exciting new venue. We can't wait to experience the ambience everyone already loves, and sample the new Executive Chef's food ideas.
