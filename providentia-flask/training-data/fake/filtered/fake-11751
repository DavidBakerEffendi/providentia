Chicken and ribs were dry.  Called to complain and management advised me to deal with it and that this is not Walmart.  They hung up on me twice when called to complain about poor food.  I would not recommend this restaurant at all for both service or fresh food.  They do not care about their customers.  Do not waste your money!!
