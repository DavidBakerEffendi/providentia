Arrived with a party of 7, before our reservation; they did not have the reservation in the system correctly. The food was good, not great and the service was ok.  We still had drinks and were contemplating ordering coffee and desert and the waiter showed up with our check, while they were cleaning off the table. if they could have, they would have taken the table cloth off while we were there.  For what we paid, not worth going back to again.
