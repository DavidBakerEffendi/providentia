THESE ARE AS CLOSE TO AN AUTHENTIC WEST COAST BURRITO THAT YOU CAN GET! I am from SF and there is NO GOOD west coast style mexican food here.  This place is exactly that. It's simple and there is rice in the burrito (awesome). For people who are saying "there is no lettuce or extra veggie options," this place is not for you.  These are made how you get them in the bay area. If it's not your thing, then go to chipotle.
