It may not be fair to give a place one star since I walked away before even being seated but, my experience was actually so bad I feel compelled to write something. We arrived a little bit after 2pm (they open at 2) and there were already a lot of people in the bar. The uncovered patio was empty and they were taking names to seat people so we figured all of those people wanted to seat on the top deck which is covered. We found out that we couldn't be seated no matter where we were willing to sit. So, with tons of empty tables and plenty of waitstaff wandering around aimlessly they were directing everybody to go wait in the bar. We gave out name and were told that we would have to wait at least a half hour and then when I asked why they weren't seating people at all the empty tables I was told that they open at 2 and they have to start taking names. If that doesn't make sense to you then join the club. It sounded to me like they either have to small a kitchen for the number of tables and can't handle the volume or they want to get people to drink more by making them wait in the bar. I'm just happy we didn't eat there especially after reading the other reviews.
