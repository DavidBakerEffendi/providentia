This place is pricey but worth it depending on what you get The restaurant itself is comfortable, clean, with nice decor and the wait staff is friendly. They give you a bowl of homemade potato chips to start with which are great. They'll give you more if you ask. I came with a group of friends who ordered the lobster mac and cheese and lobster roll (around $15-20 for these entrees) which were delicious! Again, a bit expensive and the portions looked small but deceiving as they filled you up pretty quickly. I order the pulled pork soft tacos which looked great but were disappointing. They were tasty but had bones in them and not the best I've tried for the price. Would not come here regularly but it is good for a night out once in a while and if you're in the mood to try something new. Like I said it can be a hit or miss with the entrees from my experience. Lobster mac and lobster roll are winners, though!
