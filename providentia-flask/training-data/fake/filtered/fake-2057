I've eaten here before for brunch and had a lovely time. I came back for a special dinner and was extremely disappointed. I have a gluten intolerance and their website CLEARLY states that they can make food accommodations. If they didn't say that, then I wouldn't have made reservations for a specialty 5 course dinner. Once I got to the restaurant, I immediately mentioned my food allergy because there were going to be 2 courses I would not be able to eat. The waitress promised to ask but failed to tell me that NO accommodations would be made until after we had already received the first course. I only had 3 courses and they still put all the food in front of me, which is awful when you have a food intolerance! They proceeded to charge us full price for everything even though I didn't touch anything with gluten. I would have gone elsewhere for dinner if they only mentioned it before they bright us food! Super unprofessional to trap your guests in the restaurant. Mind you, i've had dozens of Â tasting dinners, and many in MUCH nicer places than this, and NEVER have I had a restaurant refuse to substitute for my food allergy! Even something cheap like a salad would have made me feel like they take allergies seriously. I'm extremely disappointed in the kitchen and the floor staff for their lack of communication. I would be careful about eating at Northern Spy if you have any food allergies. The kitchen obviously doesn't care. I did everything a guest is supposed to do and since no one cared, I will not be going back and I will definitely stop suggesting it to people like I used to. I really can't say how much it ruined my otherwise nice day.
