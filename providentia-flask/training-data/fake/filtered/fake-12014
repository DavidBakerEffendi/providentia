DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO TRES CARNES!!!! They play profanity laced and racially derogatory music while customer are in establishment. I took my children after school last week for tacos...and we were greeted with foul and derogatory music playing at full volume. I complained to so called management to no avail. I have also posted this on the local mommy boards. Not a place for families.
