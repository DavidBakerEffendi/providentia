Maybe real Italian food and good meatball subs have spoiled me; but I didn't much care for these meatballs.  I tried both beef & pork meatballs, and they were average at best.  Same goes for their red sauce, but their Parmesan sauce was awful. I get it, everyone's tastes are different, so maybe you'll like their meatballs more than I did.  But, IMO people seem to like this place more for it's trendy vibe & atmosphere than anything else.  Also, when you call yourself 'The Meatball Shop', then you should at least be able to produce better a better meatball than the average pizzeria.
