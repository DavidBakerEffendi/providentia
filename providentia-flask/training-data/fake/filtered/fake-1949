This place is definitely worth a visit. I read the bad reviews, but think those people should try again, and others should make up their own mind. Food was great - crabs, kids fish and chips, mussels (weakest dish), peel and eat shrimp, mac and cheese, and spinach. All that was about $120. Yes wait was long but we expected it and had drinks and played a round of mini golf. Was there with my 2 kids and service was good, and everyone was very nice - waiters stopped to talk to kids, told me not to worry about cleaning up all the stuff the kids dropped. The mini golf was a hit with the kids. The owner even ran down the stairs to help my wife bring the stroller up the stairs. We'll definitely be back.
