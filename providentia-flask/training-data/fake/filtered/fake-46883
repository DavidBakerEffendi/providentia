paesanos ,very good home made sandwiches.I was surprised with the meatloaf, how juicy it was.top off with sharp provolone cheese and red sauce.Its got me, i have to go back now and try the rest of the sandwiches they have.Nice size sandwich on an italian bread,and better yet,the price is right.Fast service and friendly.only one thing, they don't put napkins in the take out bag,so you may want tocarry some with you.ok enjoy,i did.
