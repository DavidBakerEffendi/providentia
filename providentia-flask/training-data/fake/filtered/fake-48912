I went here for a blind date and had a great time! The bartender was really attentive and the ambiance was great. I had a great date and I attribute it to Almond! I also love how it's a nice place without feeling stuffy. Only 4 stars out of 5 because I wish the drinks were a little bit stronger. Overall though I highly recommend this place for a date or a few cocktails with friends
