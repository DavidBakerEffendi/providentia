I've never once written a restaurant review and signed up with Yelp just to do so now.  I'm so angry that I need to do something. I've had the most disappointing dining experience of my life this weekend.  Grimaldi's was one of my favorite restaurants in Arizona, and I figured that now that I've moved out east, I could still visit their flagship location in Brooklyn once in awhile for some delicious pizza. We went the Brooklyn Bridge location this past Saturday, and after waiting in line for 45 minutes (at 4:30 in the afternoon mind you), we finally got seated and experienced some of the worst service we've ever had in our life.  My wife's plate had some crusted cheese on it, so I stopped one of the servers to ask for a clean plate, and he literally snatched it from my hands without even saying a word, walked to the next empty table and swapped it with a clean plate from that table, brought the new one over, and literally threw it on our table.  I asked for a manager and explained this situation to him, and he just blew me off.  Unbelievable! After all this, our actual waiter never even once visited our table after initially taking our order...not to check on drink refills, not to ask if I wanted another beer, not even to bring our check.  After we finished eating, we literally waited 30 more minutes before finally asking the manager (who happened to be walking by the table to take the next table's order) if we could get the check.   I could even look past most of this...chaulk it up to them having a bad day, or just extremely busy, or *something*...but the pizza itself was even crap.  Crust way too thick, not cooked long enough, not enough sauce.  I cannot see myself ever going back again, which is truly unfortunate given how much I loved this place in Phoenix.
