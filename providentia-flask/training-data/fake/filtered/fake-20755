Love this darling little restaurant! Love Didier! I was in NY for a long weekend celebrating my birthday back in October and insisted on visiting this restaurant while there. Â (Based on reviews I had read). Simply delightful. Didier and the hostess whose name escapes me at this moment were absolutely wonderful, warm and welcoming. The food was delicious and portions were quite large. The ambience was perfectly SoHo fringe (what I love and miss about living in NY). I was wistful as our meal progressed...Wishing I still lived in NYC so that I could frequent this little gem. Hugs & Bisous, Didier! ;o) p.s. - be sure to bring a bottle of wine or bubbly to enjoy with dinner!
