so good that i watched as a woman sat down and tackled the entirety of both an appetizer and an entire pizza by herself. and she was a petite woman. this place truly satisfies the fat girl in me. there hasn't been once when i've been able to order a pizza (vodka pizza w/soppresata) without ordering a pasta or vice versa. and what better way to wash it down than with an amaretto sour?
