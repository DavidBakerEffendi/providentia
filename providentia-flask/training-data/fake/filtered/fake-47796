First, I would like to say that the food was delicious; however, the service was very bad.When I first walked in, the hostess was very unpleasant. I have been to many restaurants before n never have I seen one that didn't smile at customers when they walked in except this one. Second, my waitress, Rox, failed to tell us that lobster was sold out when she first came over to take our drink order. Because of that I had to change my orders after waiting Â for her for 20 minutes to come over and take our orders. I have never been to a restaurants where server didn't introduce his or her name to customers when taking their order except this one. This will be my first and last time dining at oyster house. The experience was not what I expected gathering from all the positive reviews.
