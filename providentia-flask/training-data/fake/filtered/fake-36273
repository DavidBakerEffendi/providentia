This place is very unprofessional. I booked a room from them and they sent me an e-mail confirmation. THen they gave it away without letting me know because they said I had to buy tickets by a certain day but the lady told me I had 48 hours before the event. They have horrible communication. They just gave away my reserved room without notifying me. They REFUSED to let me speak with a manager after seeing how upset I was. I asked for a refund on the tickets because I purchased them a day late to them. They did not honor it immediately and said they would call back because they were busy and decided to hang up on me. I use to like this place, they need new staff.
