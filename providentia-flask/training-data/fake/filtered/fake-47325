I went to Stowe's fish place yesterday because we read good reviews on this web site. Anyway, I cannot believe how bad prepared food they have. If you dont want to spend your money and time for a bad food, dont even consider going there. Sole: It was smelling clams for some reason. Heavyly smelling re-used oil. Shrimp: I bet it was a frozen, low quality shrimp which had Â nooo flavor at all. Lobster bisque: It was all about CREAM. I swear nothing else in it except some loster juice. It was clear brown CREAM with a little bit lobster shell juice.Cole-slaw: Cheap ingridients. Not fresh... If you still want to go its your choice but I felt myself resposible to let people know about how bad everything was. They get cash...Make sure you have cash wehn you go there.
