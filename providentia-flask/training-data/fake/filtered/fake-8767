Don't worry. If you're planning on going to Blue Ribbon for dinner, everything is fine. The food is fine, the decor is fine, ok the music is terrible but that's made up for by the service, which is a bit better than fine. If you manage to avoid the toddlers' dinner that takes place on the early side of the evening, and the kind of creepy, near-dark late hours (when they really pump that house music) your experience should be well, fine. I've eaten here more than a couple times over the last few years as I live nearby. So I've eaten or seen many of the dishes they have. All fine. Nothing special. Of course, everything's a few dollars more expensive than every other restaurant in Brooklyn, so they must think they've got something going on. But there's nothing particularly interesting or new about the menu, nothing seasonal, organic, local,etc, it just seems they've thrown as many dishes as they can fit onto their menu in the hopes that something might stick. I imagine that it was sort of a cool novelty back when they opened however many years ago to serve things like fried chicken and bone marrow and oysters. Well, there are plenty of places that serve those things now, and do it better. Overall, I'd have to say that the quality of the food has been in decline for several years.  You wonder if the owners are paying attention. Of course they must be, because somebody is bothering to raise the prices every year or so.  Don't get me wrong, I can afford to eat there.  It's just a question of value. Just can't do it any more.
