Went with a friend for New Year's Day brunch. Expected it to be crowded, and it was, but we were sat after a brief wait. Their coffee is not so good. Slightly too acidic for me. Their Bloody Mary is nice. Ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was actually just the right amount of food and tasted great (had somewhat of an Asian flavor profile). My friend ordered the French Dip and said it was probably the best he's had. It looked pretty good to me. Would definitely come back again and sample more of the menu.
