I've been coming here for years and there's a reason--the 3 daily pasta specials. They make something new everyday and it changes seasonally. I love the hummus and antipasti as well. Sometimes I just come in for a $25 bottle of wine or grappa, appetizer and dessert--I recommend the panna cotta. I'm a foodie--and I really enjoy Becco. However the service varies sometimes, which is why I gave 4 stars. Is this the BEST meal I've ever had? No. But it's Italian comfort food and it's one of my favorites go-to resturants.
