The food is astoundingly beautiful and tasty.  A perfect falafel greeted my taste-buds as they were soon treated to the most phenomenal plate of street food I have ever had the pleasure to partake of (indeed, this meal was superior in most ways  to the majority of the sit-down meals I've had) And who knew pickled beets could bring that precise mix of spices and hot sause all together so well? I give as high a recommendation to this place as I possibly can. Long live the king!
