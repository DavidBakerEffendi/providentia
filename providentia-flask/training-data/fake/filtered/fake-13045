terrific spot in the east village. the hostess was super nice and our table was waiting for us even tho the restaurant was packed.there was a good selection of wine and beer at good prices.we ordered grilled octopus and an arugula for apps and both were very tasty.i had the Â parpadelle with oxtail ragu which was great but my wife's spaghetti and lamb meatballs missed the mark the suace was pasty and the meatballs were pretty plain! would definately return ,tho and try another dish.
