So I am a freshman @ Montclair State Univ and we all decided to try this place bc we liked the name... First off, WOW!   The food was perfect, like really to die for!  We tried the Royal Flush which is basically everything you could think of on a sub roll and it took 3 of us to eat the sandwich...(It was huge!) Gotta Say, we will be ordering again! thankx Munchys..!!
