my friends and i tried to dine here and were told we could not go in this had never happened before so we asked, "why?". we were told by the man at the door that he didn't have to tell us why and to leave the front of their establishment. there were 4 of us all ethnic woman. he then proceeded to let Asian and Caucasian people in and was very rude to us again. then, 2 African American men approached the establishment and were treated the same way. another group of African American men showed up (one of which was an NFL player) and the rude door man told them (obviously not recognizing the pro athlete) that their "attire was inappropriate" when we could clearly see through the window that some Caucasian men were dining in the same type of urban attire. then to make matters worse we called while standing there to make reservations and were told that they were "full to capacity", meanwhile we could see the 4 empty tables through the window smh. this establishment leaves me no choice but to believe that they are racist. i hate to say it but racism is obviously still affecting lives in 2011.
