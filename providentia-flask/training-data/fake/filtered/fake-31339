We just went with our entire family on a Tuesday morning only to be greeted by a completely cranky & nasty hostess who was later replaced by a super nice guy and a really sweet waitress.  Your average breakfast price is $18 this goes for pancakes or Eggs w/ toast & bacon.  We got the eggs and they were fine the bacon was cooked maybe the day before and the "fresh local fruit" consisted of 4 cherries and an unripe plum.  The pancakes were really good but not dipped in gold $18?  Take your $18 and get a cab over to Mogador for a really good breakfast...you will still be saving money and everyone is nice.  Bubby's is resting on it's laurels from years gone by.
