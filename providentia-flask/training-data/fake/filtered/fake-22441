I have to say I was incredibly impressed by Queens Comfort. Even though they were packed for a busy Sunday Brunch everything was done with a professional efficiency without the feeling that I was being rushed out of the restaurant and all without losing the quality of service and food. Not to mention they also had a DJ mixing vinyls and the best host I've ever experienced taking pet names and getting the awaiting customers to cheer and clap as people left the restaurant. Priceless. The food is amazing. Period. I could rave all day about what we had, but as they say "aint nobody got no time for dat." In summary, This will be a regular place I will be going.
