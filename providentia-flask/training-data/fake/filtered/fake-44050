Same ownership as Joe and Pats but their "thin sliced"pizza pales in comparison.  Not really crispy; too much cheese, bland, undercooked.  Ive only gone through the take-out side but even there, the disinterested service is off-putting.  The pizza is also slightly overpriced. They need to recruit some of the Joe and Pat's pisanos to make a decent pie over here.  Drive a ways down the terrace and try Crispy's-much better pizza.
