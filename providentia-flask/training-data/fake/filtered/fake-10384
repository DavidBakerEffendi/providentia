The guy at TEA & JUICE PLACE is horrible!! He makes tea at 8 am and sell the same till 10 pm, i.e. for 14 hrs?? Â u can NOT get fresh tea!! The owner makes ice cream at home in disgusting environment and sell milkshakes of those for months. It's better to go to other places like, Jassi or Rajbhog for fresh made Tea and bombay talk for fresh Milkshakes. And most important, we have to get health department to this place for being so unhygienic. Please pass the message.
