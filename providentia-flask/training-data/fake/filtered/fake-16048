If you're looking for decently, authentic Mexican food in University City, Honest Tom's Taco Shop is the place to go. I am not a fan of the fast-food, Chipotle option for Mexican so even though Honest Tom's is a bit of a walk, it's worth it. As a BYO, you can pick up a bottle of beer at Local 44 around the corner and eat in. The establishment is too small to eat inside for me but when the weather gets nicer out, their outside seating is awesome. As far as the food goes, its all a little on the spicier side so if you are wary of spicy like me, ask for the pico on the side. They have 4+ spicy sauce options that you can chose from to add to your meal as well. Taco-wise, the portion is a little small and only comes with two mini tacos. Their tacos have Guacamole, Pico and Cheese on a Corn Tortilla (or a flour tortilla if you request it). I really like the chicken, sweet potato or steak on my tacos. But, the real move is to get the burritos!! They are a HUGE portion size (I can't finish it in one sitting) and they're just as delicious with Rice, Beans, Guacamole, Pico, Cheese and Sour Cream on a Flour Tortilla. Again, I'd go with the chicken, sweet potato or steak/beef, depending on if you're in the mood for meat or not. Besides the spicy factor, the only negative of this restaurant is the lack of variety. For example, I would love some enchiladas or quesadillas as an alternative with other sauce options. There's also no delivery so you have to walk but I say, its worth the effort.
