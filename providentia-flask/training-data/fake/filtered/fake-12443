always a ridiculous misquoted wait (how come there are ALWAYS empty seats everywhere when i get escorted in - i swear, they make you wait outside on purpose) service was always a little snooty, but the ramen and pork buns were so good that it didn't matter.  but my most recent visit was rewarded with ok ramen and ok pork buns.  add onto that a hefty price tag, a long wait and bad service - meh.  methinks not. maybe if i'm in the area and it's a cold and rainy day and there's no wait, i might consider going here again.  otherwise, sayonara.
