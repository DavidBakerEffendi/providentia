Having never heard of this restaurant before going for a friend's birthday dinner, I really didn't have any expectations for it. But I'm pleased to say that I quite enjoyed everything about it. Not only was the food delicious and reasonably priced, but the atmosphere was cozy, the servers friendly and attentive, and with a live, sort of jazz band playing in the next room, the dining experience was thoroughly enjoyable. Though I was there with several friends, I'd say this would be a brilliant place for a date night as well, the dim lighting and rustic setting wonderful for an intimate dinner. We did have a reservation, so I'm not entirely sure how feasible it would be to just walk in (I went on a Saturday night, so it was pretty busy), but I'd suggest calling ahead anyway. I'm already trying to figure out when I'll be able to go again! It was that good!
