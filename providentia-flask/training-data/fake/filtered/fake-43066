If you're into a more intimate dinner, delicious food, friendly wait staff, and a very nice and friendly owner, then you should go here. I absolutely love this place. The food was delicious and decently priced. If this was in the West Village, each meal would have an extra $10 added to it, and this is what's nice about Porteno. You get all the quality and service at a reasonable price (not cheap by any means, but affordable). The owner approached our table twice to ask how things were going, and when we stated that the bottle of wine we had ordered wasn't really what we wanted after trying it, the waiter politely switched bottles, no attitude. I will be back, as this is definitely my new favorite restaurant in NYC.
