If you like classic pub style food then this is the place for you my friend... I went hear on a whim and was not disappointed in any way. All I can say was yum yum YUM!!! they have an excellent selection of beer and spirits, and great tasting food.. it can get cramped at some times, but that just shows how popular this place is... with a fast fun & friendly staff this was a excellent choice for a great evening out!!!
