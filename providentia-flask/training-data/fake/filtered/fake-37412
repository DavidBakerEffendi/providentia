There are a lot of choices for Indian food along Oak Tree Road.  I don't know why  I picked urban spice -- maybe it was the incongruity of an Indian restaurant in a former diner -- but I'm glad I did.  Perfect flavors,  amazing Indian food so different from all the other places in indian restaurant..                                                                                                            Highly recommend this place for every one ..especially orange kulfi &  pan kulfi was mind blowing for dessert ......
