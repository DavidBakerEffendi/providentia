Three of us came for dinner last night. I'm afraid our experience wasn't great. The appetizers were OK, although the beets had been prepared earlier and tuna seemed over dressed. My tagliatelle was oily and overladen with garlic, while the chicken was tasty, the mash seemed fussy. While the food approached competent, the service was the clanger, it was like amateur hour. The wait staff couldn't remember two specials without referring to her note pad, couldn't remember who ordered what, and kind of threw the food in front of us. The staff seemed careless and offhand, pity, as they have taken some pains on the decor and the menu. C minus County.
