To make a long story short (and blunt), Sketch was f*cking awesome. These burgers come with huge ass patties that are cooked to perfection and served on the most delicious bun I have ever eaten. I ain't lying when I say this is the best burger I've ever had. Better in fact than PYT. It was so filling, too . (Truffle butter burger with mushrooms burger) We also got Belgian hand cut fries served with Harissa Aioli sauce . The fries are prob the best I've ever had because they are so thick and crunchy. Each one was crunchy!! haha and the sauce was truly something special.     The inside look was uninspiring. I think the people were going for some Hipster look with the church pews and drawings of Sketch burgers all over the walls and tables. However, it just looked Hipster-ghetto. But I applaud the idea of putting drawings all over the walls. Some were pretty cool and I even made my own with the construction paper, crayons, and markers they give you.
