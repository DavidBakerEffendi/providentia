This place is a dump! I Bought a 50.00 voucher for 25.00 off Groupon. The first sign of trouble was the tacky decor (love the 50yr old indoor/outdoor carpet) & lack of patrons @1pm. Â I ordered the penne ala Runway (spelt "penni on the menu lol) and my GF a mushroom burger. My pasta dish was made well in advance as it came "obviously microwave reheated" as it had the typical super hot then cold sections of food. Pasta was mushy and chicken over cooked. It also had "string beans" in it ( I'm guessing last night's vegetable) The burger was ordered medium rare but came well done (the no name ketchup was particularly classy. Wont even spring for Hunts. How $@$@&$ cheap) . Lemon cake was hard and stale. 1 Entree & burger, two sodas, two pieces of cake (all from the lunch menu) 47.00!?!? Avoid this place!! The Applebees 2 for 20 special has this place beat hands down lol
