Horrible, terrible customer service. I wouldn't be surprised if they spit in your food.  I ordered from this place before and never had a problem. The must have someone  new because they were rude and nasty to me on the phone, then tried to tell me I needed a $25 minimum for delivery . There food was okay being the only local Thai place, but they just lost my business.
