I almost never eat in Queens but we wanted to have something to eat in Astoria before we headed to Randall's Island to watch Cirque du Soleil.  We read some reviews and decided to make reservations because it was a group of us and we figured it's in the right location and who doesn't like Italian food.  It definetly turned out to be the best decision! Service was fantastic.  My husband dropped some change out of his pocket and the waiter rushed over and insisted on picking it up.  They were friendly and accomodating.  The food was great!  There was not one thing I didn't like (I tasted a little of everyones meal).  Be prepared to spend some $$ but to me it was well worth it.
