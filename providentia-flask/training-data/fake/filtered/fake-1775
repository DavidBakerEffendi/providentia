Pio pio was very nice. It is a beautiful restaurant which kinda makes me feel like I'm in a birds nest??!?! The atmosphere was nice even though it was very loins and very dark. My favorite thing was the appetizer we had which was the seviche. It is a plate of seafood which is very hard too explain how it is but in one word AMAZING. The chicken was rotisserie and we absolutely delicious. I would defiantly recommend this restaurant if you want to try Peruvian for a change.
