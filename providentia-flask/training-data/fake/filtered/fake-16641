This is some of the freshest sushi you will find in Philly at a very reasonable price. Everything is delicious! Â Very generous with the sashimi servings. Plus you have the pleasure of watching your sushi being constructed at the very intimate sushi bar by either Vic or his assistant. Everyone inside the restaurant is pleasant and it just makes you feel at home. Try some of the special rolls- my favorite is the Sansom roll!
