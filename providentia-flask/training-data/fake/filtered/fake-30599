Took my son there today for lunch, What has happened to this place, First the waitress was to busy takeing care of her kid instead of taking care of the customers.I ordered the Chicken with Shiitake mushrooms, "which is on the menu" when she brought it out It was made with button mushrooms. I told her that this was not what I ordered. She went back to the kitchen and then told me they were out. I asked why did you serve me something I did not order. she had no answer. I hope the owner reads this and can explain to me why they served me this
