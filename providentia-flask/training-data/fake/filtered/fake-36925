Great Place. Simple, solid menu.  Everything is made from fresh ingredients.  My wife and I go here religiously. I love the burger and fries, but sometimes venture out to other choices and am always satisfied. The owner is a great person and seems very committed to staying up-to-date with the contemporary restaurant / food trends in nyc.   The waitstaff is nice too. I enjoy seeing Quaint evolve while maintaining consistency.
