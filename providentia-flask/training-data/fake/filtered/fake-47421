FIRST AND LAST TIME. My bf ordered a bacon cheeseburger and I simply said "make it two to make it easy" followed by explaining what we wanted on it (lettuce pickle etc) AND THEY ACTUALLY MESSED THAT UP. Stupidity at its best. Maybe if cashier didn't have to yell every time someone walks in the door they would be able to concentrate on orders.
