Quality of food etting worse since last two weeks. Also, their manager told me that they only gives good Â service to new customers. There was waiting when I went threr on Mother's day (May 20, 2012) I was waitun for 15 minutes. New customer arrived. Manager gave my table to new customer. I ask him why let other customer jump the queue? He said they care about new customer than regular customer... Also As I said quality of food is going down hill.. I was going to the place for last one year.. I will not go back again..
