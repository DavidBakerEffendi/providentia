When my husband and I first stumbled upon Ngam this past summer, we were so happy to find a restaurant that served delicious Thai cuisine at such a reasonable price point.  The night we dined there, they were offering $6 grilled lobster tails! And they were darned good too.   It was a no brainer when I was picking a venue for my birthday party dinner this October.  While most restaurants in NYC make it extremely difficult to book large party reservations, Chef Hong, Molly and team made it easy and were so accommodating.   They worked within our budget and created a tasty crowd-pleasing menu.  We started with fresh oysters for the table served with a spicy thai sauce.  Our guests had a choice of  a garden salad, spring rolls or tom kha soup to start.  The choices for mains were the Thai Burger (unlike any burger I've ever had - it's delicious), pad thai and green curry.  The green curry was very spicy but my friends raved about it. We were also able to bring in our own birthday cake which was nice. The dinner was relaxed and fun and we never once felt rushed.  We were able to take over the entire communal table in the center of the restaurant.   The service at Ngam is exceptional whether you're going on a date or throwing a bday dinner for 22 people.  I can't say enough good things...
