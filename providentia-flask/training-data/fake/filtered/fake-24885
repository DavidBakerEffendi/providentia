I went to El Cocotero on Friday night with my friend and thought it was INCREDIBLE! The waitstaff was unbelievable--on top of everything, super nice, gave great recommendations and were super cute! The arepas are so delicious! We had several meat and fish filled arepas and cachapas. Â The guarapita was so refreshing and smooth! Plus, everything is wheat free! The warm staff really makes you feel welcome--it's almost like you're eating in someone's hom. I can't wait to bring a date there!
