Food was excellent. Great Italian spot. Glad I made reservations too. The entire place was packed around 7pm. I do have one complaint though. The person I was eating dinner with was drinking Ginger Ale and I was drinking Sprite. The waiters kept tipping off our glasses with water. They assumed since our drinks were clear-ish that we were drinking water. It became very annoying around the 3rd time they did it. I even told them after the first time they made the mistake, that we weren't drinking water. I had to keep asking for new glasses.
