Very disappointed! I ordered 2 Panini and 2 pizzas and ended up paying 40 bucks (including tip for delivery). Not only the Paninis were dry and tasteless, but I burped soap all day! I live in that neighborhood and one of the reasons why I chose that particular place is to be close to Italian cuisine which I adore. I'm starving to get something good in a reasonable price range. I can't understand why there's no good place where you can get good food in NYC, unless you go to a fancy restaurant? Any suggestions folks?
