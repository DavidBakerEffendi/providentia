I had a Blackboard Eats discount (30%) for Swine. It was great, but I must say that if I had paid full price, it would have been too much for the quantity of food we got. The scallops were delicious, but you only get three small ones for $12. The pulled pork sliders were by far the best value and tasted amazing ($4 for one decent sized slider + a bit of really good cole slaw). I had high hopes for the house pickle plate, but it wasn't that great. The short rib was super tender and good, but not the best I've ever had. The cocktails were quite good and reasonably priced. The duck prosciutto crisps were solid. The ambiance of this place is fantastic!
