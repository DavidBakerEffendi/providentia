I just tried to make a reservation not two seconds ago. Â I expected courtesy and patience. The only thing I got were two really rude people who had no patience or the common sense to attempt to hear what I was saying. When I asked for a reservation for the 31st, they repeated 25th. After two attempts, the first person placed me on hold without saying anything other than "just a minute". The second person picked up and seemed so impatient, like I was wasting her time. As soon as I said 31st she said "can you speak louder?" at which point I was already yelling through the phone. I had to repeat it four more times and include "at the end of the month, 3, 1" in order for her to hear me. Then when she asked me for how many people, before I could answer, she followed with "hellooo?", again in a very seemingly annoyed tone. After that, I got fed up. For a distinguished restaurant, I would expect better customer service. If this was the service I received over the phone, I'd hate to think what I would receive in person.
