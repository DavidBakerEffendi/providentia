First time patronizing a local eatery in East Falls and what a pleasure. The quaint setting and quality food made for an enjoyable evening. The staff was quite attentive and the service was on point the entire evening. The veal was tender and very tasty as were the appetizers. The antipasto provided a nice selection of italian meets and the mussels were tender and flavorful. The only reason I gave this a four star was because the espresso was weak and the tiramasou (sp?) was ice cold. My wife however was overwhelmed with the chocolate ice cream. I like the vanilla ice cream that was infused with coconut. At the conclusion of the meal the chef came to our table and inquired as to our satisfaction and I must say that I was impressed. Thank you for a very enjoyable evening. Great window seats, great food and a nice setting.
