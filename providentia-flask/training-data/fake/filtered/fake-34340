I recently came here on a business trip with some coworkers. The atmosphere is very nice the entire place possess a nice ambiance that is hard to find these days. Our table was ready almost immediately after we arrived which was very surprising for Â a larger group. The food was standard, nothing in particular stood out but nothing to complain about. We ordered drinks, appetizers, entrees and dessert and they did not give us any hassle when it came to dividing up the checks. I will keep this place on the list when I am back in the area.
