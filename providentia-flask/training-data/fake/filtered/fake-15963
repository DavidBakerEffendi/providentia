Had dinner here earlier this week.  This is perhaps the 4th time eating at the Continental and it continues to under whelm us.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  Atmosphere is great, the owners are fabulous in keeping the place attractive and comfortable.  The food to us is sorely lacking. We ordered 2 burgers, at $10 each no bargin, and toppings were extra to boot.  Our burger was kind of dry and not very tasteful, the swiss cheese did not have much bite.  DW ordered Crab and Linquini.  For $19 there was not much in the way of crabmeat and a rather small portion for this price.  Crustini was really garlicy, too salty to eat.   Menu is not very large, mostly tavern food.  Perhaps 2 pasta, 2 seafood and the rest standard upscale bar items.  No specials on the board, just plain uninspiring. Will probably look elsewhere as the prices did not justify the quality or quantity of food, better choices in the area.
