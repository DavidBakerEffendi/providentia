Don't really understand what all the hype is about this place. Stopped by here for dinner with the gf and that was my first mistake.  Definitely not a good place to go if you want to have a conversation over a meal.  The seating is cramped and the acoustics leave you shouting across the table.  The decor is interesting, as they have a whole chair, desk and lamp hanging on the ceiling as if the whole room had been turned upside down.  Usually that's a warning in my book when restaurants try to get clever with the atmosphere instead of focusing on the food.  Given the homey feel and word of mouth, I was hoping the food would change my mind.   First the appetizers.  We ordered Arancini Di Carne (Rice balls) and the Mozzarella Pizzaiola and my were they disappointing.  The Rice balls were flavorless and crumbled on impact - its impossible to pick them up with a fork.  There wasn't much meat inside and the sauce around it added nothing but an oily mess.  The mozzarella fared a tad better, but was ultimately nothing to write home about. On to the main course, I ordered the Michele pizza while the gf ordered the special seafood pasta entree of the day.  Since I don't eat much seafood I can't comment much on the dish, but the gf was unimpressed.  My pizza was similarly blah.  I'd gotten rave reviews from friends about the pizza and was excited to try it, but it was altogether ho-hum.  When it came out, the heat of pizza along with the toppings I chose left the center of the pie very moist and flimsy.  It tasted okay, but the mushy-ness of the first bite wasn't too pleasant. The place gets packed, so you need to continually flag down your waiter.  We had to wait for menus, utensils, the bill, etc. and my water glass was continually empty.  -1 star.  So much for the hype - there are better options out there!
