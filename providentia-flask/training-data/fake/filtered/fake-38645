Went here this past Sunday night. When my friend called to make a reservation for 8, they gave her a hard time and said they would try to squeeze us in. When we showed up we were literally the only people there. Throughout our meal there were never more than 6 or 8 tables with people. The one bright spot for the entire evening was our waitress who was extremely helpful. But unfortunately she was not nice enough to out weigh how poor the food was. If they wanted to bill themselves as an inexpensive tapas type place that would be appropriate, but instead they charge high prices for sub par food. There are a wealth of great restaurants in the area, avoid this one at all costs!
