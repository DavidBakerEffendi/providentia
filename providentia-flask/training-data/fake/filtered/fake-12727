I want to preface this by saying, yes, I am a big Mario Batali fan, but I ensure you this is a completely unbiased review. I came to Lupa for lunch which I recommend for this type of restaurant. The restaurant had an inviting, yet simple rustic Italian décor. The menu was straight forward (in Italian with English translation on the back) featuring a lot of Batali staples as well as a great wine list. I had the spaghetti alla carbonara. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the pancetta was amazing. Perfectly cooked chunks of pancetta with a slightly crispy skin that exploded with flavor in your mouth. This is coming from the foremost authority on spaghetti  alla carbonara. Overall I think it's a great place for an afternoon lunch with friends or a date night.
