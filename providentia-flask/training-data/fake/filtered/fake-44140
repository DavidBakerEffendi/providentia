We would never come back to this place. The guy behind the counter never greeted us since my wife and I walked in and did not show us one bit hospitality. We didn't want to stay there a second longer and later changed our order to takeout. The food was ok at the best and over priced. For fried fresh seafoods, I say Stowe's would be a much better option in town.
