Dear owner The decor great chic I can say much about the food as i only tryed the octupus and the meatballs which both dishes where good Now the reason i gave you 1 star Â you might want to think about the service which is so so so slow ,one of the issue is that your staff finishing their shift blend at the bar with costumers and your bartender 's pay attention to them and not to the actually costumer whom pays their bill I went already several times, the bar service.... man this guys don't know what to do at all,i understand is not Manhattan standard but at the end the floor staff works for tips and if you want to make money pay attention to what you do Look forward for a better experience
