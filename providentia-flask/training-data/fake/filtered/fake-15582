I take my hat off to you guys.  I'm a 15-year culinary professional and I am also new to the Newark Ironbound area.  Last week I went to Manu's for dinner for the first time and went back twice later that week.  As an openly admitting food snob, I am very critical of food quality and general cleanliness.  You guys are spot-on.  Although I love the sushi, especially the "Incredible Roll", due to the fact I had dinner on half price tapas Tuesday, I got hooked on your tapas.  I must say that I was quite skeptical about the fusion of the Asian and Mediterranean cuisine.  Again, I take my hat off.  You do it well.  Congratulations on your substantial achievement.  Keep it coming.
