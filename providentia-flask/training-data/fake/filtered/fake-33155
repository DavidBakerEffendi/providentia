Good Food.  Bad Customer Service.   We ordered from Taim and they convinced us to order the fries (top 20 in New York) because of the sauce.  They delivered the fries without the sauce.    We called and said that the fries (soggy and mediocre) did not come with any sauce.  They said they would send sauce.  An hour later, long after we had finished our meal, the sauce arrived.
