I went to Georgie's on 8/6/2011.  I was raving to my wife about a Pat La Freida burger I had at a restaurant in Rye, NY (On the Way Cafe) and had to take my wife to get one.  I found out that Georgies had them and since we lived in Fairfield we decided to go because it was closer than Rye.  Well the Georgies burger fell way short to the burger I had in Rye, wasn't even close.  I make better burgers on my own grill, my wife was disappointed as well.  It just had a burnt taste to it, despite the fact that they were done medium.  Needless to say, we won't be giving this place another try.  If you can't cook a La Freida burger well, burgers should be easy!...its my opinion that you probably can't do anything else that well either.
