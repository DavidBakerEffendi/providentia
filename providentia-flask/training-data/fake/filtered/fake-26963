LOVED IT!!! The place looks interesting, not something you would think to be in Astoria. Loved the wood walls and cleaver details, very eye catching and distracts you from the saliva collecting in your mouth when you are waiting for food. The service was great too!! Waitress was attentive, knowledgeable (taught me about 'burnt ends') and hot!!! Food was delicious, not overly seasoned or sauced. Portions seemed to be perfect for the price and enough to satisfy. In addition to the burnt ends, I enjoyed the ribs which I found out were St. Louis style(thanks hot waitress who i can't remember your name)...whatever, they were good. I also enjoyed the sweet potatoes-I don't normally like, but did. The honey butter and corn muffins (gratis) was a nice touch. The kid...I mean chef...behind the counter sounds, looks and acts like he knows what he is doing.....I was studying his every move when he was putting my order together. Â  The managers were also very friendly and warm, this caught me a little off guard. They gave me a tour of the place and told me where my meat came from.....hey wait a minute... The back yard looks cool. Can't wait until that rotisserie is going and they get beers in this place, that backyard deck has late night potential. Going back soon....
