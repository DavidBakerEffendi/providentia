My flight to the Murtosa Airport was 6 hours late. I took a cab to Seabra's Marisqueira, had dinner, met some old friends, got to the flight late and went the next day. I went back for lunch, the following day. Seabra's Marisqueira is like home for me. 5 stars food, among old friends, what else can a man long for?
