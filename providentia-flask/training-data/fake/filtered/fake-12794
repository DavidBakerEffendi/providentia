I am from Chicago and was on a business visit in New York . I was looking for an Indian Restaurant in the Jackson Heights area ... Samudra seemed to be one of new restaurants and I decided to try it . I tried some of the south indian stuff like dosas and idlis - they were fresh , great tasting with the appropriate amount of spices . The service was excellent too . Being originally from Bombay , the food here brought back fond memories of the some of best Udupi restaurants there which are known for their tasty food & service at a gerat price. Â I have not seen any good 'Udupi' style restaurants in Chicago or New York . Samudra is definitely the best of the lot. ! .
