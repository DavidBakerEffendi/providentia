More like PJ's Disappointment house. I ordered pancakes and sausage thinking it would be fully satisfying. I left with 2 tiny sausages (still cold) and 3 semi burnt pancakes. Keeping this in mind I owed $15 plus tip (which I did not include for their poor performance). I left full...y dissatisfied. Never going back. Sincerely JDUBZ
