Small quaint restaurant with casual dining. Pleasant and attentive service. The mulligatawny, the traditional Indian pepper and curry soup was spicey and delicious. We also enjoyed a saag and vindaloo dish for dinner. Unaware that the Saffron is BYOB we had to rely on the generousity of the fun adventurous couples seated closeby. It was a great dining exerience. We will be back. As a added bonus, there is a great Thai market a few doors down.
