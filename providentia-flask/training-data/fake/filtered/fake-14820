I have been coming here for personal and business dinners for years.  The quality of food and service is unique and rare for the Lawrence area.  I highly recommend the pork chops when they come up on the specials menu, and the brussel sprouts are wonderful.  They will modify menu items upon request, like asking for them to make the burger with a chicken breast instead.  Incredible food and the prices are reasonable for the quality and atmosphere. A nice place to bring clients as well as just for dinner with friends in a sophisticated environment.
