Anytime you're in the TriBeCa area, I urge you to stop by Sophie's to eat some authentic Cuban food.  If you're in to Latin and Spanish food, this is the best place, with good prices.  The food is hot, fresh, and made quick if you're in a rush. I don't know why they close early at nights, so go there for lunch. Apparently there are several Sophie's in NYC. But I think they're all good. Cheers.
