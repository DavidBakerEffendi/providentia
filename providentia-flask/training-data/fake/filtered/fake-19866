I am definitely a fan of this place. The way they set it up is fantastic and super comfy. You can definitely hang out with great friends or even take someone on a date there. The staff was really friendly,  down to earth, and attentive.  And most importantly, the food was delicious :) It was such a pleasant surprise & I will be going back soon. I highly recommend it.
