I absolutely love this restaurant. The food is incredible, the sizes are extremely large, the service is friendly and the ambiance is cute and charming. I love going there and getting the artichoke and spinach dip and the warm chicken meatball salad. I have never been disappointed and go back over and over again. Be warned, however, the wait time for a table on the weekend will be long so make sure to go when it opens or later on in the afternoon.
