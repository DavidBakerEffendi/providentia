I love chicken and rice carts, good cheap and filling. I had high expectations for this place, it was a letdown, big time. The rice was cold, the chicken and lamb was tasteless, and I waited on a long line. If you want to eat real quality Halal cart food, get out of Manhattan, and go to the Falafel King of Astoria, that fella makes incredible food, its a bit different than most carts and it really tastes like chicken over there.
