I go to this place often mainly because its close and I like to have some drinks. Overall, their food is horrendous.  Especially if you have had shell fish in other places, you will be able to make a distinction lol. The oysters are the size of a quarter, and they charge 2.50 per.  There is another raw bar just a few miles away from Stagehouse that charges 2.00 per oyster and they are 3 times the size and fresh. When I was served these oysters at Stagehouse I didnt know whether to laugh or cry becuase I was dying for oysters lol. The Stagehouse is nothing more than a glorified burger joint- more hype than anything else.  Their greatest attribute by far is their outside seating section.
