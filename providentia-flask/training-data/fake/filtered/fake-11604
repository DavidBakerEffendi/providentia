This place is great! I have been here a few times but yesterday was my first time at their happy hour and let me just say it's AWESOME! Their margaritas are great and I love that they make them with fresh ingredients and none of that sour mix stuff. Dollar tacos are a steal and they have a bunch of options to choose from. The atmosphere in the place is very cool, kind of kitschy mexican vibe which might not be for everyone but it's definitely a different experience unlike anything I've seen. The staff is great, very knowledgable and my bartender last night was no exception. All in all, if you want traditional, authentic Mexican food, this is the place to go. Keep it up! I will definitely be back!
