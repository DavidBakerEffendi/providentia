My wife and I went there for dinner tonight.  The service was subpar.  One of the appetizers, the eggplant caponata had a piece of saran wrap in the dish, and it was returned with hardly an apology.  The whole wheat pasta dish was al dente and bland... most likely a box of Barillo pasta.  The antipasti meats were dried out, and the bbq chicken pizza had way too much bbq sauce on it.  Overall, it was a disappointing meal, considering how many other wonderful restaurants are in west hartford.  Avoid!
