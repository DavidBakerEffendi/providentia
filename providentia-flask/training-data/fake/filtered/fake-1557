Found this place randomly on Yelp and it turned out to be a very pleasant surprise.  The food was incredible and very inexpensive.  Every dish was extremely tasty and well presented.  Probably the best Indian food I've ever had, and I eat it quite often,  The place itself is very small, maybe 4-5 tables, but it looks like they do a lot of deliveries.  The only negative was the neighborhood - it isn't in the best of areas, and it feels a bit out of place for where it is.   Also finding parking can be a bit of a hassle.  Service was good.
