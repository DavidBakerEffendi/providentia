I asked for recommendations from some of my neighbors and several people recommended this place. Generally I prefer Vietnamese, Thai, or Cambodian cuisine to Chinese but my 12 year old  really wanted some Sesame Chicken, so Chinese it was. Upon arrival, the tiny dining room was pleasantly  a buzz with activity. The decor was simple but cozy and cheerful and everything smelled MARVELOUS.T We ordered 3 entrees and 3 appetizers for our first time ordering from this neighborhood hot spot. The Cumin Lamb was great. The Sesame Chicken was really just General Tsao's Chicken with sesame seeds sprinkled on top and the Chicken Lo Mein was good with noodles that were fresh and springy and the chicken was tender. The apps were not a success: Pork Spring Rolls were very grease-soaked and tough, Steamed Dumplings had a thick rubbery dough with tasteless filling  and Crab Rangoon was pretty much all cream cheese with no discernible crab and it also had a thick, tough dough shell.  We didn't finish the Rangoon and dumplings and thew a few out. That NEVER happens. We ordered online and the  promotion wasn't honored at pick up: free Chicken Fried Rice with a $40 order.  So, kind of a mixed bag.
