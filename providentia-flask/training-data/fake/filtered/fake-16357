First and last time we try this place.  Pizza crust was hard as a rock (also took too long to arrive). My boyfriend and I ordered the Arugula salads to start with. Our suggestion: DON'T ORDER SALAD FROM THIS PLACE unless you like a bland, tasteless salad. Back to the pizza...The sausage on our Camp Randall pizza smelled disease-ridden and I felt like puking after two bites.  I've not had a worse tasting meal in a long time.  How can they serve stuff like this?   There aren't many restaurant options in this area, which makes Emily an easy pick for the neighborhood..but I would highly recommend making the trek to go somewhere else instead of wasting your time on this self proclaimed loveable pizza.  It was horrific.  I will never go there again. Maybe management needs to re-evaluate the quality of their products that they offer. Sorry Emily ...Thumbs down.
