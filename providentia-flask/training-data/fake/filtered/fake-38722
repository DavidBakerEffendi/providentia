I had dinner with a friend of mine a few days ago. This was my first visit there. While the service and atmosphere were good and the quality of the food adequate, I found the prices for the adequate food to be very high. I have been to many restaurants in Philadelphia from those owned by Starr, Vetri and Garces to the smaller independent ones like Barbuzzo, Indeblue, Zahav etc, and while Fork was not bad, it certainly didn't reach the heights of many others that I have been to. Especially for the money they charge. I probably won't return.
