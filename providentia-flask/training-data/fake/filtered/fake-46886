I'll start off by saying this is now my go-to Italian restaurant. The prices are reasonable and the food is GREAT. Not an A+, but definitely an A. The bread is delicious, fresh from the brick oven, with olive oil and herbs to dip it in. I ordered the sampler as an appetizer and it did not disappoint. The meatballs were very flavorful, the fried mozzarella really good, and the Tuscan grilled chicken wings even better. The only slight disappointment I had was the shrimp scampi because the shrimp were small and there weren't a lot. I've had better shrimp scampi, but it was still good nonetheless! Overall, it was a great experience! Definitely a good Italian family restaurant if you want to avoid the generic Olive Garden and Carrabba's stuff. I'll definitely be coming back to try the brick oven pizza.
