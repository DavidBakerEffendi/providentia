I'm sure this place is charming and hip for out of towners visiting their transplant kids who've landed in the eclectic and sophisticated culture of Astoria :/, but between the slow service, attitude from counterpersons too busy with their own personal conversations to know what their own wifi login is, and the inability to pour a cappuccino properly, I'd recommend avoiding this spot. Might as well just take an hour train ride to one of 500 pretentious spots in Williamsburg. At least your overrated coffee or beer will probably be made at least 10% closer to acceptable, you'll know what you're walking into when a careless hipster ignores a usual request of a normal customer, and you'll at least be able to walk ten minutes for a nice view of downtown Manhattan. This behavior is unacceptable in a nice family hood like Astoria. And oh yeah, fix your wifi. Why is everybody always raving about this place? Do you ever make it to the island?
