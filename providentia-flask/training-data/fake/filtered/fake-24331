Ate here tonight for the third time.  First time was over two years ago when my husband I were visiting Burlington.  That experience was not bad and we thought, while not great, the food was passable as pretty good Mexican food.  Ate there with friends a month ago on our way to Montreal and my husband I thought the food was not very good.  Since moving to the east coast from San Francisco a few years ago, my husband and I are starved for good Mexican food so we decided to try again tonight, hoping our last visit had been a fluke.  Not so!  I thought I was ordering something safe when I ordered a combo plate with a cheese quesadilla and a pork taco.  They managed to ruin both!  The quesadilla was so small and thin that I couldn't pick it up with my fingers.  It was really awful.  The pork taco had nothing on it except very dry pork.  It was inedible.   My husband had a chicken enchilada and a pork tamale.  The chicken was tough and stringy and the pork tamale was edible but not great. I thought sour cream might help the meal so my husband and I tried to flag down the waiter - twice - to no avail.  I finally had to get up and go to the kitchen to find him.  He never checked on us one time the entire time we were eating.  My husband's glass was empty and it was never refilled. I had a house margarita, up with no salt, and it's the first time in my life that I was not able to finish a margarita.  I don't know what they use for a mix, but it was sickening sweet with a slightly bitter after taste. Burlington is a great food town.  With so many good restaurants, there's no need to waste your money at this place!  Hopefully someone will see the need and open a really good authentic Mexican place someday.  In the meantime I will pass on this place.
