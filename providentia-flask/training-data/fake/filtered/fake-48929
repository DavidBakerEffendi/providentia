We got in and waited for about 10 minutes to be seated. The waiting area, as well as the bar, are really nice. The hosts too.  Our waitress was a delight, very helpful and nice and the food was pretty good. I had the Almond Hash (Duck confit, onions, potatoes, poached eggs) which was so huge my friends had to help me with that.  Nice place for brunch. I suspect it would also be nice for dinner.
