This is one of the best restaurants in the city. If I'm rating based solely on that, then it's 5-stars all the way. Great food, great service, great location, great setting. Not okay: everything is overpriced. $10.00 for a glass of cabernet that online the entire bottle cost $12.00. That was the cheapest wine-by-the-glass, too. My entree was delicious, Braised Lancaster Chicken and Tender Potato Gnocchi, but at $28.00 it didn't include more than the equivalent of a chicken tender amount of chicken. Until the prices come down by about $3.00 (wine-by-glass) and $5.00 (entrees), I won't return.
