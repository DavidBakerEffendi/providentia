My wife and I have been here three times, and each time we've been really happy with everything. It's so nice to have a place where you can get great food and still have a clear conscience about what you're eating. Eno Terra grows much of its own food, supports local farmers and livestock-growers, and encourages sustainable practices on a lot of different fronts. Every time we've been there, too, the wait staff has been incredibly knowledgeable and friendly. All in all, this is one of the few places I've ever eaten where I really felt like I could spend a lot of money and get what I paid for.
