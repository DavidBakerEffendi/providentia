A small group of us went to dine at this local spot that eveyrone kept talking about. We heard it gets crowded and that's it's cash only. We went early on a Tuesday night, 6pm the place was empty except for one other patron and her child. We were a part of 6, 5 with one on the way to from work. The host literally argued with the 5 of us for 15 minutes about holding 6 seats at a table of 6 since we all weren't there. He insisted he take a table away which makes it a table for 4 with one chair set on the side. We explained that she was on her way we would order for her etc. but alas no. Did I mentioned the place was EMPTY!!! We called our friend told her don't bother we weren't staying long and we'd bring her food at home. Next time I would advise the owner to teach his staff manager to treat the actual customers who are in the restaurant and about to drop cash on food and drink with more importance then the potential customers that never arrived. I am a native Brooklynite and can honestly say outside of the behavior of the staff that the food was average Italian red sauce stuff making me feel not disappointed for deciding we are never going back.
