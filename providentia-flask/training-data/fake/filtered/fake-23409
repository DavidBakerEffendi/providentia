Adore it! My favorite Italian cafe in NYC. The go-to-place for a casual, relaxed but beautiful Italian dinner. Pizzas (the prosciutto one is great) and paninis are great and the vichyssoise soup is also delicious. Service is always very pleasant although a bit slow. It more than surpasses the expectations of a simple cafe.
