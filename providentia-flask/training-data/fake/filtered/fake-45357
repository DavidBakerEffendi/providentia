The food is always divine, which is excellent! Their only flaw is that waiting for a table can be a drain, especially one the host tends to seat her friends first! Tisk tisk, however the staff is very friendly & the dj who isn't amazing tends to play good jams. Best nights to go, are Fri & Sat. be prepared for at least a 45-min wait though. Eeeek!
