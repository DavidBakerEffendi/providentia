This Place is really amazing.  I've been going here ever since all the chefs and a majority of the workers broke off from Penang down the street and came over here.  The waiters & waitresses are really on point here.  Never had a wrong order, and my cup of water never goes empty (i know that's a little thing but it's often a measure of how attentive the workers are of you). The food has NEVER been bad here.  I've been a regular for about 5 years now and the dishes I order have been CONSISTENTLY delicious, and that says a whole lot about a restaurant.   For Appetizer, I usually order Indian Pancakes, beef or chicken satay, spicy crispy squid (For the Adventurous eaters), or Banana Leaf Chicken Wings. Whether or not you're vegetarian, I'd recommend the Tofu Satay. For Entree, I'd recommend the Mango Chicken (Mango Tofu as an alternative... oh and in my opinion, the mango tofu actually tastes better because it soaks in the mango sauce into a deliciously deep fried tofu sponge, and when you bite into that, the flavors just overwhelm you and put you in a good mood) I can't say I've ever had the pad thai, but whether or not you liked it, you should try the Mee Siam which are thin vermicelli noodles with a sweet spicy sauce, (one of my all time favs).  Also try the Thai Basil Noodle... Malasian Buddhist for vegetarians is a good one as well. Finish with a Fried Ice cream, and I'm sure you'd be one happy camper.  Oh and did I mention it all comes at a fair price? Yea.  Very Enjoyable Food.
