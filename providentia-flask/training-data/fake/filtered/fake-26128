Consistently exceptional. Â  Skappo has been a favorite for years. The food is always amazing, and paired with the mom and pop atmosphere, I always feel right at home. The service is warm and friendly without being over solicitous, striking just the right balance. Other reviewers have noted this atmosphere as going against the prices. I think the prices are perfectly suited to the excellent food, and the atmosphere has never taken away from a fancy date night - quite the opposite. The food is exquisite. The menu changes pretty regularly, so there's always something new to try and love. The truffle crostini is simply out of this world. I never leave without the risotto, and the meatballs are another perennial favorite. You cannot get food like this anywhere else. It's clearly crafted with love. The espresso is, for my money, the best in town. Perfect crema, and just the right amount of sharpness without excessive acidity. The wine list is a great balance of delicious affordable stuff and fabulous splurges, and the staff is very helpful if you're looking for suggestions. Tried and true, Skappo is the best Italian food in New Haven. They'll be keeping my business for years to come.
