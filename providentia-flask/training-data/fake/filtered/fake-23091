I found this restaurant when I was looking for a good restaurant for Goulash. I didn't like the goulash here but they have other yummy stuff. You should definately try their Borscht & vegetable soup. I like their coleslaw kinda vegetables, too. They are delicious. My bf and his roomie love their Polish Platter with 3 pierogies, kielbasa, stuffed cabbage, bigos and potatoes. They are all really good. I'm not a meat lover so I haven't tried the other entrees but they are all inexpensive and look good. Oh, don't forget to bring your own drink (if you want to have some beer/wine) and cash with you.
