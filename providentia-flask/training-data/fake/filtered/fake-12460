I have been raving about Laduree since I lived in Paris in 1996. Every subsequent trip across the pond required a last-minute Laduree run at Â the shop on Rue Royale near La Madeleine. I would purchase a St. Honore for myself to eat, a few eclairs - especially the coffee one for my dad, and an enormous box of the celebrated macarons to bring on the plane (oh, they do travel well). My favorites are the rose, cassis, pistachio, dulce de leche and vanilla. I literally squealed in delight over the announcement of Maison Laduree's NY opening. While it will never replace a trip to Paris, I am delighted to know I can get my favorite pastries right here in my home city. Bravo et a bientot!
