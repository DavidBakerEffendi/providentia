We've been going to the Sahara for some years now, and with their new and improved setting and new menu things have only got better than they already were. Service has always been warm and friendly and reasonably prompt. Whatever combination of things you choose, the items are always fresh and neatly balanced, especially important for the baba, tahini, hummus and ful madams--and the falafels. The amounts served are always generous. And I am a dessert person, so I can only confirm what one other reviewer has said below: their baklava is 'to die for...'
