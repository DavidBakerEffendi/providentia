My absolute favorite place to go when I'm home in Jersey! I don't go as often as I want to, though, because of the wait. I find that if you go for an early/late lunch or early dinner, the wait is manageable. Otherwise, expect to hang outside or at the bar for about an hour. As for the food-- more often than not I get the swordfish tacos. I have not seen swordfish in any other restaurant in the area.. for the price you get a hefty portion and a happy stomach! It also comes with half an avocado and other sides. Swordfish can be very flavorless and dry if not prepared correctly, but what comes in their tacos gives it the punch it needs without being overly spicy or greasy. The margaritas here are huge and aren't skimpy on the alcohol. The burgers are also very good, for only $6-$8 a pop. The complimentary chips and salsa are always a plus. It's not exactly a great place if you want to catch up with friends as you will probably have a hard time hearing them. Still, 5 stars for the food, drinks, and ambiance!
