one of my go to places in the neighborhood.  decent prices, staff and owners are super nice.  service has gotten a little slow though, and one of the waiters is sometimes too preoccupied with telling you you want a bloody mary to remember you actually ordered a coffee.  oh well, not a deal breaker.  nice place for drinks and food. update - i'm knocking this down to 1 star - because of one waiter, Brian, who is terrible.  consistently awful rude service.  i saw in other reviews he was mentioned.  the other staff said we weren't the first to complain about him.  i would mention specifics, but he is across the board shitty -  IF i ever go there again, i refuse to have him as my server.  but i'm probably not going back, there are plenty of other options within a block or two that don't have such a spectacular asshole of a waiter.
