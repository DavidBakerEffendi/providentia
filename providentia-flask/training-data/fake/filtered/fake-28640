YES, FINALLY - an authentic Italian restaurant in the area. My wife and I shared two appetizers, one pasta dish and we each ordered dinner. Each dish was excellent. The food was so fresh that we had to ask the friendly owner how they do it. We were told that the food is delivered fresh each and every day. Wow, it was that good. The server was a very nice young man that exceeded our expectations. I will defiantly recommend this restaurant to anyone that appreciates delicious, fresh food in a warm, welcoming atmosphere
