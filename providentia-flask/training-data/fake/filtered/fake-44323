Sometimes bad service ruins the whole dinner. If it is just bad service, I will give it three-star for its food. But, but a waiter in this restaurant is really RUDE. Speak loudly to us in a bad mood; never come to refill our hot tea; one of our food is simply forgot to put in; urge us to pay tips. It's the worst experience for us to be in New York last time. I will never come to this restaurant!!!!!!
