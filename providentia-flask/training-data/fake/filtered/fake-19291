Was in the mood for sushi and not wanting to head back into center city, so I stopped here for a quick snack and some free wifi. Food was very quick and the employees were very friendly. For such a small place it has a pretty large menu from breakfast sandwiches, to noodle dishes, to sushi. I'll be stopping by again to try out what else they have to offer.
