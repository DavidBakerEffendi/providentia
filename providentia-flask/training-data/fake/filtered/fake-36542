My go to pizza place in the area.  They don't deliver and I still choose to drive over and pick up rather than get pizza in the convenience of my own home.   The pizza is tasty and they don't skimp on the toppings if you order any.   The guys who run the place are really friendly as well.  They once stayed open late for me to pick up my pizza and then tossed in one of the extra pizza's they couldn't sell as a freebie.
