Awesome burritos and definitely worth the trip. My friends and I have tried the carnitas al pastor burrito, sunrise burrito and portabellorito, and really enjoyed it. The pear cider ale is also very good--- light and refreshing. Only down side for me is that the atmosphere is a little too dark and loud-- I don't enjoying shouting to my friends sitting next to me.
