This place is very close to where I live & at night this place is packed with people coming from parties. So it can be hard to find a seat at 3 am. They are open 24hrs. I get X burger. It's huge & tasty, I usually can't finish it. I tried other things on the menu like salad, pastel (favorite) cocada(desert) & the shakes are amazing def try cupuacu with milk or water. The potato sticks on the burger are a great touch. Can't go wrong with this place for late night eats. Outdoor seating a huge plus during summer.
