This is the worst Indian lunch buffet in Center City Philadelphia and is also the most expensive at $9.95.  The signs claim that it has 30 items, but 12 of them are condiments like chutney!  Speaking of the chutney, it tastes terrible and looks like melted mint chocolate chip ice cream.  If you are looking for non vegetarian food, this is definitely not the place.  They only had two meat options in the entire buffet.  The fruits in the desserts looked like they were sitting out for two days.  The idlis were stuck to the napkins and they were yellow and either all crusting or extremely hard.  Most of the dishes were very bland and cold.  The staff never refreshed any of the items on the buffet the entire time we were there.  Contrary to what some other reviews have pointed out, there is nothing traditional about this place.  I have honestly eaten better tasting frozen Indian food. Bottom line -- dont ever go here for lunch buffet.  You would be better off saving your money and eating better food from one of the carts off the street.  Samosa has a cheaper lunch buffet and although I did not think it was good, it is still much better than Karma's.
