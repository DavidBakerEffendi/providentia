This place is one of my favorite bars in New Jersey to go and have a drink. They always have a good beer selection and the bartenders are cool with you if they have seen you a few times and will take care of you. It's a great place to watch sporting events of any type, and it's got a really nice outdoor tiki lounge to chill out in the summer. The clientele is definitely colorful but that's what makes it fun. And unlike most other chill bars that I've been to, the food is really great, especially the pizza and the wings. Big thumbs up! I've spent many a fun night here.
