The restaurant has very relax decor which makes you feel at ease. The food was enjoyable and delicious. Since I have never had Cajun, it was new experience for me. We had the catfish, shrimp and crab boil and vegeterian gumbo soup. The environment and the food Â makes it a great place to take ones significant other and have a relaxing time.
