I had a great dinner with a buddy here a few months ago, and I'd definitely recommend the place to anyone.  Every item we got--from the burger, to the appetizer, to the beer--was delicious.  I think we got fried pickles for the appetizer and they were amazing.   Nice atmosphere inside, though it was very crowded when we showed up, and I think we even had to wait for a bit to be seated, but it was worth it.
