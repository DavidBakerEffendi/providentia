Wow, what an absolutely perfect experience. A beautiful space, attentive but not overbearing and so delicious. We travel to Italy often and this place gets it exactly. Our first visit was for a friends wedding which was by far the best wedding we had ever been to. Experiencing Tre Piani with just my husband and I was even better. Try the homemade mozzarella and osso buco, Somehow the chef even managaes to get amazing tomatoes in the winter. Thank you Tre Piani!
