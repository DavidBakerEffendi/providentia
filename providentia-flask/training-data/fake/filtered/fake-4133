I want to like this place, I do. I take the train on the corner to work in the mornings and  stop in to pick up a cup of coffee. Without fail, the man working the counter is so cold. I dont expect him to remember me (even though I go there 5 out of 7 mornings, at the same time), but a glimmer of friendliness would go a long way.  Today I decided I am going to write a review and walk a little further to the coffee shop on Fort Hamilton from now on.
