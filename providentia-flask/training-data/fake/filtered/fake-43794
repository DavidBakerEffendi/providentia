I love their food and tapas! So many great dishes on their menu that the last few times that I went, we over ordered but my party & I still managed to finish it all up bc it was so delicious. My favorites are their crispy brussel sprouts...omg just thinking of it makes me salivate (I cook brussel sprouts at home now bc of theirs), seared foie gras, seared scallops, philadelphia truffle surprise, squid-ink paella (was pretty large), the angus beef slider (drool, so juicy), braised short ribs (omg so tender), tuna tartare, potato gnocchi, pan-roasted striped bass, sangria (pretty strong, thumbs up), almost love it all. I always want to go back. Great romantic & cozy dim traditonal/rustic style atmosphere for a date or a GNO. Dishes are a sprinkled variety of international delicacy; fusion delight. You can't go wrong here for a great wine & dine night. You definitely need to call ahead for reservations bc I've tried spontaneously walking in a few times on the weekends for dinner and they rarely ever have tables for walk-ins. It just shows the food is that good and a must try. Note: entrance is a little hidden bc I almost missed it when I first went, so look carefully...it's really a hidden gem in the neighborhood. Be sure to have cash in hand bc they only accept AMEX. Only bummer but preparation will nullify that minor problem. Enjoy!
