Hands down Philly's best raw bar.  The staff is well educated and up to speed with the Restaurant's daily market menu.  They are aware of what wines best suit your meal and understand the entire menu equally.   As a popular establishment, large groups may be difficult to accomodate, but with patience will be seated.   The ambience is light and airy in a large space decorated with antique oyster plates.   The dessert menu is well curated and innovative.   A must visit for the oyster aficionado.
