I am a native Philadelphian born and raised in West Philly.  We typically ate cheesesteaks from local pizza joints.  Well since joining the military 17 years ago, I decided to take my children to have a Famous Pat's and Gino's Steak.  Oh how aweful it was.  Pat's steak was bland, fatty, the fixin's area was dirty, bad customer service.  The steak was so bad, we decided not to go to Gino's and just tossed the Pat's steak in the trash.  We left and headed for a corner pizza joint.  Don't waste the time and money on a Pat's steak.  Go to South street or a local pizza joint in the hood.
