this is as good as it gets.  usually the food and service is good.  will not get any diamonds but it is typical Filipino style food and restaurant.   Very casual and service just meets the minimum.  they respond to requests but do not expect the dishes to be cleared the same day you are there.  it is a family affair with friendly staff.
