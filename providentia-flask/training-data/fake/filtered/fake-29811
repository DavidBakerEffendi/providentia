Whoa, 19 bucks for brunch a bit pricey we thought but well worth the price.We had lobster rancheros and fried oyster omelette both delicious and the home fries were outstanding.A must try is the lobster claw bloody mary that comes with the brunch a perfect drink with along side these dishes. We are looking foward to sampleing the other dishes and to what seems like a great happy hour. Martin O.
