In the former location of my favorite sushi restaurant of 20 years, this has now become my favorite neighborhood restaurant.  I go on a regular basis just for the watermelon gazpacho, but literally everything on the menu is delicious, light, flavorful, with beautiful presentation.  Some of my other favorites are chicken salad arepa, the pork belly, the crabcake wrapped in rice paper.  The brunch is also highly recommended.  Get there,
