qualified review ONLY for my favorite pie: "with fresh tomatos"... have to admit we love this pie so much we always end up ordering it, no matter how tempting today's specials may entice... and the siren-call of a Vinnie's pie beckons often. As others mention: nice, thin crust: I'll add perfect sauce-to-cheese ratio. Vinnie's sauce is tangy and garlicky: more flavorful than most others. But add the tang of those fresh tomatos and the pie elevates to THE BEST pizza in the area. We've tried a few appetizers and they've all be quite nice: but I go for the pie.  We usually go early (before 6) for dinner: service and atmosphere has been great. Thank heavens I don't live close enough to walk over for a slice for lunch or I'd be 200lbs.!  Dining rooms are in-between casual and classy: I hear it can get busy and service may suffer. As with any pizza, it's better gooey-hot right out of the oven than having sat in a cardboard box getting soggy-bottomed. I think they're now offering wine, but you can BYO of choice.
