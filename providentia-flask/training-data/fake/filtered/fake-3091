My wife and I treat ourselves to Cuban Pete's once a month and we have an excellent experience every time we go.  Dominic, the owner, makes you feel like family when you are there, taking the time to stop at each table to say hello and to make sure everything is going well.  The service is impeccable, most notably Estephen, who I make sure to ask for when we go because of his positive, upbeat personality and he is always helpful when we ask for his suggestions on what to eat.  Be sure to bring some  wine and order up some of their incredible sangria - watermelon is our favorite!  Overall Cuban Pete's has delicious food, a fun/lively atmosphere and top notch service. It is one of our favorite spots to eat.
