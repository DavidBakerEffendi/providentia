Greek Lady is a great place for a relaxed breakfast lunch or dinner at a great price with Â filling portions and fast service. I brought my family friends here when they were visiting form out of town because I knew that they would enjoy the may food options Greek Lady offers, as well as the high quality. We had a great time getting brunch there - the food came out quickly and just howe ordered it (I recommend the egg white omelet with veggies and potatoes!) Great experience!
