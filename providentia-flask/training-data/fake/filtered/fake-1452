Very European and cool. Lovely Austrian menue, on the over-priced site. Great service. The only problem- some times the wait is too long. The museum is also worth seeing. I always go there with my guests from Europe. It's our island on the other site of the Atlantic. And they used to speak German there. Love the newspapers, the flowers and and the music. Great ambiance! Everything that transports you to old Europe.
