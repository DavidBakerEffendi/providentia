i moved to greenpoint Â about a year ago and was a lil sad about the cafe situation in the area... glad this place has opened!!! i can get a kick ass coffee on the way to work and i admit i have been stopping by on my way home for oysters/cheese and their addictive sidecars. the staff is nice (hot) and it's a good addition to the hood.
