Very solid happy hour. Buck a shuck oysters were surprisingly fresh and delicious. Combined with a few oyster shooters and cold kenzingers this meal was beyond pleasant, especially considering what we paid. The highlight for my wife and i was definitely the friendly service and the raw clams. I wouldn't recommend dinner after having a bad experience w a very moody server (back table on a thursday night) but every happy hour seems to out-do the previous. After having visited 4 or 5 times now this place is highly recommended.
