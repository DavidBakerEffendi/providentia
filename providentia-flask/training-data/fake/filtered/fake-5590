Perfect spot for a date or girl's night out.  Be prepared for a wait if you go during the evening hours.  I've gone here a few times and only order dessert.  Their menu is expansive and portions are large, similar to Cheesecake Factory.  I recommend the fondue with churros, since it's fun to share with.  It comes with a caramel, raspberry, and a choice of milk or dark chocolate dipping sauce.  Ask for a spoon to continue feasting on the sauce if you gobble the churros up.  As for ambience, the décor has low lighting and large windows that open during the summer months.  On the way out, don't forget to eye their chocolate truffles - makes good gifts for someone special :)
