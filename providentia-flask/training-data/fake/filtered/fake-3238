My family and I have been going here for years...located close to the house and very convenient.. Great pizza...fresh ingredients and friendly staff. The inside is still very old looking. They could use a make over. I always pick up my food and it's always got and ready when I get there. And if you dress up on Halloween and decided to get pizza they will give u a free slice for wearing a costume
