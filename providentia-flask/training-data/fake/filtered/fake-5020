A very Modern Korean looking place. Food Love the Food . We ordered the Kimchi tofu soup. We were stuffed. Tofu was very silky. I like hotpot with a very nice broth. Great for a winter day. Love the banchan too. Service The waitress was very nice and friendly. She gave us extra banchan. Automatically I would like to go back again to try out the other foods.
