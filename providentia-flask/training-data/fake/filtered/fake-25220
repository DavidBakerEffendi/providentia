My family visited me for the first time since I moved to Brooklyn and my sister and mother are both vegan. I was trying to find a place that they would really enjoy. I heard about Champs and the menu looked amazing! We went and had such a great experience! The tofu scramble with the belgium waffle and sauteed kale was so delicious!!!! My mom and sister were so happy....it was a long walk home because we were so stuffed!!! I can't wait to go back again!!
