I will NEVER go back here again! I brought my 16 month old toddler in her for a slice of pizza and they said that they were out of slices and that we would have to wait "15 minutes" for a new pie. made us wait like 45 minutes after they said that the wait would only be like 15 for a new pie for slices. Every 10 minutes or so, they would see my son cry and say "oh, it will be out soon" but they NEVER made the pizza! They saw my poor child and just kept lying and never made the pizza- because they wanted to make $$ from pizza orders and didn't care about my $6 for 3 slices (which is over-priced to begin with). Finally, I got tired of waiting and left after about 45 minutes of being lied to. If they were not going to make the pizza, that's fine, but they could have had the decency to tell me so that I could take my hungry baby somewhere else to eat! That was very MEAN and CRUEL to do to a 16 month old baby!!! I wouldn't patronize this place again if they sold the pizza for $1!!!!!!!! And their pizza is way OVERPRICED anyway!!!!!!!
