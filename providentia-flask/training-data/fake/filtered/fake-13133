Eh, what can I say. For us meat eaters, this food is strictly average. Some of the better vegan food I've had, but in the end nothing to write home about. Even the pastries are just average. The selection is pretty big, but is a little confusing. The place is pretty cramped and you can feel pretty claustrophobic because of that. The waitstaff are generally pretty nice, if busy. Prices are a tad on the high side for what you get. It's a solid dining experience though.
