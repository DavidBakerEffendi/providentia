first visit to Cafe Gitane and it was very disappointing. the gorgonzola cheese in the baked pasta is overpowering.  the cous cous was definitely not fresh. most likely just tapped out of the plastic container which is how it got it's "unique" shape when served.  it gave me an upset stomach for two days. nice place to people watch - stick to the avocado toast , it's about as fresh as you're going to get. our experience was very forgettable.
