I wandered into the Otheroom to meet a few friends just after I moved to the West Village in the summer.  I generally find the bars in this neighborhood to be boring and/or trying way too hard, but this place is genuinely a gem.  I've become a Sunday regular and even become friends with a few others who pop in regularly.  The atmosphere is chill, drinks are good, bartenders are good looking, hilarious and attentive.  But this place gets the 5th star because it's one of the few places in the west village where you can still meet cool, interesting people and have a great conversation without paying $17 for a cocktail and fighting some douche-y banker and his douche-y girlfriend for elbow room.
