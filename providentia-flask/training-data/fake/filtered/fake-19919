Great atmosphere, interior makes for a cozy, intimate setting. Owner is a great guy who filled us up with wine at the bar seeing as our reservation time was not honored until 30 minutes later to be seated. But, the food, urgh. I had the cornish hen. Go to KFC / Popeyes for what is better tasting fried chicken. Because thats what it is - flavorless, fried chicken on a bed of turgid cabbage and saliva. Oh, I had an appetizer too - fig and prosciutto flat bread - the cheese was good, the rest of it average. Some of my dining companions had the Schnitzel (Veal / Pork) - this looked and tasted like the type of TV dinner that low-income families make their 9 year old kids cook for themselves while mommy is at her 3rd job and daddy is getting drunk. Also, the food 'repeated on me' the next day. I neither have the inclination nor the constitution to try this repugnant gastronomy ever again. But, I would love to visit for a glass of wine on a night where you can stand at the bar without being in the way of the waiting staff.
