A great experience!  We had reservations but when we got there they were just cleaning up after a very large party, so it was going to be a few minutes.  The wait ended up being short, and while we were waiting, the staff opened the bottle of wine that we brought.  They also offered to bring us something to munch on.  A nice touch I thought.  Once we were seated we had a very pleasant server who again apologized for the wait and she told us that our desert would be complimentary.  She mentioned that some of the earlier reviews about the place were critical because of the wait times, and they took the criticism to heart.  In fairness to them the restaurant is brand new and they're still learning how to manage all of the eager patrons.  They more than made up for the small wait with great service, excellent food, kindly servers, and a cozy atmosphere.  Also the price was surprisingly reasonable.  I think my wife and I spent less than $45 for a salad, appetizer, bread, and two entrees.  We were full when we left.  I would highly recommend it and plan on going back soon.
