DISASTER!!  Once great, this spot is now horrible !  It was my favorite for years, but now they have the slowest and rudest waiters in NYC, mediocre food (at best), and it's filthy.  What a shame.  I thought it might have been a one-time mess, but I gave them 2 more chances and they were all the worst dining experiences I've had in New York. Save your money and eat at one of the many many better Italian restaurants (like Applebee's).
