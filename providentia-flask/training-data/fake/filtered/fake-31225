My Â first Yelp review, and I'm writing it only because I feel ripped off. I ordered the baked ravioli for delivery tonight. $13 for 5 small raviolis - literally smaller than an appetizer portion. Nothing else, no bread, just 5 small raviolis in red sauce. This place is well known for pizza - I have had it, and it is good, but don't bother ordering anything else if you have an appetite.
