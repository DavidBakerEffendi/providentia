Lovely new pub in Tribeca--unpretentious, friendly, warm place with picture windows letting the outside in. Amazing, inventive food and great drinks served by the attentive staff.  Among the best chicken wings in town, oh yes!  From the simplest (popcorn dusted with brewer's yeast and cayenne pepper) to the more complex (aforementioned chicken wings; scallops over slices of duck), the fare here is sumptuous, surprising, and full of flavor.  They do both meat and vegetables incredibly well. And I also appreciated that in such a lively place, the noise level remains pretty low.  Rare in this city. In short: GO!
