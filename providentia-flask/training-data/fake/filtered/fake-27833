I'm not taking away from the pizza itself which is very good, but the long wait + the jacked up prices will not have me going back.  I wouldn't wait more than 20 min. to eat anywhere, but that's me.  I'm a simple chap.  It's a very good pie with fresh ingredients all around, but I had a few spots of burnt crust, and don't tell me that's the way they make it.  Nobody wants to taste and chew on carcinogens.
