Was there last night-looking forward to going again. We had Â 2 kebab dishes and 2 appetizers. Plan on trying all the appetizers over several months-not the kind of food I eat all the time, so it's a treat.. Prices are very reasonable; yes there are differences in menus as to prices of some items-but that is so minor. The first reviewer may have a vested interest in other place they suggested-so I'll try that one too, just to be fair. Nice and quiet, service is calming and pleasant. Restaurant is neat, clean and nicely decorated. Try it out; will more than likely be very pleased. Jerry S.
