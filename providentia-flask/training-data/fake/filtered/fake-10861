Amazing amazing amazing.  Though the wait was a bit intense,  (darn them high ratings s making this place a must go to) the food and service well made up for it. Favorite things were the shrimp boil,  the crabcakes,  and the Mac and cheese. .. However,  best body may and Margarita ever. Definitely worth 5 stars,  if I could give 6 i would.  All I can say is the scene is hot,  and I will definitely make this a regular spot for me and my friends.
