Hinge was a great local joint. The food was good and supporting the neighborhood felt good. The lady and I were passed over for two groups of three for seating. The other parties arrived much after us. When we questioned not being seated, they couldn't give up the extra seat. I guess they are looking to sell plates without much regard for customer service. Not the way to treat anyone especially local regulars. North 3rd Sounds mighty tasty for our brunches from here on out.
