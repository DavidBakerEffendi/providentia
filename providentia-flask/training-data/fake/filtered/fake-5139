ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE! Perhaps the worst restaurant experience of my life. Wait staff was extremely rude from beginning to end and the food was oily and fatty. They rushed us in and out, making my girlfiend and I feel like an imposition, rather than welcomed guests. The level of absurdity of the way in which we were treated cannot be sufficiently communicated in writing. I would greatly implore you to choose a different establishment if you care at all to be treated with any decency or respect and served a decent meal.
