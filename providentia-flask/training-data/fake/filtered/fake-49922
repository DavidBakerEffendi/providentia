I don't really understand why City Steam has any bad reviews. I have been here probably 20 times or more, and I have never had a bad experience. Above all, this place is a brewery. It's a great place to kick back with friends and have a few great beers. Their Naughty Nurse is the most popular (probably because of the great name) but my favorites are the Norwegian Wood and the Careless Love. I have had many a happy hour turn into late night at City Steam, getting lost in conversations with great friends over great beers. The architecture in this space is amazing, and I always recommend it to out of towners because it is unique and familiar at the same time. I have been to several comedy shows here and I like that they don't have a 2 drink minimum like a lot of comedy clubs. I am probably going to have 2 anyways, but I appreciate they don't pressure you. About one Sunday each month, Sea Tea Improv, a local improv group, does a free show. Always a good time. My favorite menu items are the burgers (with a side of mashed potatoes instead of fries) and the mini mac (a small mac and cheese) but everything I've tried is good. If you go expecting good pub fare, you will not be disappointed, and a lot of items are a step up from pub fare. I have even been here for a working dinner with a large group. They set us up upstairs and we ate family style. Very good service and we were able to get our work done in a private space.
