Honestly, as far as good Middle Eastern food goes, this isn't of the best quality. Positives: Delicious hummus with just the right balance of flavors, fantastic grape leaves, and phenomenal falafel sandwiches. Negatives: The filo in the spinach pie is always soggy, and the lamb shawarma is very dry. That said, Â when you're getting a falafel sandwich with a side of hummus and grape leaves for $6.00, who really cares about the quality? The food is literally ready in under a minute, it's open late, and it has two great locations. A side note: do yourself a favor and test their hot sauce BEFORE you put it on your sandwich. I think it's the hottest sauce I've ever had in my entire life, and it can truly ruin a sandwich if you're not very VERY careful with it. The sauce is also big on spice and low on flavor, so it's not for everyone.
