Alright, maybe it was Â a bad day but was expecting much more from this place. Food was good, we tried to get some help from waitress but we only got some attitude, only a smile when she dropped the check. Heart of palm salad was tasty but nothing out of this world, we tried too arepas and that was really good, guacamole and chips very nice too. I guess i was just turned off by service and the atmosphere but i'll go back to confirm.
