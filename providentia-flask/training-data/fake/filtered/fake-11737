Great place!! i heard this from my friend and hesitate to go because 'Shushi All you can eat" sounds cheap and not good quality food.  I tried it and it was totally different than I thought. It is not 'buffet style', instead you can sit down and eat whatever you want.  they have shushi, sasimi, noodle soup, small plates, maki, tempura all you can find in Japanese restaurant. Better thing is those were all good and tasty!  I think I ate whole courses and even had a green tea ice cream at the end.
