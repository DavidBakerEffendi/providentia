My husband and I dined at this place for Valentine's day. The ambience was well setup for the day with a special menu as well. There was a long wait for the tables so making a reservation was well worth the time. Plus points of this place - Thai Chef's Dumplings - Great as appetizer but had too much pork than shrimp. French Onion Soup - Out of this world!! Best I've tasted so far. Pad Thai Veg - This was done well but was lacking the spice factor that my husband wanted. Pan Fried Shrimp with Rice - The shrimp with light garlic sauce was good too. On the menu was a special dessert - Red Cake Marinier Souffle which was the hot pick that night. It was rich, creamy and delicious end to a looong dinner. Ambience at front desk and one of the corridors is great. But then the tables look a bit cramped though. Negatives - The restaurant was short of staff, waiters took a long time to reach your table for placing the orders, the wait for each dish was so long that we were snoozing by dessert time (kidding!) We went by 7.30 and reached home by 11. Hope it was only the V day long wait.
