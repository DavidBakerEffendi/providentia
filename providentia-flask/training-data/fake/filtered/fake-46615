So disappointed today. I really love Chipotle.  Boloco in Burlington is the nearest place like it. Usually. Unfortunately today was not so good. Sales staff cheerful and friendly as usual. Having burrito delivered instead of a bowl and waiting for right order was no big deal. These things happen. However, the largest chunk of pork in my bowl was a gross, gristly piece of unchewable stuff. Being a passive sort,  I was eating around it and had decided not to bring it back because I usually enjoy the food there.  It was too bad to have that inedible ugly thing in the bowl, but  I could deal with it. Then a black shirt (?manager type) came to clear table next to me and asked how things were.  When he heard my description and saw my bowl, he asked what kind of meat it was. When I said pork, he nodded and said  they serve pulled pork .  .  .  this sort of thing happens. He told me the food at Boloco is good. That's it . No apology. ( not even a take no responsibility, "I'm sorry that happened." NOTHING) No offer to take the ugly thing away. NOTHING. It's not my job to train restaurant staff in customer relations, so I will vote with my feet.
