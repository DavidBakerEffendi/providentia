Ate here during restaurant week. Dishes were all delicious, service very attentive and atmosphere was energetic and fun. I'm gluten intolerant and the server was so accommodating. She brought sliced cucumber for the humus, instead of pita. They had a wonderful dessert with tahini and praline chick peas.
