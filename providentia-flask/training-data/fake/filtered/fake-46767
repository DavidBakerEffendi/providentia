OK...We spoke to the owner Matthew and guess what??  He's "The guy working the front", he's a really nice guy and DEFINITELY NOT incompetent. In fact his story is fairly remarkable. northjersey.com/news/115… It's obvious that our experience was just a fluke and we will absolutely be going back. Like I said, the food and the restaurant look incredible.  Based on all the other reviews I'm sure we won't be disappointed. UPDATE....UPDATE....UPDATE!!! We had dinner last night at Matthew's and I can't say enough GREAT things.  Matt was incredibly welcoming and made us feel very comfortable.  We had perfectly made large martinis at the bar which we finished at our table. Our server, Martine, is a very friendly, efficient and happily familiar face for us from his days at Bella Napoli.  It's great to connect with him again. Matt sent over an appetizer special that was incredible.  It was a stack of roasted (?) vegetables topped with mozzarella and surrounded by toasted pignoli nuts and a delicious balsamic reduction. Next we shared a delicious fresh seafood salad in a lemon vinaigrette dressing.  BTW, the bread is also fantastic. I had the highly recommended Filet Mignon with roasted potatoes, string beans and a red wine sauce.  I wasn't disappointed.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked (medium rare). My partner had a Surf and Turf special which was a NY Strip topped with 3 Jumbo Shrimp, Scampi Style over a bed of fluffy perfectly prepared mashed potatoes.  This was also delicious and perfectly cooked (rare in this case). Martine recommended a special Cabernet that was not on the very nice wine list which was the perfect accompaniment. We shared a dessert which was a special last night.  It was a delicious homemade Lemon Cake served with fresh whipped cream.  It was really good. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, Matt and his staff.  Get there as soon as you can.  We'll definitely be back soon. Thanks again for a great night. Michael
