I was just there tonight. I called before hand and was told a reservation was not needed. Â However, apon arrival I quickly realized I was uninformed as there was a waiting line pratically out of the door. Still, interested in dining, I chose to go in and leave my name with the hostess. The hostess was rude and very short with me and shot me a couple of un-pleasnt looks. I'm still not really sure why? lol But I chose to dine somewhere else. I have been a server, hostess, food runner, and resturant manager all in Montclair so I am very understanding when it comes to service and I know what it means to be working in a busy resturant. I have experienced the unpleasnt exchange with the hostess' of Cuban Pete's before and have still gone back despite the poor greeting service, however, tonight was my last straw. I will not dine where i don't feel welcome.
