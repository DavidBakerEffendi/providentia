This is not your average pizza. This is simply the best tasting pizza in Bayonne.  They use fresh ingredients a thin crust, and when they but it the box they add fresh Basil.  Which makes the drive home maddening, as the aroma fills the car.   I've had the margarita, and the wild mushrooms and onions. Can't wait to try them all.
