Wow,wow and double wow !!!! Unbelievable how great this restuarant is. I am afraid to Yelp about it because it may get to busy to feed me. I am a chicken parm person and how diiferernt can chicken parm be from restaurant to restaurant? Â Chicken parm here is amazing...I dont know what they did but they did it right. Lasagna was perfect and the backed clams were great. Believe me .go here you will love it. and also they have a harp player. All i could think of while watching it was of Harpo Marx playing one in "I love Lucy".
