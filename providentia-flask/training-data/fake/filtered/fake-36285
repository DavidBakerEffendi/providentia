Food is pretty good, but the frozen margaritas are awesome.  A great "inbetween" spot in that it's great as a standalone restaurant, or as a place to hang out in the evenings or weekends.  One of my fav spots in the city. They can sometimes get crazy busy so seating/service lags slightly but never had a bad experience.
