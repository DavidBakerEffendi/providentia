Absolutely love this place! I attended an alum performance at the Frank Sinatra School, and I'm so glad I found this place right around the corner when I needed a bite. The Arepas were different than anything else I've ever eaten, and ultimately delicious. Needed the food fast and they were prompt and friendly. Have returned with friends who all enjoyed their meals too. Great inexpensive lunch/dinner option in the area.
