- We were able to get a 7:30 reservation at  the Noodle Pudding this past Friday night and it was AMAZING!! For starters, the people there are just so wonderful. The waiter and the whole  crew were so fun and friendly! As for the food, WOW! I had chicken parmesan and my husband had the lobster special (a whole lobster with shrimp, mussels, and clams over pasta). Both of these dishes were amazing! I'm not a seafood person but my husband said that his dish was the best he's had. Just a wonderful dinner and we are looking forward to going back next month!
