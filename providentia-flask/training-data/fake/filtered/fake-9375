Tucked away far from the drunk Friday night bar hoppers of the West Village, this 28 seat restaurants is a hit. The charming pushed-tin ceiling and large windows on both sides will make you feel like you have left New york entirely. The staff is friendly and the food was fantastic. We ordered the meatball sliders (of course), the Soft Shell Crab special and the Pork Chop. Sliders are totally overdone, but these were fantastic. The Pork Chop was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was delicious. My favorite dish was the Soft Shell Crab. We had to order it, as they are in season. It was crispy on the outside with a moist interior. I could have ordered another. Will definitely be back!
