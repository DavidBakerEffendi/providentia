My review is for the Bahn Mi sandwhich and the Marscapone-Cheddar Mac and Cheese. Backstory: I used to get the Bahn-Mi from a fried chicken place in west philly that has since closed down. I've tried a few of the other fried chicken restaurants in philly and couldn't find one that I enjoyed as much as my old place. Based on the menu alone, I had high hopes for this place because the menu was similar to my old place. Review: The breading on the chicken at Wishbone is fantastic. They've managed to coat the chicken in a fairly thick and textured layer of breading without making the chicken dry or making the breading hard. The chicken was very juicy and flavorful. The home made sauce that they put on the bread was fantastic, not too spicy but enough to excite the taste buds. The flavor of the pickled vegetables was sweet and not to powerful, just accenting the flavor of the chicken and the sauce. All in all a great sandwich. The mac and cheese was had a strong flavor in the way that the sandwhich didn't. I could tell there were spices and other ingredients in it but I only got hints as they were overpowered by the cheesiness. It was a good cheesiness, but not my favorite. I still enjoyed it a lot, and its sold per pound, so next I just get less and still enjoy it a lot. Conclusion: Excellent sandwich. I'll definitely be returning to try their other sandwiches, and if I have room they had quite a few home-made turnover type pies that I wanted to try. The chicken is definitely better than my old chicken place but the pickled vegetables aren't; they weren't tangy enough. This place is still open though, so its got the number one spot on my list.
