Would NOT recommend ! This is our second time at this restaurant and both times our reservation was "lost". Although we had this experience the first time we gave it another try because the food was good. But 2 out of 2 is ridiculous. In addition the way our situation was handled was very rude and unprofessional by the hostess. After reading the other reviews I see this must be a practice of this restaurant for what reason I do not understand. But with hundreds of great restaurants in NYC why bother going here? They sure know how to ruin a night out!
