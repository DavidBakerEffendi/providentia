Wafa's is the benchmark for Lebanese food in NYC. This is the REAL deal and a must go to for anyone with a true appreciation and knowledge of how it's done right. Kudos to you Wafa- you have hit a home run with your absolutely authentic Lebanese food. It does not get any better than this from one of very few true Lebanese culinary purists.
