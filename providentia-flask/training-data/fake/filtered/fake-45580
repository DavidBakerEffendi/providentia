This place will make your head explode!  I guarantee it.  Forget that the restaurant is next to JFK, it is well worth the commute.  Just remember that this is a cash-only, no BS establishment, so walk in, be respectful, take a look at the menu on the big board, order and enjoy.  I can't say enough about this place.  I've noticed people being more lax in dress there lately, but I would recommend not coming in shorts and a t-shirt - lots of special occassions being celebrated there, so don't stand out!
