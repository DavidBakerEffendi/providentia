For the majority of my college years at UVM, I had the ultimate pleasure of routinely joining my friend and his family whenever they went out to breakfast at Penny Cluse.  Arriving hungry and hungover (so college, right?!), I would help myself to the extraordinary coffee and indulge in the many breakfast dimes they have on the menu. (the black beans and anadouille sausage scramble is bomb!) Let this review be extremely clear: Penny Cluse is one of the best breakfast places in Burlington and probably in New England.  Portion sizes are solid, ingredients are very fresh, service is routinely great, and the menu is creative enough to make you want to try everything on the menu, while still containing the more traditional breakfast plates. If you're visiting Burlington, get up early and beat the line.  It's well worth it.  But, if you wish to instead sleep in and end up eating an over-priced uninspired breakfast sandwich from City Market, that's cool too I guess...
