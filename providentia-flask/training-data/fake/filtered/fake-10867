I've been here a few times with family and friends since this restaurant open.  The service is excellent, the waiter and waitress are very attentive and always asking if there is anything else we need.  Pho Vietnam 78 décor is very nice compare to other Vietnamese restaurants in the city.  They actually have a train and tracks in the restaurant which looks pretty awesome.  We ordered different dishes to share (family style).  For appetizers, we ordered the fried eggrolls, fried squid (calamari) and the salt & pepper soft-shell crab.  All three appetizers were extremely yummy!  For entrees, we ordered the sweet/sour/spicy soup with shrimp, grilled pork chops, clay-pot satay fish, and an order of grilled beef roll wrapped in some kind of leaf with rice on the side.  Everything was very tasty and gooood!  This restaurant has just became my go to place for Vietnamese food.  Would recommend it to everyone.
