Okay, so this is where you come if you want the best breakfast in NYC.  Blueberry pancakes, huevos rancheros, BISCUITS, bacon, sausage-- it couldn't have been better (and the maple butter for the pancakes-- i'll have some more of that please, and by more, i mean fill a small bucket. Yes.)  The amazing food was matched by the best service I've had in ages-- Isamar couldn't have been sweeter or more helpful, and made me want to come back to CSBC as much as the bacon.  And that is saying a lot. Guys: go here.
