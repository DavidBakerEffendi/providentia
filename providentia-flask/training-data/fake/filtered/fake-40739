Bouley is one of my favorite restaurants, ever. The tasting menu is incredible. The dining area is very cool and super inviting and you feel intimate at once.   It feels comfortable and also elegant with candles and asian rugs strewn about. The luncheon tasting menu is fantastic with five divine courses of fancy, delicate French cuisine for $55. I highly recommend the foie gras,  and duck as they are some of the best dishes I've ever eaten. It's truly an incredible culinary affair, so allot yourself at least two hours to thoroughly enjoy your fine dining experience.  I definitely am looking forward to another delightful visit
