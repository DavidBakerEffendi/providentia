How refreshing for me to find this place.  I was surprised that there were more good looking women then men in this place given it's location.   I am new to town from Chicago via New York and if first impressions are any indication... I am impressed Philadelphia!   I liked the mixed up music tracks playing reminded me of sing-alongs on childhood roadtrips with my cousins when my uncles would drive us around in the convertable and play the music loud.   The food was spot on.  I sat at the bar and ordered a yuzu martini and thought it was banging and a good pour for ten bucks!  I talked a while with the bartender and he convinced me to stay for food.   I ordered a  glass of cabernet  for nine bucks that I also thought was a great value and drank well.  I had the Banh Mi sandwich that I read about in the paper a few weeks back at the bartenders suggestion that must be the best sandwich I have EVER had!!!   SO freakin good!  I loved the bread and the flavor of the meat and vegies... Although I was pretty much full I wanted to try some thing else... the shimp tacos cought my eye so I tried them too...  great little crunchy taco shells with some lettuce and rock shrimp tempura with spicy sauce that was perfect for me.   I rolled out for about $40 bucks full with a littel buzz... I will be go back soon to try some more food from the menu.   I have to say this is my first time "yelping" although I have looked here for suggestions before, I have never been driven to share my thoughts... maybe it was the drinks?  Maybe it was the food? Maybe it was the music that brought me back to a happier time...
