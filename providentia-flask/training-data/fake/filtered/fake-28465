My favorite brunch spot in Manhattan.  I adore this place.  The beer list is incredible if you're a fan of Belgian beers, the wine list is great, the omelettes are to-die-for.  I make it a point to go on weekdays for an early lunch, as weekends can be a bit hectic.  It's an out of the way location for a quiet meal for two.  And the specials are terrific!
