Absolutely fabulous! We're visiting NY from Oz and my step-sister recommended it - so glad she did! I had a special - the home made spinich fettuccini with wild mushrooms and white truffle oil. So simple but so delicious. The home made pasta was salted perfectly and just absolutely delightful and morish. The service was great, the ambience was lovely and the complimentary bread was delicious and very fresh and tasted homemade. The serving size was just right too - didn't leave me feeling stuffed or hungry. Definitely up in the top 5 meals of my life - can't rave about it highly enough!
