Oh Mundo, how I have missed you! I'm so incredibly happy to have you back and last night's dining experience made the 2 year wait worth it. The perfect, signature Red Sonya, the crazy delicious Veggie Wrap (who knew something so seemingly simple could be that amazing!), the ecclectic decor, and the attentive service will bring me back to Mundo over and over again. Though, admittedly, I should probably branch out and actually try some of the new things on the menu :)
