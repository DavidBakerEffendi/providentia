Waited an hour for my gryo.  It never came.  I got my money back and left.     This is not a restaurant; its a waiting room for nothing to happen.   If you are homeless and need to hang out somewhere inside, this is a great place.   If you want to eat food, go to a place that will bring you food- not here.
