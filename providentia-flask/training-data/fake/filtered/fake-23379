I am hesitant to give this place a review, because it is already hard enough to get a table.  But in the spirit of sharing a treasure found... here it goes.  First it is important to mention that every time I've come here it has been busy and they will not - absolutely positively - will not seat a partial group.  If you aren't all present you aren't sitting down.  I get around this sometimes by saying I am a party of one and then acting surprised to see the friend who comes to join me.  All kidding aside they have done this for me because they are super nice and the service is exceptionally good - but I had to promise to order and not sit and wait.   The atmosphere is perfect for a breakfast/brunch/lunch spot.  The bar is great if you are indeed dining solo and although it is crowded and a tight squeeze, once seated the other patrons are friendly and I always find myself striking up a conversation with my fellow diners.  If you like privacy and intimate seating arrangements this is not the café for you.  I have never been here for dinner so cannot tell you how it is when the sun goes down, but the food is so good I'm sure it is a great place for any meal.   The food... oh the food.  It is so fresh and so superbly seasoned.  I have tried almost everything and there's not even a moment of hesitation before a satisfied mmmm sound presents itself.  I am very partial to the artichokes.... Sometimes choosing 2 portions in my combination.  I like a selection so I love the tapas style market veggie menu and usually get a combo for the table to share and then get an egg entrée - mostly for the mashed potatoes.  I'm usually stuffed at this point but it is worth it.  Oh and did I mention the coffee... LOVE it!  Yep this place gets 5 stars... without a doubt!
