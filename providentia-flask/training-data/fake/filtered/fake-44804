This restaurant was highly recommended to me by a friend.  She said to request the spinach gnochi with the creamy tomato sauce.  It is BYOB and there is a wine store on Chestnut between 19th and 20th.  She said say hi to David and Steven for her!  Her name is Desiree and she is from Dallas too!  They are closed on Sunday evenings so I missed it on my last trip to Phili :(
