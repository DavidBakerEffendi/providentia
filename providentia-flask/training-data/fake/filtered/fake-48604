A pleasant experience indeed. My guy friend and I came here for the first time and was pretty excited as this place has great reviews! I love ramen and wanted to come here when Ramen King came to town but missed out. Either way, I knew I had to come for a taste to see what everyone is raving about. First off, the wait for this place is ridiculously long!  We waited for over an hour before being seated, and this was on a Monday night!  Imagine if we had came on a weekend, whew! Once seated, we were greeted by our server and beverages quickly came out. We ordered the Pork Hirata Buns which were DEliciousss.  Amazing flavors, I wanted more! We also ordered Hirata Chicken Wings.  They were also very tasty but I would take the buns over this any day!  Salivating as I recall the taste :D As for the ramen, I chose the Shiromaru Hakata Classic while my friend had the Karaka Men.  I love spicy food but was sick so I chose not to have anything spicy.   I was more than happy with my pick as it was soooo scrumptiously good.  I really love food and this place is probably one of my favorites now.  Although a bit pricy but to me, they were worth every penny...oh and even the long wait! ^_~; Ippudo, you will be seeing me again :D
