First Impressions: simple but confident in quality Outside appearance- Â nothing fancy or appealing to the eye Inside appearance- cramped, busy, cute Pros: great food for the $, fast courteous service once inside, restaurant has kept it's feel of authenticity, able to watch them make the pizzas, coal oven, quaint area under Brooklyn Bridge Cons: long line to get in, cramped inside, one restroom My story: I loved the authenticity. Frank Sinatra frequented this place! I went w my family. We had pizza & tried a cannoli. No one was disappointed or had anything bad to say. Waiting in line for the restroom, I was able to watch the pizzas being made. These guys have a system that works well. They make pizza slightly different from what I'm used to. But it was worth the differences. Servers didn't talk much but were courteous & quick. One of the employees there, seemed to be a manager of some sort, checked on us & asked how old our children were. He came back w free t-shirts for them. We topped off our experience w a few steps to the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory & views from under the Brooklyn Bridge. Going back there is a must & I'm making plans to for next year's trip.
