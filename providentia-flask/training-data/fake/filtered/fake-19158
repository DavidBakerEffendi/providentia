This steakhouse is a great place to get not only steaks Â and sushi and rolls but also very tasty desserts. There are two areas in the restaurant: the one with Hibachi and just a regular one. You might have to wait to get a table with Hibachi but it might be worth doing if you have a lot of friends / family and want to have an experience. Their menu offers a truly wide selection of suchis, rolls, noodles and pretty much you can think of. The downside is may be a waiting time. For us it tool more than half an hour to get food. Nonetheless, still good place to come by.
