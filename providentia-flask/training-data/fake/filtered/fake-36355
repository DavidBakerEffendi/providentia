I came here with my boyfriend a few weeks ago, and it was really one of the best restaurants I've been to in a while. Polenta with mushrooms - So good. The mushrooms are very flavorful and the polenta was creamy with tiny grits in it--really good texture. Short rib risotto - The meat fell apart as soon as you pierce into it--a sure sign that it's amazing. The risotto was perfect, al dente but not hard. My boyfriend actually smiled when he ate it, which is really a big deal for him. Duck foie gras ravioli - My boyfriend ordered this, and he really, really liked it. It was a little rich for me, especially with the marsala reduction. Spaghetti with tomato sauce and basil - This is by far the most famous dish from Scarpetta, but honestly, I can't believe it costs $24. I was expecting really amazing sauce, but it's quite plain. The money goes into the pasta, which does have a really nice bite and texture. It's a lot more dense than most spaghetti. Overall, still a good dish, but really overpriced for average tomato sauce. Lemon semifreddo - I think this was just okay. I was a little put off by the apple and lavender butter though--it has this strange bitter/sour flavor--but the meringues were nice. Coconut panna cotta with guava sauce - So, so good. The guava sauce is delicious. This is perfect for people who don't like coconut, since the flavor of the panna cotta is very mild; it doesn't taste too tropical. This was my boyfriend's favorite dish, which is saying a lot, since he doesn't like dessert in general.
