A visitor might not go to all the effort to find this place, but that's what I like to do when visiting a new city. Eat where the locals eat. So many choices, I am sorry I could only enjoy one meal. We were able to walk there from our hotel. They only take cash, but there is an ATM at the entrance. Keeps the prices down. So worth the hunt. Needed to walk back to hotel as I ate enough for two. I read a review where the person said the noodles seemed to multiple as she ate. I totally agree! Very clean and brightly lit.
