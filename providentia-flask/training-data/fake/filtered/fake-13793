We have eaten here a few times in the last couple of months and it continues to impress!  We ate out on the patio.  I had a huge salad with tasty shrimp, my husband had a buffalo chicken cheese steak on really fresh Italian bread.  My kids ordered a personal pie and vodka rigatoni which was delicious beyond belief...flavorful, cheesy and served piping hot.  Would highly recommend!
