Parc has always been one of my favorite restaurants in they city. I go there whenever I get the chance. I love the food, the atmosphere. The service is typically good, but I wouldn't go so far as to say stellar. Our server was less than fantastic on this last visit. I went to Parc for brunch just about a month ago. This is the first time I had been to Parc since realizing I had a gluten allergy eight months ago. I was very clear about this with my server. He helped me to pick something off the menu that was/could be made gluten free. After I left I had a reaction, so my food was definitely not free of gluten. I called the next day to inform the restaurant of my reaction. Not only to complain, but to let them know that they could be serving something as gluten-free when it was not. The manager in that day was very apologetic and assured me the GM would call me back the next day. I have not received a call back from the GM or anyone else from the restaurant. I will not be returning.
