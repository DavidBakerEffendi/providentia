I love pizza but Scott makes me feel like a rank amateur I had no idea of the world I was missing. The tour was so much fun and Scott was an amazingly knowledgeable and amenable guide. My pizza world has been blasted wide open and I will be evaluating my slices in a whole new way. Thanks so much Scott for a fun and delicious way to spend time with my extended family. We had a great time.
