Foodies pay attention, you Have to go here... Don't leave when you pull up because the place looks closed.  You will find some of the best food in the area at unbelievable prices.  Again, don't let the look of the outside deter you, go right in and let the friendly staff seat you anywhere you want to go and look to the "SPECIALS MENU" only, in my opinion.  I'm not saying that all the food isn't wonderful, but the specials menu is off the chart fantastic.  The appetizers are incredible and so are the desserts.  One catch, the chef who creates these spectacular dishes is not on the premises Tuesdays or Sundays, so try to work around that.   Yesterday I had a pesto shrimp appetizer with feta cheese, watermelon, cucumber and fresh dill and basil.  So yummy and refreshing.  My mom had the pierogi's which were the best Ive ever had (sorry New Britain!) and my mother in law had the Spanikopita which is served on a bed of Greek salad.  The pierogis could have been an entree it was so ample.  Dinner for me was the panko cod over a bed of spinach and mashed potatoes and a clam cream sauce.  PLEASE!!! This was so good I'm going back Monday and hoping its still on the SPECIALS MENU.  In case I haven't mentioned it, that is where all the magic of this place lies.....Trust me, you will be amazed at the food this place puts out, how little you'll spend for what your getting and you don't have to dress up!
