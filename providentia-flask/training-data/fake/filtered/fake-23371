My wife and I ate here for our anniversary last week based on great reviews here and other places. Nice ambiance and the staff could not have been nicer. To the food. I am a huge fan of olives and great Italian bread. This place did not disappoint on either - in fact, I used the olive oil in the plate of olives to dip the bread . . . For an appetizer, I had the mussels in a garlic tomato sauce. Wow!  THIS was amazing! The sauce had big chunks of perfectly seasoned tomatoes that actually put the sauce of my wife's main course to shame (see later). Try this - you will not be disappointed. For the main courses, I had the seafood risotto. This was really quite good, perfectly prepared. My only  complaint is that for the price ($32) it was mainly calamari, with much smaller portions of shrimp, scallops, etc. My wife had her Italian favorite - fruite de mare (seafood over angel hair pasta). This was a major disappointment; the sauce was very thin and frankly, there was not enough of it to properly dress the seafood. (This is where the sauce on my mussels would have been great!). Our server was polite and asked if we wanted another dish, but my wife declined. To their credit, they did not charge for the dish, and the person at the table next to us, who had ordered the same dish, asked for a side dish of sauce and some pepper flakes to spice up the sauce a bit.  I would hope that this was a momentary lapse in the kitchen, but a review below also spoke of this dish in unkind terms.  Perhaps it should be re-visited by the chef.
