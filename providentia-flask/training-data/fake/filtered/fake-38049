Went here for some drinks and some light dinner with a few friends. All I can say is: WOW. They are only a few days open and they've already established themselves as a mainstay in my dining habits. The food is high class pub food, wish some fascinating and delicious takes on hearty meaty dishes. The highlight for me, though, was the booze and pickled foods (obviously given the name) The selection of pickles, beers, and whiskeys (including a moonshine!) was incredible, and made sure I was left wanted to come back soon to try something else. This place is not to be missed if you're in the neighborhood!
