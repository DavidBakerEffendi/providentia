I am in the area for one night for work and decided to give this place a try based on the reviews.  Today was 5 for 5 tuesday, 5 tacos for $5!  Pretty good deal for $5.  The tacos had plenty of meat and the other ingredients also looked and tasted fresh.  The hot salsa is HOT!  Exercise caution with this salsa.  I am pretty good with hot stuff, but this salsa is tongue burning hot!  It does taste very good on the tacos, but it is pretty damn HOT!  Overall very good experience at a very reasonable price!
