The coal fired brick oven bakes an exceptional crust.As far as the  cheese(fresh mozzarella),there must have been a global shortage.I wasn't real fond of the sauce(gravy) either.As far as I'm concerned  @ $20 USD for a large pie they can kiss my you know what.You're better off with a frozen pizza. LOMBARDI'S SUCKS!Don't waste your money.
