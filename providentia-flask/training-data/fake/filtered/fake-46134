Horrible service with a rude waiter.  Food was mediocre and overpriced.  They will really hassle you if you dont have your entire party there when your table is ready and threaten to give your table away even when they make you wait over an hour.  After making us wait that long no need to give us attitude and threats.  Watch out for this place and dont buy into the hype.  You have been warned.
