Oysters=Fresh. Bone Marrow Appetizer=Amazing. Hot Fudge Sundae=Decadent. Absolutely love this place. Even though it's often pretty packed and sometimes a bit noisy, the food and service always make up for it. Pros: Open late High-quality, solid cuisine Consistently friendly and attentive service Great place to bring out-of-town guests Located in Park Slope, BK (Pro, if you're local) Cons: Can be pricey
