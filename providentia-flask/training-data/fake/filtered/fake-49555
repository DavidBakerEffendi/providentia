I completely enjoyed Zen from the comfortable atmosphere, the gracious service and the quantity and quality of the food. I am not a Miso lover; actually I despise it bc it typically tasted like dirty water and has the consistency of water.  I am so happy I chose to accept my Miso and was blown away.  It was so flavorful, (delicious not sewage tasting) and the hearty conistency was right on.  I was so excited to the next item which was the seaweed salad.  Not your typical, it was slightly creamy with chunks of raw tuna that melted in your mouth.  I love your typical seaweed salad equally but the way Zen prepared theirs with the creaminess and the tuna made me feel like I was getting the Star treatment. The Sashimi selection was so fresh and delicious and the rolls were bursting with flavors and textures that really made everything about the dinner enjoyable. I dined at Zen a few years ago and I remember loving it and saying "I have to go back here again".  I never did because it is somewhat out of the way for me, but got the opportunity to go with a group of peers and am so glad I did.  Now I find myself saying "I shouldnt go anywhere else for Sushi".
