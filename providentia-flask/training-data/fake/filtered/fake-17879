Been living in the area for 10 months and was looking for a real standout Thai Restaurant looking at reviews of Thai restaurants it seemed that Brookside Thai reviews where consistent on both food and service.When we got there we waited 10 minutes as they seem to clean the tables off as soon as available.Looking at the menu there was a huge selection with extremely diverse choices. we ordered  a couple of appetizers, spring roll and dumplings and arrived at our table quickly The appetizers where really tasty, my wife ordered a seafood dish which was as fresh as can be.Besides being a first at this restaurant the vegetarian selection was so enticing I ordered a dish with the spicy red coconut milk tofu,mushrooms and assorted vegetables and it was great.The icing on the cake with this restaurant  was the service which seemed to be family of the owner's really helpful and polite. A  must try and will be back often
