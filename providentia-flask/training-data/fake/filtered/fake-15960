This was once a good place to go for a burger and a beer but for the last few visits I have left disappointed. I am not one to wait over 15 minutes for a bottled beer and over an hour for a burger. The taste of the food has like the service declined. Weird flavors that don't meld well and blah tastes have made me decide that I need to find another pub to frequent.
