Yes.  I just found this place on the way to the ucb.  Punjabi food.  Got a thali like deal.  Man it was good.  Turned out to be quite a surprise.  Had an eggplant dish and a tofu dish, rice, roti, and yogurt.  The pickle was pretty kickin too if you can do it.  Good for taxi drivers and hungry people.
