When I first went to Crescent Grill 11/8/2013 I ordered the chicken and it was good, however 3 or 4 days later I ordered 2 orders of the chicken and I  was disappointed because I was served half cooked chicken and on the menu it states 1/2 chicken served with smashed yukon gold potatoes, angula, and heirloom tomatoes tossed in garlic infused extra virgin olive oil.  I got 1/2 cooked chicken and asparagus and mashed potatoes for $16.  Basically not well tasting chicken and regular mashed potatoes.  I honestly could  have done better at Boston Market for taste and price.  I did call to inquire "did the chef change"  and I was told no and when I asked about the change in my menu options I was told that certain things that were on the menu are now out of season. (Really)?.   Consistency is such an important ingredient in the service industry to acquire success.  I hope this restaurant recognizes this and inspects the quality of food prior to sending it out.  One time customers will not keep your doors open it will be repeat customers that will drive you to success.
