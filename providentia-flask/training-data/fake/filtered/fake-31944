I dined here couple of times in the past 6 months. I always share a salad and a large pizza; shroomtown house pie is amazing maybe because I like truffle oil and mushrooms. I cant be positive about the service. Â It once took me 20 minutes to place my order and get a cup of water. I also find this place to be dirty; tables are never properly cleaned before I am seated at them. I always ask them to re wipe the table and they simply wipe it with one disgustingly dirty cloth. Finally, my water glass and my fork once smelled really bad that I had to ask for new ones.
