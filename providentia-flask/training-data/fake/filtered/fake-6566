This place is wonderful! The atmosphere is really cool-very modern. If you go on a warm day there's outdoor seating, and they have Â floor to ceiling windows open in the front where there are a few tables also. The BET fried rice is amazing-pineapple, egg, & cashews-and it comes in a pineapple! The presentation is awesome! Delicious drunken noodle and pad thai. They have a huge menu so I will def. try something different next time. Drunken noodle is my fav., so I always go on the judgement of that. And the staff is prompt and friendly. Definitely will be returning
