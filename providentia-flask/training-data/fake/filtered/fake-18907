I don't get it. I really don't get it. I usually trust yelpers but wow... what the famous artichoke slice tastes like: cheap alfredo sauce mixed with cheese, spinach and artichoke. not bad, but not good either. To hold the massive amount of sauce and ingredients, they make the dough extra thick. i'm not a huge fan of doughy pizza. i didn't even finish the slice...which is a lot to say for me because i love pizza. the only pro is that for $4 one artichoke slice is a full meal so if you're looking for a cheap dinner...well there you go. so disappointed. i'm still saying yuck. ughhhh.
