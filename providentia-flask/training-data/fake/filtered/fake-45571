My family goes to this place whenever we have something to celebrate. We have ordered everything from Clam Sauce to Veal Don Peppe and even arthokes, and trust me, you can never go wrong! I've never had a problem with the waiters here. They are always very friendly and are more than willing to recommend a dish to you. The difference: when they recommend something to you, it is excellent food (unlike what I often hear when waiters recommend the worst food they have, just to sell it off). The price is very reasonable with a small group and downright cheap with a large group. When I had my confirmation several years ago, a group of 12 went to Don Peppe and had appetizers, pastas, entrees, deserts, and drinks (including some wine) for about $350 (less than $30 per person for drink, appetizer, pasta, entree, and desert=very reasonable). This price level is amazing, especially since it's one of the best Italian restaurants in New York City. When I'm in the restaurant, it's usually for lunch. Therefore, I can't attest to how crowded it gets. However, with this level of food quality, it is definitely worth the wait. There are a couple of things to keep in mind before entering into Don Peppe. First, they only accept cash! They don't accept credit cards!!! Second, the menu and menu prices on the wall don't necessairly correspond to what they actually have and for the price they are offering. I considered knocking Don Peppe down a star for its dated decor. A couple of things changed my mind on this. First, the great food at a reasonable price more than makes up for the decor. Second, I noticed a Joe Montana signed autograph on the wall, with the autograph saying that he really enjoyed the food. To me, this cool piece makes up for decor issues. If it's good enough for Joe Montana, it's definitely good enough for me!
