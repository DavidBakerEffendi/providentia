I'm fairly new to Jersey City and I have been on a personal mission to seek out new and interesting places to eat.  I went to Carmines based on the 2 reviews b4 mine and they were absolutely right.  This had to be one the best sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Sandwich: Grilled Chicken Fresh Mozzarella roasted red peppers balsamic Vinegar on Garlic Bread Tell em Mike sent you !!  Who knows maybe they'll name the sandwich after me :-)
