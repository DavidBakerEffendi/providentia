This is a really terrific and unique Thai restaurant, I eat there often. The Thai Steak is my favorite, just-the-right spicy, very tender and served with scrumptuous scallion mashed potatoes -- a nice Thai twist! I also love that they have different specials every week, like the best Won Ton soup I've ever had, it's a complete meal in a bowl! Every weekly special is something new and different, never a disappointment. Â Great service , great prices and nice neighborhood feel...
