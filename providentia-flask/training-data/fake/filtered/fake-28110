Very delicious Olives appetizer with perfectly baked bread. The most delicious South African Shiraz for $16 dollars a glass. Four stars because of service, even though it wasn't busy an late, Â the waitress rushed us with the check, as soon as we were done with our meal. The bartender is great. I would recommend this place for people who wants to finish their day with good glass of wine.
