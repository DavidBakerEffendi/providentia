As a group we have lunch here almost every Thursday. Today 8/15/13 I had a Cheeseburger. While it was good within an hour I was having severe stomach distress. I called the Manager to alert him of a possible problem and he basically blew me off saying we don't have any problems. Not good customer relations.
