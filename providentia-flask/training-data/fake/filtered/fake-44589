Ate at the bar and was not impressed in the least bit. The food is solid, nothing mind blowingly great, but good and not worth the lacking attention to the guest experience. What really soured the experience was the service. Bartender seemed unwilling to talk about the food and make suggestions, even when I asked directly for his opinion. Sometimes you want to be sold, you want to hear someone talk to you about the food and the bar, apparently is not the place to feel taken care of. I would be willing to overlook that, however when we weren't given water after it was clear we were there to eat..? I had to grab a barback to ask for water half way through the mains and it was never refilled. No one checked in with us, to see if we liked our meal. I was waiting for someone to ask if I wanted a glass of red with my duck, nope. And after finishing our mains, we sat there considering dessert, but when not one of the three bartenders gave us a menu, just seemingly ignored us until we just flagged one down for the check. Don't they realize they could have made more money by being attentive?? Â Upon leaving, not one person, from the four hostesses, couple mangers to the three bartenders said 'Good Night" or even tried to look our direction.. To me that is a deal breaker. It is inhospitable to turn your back on your guests as they leave and not say anything. With all the hype about this place, it seems to me they've still got a lot to learn about service - this is New York and there are lots of great restaurants so step it up. Saying good night to your guests and asking about their meal is BASIC. Service and lack of hospitality was the deciding factor for me that I will never go back and I will not recommend it to anyone. Ever.
