Please try her Hung Lay curry. I've never had anything like it and it was pure heaven. That is, if you like rich porky brothy stew that melts in your mouth kind of heaven. I went there with a girlfriend and after devouring the Thai burger and Hung Lay Fried Rice for lunch we ordered curry mussels, too. We couldn't get enough. Hong, the owner, sent over lychee and mint shakes as a complimentary service to us for our gluttony. To finish off our 2 hour lunch we had the jasmine panna cotta. I normally don't like panna cotta, but the jasmine was addictive and fragrant and not too sweet. Hong is a pure genius when it comes to creative recipes. Muah!
