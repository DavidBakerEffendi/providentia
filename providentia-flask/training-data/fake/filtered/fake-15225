Day by day used to be a great place for brunch.  I ate at this restaurant for 3-years, and the food was always above average and the waitstaff treated me pleasantly.   However, I will never visit again.  I am extremely disappointed by managements mistreatment of regular customers and display of rude behavior.  Management pretends to take "call-ahead" reservations, however they do not honor the requests.  I have waited in excess of 1-2 hours at this restaurant far too often.  There is simply no reason to spend multiple hours at this restaurant waiting for a simple egg or bagel for breakfast.  The kitchen staff is beyond over-worked, and management makes no apologies or effort to be cordial. I am sad to say that Day by Day is no longer a friendly and quality option for brunch.  Instead of bringing your business to this distasteful experience, I would recommend other terrific local brunch options such as: Honey Sit and Eat, Sabrinas, Green Eggs, Sidecar.  Perhaps, under new management, or with a change in management affect, this restaurant can one-day resuscitate the previously good experience it once provided to neighborhood residents.
