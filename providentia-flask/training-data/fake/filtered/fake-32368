Lots of mixed reviews; wasn't sure what to expect.  But the menu was delicious and as a vegetarian I was pleasantly suprised to find a lot of good, seasonal veggie dishes on the menu.  The decor is amazing and the place has the vibe of both a neighborhood spot (does everyone here know each other???) and a good place to take out of town friends  you want to impress.  The best part was being able to see into the kitchen--an intimate peek you don't get in a lot of places around here, where you can't tell if your food is being scraped off the floor or what.  The drinks menu is fun and funny, the wine list delish and I'm not going to complain about the prices because each dish was beautifully prepared with lots of delicate touches.  What's great it that is seems like the menu rotates around a few tasty standards (I won't eat it, but the burger looks deeeeelish and juicy, and the french fries are spot-on), but the specials follow the trends in the market.  What that means is that if I go in more than twice a month, I'm still pleasantly suprised by various menu options.  Oh! and the creamy corn dish is to die for.  I could eat that morning, noon and night.
