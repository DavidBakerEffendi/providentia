As good as they say. Absolutely stellar selection of sauces you won't find anywhere else. A vast menu crammed with bizarre combinations and fun reinvented classic sauces. It would be downright criminal if Pommes' fries didnt hold up to the quality of their dressing, but thankfully this is not the case. Cooked nicely, crisp all around. A perfect example of NYC hole-in-the wall excellence. One of Saint Mark's shining stars, with a commanding presence late-night.
