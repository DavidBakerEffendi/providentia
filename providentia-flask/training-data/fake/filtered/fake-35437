This is my go to late night spot! As someone who works late at a restaurant myself, I find myself very limited when going out to eat after work. I appreciate that is place is open very late and I beat that normal dinner rush. I just have to learn to order less food, I simply want everything on this amazing menu and always leave with a huge doggie bag.
