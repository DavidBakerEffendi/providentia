My firend and I were walking around looking for a place to eat and decided to try it, looked like a cute interior and menu was good. It got super crowded after we arrived, but the salads were good and had a yummy lobster asparagus crepe. The dessert was also delicious, peanut butter chocoloate pot du creme with rasberries. We had two appetizers, two salads, and dessert and was $70. Not cheap but not super expensive. Good service too. I'd go back.
