I am writing this in response to a post from Christopher R. from Middletown, who dined at Rizzuto's this past Saturday evening. It is obvious that Christopher does not understand what Rizzuto's is all about. For example, the described 'hunk of bread' is actually Terranova bread that is brought in daily from Arthur Avenue, NY. It is NY's favorite Italian bread, crusty, chewy and fabulous. Our customers love it, especially dipping it into a simple marinara sauce (maybe Christopher prefers cheap olive oil that is offered virtually everywhere else). Based on his comments, it sounds like there was nothing we could do to please him and he just did not care for the specific dish he ordered, which was a blackboard special and sold well all weekend receiving many customer raves. While I am glad he recognized that Rizzuto's uses fresh ingredients and has great people working there, I would add that having spoken to the manager with whom he interacted, it is incredible that she nor anyone else there would make him feel that our kitchen is weak. I suggest people look at real objective feedback from diners on Open Table, who are the most sophisticated and experienced customers. Look at the other Yelp reviews as well and you will see that Rizzuto's food quality ranks top among restaurants in the same bracket - that is feedback you can trust, not the one-off opinion from someone who found Rizzuto's style not to be his cup of tea, and decides to tell the world to 'stay away'. Hope we get to serve you all! Bill Rizzuto, Owner
