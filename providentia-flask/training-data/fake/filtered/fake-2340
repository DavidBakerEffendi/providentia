Given all the hype surrounding this place, I'm sort of surprised to find my review wants to be a bullet-point summary, but it does. Though a number of things tickled my fancy, I just didn't think it was that great. - Service, fabulous. Servers were polite, personable, efficient, forward when needed, and hung back when needed. They worked us into a tight schedule, they were all really fashionable but didn't put on airs about it. Class act. - Decor, an experience. The combination of the delicate and the rough-hewn, uniquely mirroring the offerings of the furniture store, was a treat in itself. - The food, unremarkable. Lentil soup tasted like lentils and kale had been put into a soup. Arctic char melted in my mouth, just like it does everywhere else in the five boroughs. Broccoli and Parmesan were delicious, even though the chef brazenly replaced pine nuts with pistachios in this completely foreseeable and not-exciting twist on an old favorite. Rhubarbs in some kind of sauce for dessert. What can I possibly say about this that you are not already thinking. And Â f i n a l l y, - The price, -- $135 for two. Again, uniquely mirroring the furniture store of the same name, which will straight-facedly charge $30 for a candle, the restaurant brandishes its overconfidence in vulgar numeric fashion, and this transgression shall not stand. The restaurant analogue to the furniture store's window shopper, sadly, is the diner who does not come back. I am that diner.
