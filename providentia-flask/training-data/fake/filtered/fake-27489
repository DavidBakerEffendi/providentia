They have the BEST spumoni ice cream!! I'm not a huge fan of their pizza and the dining room is big but it gets crowded. I gotta say the service was pretty good, the last time I was their our waiter was really nice and helpful. I don't know about the food but I definetly would recommend to go there for dessert.
