I LOVE this place! I've been to Sugar Freak three times now - twice for dinner and once for brunch - and it is always delicious. Plus the servers are very nice, which is always a plus for me. The first two times I went the music didn't seem to fit with the vibe of the place (they were blasting top 40 pop when it seemed more like the sort of place that might play zydeco or some other southern roots to set the mood), but this last time they had lowered the volume of the music and were playing rock and zydeco. It was fun and felt like more of an "experience". Definitely worth a visit - if you care about music or not!
