stopped into sea fire grill for dinner and everything was excellent!! a friend and I got the oysters Rockefeller and they were incredible.  but the best part of our experience was our server, Besfort.  He was so attentive and gave us great suggestions.  We felt very welcomed and will definitely be back again soon!
