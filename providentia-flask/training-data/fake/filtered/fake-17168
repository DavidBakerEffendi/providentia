I love this restaurant! Their fresh baked bread is absolutely delicious and the service is always fantastic--servers super friendly and upbeat. I made it in for one of their newly started Friday lunches and the owner was going from table personally checking in on his patrons' experiences. I definitely recommend this place-- steaks are good, chicken's good, and while I don't eat pork, my friend raves about the ribs too. Seriously generous portions and reasonable prices. If you're in the area, give it a try!
