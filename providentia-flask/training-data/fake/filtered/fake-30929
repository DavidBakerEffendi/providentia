My husband and I dined on the patio at Jimmies this past weekend. There was a 30 minute wait so we decided to sit at the patio bar until our table was ready. We ordered 2 cups of the Crab and Corn Chowder while waiting for our table, and it was delicious. For dinner, I had the lobster roll platter and my husband had a whole belly clam platter. The food was delivered rather quickly, but it was great! I had the lobster roll last summer and it wasn t the best I had, but it seemed they have since improved the lobster meat they are using because it was filled with huge chunks (mostly claw meat). The whole belly clams are always a must get for my husband...he has never once been disappointed. I definitely recommend Jimmie s as the food and view are spectacular! We will be returning before the end of the summer so that we can sit outside once more.
