I typically eat Cantonese food, but love spicy (Capsaicin spicy) and Szechuan food in general also.  The Szechuan food here is hands down way better than anything near metro Boston.  I would definitely go here a lot more often if only it weren't in the middle of CT.  I guess I know where I would be scheduling my pit stops in the future. Simply outstanding Chinese food, but with the heat level dialed down to better suit the general palette.  This might perhaps be a negative for heat seekers, but a definite plus for the majority of people.  The food is so good that I don't miss the heat.  I would trust the chef to prepare the food however he thinks is best.
