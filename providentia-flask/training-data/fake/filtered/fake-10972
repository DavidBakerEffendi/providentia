if i could give 0 stars i would. took them two hours to get me the food and when they did, half of my order was raw uncooked and cold. When i called them back they asked how rare the chicken i ordered was as if i should eat it still. Raw is Raw. they said they would take care of it and call me back. they never called back. i tried calling 20 minutes later to no response. Thanks for the help king Taste ill never order from you again and a health inspector is heading ur way soon
