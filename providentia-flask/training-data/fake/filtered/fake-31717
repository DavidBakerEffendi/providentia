If you don't understand The Happy Rooster for what it is then you probably wouldn't enjoy it. It's a tiny martini bar before they became cool. It's like an early  Playboy magazine idea of where executives and lawyers, at the very end of their careers,  would go to have a scotch-the-rocks or two or three before catching the R-5 home. Take your secretary here for lunch for her birthday if she is a little too New Jersey for the Union League. If you have gobs of inherited money and a pile in Haverford, do you really care how much the appetizers cost? Superb place to get quietly smashed afer work. Just don't forget your briefcase on the way out. And the sidewalk on 16th st is really narrow- especially after a few stiff ones.
