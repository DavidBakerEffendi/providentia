Here is the place everyone should go for fresh oysters and desert!:) of course you should try entrees too, but those 2 things that I mentioned me and my bf love the most. The stuff is always nice and if you are lucky and know the manager he may even sit to the table right next to the door when the place is packed. We would always opt for that table if there is not other way to get one.
