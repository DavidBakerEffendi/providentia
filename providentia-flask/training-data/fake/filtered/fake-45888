Have been to The Brothers Moon twice and will certainly return. The first time was for a work dinner party for about 25 people (which I organized and got lots of kudos for picking such a great place - lucky for me)! Beth from the staff helped me pick out the menu for the party. We started with a mediterrean platter and an assorted cheese platter. Both were delicious. Then gave people a choice of an amazing mushroom risotto, quail, hangar steak or salmon. Everyone seemed to really enjoy thier meal and the "icing on the cake" was an assorted dessert platter (best lemon bars ever)! I recently returned to celebrate some friends' birthdays and got to sit outside this time. Was truly a treat!
