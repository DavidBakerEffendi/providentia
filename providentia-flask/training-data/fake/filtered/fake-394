I've grown to like Pat's more than Geno's over the years but there are definitely better steak spots in Philly than what is offered at 9th & Passyunk.  Still, there is a cool thing about being able to grab a greasy, cheesy steak sandwich at any hour.  It's worth checking out once just to do it, but once you've experienced this tourist spot look into other steak places, there are plenty cheaper and higher quality all over Philly.
