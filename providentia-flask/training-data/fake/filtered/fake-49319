Vin et Fleurs is a perfect local place in Soho that happens to be a rare find. Great attentive service, wonderful food and terrific ambiance. The waiter recommended an excellent value wine that was worth double the price which is also rare for NYC! We started with the mussels (and clams) in white wine sauce which was a 10 out of 10 as was the asparagus salad with poached egg. Our osso bucco entree was a 8 out of 10, but that's still pretty darn good. I recommend for sure and i bet you will agree!
