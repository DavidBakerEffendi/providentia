The most overrated restaurant in the world.  For the price, you would wonder if the restaurant had actually trained their staff in the art of customer service.  The greeter / receptionist and waiters had an attitude that was reserved for the snotty stuff you see in the movie Pretty Woman.  DO NOT go here unless you'd want to have your money robbed off you with service better in a fast food chain than in this place.  The waiter was slamming coffee cups and saucers in the mad rush to shoo us away from this place.   I've had better food in five-star hotels at half the price.  The overrated spaghetti tasted like mashed potatoes as it was clearly undercooked.
