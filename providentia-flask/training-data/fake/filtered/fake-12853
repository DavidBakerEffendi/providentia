Ok so at first we were a little nervous about this place cause this it is located in a hotel.... But this place is unbelievable! We got the Notali 5 pizza and lasagna. All the pasta is made in house. Â Staff is extremely friendly. Must get the wings! Ask about weekly specials. Happy hour everyday. Menu very well described.
