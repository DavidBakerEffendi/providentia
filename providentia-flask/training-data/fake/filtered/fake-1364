The Pines is among the best restaurants I have been to in a long while. The dishes and flavor combinations are unique and creative. Even when they missed for me on a personal level I could see the intent to push the envelope and create new and exciting flavors. I have not written a Yelp review before and was inspired to sing the prices of the Pines after my recent meal there. Everyone should try this place , it is something special.
