Digusti g frozen pizza dough. Unclean rest and staff hangs out at the bar. Owner is rude and arrogant. If u truly want a good pie that tastes like authentic new haven apizz trVel a litt.e ways up the road to abates...absolutely delish. I actually gave renls good reviews in the past simply because their staff was excellent. But boy has it gone downhill...go to abates!
