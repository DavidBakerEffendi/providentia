Food was okay, though the ceviche didn't taste that fresh, and some of the sides were a little ... weirdly placed? They weren't bad, but didn't necessarily complement the main course either. My issue is with the service. I'm normally not picky. I tend to dislike yelpers who seem to be nitpicking about service. My rule is accept a place on its terms, and if the food is good, its worth it, but this place was problematic. First, it seems like a take out joint, so I'd expect the food to be served somewhat quickly. I ordered, and the woman (who seemed a bit confused in general) told me 10 minutes, which was fine. After I'd waited half an hour, I asked how long, and she told me the ceviche wasn't ready yet. Aside from waiting half an hour after being told to wait for 10 minutes, it didn't make sense that the ceviche was slowing things down, since it's supposed to marinate for a few days. All in all, weird experience, and the food, while not terrible, wasn't worth it. If you're going to order from there, call in advance.
