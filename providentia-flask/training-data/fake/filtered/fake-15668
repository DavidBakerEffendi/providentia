The pizza is really really good, the salad is really good, but lets face it....its pizza!  plus they talk the progessive, hippy talk but the owners are still rich bosses that fire people unmercifully.  They always talk about how good they are doing for the community when they are really just yuppie liberals.  Again the food is really good but i just hate hypocrites.
