This Chinese restaurant has improved over the years.  Now there is an All You Can Eat buffet  for a low cost. They have General Tso's Chicken, Vegetable Fried Rice, Boneless Spare Ribs, and more. Every time I go, it's always clean and organized. Their lunch specials run from 12 to 4, and you can pick any rice you like with your order. I suggest anyone to try their food out and enjoy!
