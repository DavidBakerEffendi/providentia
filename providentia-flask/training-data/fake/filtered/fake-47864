Ate here and got food poisoning from chicken pasta.  Completely miserable experience.  Will never go back.  I called the restaurant to let them know as a public service so they could look into it.  Manager claimed they would investigate and follow up with me the next day.  I never heard back from them.  They were probably afraid they'd have to comp me for my overpriced bill.  Dinner for two was about seventy dollars WITHOUT any alcohol or dessert.  I wouldn't eat here again even if they paid me.
