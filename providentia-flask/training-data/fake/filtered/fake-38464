Bought a Groupon and visited the restaurant on 8/15/14. The restaurant was very nice, newly renovated, great atmosphere and the waitress was very sweet and attentive. The Food was delicious and the juices were fresh . I was amazed Â how much we received for a Groupon, appetizer, two main courses including salad and drinks(non alcoholic). I would definitely recommend and look forward to attending this restaurant again. :)
