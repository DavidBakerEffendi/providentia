The Philly Cheese Steaks were really good.  I had a BLT myself and my sister & nieces had the Philly but I did take a bite and it was one of the best I had tasted.  Now the drink "Gremlin" was awesome.  We all had the Grape/lemonade one and that's what it was called.  I would recommend Ishkabibbles.  There were 2 locations.  The one that David B. mentioned in his review was the walkup to order with only a few chairs, but about 2 blocks up from it was the restaurant one with Air Conditioner and a lot more tables.  ***** ( 5 stars)
