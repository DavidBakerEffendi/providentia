The chicken mushroom dish was ok, pasta with white sauce was good, but the AMAZING squid ink pasta with assorted seafood more than made up for the other dishes. Â I've come back many times for the seafood pasta dish and the great quality is pretty consistent. Def get a reservation before you go, else the wait might be long.
