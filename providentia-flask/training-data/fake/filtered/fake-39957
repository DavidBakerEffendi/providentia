Actually I've been ordering and getting really very good food from Golden. One thing I've recently noticed was that the food tasted even better than usual. This is my "go-to" Chinese take out. I really don't care about the seating. We lived in Hong Kong for 9 years and this comes close to what we had there - when it comes to takeout. It's a great deal!
