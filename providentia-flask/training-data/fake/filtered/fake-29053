My parents are from Cambodia but ethnically we're Chinese- like a previous yelper who reviewed this place. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about real Cambodian food which is why this place is just so disappointing on multiple levels. Rather than getting to the heart of Cambodian cuisine, it tries so hard to dress it up into something its not.   Cambodian food is actually quite tasty and not all that expensive to make which is why I don't understand why they'd rip you off  and make portion sizes so small Nothing about this place is authentic or impressive. In fact, I find it hard to even find anything that's traditionally Cambodian on the menu. We're in Manhattan and while we love to over glorify things sometimes- we still appreciate places that keep things authentic.
