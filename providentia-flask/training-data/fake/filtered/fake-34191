Yasuda may have great sushi, but the stench from their total lack of class has overshadowed their food, and turned me permanently away from this restaurant.  My wife and I had a reservation on a Monday night, and when we showed up with our two year old son, we were emphatically told no children, and that we no longer had a table and were turned away.   They waved us off like solicitors without apology.   Any family should find this utterly classless.  Shame on Yasuda and its owners.  It is not as though this is a $400 a couple romantic restaurant.  Families that value family life, should send a message against this trifling behavior.
