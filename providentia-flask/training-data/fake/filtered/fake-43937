I found this cafe restaurant three weeks ago and have been here more than 7 times! Guess this place breaks my record in NYC!!! I tried CC' egg wrap, house wrap, three soups and one sandwiches...everything is amazing. Hummus is the best I have ever tried so far! they also got good wine & desert! You have to try the carrot cake!!! Chef Thomas(sorry if I spell wrong) prepares food with his heart and trust me you'll feel it. Place is cozy, service is excellent, price is reasonable. I am leaving New York in a month. This is my first yelp review and maybe the last. I will definitely miss the food here.
