I've been to Metro North many times for dinner and have always had a great experience. The food is incredible and there are always interesting specials. Last night I had a fennel salmon plate that was cooked perfectly. My husband LOVED the seasoned chicken. The service was attentive, as always. We finished with some drinks at the bar. The cucumber martini was tasty and my husband tried a couple of micro brews on tap. We are pretty much regulars now. A++
