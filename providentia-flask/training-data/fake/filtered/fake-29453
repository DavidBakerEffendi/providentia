Great Meeting Place, Okay Food. As a graduate of JFK High school, we would always raid the Galaxy Dinner after late night Play rehearsals and parties. It was quick and easy to get to and the food was decent. The prices are a little high for a dinner, but the foods ok. Most desserts there are very good! The staff is very friendly, but there are the select few that you don't want. I would recommend it, but don't go out of your way to try it.
