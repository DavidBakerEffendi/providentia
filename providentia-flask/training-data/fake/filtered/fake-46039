Brought my family here for dinner and we were thoroughly stuffed before our entrees arrived. The servings for their appetizers were actually enough to be a considered a meal. They also served us a generous amount of bread. I tried their ribs with sweet and spicy tomato sauce and it was so delicious. It was actually a new taste I have never had before. I usually do not deviate from the more familiar tastes, but this was a great new discovery for me. I am eager to return here for this same treat or perhaps go on another adventure with their menu. We arrive at the restaurant at seven in the evening on a Friday and we were able to get a table for four without any wait. The other popular Greek restaurant across the street appeared to have a much longer wait. This place is certainly worth trying if you appreciate Mediterranean foo.
