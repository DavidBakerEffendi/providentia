Pros:    Sauce Cons:    $30 pie    Pizzeria interior is filthy    Regular pie has too much cheese    Crust is terribly unimpressive    Overloaded with olive oil I can't believe the reviews this joint gets.  If this place was a neighborhood pizzeria and sold pies for $12-$15, maybe.  Putting Di Fara on the same list as the NYC pizza greats is really shocking and a tragic mistake.
