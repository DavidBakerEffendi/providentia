This was our first time visiting Samba. We were so glad we decided to give this restaurant a visit. It's a really nice place! Love the decor and vibe. Great service.  Perfect for a date. The food was yummy. My BF, who is a health nut, was very happy to see they serve most of their entrees with veggies. The tables are a bit small and close together but the atmosphere still felt intimate and romantic. Reasonably priced.  The best part = its BYOB.  There is a liquor store on the same block (incase you forget or need more wine during dinner).  I had the Salmon (in mango sauce, with rice, and mixed veggies), very good. My BF had the flank steak with veggies. He liked his dish as well. We didn't get to try dessert since we were on a tight time schedule. (Tip: AMC Essex Green movie theater is about 10 mins away).  The area itself is really cool. There's a Urban Outfitters about a block away so we were able talk a walk after dinner and enjoy some shopping.  We will def be back soon! We love it!
