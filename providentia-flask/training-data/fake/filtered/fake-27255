This place was not good. I brought one of my employees, Madeline, here to commend her for doing an excellent job on a project she did for me. This was supposed to be the "best in town". But when you wait 35 minutes to get in when 6-7 tables open @ all times, that is just ridiculous. That is not a busy restaurant, but poor management. Further, we waited another 30 minutes to get our food. It was as if we didn't matter at all. No longer will I go there for business dinners or even casual dinners.
