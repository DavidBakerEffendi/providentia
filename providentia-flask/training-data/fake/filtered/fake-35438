I have been going to this restaurant since I moved to Astoria back in 2001.  The food is delicious.  The staff are the best.  Vinnie is a host there, and he will assist you with anything you need. Rocca is the owner/chef and what a chef!  The food is delicious, and his hospitality is superb.  Rocco comes out and talks with his costumers, and is just super friendly.  They once gave me a bottle of wine because I was such a good costumer. Love this place.
