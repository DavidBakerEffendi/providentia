Food and drink here tonight was great--had a decadent meal with the 5 vegetable plate and rillette and all was homey, rich and well-executed, as the food around me also appeared to be (burgers w shoestring fries looked yummy and popular) but this is largely a shout out for the upstairs bartender, Alex, who does a fab job--both as a craftsman and a host. Was traveling alone and had high recommendation from a very picky sibling that this was 'must do' so made a special trip here to eat dinner on my last night in NYC. Laid back vibe here but crowded which meant no tables so headed up to the 2nd floor bar. Not only did Alex make me two of the best 'spot on' cocktails I've ever had, he steered me to the perfect IPA and was very helpful in ordering dinner (as well as eating it, since he gave me a tip to mix the rillette so I didn't get a mouthful of duck fat instead of pate) Clearly, he cares about/has a passion for his work and I also observed him to take care of other parties around me in the same way and going the extra mile to give customers just what they wanted--even when that took quite awhile to tease out of them. I had a fabulous dinner where I felt relaxed and personally attended to (thx for the history lesson about Chartreuse btw!) despite dropping in on a very busy Sunday night. I even left with the exact recipe for my favorite drink--yay! Alex is a real gentleman and great at what he does--bravo to him and know that the bar upstairs is a fine place--perhaps even the best place--to spend your evening here.
