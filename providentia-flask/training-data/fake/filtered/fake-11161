In from L.A went last week and loved the ravioli with ricotta and spinach in a lemon sauce. The grilled radicchio salad with currants and pine nuts was also fab. We went back tonight and it the experience was so different. Tonight the same salad was too salty and burnt and I had to return the pizza because it was soggy and burnt. When I asked for another pizza the waitress said that this is how it is and suggested I get a pasta. When I told her I was here last week and the pizza was not soggy and burnt she looked surprised. I ordered a different pizza with different toppings and what was delivered was the same pizza that I originally ordered. I said don't you remember I ordered a different pizza based on your suggestion and she apologized. She returned it to the kitchen. Next the same pizza was delivered again...truly remarkable. Finally got the pizza I ordered and it was a 1 on a 10 scale. The people next to us were really unhappy too. The waiter that served us the pizza was super rude. Two busboys were wonderful and saved the day...brothers, Samba and Souke. Brought us cheese, napkins and pepper. Extremely rude staff in the pizza section. I enjoyed the gelato and overall shopping experience but will not return to eat there.
