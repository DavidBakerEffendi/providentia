I ordered sushi here and it was terrible.  I actually felt like the fish was bad, I felt sick after one bite and had to throw the entire roll out.  Not only did I feel this way but the person who ordered with me had to throw hers out as well because she felt hers was awful too.  When we called to let them know their fish may be bad and asked for a refund, I received nothing but attitude and rudeness.  We received no sort of compensation.  I will never go here again and recommend it to no one.  I eat sushi all the time and never have I had such terrible non-eatable sushi.
