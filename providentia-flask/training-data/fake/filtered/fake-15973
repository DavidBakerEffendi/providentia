I have been going to the Tavern for a long time and if it's consistent with anything, it being mediocre. The menu has not changed in forever which implies that the chef is not creative or they have no chef. The food is typical bar good, over salted, rarely prepared as requested and unimaginative. You'd think for $10 you'd get a super burger. The manager they hired seems incredibly non customer service oriented. The bartenders, except for Kevin, are surly or totally devoid of personality. I had an issue 18 months ago that the "owner" who looks like he gets in everyone's way rather than help, promised me a compensatory gift certificate. I'm still waiting. There is good ambiance but don't go expecting great or friendly service or food nor great value.
