My girlfriend and I decided to check out the place after heard good things about this place. We ordered 3 crepes in total; Lychee valentine, Crepe dog and Azuki green tea. I would recommend the Azuki since the rest aren't really impress me at all. The crepes somehow come different in standards, the Azuki green tea that is made by the Asian lady who assumed to be an owner impressed us right away.  On the other hand, the other two crepes that made by the employees come out much smaller in size as well as the crepes weren't cook well at all. Overall, it is a good place if you have a chance to visit Soho and want to grab something while hanging around.   PS It would be better if they could train the employee to make the crepe at the same standards.
