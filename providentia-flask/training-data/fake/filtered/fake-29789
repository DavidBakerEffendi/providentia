Went here for the first time over the weekend.  Lived in williamsburg for years but rarely ventured into Greenpoint. I have to say I am a HUGE fan of the lobster claw spicy bloody mary.  The lobster eggs benedict was delicious, but sadly accompanied by a over dressed yet bland salad. The bus staff were pushy in trying to get us to leave, which put a damper on our groups brunch. Still, the food and beverage were so good I would definitely go back.
