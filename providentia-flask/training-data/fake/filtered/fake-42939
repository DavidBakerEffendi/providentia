Be aware of this place! We went for dinner last Tuesday and the bill was $39. We went  back a week later and had the same order plus an extra order of picanha, totaling $57. What?!  Last week was $12 a plate for picanha and Costela today the same plate was $14 for the same plate. Get this, $5 for each slice of picanha. This place is the biggest rip off. Pic had forgotten why we stopped going there. Never going to this place again.
