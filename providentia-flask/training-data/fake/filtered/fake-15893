I placed an order online. I prepaid and went to the place to pick up the order in person. I entered the place and gave my name to retrieve my pick up order. The cashier reached down and picked my order up off the ground. Yes, it was in a bag but it was sitting on the floor near her feet. I can't believe they sat my food on the floor. The cashier said that's where they always sit the "to go" orders. It seems like they could have allowed it to sit on the counter but nope. I really wanted to cancel but my order was non-refundable. My order included a beverage and I asked for a cup of ice. Suddenly, everyone stopped speaking English. Finally, they came back to me and said it would cost $1 to get ice. I said I didn't see that charge on the menu and I expected ice to go with the beverage I'd already paid for. They continued to argue and finally the manager was called. I ended up getting the ice at no charge. However, between seeing my food waiting on the FLOOR for me, having to argue for a cup of ice and also having to translate their conversation when they stopped speaking English, I had enough of this place. I will never go back.
