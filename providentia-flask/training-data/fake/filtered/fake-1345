Applewood has always been a very satisfying and excellent experience.  I live near by and it is a great go to place.  One of my out of town friends always must make a trip to Applewood before the end of his visit and many other friends will also travel out of their way to come here. The food is always very well put together and satisfying.  I love the dinner menu as well as the brunch.  The food is well thought out and there are so many great flavors combined in a way that you can actually appreciate all the ingredients in the dish.   Applewood is a must try.
