A very warm, cozy bar (thankfully with no TVs!). My two friends and I started with the fried pickles just because everyone here said you had to try them. Truthfully, the though of fried pickles was nauseating but they were pretty damn awesome. We all got burgers and they were tasty, cooked perfectly and a good size. Maybe a little pricey but nothing crazy. The fries were also excellent. Both waitresses that helped us were friendly and professional. We'll definitely go there again. One negative...I dont' drink on a "school night" so I got a soda. My tap water is fizzier than their soda. But still 5 stars as I'm not going to knock a bar that has a huge beer selection and great food for bad soda.
