average food + worst service I've ever had entire life. especially their reception is clueless. Long waiting is OK, but to be seated in order on the waiting list, you have to pray(or being a family or a friends of hostess must be easier). Pls be sure there are lots of good pancake house or brunch restaurant near from you in NYC. In a point of service, this restaurant must have been over-rated.
