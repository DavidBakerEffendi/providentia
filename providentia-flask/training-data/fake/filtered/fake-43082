I am very picky about my food and I have a lot of food allergies.  Not only was the staff completely patient and willing to work with me but the food tasted amazing.  Also they really know their wines and how to pair them with exactly what you are eatting.  I can't say enough good things about this place but put it this way - I was in midtown on the East side and I made the trek there to meet friends and it was totally worth it.  DO IT!
