Had not been in the Mill on the River for a long time and decided to try it again for our Anniversary.  Started with some drinks and good appetizers in the bar, before dinner.  Very reasonable and tasty.  Dinner was just a wonderful experience, the meals were outstanding and our server "Joan"  and the rest of the staff went above and beyond to make our night extra special.  Nothing could have been improved on in any way...  Keep up the good work.
