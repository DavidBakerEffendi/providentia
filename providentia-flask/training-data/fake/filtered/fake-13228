i live right around the corner from this place, and i have to say, i really don't go enough. maybe if the brunch waiting line wasn't so long i'd be more inclined, but it's just proof that it's a good spot. quality homefries, intensely good hot chocolate, great coffee (a must), and honestly i'm a fan of the chocolate pudding hahaha. they use the good kind of chocolate. i think that the atmosphere is great for any kind of gathering whether it be the family, a date, business, etc. the service is good, even when it's packed, and also very friendly. generally, i get breakfast there, but they have prime breakfast, lunch, and dinner. although a slight risk (very), i highly recommend trying the specials. all of the specials i've had there were delicious. -Maddddy
