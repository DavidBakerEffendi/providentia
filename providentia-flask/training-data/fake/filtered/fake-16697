I would give five stars for the quality and quantity of the food served, but would have to take away a star for the neighborhood/ atmosphere of the restaurant as well as for its service. If you want good Chinese food for a cheap price, Hunan is the place you want to go to; but if you want to celebrate a special occasion in a "fancy" setting, you should find another place. A lot of college students from Princeton tend to go there on random weekends or for birthday celebrations, and the place could get pretty rowdy sometimes - not an ideal place to be for those who want to have quiet, serious talk over a meal. But if you're craving Chinese food and want to eat out while not spending too much money, go to Hunan! There is a variety of dishes, most of which (at least the Chinese and Malaysian) taste very good overall and come in generous portions, so I would highly recommend ordering family style and sharing. Remember to bring cash, though, because last time I went, they didn't take credit cards!
