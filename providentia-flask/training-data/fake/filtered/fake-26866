This place is SO. GOOD. An old boss tipped me off about it back in the winter of 2009, and while I was living in the city, I'm pretty sure I ate there at least 3 times a week that following spring. I only wish the 4th Ave location were a little bigger, because my heart is sad everytime I walk in and see there's no place for me to sit and eat my bean burrito. But I'll gladly sit on the sidewalk for one of those guys.
