What an incredible find! Menu was creative and not overwhelming or intimidating. The Ricotta Gnocchi was incredibly light but tasteful and the pork chops were moist and plentiful. Round this off with an excellent, attentive staff and you are guaranteed a great evening. Â  Crown Heights is very lucky to have this in their neighborhood.
