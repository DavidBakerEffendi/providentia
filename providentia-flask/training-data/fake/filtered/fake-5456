First off: Major props to these people for serving locally produced food. More of this needs to happen, and Sweet Afton serves a good product. Nitty Gritty: I tried this place out after reading such rave reviews, but I'm really not sold on Sweet Afton's portions, prices, service, or beer selection. The ambiance here is warm, but much too crowded and loud for a "romantic" scene that someone described below. They have eight to ten beers on tap, and they were serving two cask ales as well. A few points: The Ribs: ARE delicious, nicely cooked, and not saucy. However, at $11 per plate, I'd expect more than FOUR RIBS and a small bowl of cabbage. These guys are making a killing off this menu item alone. The Burger: Cooked to perfection. No complaints about the meat, but the bun leaves me a little disappointed. At $10 for a cheeseburger without fries/salad/etc., I also feel this is overpriced. The Pickles: Interesting, but they're not worth another round. My relationship with deep fried pickles is colorful and full of life, but these ones left me a little confused. Whats the point of putting a one-inch coating of soft batter on a pickle? SA's pickles are all soft and bready, whereas my favorite tend to be crisp and light. SA's "spicy" aioli is also a little too watered down for my tastes. I like more of a zing. So, four beers, two entrees (without sides!), and one app later, our bill was over $50 before the tip. In my opinion, there are definitely other places worth searching out before camping at Sweet Afton!
