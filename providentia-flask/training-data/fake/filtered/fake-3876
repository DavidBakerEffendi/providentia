Went there on a Monday night, walked to the bar with two minority friends. Was completely ignored for first 10 minutes. Finally got drinks than bartender proceeded tohave conversations with people at the bar for another 20 minutes. Finally got the bartender attention and got my check and left immediately . Not really a mixed crowd
