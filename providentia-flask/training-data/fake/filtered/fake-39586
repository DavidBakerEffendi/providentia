I used to live 2 blocks away from De Mole; now that I'm living around 61st St. station my commute is hike, but always well worth it! Personal favs that have been consistently good over the past two years include: pork and pineapple taco, goat taco (goat you may ask? - SERIOUSLY, TRY IT!), and the Mole Burrito. While I will agree with some reviewers that I have sometimes found the food a little bland, those were on rare occasions, and there is nothing a shot of their fresh green or red sauce can't solve. I would go here even if I lived back in Manhattan.
