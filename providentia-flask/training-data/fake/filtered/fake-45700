They have very unique and never seen before items on the menu! I recommend the mango avocado salmon salad and the sushi "pizzas"! So delicious!! Their service is quick, warm, and friendly! I love them and the lovely ppl who work there always treat you like family when you dine there! It's right next to the train station so very convenient for me! This place is a must!
