I have been there twice for sit down dinner now and it's amazing.  Try to get the banco right wall.  There is this really tall nice man who is the nicest waiter ever!!!! Excellent food and the only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is because the second time I went back my waiter wasn't as good but still great. Go you'll love it!!!
