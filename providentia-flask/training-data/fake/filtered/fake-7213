My wife and I went to Tinto for a birthday dinner and did the tasting menu as we thought it would be a good way to taste a lot of interesting things.  It also seemed like a good deal.  The food was good, but didn't blow us away compared to other places we've been to.  We were really  happy with everything until we looked at the menu this morning and realized that our tasting was about $30 more than it should have been for what we received.  Save yourself some money and go a la carte.
