If you're ever looking for a truly unique and amazing experience when it comes to cuisine, then look no further than Miya's sushi! I highly recommend first timers, or anyone for that matter, to go with the future sushi special. For $35 you get three appetizers, a sake bomb, a dozen plus pieces of incredible sushi, and desert!!! For me personally, I can't get enough of the Chinese Pygmy Rodeo! Broccoli wrapped in potato skin and covered in melted Havarti cheese and lemon dill! Not to mention I can also live off their pumpkin miso soup. I seriously can eat a bowl a day and never complain! With an awesome atmosphere and all around great environment, it's easier than ever to sit down and enjoy an incredible meal in new haven! When it comes to dining in new haven, Miya's is the Apex!
