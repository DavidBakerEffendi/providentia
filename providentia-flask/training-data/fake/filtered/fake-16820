I think this restaurant is definitely worth a try. I love the peaceful decor, the service was so friendly from the hostess to the server, and the food concept of market to table, organic, locally grown is my favorite. However, a big warning, lots of the appetizer dishes are fried and the menu description doesn't mention it. Ask first "is this dish fried" for any dish you want.  I think from a health standpoint, it was not a good meal for me.  The flavors were good, but again, heavy oiled. I will go back and carefully ask about each dish.  The goat cheese pizza with spinach was very good and the wild striped bass was also good.  Wine selection is very good.  They offered a truffle pizza for 92 which is over the top in my opinion but I hope someone who tries it will write a review.
