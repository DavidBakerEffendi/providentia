The pernil (slow roasted pork) is to die for !! The portions are generous and this is served with a huge side of rice and beans and a salad.  I also wanted some fried plantains, and the waitress said she could just substitute the plantains for the salad, which I gladly accepted.   This place has delicious food and great prices.  Just don't go here for the atmosphere ! It's definitely a cafe' type of place with very bright lighting. But give it a try.  I would like to try other dishes, but their pernil is so good, I don't see it happening any time soon .
