This place just doesn't do it right. The ramen was just okay, not something I would go back for. The thing that sucked was that everything else we ordered - Karaage Chicken, Shrimp Tempura Shu Mai, & Gyoza, were of poor quality! I'm convinced that it's all frozen out of the box type of stuff. Now that's just being lazy. The pork bun did not taste frozen but it was dull. They need to add a kimchi in it or something. The waitress also had a hard time taking our order, as well as remembering our order and came back a couple of times to confirm. Needless to say, I ain't coming back for more.
