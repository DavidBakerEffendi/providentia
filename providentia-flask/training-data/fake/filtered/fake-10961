Went in to grab something quick to go. The staff didn't seem too friendly it almost seemed like I was bothering them walking in. The restaurant was empty which is never a good sign but I decided to try it anyway. Their lunch specials are $2 more than most other Chinese restaurants and do not give a soup or egg roll with their lunch. On top of being more expensive I couldn't pay with a card unless I spent over $10 okay some places are like that and I understand they get charged for credit transactions. Anyway I was forced to buy 2 egg rolls to get to the minimum. Â I ordered chicken in garlic sauce (asked for extra spicy) lunch with pork fried rice. The lid wasn't put on securely so there was sauce all over the bag then all over my desk at work they gave me chicken in brown sauce not garlic sauce like I had ordered it wasn't spicy i counted 4 small pieces of pork in the rice and the egg rolls weren't too tasty. I had asked for extra duck sauce and soy sauce. They gave me 1 extra of each I asked again for a few more and she sighed and rolled her eyes and reluctantly gave me 2 more packets of each. The only positive thing I can say was that it had a nice looking atmosphere and the food was ready pretty quick. I will not be returning to this place. Luckily there are 25 other Chinese places within 10 minutes of here. I'd recommend almost any of the others vs. This one.
