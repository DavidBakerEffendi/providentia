WOW!!!  What a great find on the UES!!  The Drunken Munkey is a wonderfully cozy place especially on a snowy, cold winter night.  The drinks were great - and LOVED the food.  The cheese appetizer was amazing, the Butter Chicken Tikka Masala was the best I've ever had, and the service was fabulous.  Terrific addition to the neighborhood!
