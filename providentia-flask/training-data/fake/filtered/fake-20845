I have tried a little of everything here and can't decide what's best - from brunches with deliciously chewy breads from local bakeries, cooked to perfection eggs with all the right condiments, to the sausage. Oh the sausage.  Soups that taste like bacon. And  the best part - I've even tried some of the healthier items, the salad and the perfectly cooked side veggies and even those are fantastic. Great job with the new menu. Oh, one thing I want to add is it's really obvious they're paying attention to detail and making sure the patron feels good about what they're putting in their body. This place never struck me as a place that focused on high end products until I read the menu and the subtleties are everywhere. Again, great job. Wait, I think I've decided - the honey sriracha chicken tenders have my vote for best item.
