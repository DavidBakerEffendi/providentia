This place has a great vibe as soon as you walk in. The menu is huge so sometimes it is hard to decide what to get. There is a case with pastries that always look yummy. They give you cole slaw and pickles to munch on before your meal comes. sandwiches are a always huge. Usually eat one half then save the rest for later. I am always very full after I leave this place.
