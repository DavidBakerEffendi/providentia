I really liked this place!! The choice was five guys (in the same strip) or TLG and I was so glad I went to TLG! I had a great salad with apples, cheese and grilled chicken. My young daughter had a grilled cheese that she really liked! We ate in the restaurant which was clean and comfortable. Will definitely go back next time I'm in the area.
