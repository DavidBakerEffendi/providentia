There is chicken broth in everything, even in the "vegetarian choices" section... They need to make that clear. This is at least my third time ordering and they just now informed me, despite my specific requests that everything be vegetarian each time I've ordered in the past. Among other reasons, this is particularly offensive since I made it obvious that I'm a strict vegetarian. I won't be ordering again and I'll certainly inform others about their categorization problem.
