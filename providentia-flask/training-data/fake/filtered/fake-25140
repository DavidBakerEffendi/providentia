My wife and I stopped in just before 9 PM on Saturday the 9th to celebrate our anniversary.  Having never been to any of Marc Vetri's restaurants, we didn't know what to expect.  In my opinion it lived up to the hype.  The ambience was nice, a little loud, but we liked the feel of it.  The food was very good.  I definitely recommend trying the swordfish meatballs. It was packed when we arrived but there was minimal wait time before we could sit down.  We had a table closer to the door but it turned out to be nice as we were a little more secluded.  While our server Eric was checking in on his other tables, we had management stop by to check in on us and ultimately take our order.  I was impressed.  I could see the restaurant was very busy and had no problem waiting for the server to make his rounds but it was appreciated nonetheless. Our server Eric was attentive but not overzealous.  He took the time to check in on us but gave us plenty of space to celebrate our evening.  He was knowledgeable and gave us a few good recommendations but he was also able to loosen up and joke with us which made the evening more enjoyable. It was our first anniversary and Amis made it quite memorable.  We won't hesitate to go back for seconds.
