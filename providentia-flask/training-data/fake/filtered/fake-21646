My boyfriend and I tried this place out for the first time last night. At first we were a little disappointed that the buffet is only for lunch not dinner. While we were looking through the menu they brought out some papadam with two sauces. I loved the spicy green one and my boyfriend preferred the brown one which was a bit sweet. We ordered the chicken korma, lamb tikka masala, and butter naan. All of which were phenomenal! The dishes were creamy with the perfect amount of spice. The cuts of the meat were very good quality.  I love Indian food and have gone to several places. Krishna is by far one of the best I've eaten at. The service was also good. Our water glasses were never empty and the waiter came back to ask if the spice level for the food was okay for us.  My boyfriend even left his credit card there and the waiter flagged down our car at a stop sign to return it.  We will definitely be going back for more food!
