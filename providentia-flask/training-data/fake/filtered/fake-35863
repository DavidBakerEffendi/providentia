After visiting a few times with my husband, we have decided TFK is our favorite place. Breakfast, lunch or dinner! They recently opened for dinner hours and we couldn't be more thrilled. Seriously. The owners are like family. Always welcoming, caring about our experience, greeting us and genuinely concerned about the food. Favorite foods include their "Awesome" Burger, the Yankee Bean Soup, and the pancakes. The wait is short and the food is great. Prices are fantastic. I can bring my whole family of 5 for dinner and pay less than $40. Total. That's unbeatable. Really love the family friendly atmosphere too.
