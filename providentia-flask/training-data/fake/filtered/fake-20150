Trio is not worth the wait for delivery or pick up. Ordered delivery one night and was told it would be 40 minutes.  The food showed up cold, 2 hours after the order was placed.  Thinking everyone needs a second chance we ordered again opting for pick up thinking that would save some time. Wrong. Again the food was to be ready in 40 minutes. Get to Trio 45 minutes later and the food isn't ready. They said it was going to be another 30 minutes and they would deliver it.  They delivered cold food 45 minutes later. Two strikes and your out Trio.
