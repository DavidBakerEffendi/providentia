After seeing that review from James L I felt i had to give you my prospective. I and my family were also there sat night and what I saw was a rocking seafood market and restaurant Â that people were lined up to get into. Our dinner was fantastic and apperenty so were most other patrons as I saw many customers stop on the way out to tell the Chefs how great there meal was. Frankly I do remember that couple as the gentlemen had an attitude when he could not sit right down on a busy sat night and was asked to step over to the side as he wanted to stand where the waitress had to pass to get to the tables. Yes the restaurant is small and crowded and sometimes you have to wait but 20 min on a Sat night does not seem unreasonable but when you sit down with a bad attitude well he told you the rest. We had a great time. You cannot beat the quality and freshness, The service was ok but good be better but I will also say it was a very busy night.
