Please before you die try their gnocchis. Although the place is cramped, I wanna go back just for the gnocchis. And our server, don't remember her name, was really great and very nice. Fries are decent too. I tried the cookies and milk dessert and it was pretty good, not as good as I expected, but definitely try it and split it with someone
