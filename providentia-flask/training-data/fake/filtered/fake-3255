Their menu is loaded up with pork right now. Everything is meat. It's not vegan/vegetarian friendly. And it's cool if they don't want to be. Culinary wise, it's very ambitious... and unique from most Philly spots. They have a great beer list and a nice wine list too. The music was just really good, some early Weezer, Franz Ferdinand, etc. I had the pickled veggies and it was just too sour. I'm a HUGE pickled fan but this was just raw vinegar. They had a very nice soft serve twist with blood orange! So gorgeous. I wouldn't go back. If I did, only for drinks.
