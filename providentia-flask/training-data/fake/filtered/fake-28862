I had wonderful food here! I have an annoying diet (I'm a vegan) and even though there were very few vegan options on the menu the chef came out and talked with me and came up with the most delicious mole in vegetables and for dessert I had fruit soaked in Mezcal! Also recommended for the appetizers is the El Diablito which is a tasting of six sauces with fresh homemade tortillas. The place is also cute and cozy (probably a good date spot) with various Mexican folk art on display. The staff are super sweet and personable.
