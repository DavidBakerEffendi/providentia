First of all, too small of a facility for a restaurant. Customers and workers have to squeeze by each other to get by. Second, took me 35 minutes to get some food! come on!! The 1 dollar skewers were horrible!! No choices what so ever. Food wasn't all that good. I had to BUY more food just to get full. Also, WHO was my waiter? I had over 5 different people serve me and give out drinks! I had to wave down a server for some assistance! Â Never again! Two thumbs down for me!
