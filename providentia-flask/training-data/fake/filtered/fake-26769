Great Food, Big Portions, Low Prices, Crystal Clean Restaurant! I highly recommend it! Try the 1) 'Pikilia=assorted Greek spreads' with pita bread, 2) Greek Traditional Salad, 3) Chicken grilled souvlaki! + they also have a great variety of fish, although I haven't tried any of them yet. We got a free 'galaktompoureko=custard pie dessert' at the end of our meal :)
