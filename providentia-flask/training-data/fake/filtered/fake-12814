The problem is...these guys are so busy that when we have a problem, they don't care. They know they will fill the table before we get up...like the other day.  Our plates cleared, rushed out before more coffee. My $10 eggs benedict florentine were sooo soggy and over-cooked (under the heater light in the back) that if we had not been waiting fourty minutes, I would have eaten my nails.  I had to go to wait station to get my own fork, waiter looked worried. Florentine? With dill? Mushy mush english muffins? Hard poached eggs? Oh, and the salad that used to come with salad now costs so much, I cannot afford the gas to get to this place.  Diner? No, If I am going to drive, pay these prices for food that I can make from all the surrounding supermarkets, be ignored, or talked to with my mouth full and cannot answer, yet again, I can cook at home or your home. Just saying. What happened to visiting?
