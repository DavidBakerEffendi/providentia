Tiny little hole in the wall place in South Philly. Caesar salad was fairly bland (too little dressing, and was soggy), but the gnocci with marinara sauce was one of the BEST gnocci dishes I've ever had! The service was also very attentive and friendly. I'd recommend getting the gnocci, if it wasn't already clear that I liked it.
