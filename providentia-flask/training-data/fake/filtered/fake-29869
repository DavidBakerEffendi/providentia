We drove 30 mins to Montclair to try out the Chatanooga fried chicken and it was soooo worth it. Â We tried the cole slaw w shredded pineapple, some delicious cornbread, and real mashed potatoes!! Yes, real! not like the boxed kind that you get from other places. The chatanooga chicken was so juicy and was still crispy and hot after driving 30 mins! We are so returning.. Oh, forgot to mention that we arrived almost at closing time and he was super nice and cooked my chicken on the spot, fresh and was extremely nice! thank you Urban Chicken!
