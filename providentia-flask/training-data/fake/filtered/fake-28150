Being stuck at home with nothing but old ramen and canned tuna w/expired mayo, I realized I needed takeout to survive. I usually don't stay in Boonton at my old apartment- and sans car access I decided to yelp it up and hopefully find some delivery chinese food in the area. Delivery guy was nice. Opening the bag, I was sad to not see any rice. Maybe they did away with that whole lunch-special deal? Ordered chicken lo-mein and fried dumplings. The dumplings were pleasantly browned and not dripping oil like other places in the area. Great filling, and the dipping sauce was nice and snappy-sweet. It was not full of a million scallions or runny like some other places. The lo-mein was amazing. Great flavor without being too overpowered by garlic or sweetness. The veggies were crispy and the chicken was identifiable and yummy. Yes, when it comes to Chinese take-out this is very important to me. xD I am really glad to have found this new gem so close to me. I'm tempted to unplug my fridge so I have an excuse to order here asap. ^.^
