Food was actually good.. EVEN if I didn't like half the stuff on the menu or ddin't know what it was! I tried the roasted chicken with green beans garlic mashed potatoes & side of mac &cheese like most places the mac was store bought kind or not authentic mac n cheese! Chicken was actually flavorful Â & tasty lol Now the price was actully very high for such limited menu in my opinion. I think it ranged from 16-30 or 40 dollars per entree...
