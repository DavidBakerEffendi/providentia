I've never reviewed restaurants on yelp, but this restaurant is so good that it deserves recognition. This restaurant serves the best Chinese take out food I've ever had. I now refuse to eat at any other establishments of this kind because Ruyi's food is far superior. I'm not the only one I know who feels this way. I live with 7 other people, and every one of them shares my beliefs. If you are looking for some Chinese take out, you can do no wrong ordering from here.
