I can't understand the great reviews.  My husband and  I had heard the chicken was good , and yes, it was. (But nothing spectacular).  The waiter was non-responsive. The prices were extremely high for lunch. I can't understand why a restaurant w ould not have a lunch menu.  And, are you kidding, not even bread for the table without a charge and a bad cup of coffee with no refills.  You can have th e place. I'll never go back.
