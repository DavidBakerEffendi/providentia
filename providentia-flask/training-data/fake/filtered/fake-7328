Having been to many of the top rated restaurants in New York City, I was looking forward to eating at Bouley, rated 2nd for food in Zagat. Unfortunately, I left quite disappointed with the experience. I had the special lunch menu of five courses...none were a culinary "wow". Although the quality of each ingredient was superb, I felt that the somewhat exotic additions to each dish resulted in less than wonderful flavors. Please note I welcome creative cusine; I simply feel Bouley's attempts at modernity did not work. Service was also less than expected for a restaurant of this reputation. We waited more than 5 minutes after being seated before anyone came to to take our orders. I ran out of water midway through the meal; no one came to refill it until I was almost finished with the dessert course. We had several waiters bring courses,and we were never served by the lady who originally took our orders. I find this odd. I actually wish I could give Bouley a 3.5 rating. Needless to say, I do not intend to return to this restaurant.
