This is the only place in Hartford that knows how to pour a proper Boddington's, other than Vaughn's. Erin's a wonderful, knowledgeable bartender who can explain why (they have the keg lines cleaned weekly). Food is very very good. Clean, fun atmosphere. Bangers and mashed, as well as Irish nachos, are a must-try. I avoid it when the bands are there, because I like to talk to friends. But most folks enjoy the bands and I'm in the minority there. Only prob is lack of parking, but so be it. Â Food, service, atmosphere all top shelf. Oh, and reviewer Daniel B has the wrong place. This is not in West Hartford center and there is no rooftop deck.
