Went on July 3, 2010 with my mom and sister for a belated birthday dinner for me (my birthday's in January).  The place is beautiful and although the food is pricey, it is quite good.  The waiter bought over some popovers wchich were really excellent.  Also for an amouse bouche, there was a gaspacho that was ok, it tasted like pico de gallo.  For appetizers, my mom got the escargot and really liked it, my sister and I shared the charcuterie plate and it was ok, nothing great.  I got an elderflower cocktail and it tasted like lemonade, which was nice, but at $12 or so, an expensive lemonade.  We got a half bottle of the cheapest Pinot Noir at $30 to go with our meals, and though I'm not a big wine guy, I thought it was very good.  For entrees, I had the Lamb Chops.  They were cooked perfect medium rare as I had requested and came with peas and morels and a demi glace.  The lamb was a bit underseasoned and the peas seemed undercooked, but the lamb had good flavor and the morels were excellent.  My sis got the duck breast which was seasoned with coriander and I think also cumin.  It was quite flavorful with a crisp skin and cooked beautifully.  Probably the best of the three entrees although it came with some sweet puree that was a bit cloying.  My mom got the filet, and like my lamb, I thought it was cooked perfectly, but underseasoned.  I had creme brulee for dessert and it was good, with a few berries.  My sister got some macadamia cookies with chocolate ice cream in between them.  The ice cream was quite intense, like a gelato.  Our waiter was not that great, I don't remember his name, but he was a bit of a dope, better suited for TGI Fridays.  My sister was a bit disturbed that she had ordered the duck breast and there were ducks walking around the outdoor seating area right outside our table.   Overall it was good, but it didn't really elevate to that next level.
