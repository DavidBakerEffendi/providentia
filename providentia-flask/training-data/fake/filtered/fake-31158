Hands down a great place to get eat a bit of the Mediterranean.  Food is inexpensive and the fact that is a BYOB is an added bonus since I like to pair my wines with my food.  Great food, great service...a highlight is the fact that the owner does the rounds to make sure everyone is enjoying their food.  Will definitely go back for as long as it remains as good as the first time I had ate there.  Job well done, keep it up....
