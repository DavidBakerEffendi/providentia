I really love the pizza here. Wood fired gives it a distinct taste. Arugula and Prosciutto pie is fantastic. The prices are on the high side but that's okay because it is very good. I did have a lunch special once which consisted of a sandwich, soup and fries. It was very average. Decor wise the place is very beautiful and it is never crowded. They have a happy hour but I always forget to go.
