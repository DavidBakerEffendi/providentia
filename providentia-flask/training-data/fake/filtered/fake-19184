we went to burrito bar tonight in a good mood.  they must re think their business strategy.  it is not ok to ignore your customers and then ask them if they want their food to go. just serve us our food when we order it.  secondly, someone who claimed to be the manager did not apologie  for not bringing  our food.  he sent an ugly woman to acuse  us of running out our bill.  we were sitting there.  burrito bar waitress.  bring our food and we will be happy.  do not accuse nice people of being degenerates.  if you want to be hungry abd inuslted by an ugly woman,   eat here.  they will not bring your food and be mad when you want to leave.  sorry is in the dictionary learn it  manager man must not hide behind the ugly woman
