We chose Estia because it was near the theater and also because their website featured a lovely dish which we had never tried. When we were seated and asked about the Lobster Moussaka the waiter said not tonight and could not tell us when it might be back. Many more disappointments followed. After requesting no salt my mussels were stringy and immersed in an over salted otherwise tasteless sauce that did NOT invite the bread for sopping up. (Bread was good) Â My Moussaka arrived at the table cold. The bottom of the plate was stained with lumps of food leaving an embarrassing mess when the plate was retrieved. Dessert fruit was unripe and barely edible. My companions vegetable dish was a joke. We give them one star because of the bread.
