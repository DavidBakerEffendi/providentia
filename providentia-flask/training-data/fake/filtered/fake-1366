To quote a friend "I had the bread for dessert".  Is it the bread or the caraway butter that is so fantastic?  No idea and who cares.  It is amazing!   Worth the visit just for that!!!     My dinner that night?  The hand rolled pici pasta. Fantastic!!!! Took my kids there for brunch one day. I skipped the bread & pasta this time and went for the poached eggs and hen of the woods mushrooms.  I ate every last bite.  And followed it up with a side of mouth watering yummy cinnamon toast.   My kids had the cured bacon and waffles and could not have been happier. Can't wait for the backyard to open up for outdoor dining this Spring and Summer!!!
