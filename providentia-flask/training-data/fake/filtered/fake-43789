Alta is without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I could write a book on the deliciousness that this place has to offer. From the cocktails, to the tapas, I don't think I've ever tasted something I didn't like. I have been a few times over the past few years, but never had the chance to do the "whole shebang." (You get every plate on the menu for $450) Finally, last month a friend of mine hosted her birthday dinner there and 10 of us got to experience the "whole shebang." What an amazing experience!!! It was a never ending dinner of excellent and authentic dishes, each one topping the next. We definitely got our money's worth at $45 per person for there was more than enough food. (In fact, I went on a juice cleanse the day after because I may have been a little TOO over-indulgent.) Definitely try the skirt steak, the brussel sprouts (best preparation I've ever had) and the foie gras au torchon. I could go into details, but my suggestion is just to go and see for yourself. It's perfect for a date or a group as well (although they do have a 12 person limit per table and these larger ones definitely book up weeks in advance as I learned the hard way.) The space is beautiful and cozy and always seems to host an attractive crowd. The service is always up to par in a very laid back style and they have a great list of Spanish and French wines that are all reasonably priced. (Do yourself a favor though and start with the Sangria...you'll thank me later.) To sum it up, take my advice and just go. You'll be very happy you did.
