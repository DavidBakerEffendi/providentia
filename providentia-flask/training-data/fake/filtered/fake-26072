A friend and I tried breakfast with our four kids (3-7). The atmosphere is nice and our server was also pleasant. The food was ok. I tried the sweet potato pancakes. They were quite bland and a bit rubbery. They also don't use real syrup, which many places don't, but would have earned points for me. My kids also got pancakes (choc. chip and blueberry) which were a bit more flavorful but also rubbery. The homefries were very good as was the coffee. I have to say the egg sandwiches looked terrific so I would like to go back and try one of those. I also saw some of the lunch sandwiches on the way out and those looked very good. Overall not terrible but not great for breakfast. I will definitely try lunch there.
