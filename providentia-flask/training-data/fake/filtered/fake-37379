I've been onto Indian food since the first restaurant opened next door in Colonia over 30 years ago.   I have had great service and food at many / Indian restaurants, but not here. The food here is substandard and overpriced.  A table for two can't possibly hold the typical quantity of food my wife and I order. The hospitality was underwhelming. The Tandori chicken was not served hot on a sizzling platter and underspiced. My wife's favorite, Chicken Tika Masala was not creamy. The daal makahni was watery.   The small 12 oz. bottle of Kingfisher beer ($5) was way overpriced. Save your money and time and go elsewhere
