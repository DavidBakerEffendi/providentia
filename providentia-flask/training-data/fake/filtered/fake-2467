$70 (pre tip) in and out for 3 1/2 people, including a pitcher of margarita and plenty of food....sign me up....anytime. Food was great- stellar guac and chips, ok quesadilla, good mac/ cheese for kids, a bit salty of the mixed BBQ platter- but what do you expect its smoked BBQ.. thats what the margarita is for. Sat outside on beautiful Wednesday night.  Lots of street traffic and full dining section gave great energy.  Highly recommended the outdoor tables in between Camino and Ferdinand Good service- and good insight to how to best accomodate the kids.   Would definitely head back for a night out- seems like it would be a great meet up spot.
