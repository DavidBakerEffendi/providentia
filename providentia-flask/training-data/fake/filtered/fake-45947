I always get the Cambodian noodles soup but would ask them the use egg noodles instead. For some reason their rice noodles is always too soft and easy to break apart. It looks like the same noodles used for Pad Thai but might be of different quality or it's just way overcooked. The broth is tasty however. My boyfriend enjoys the roasted duck or pork chop overrice. We found the shrimp rolls to be quite tasty as well.
