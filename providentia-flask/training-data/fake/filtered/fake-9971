3.5 stars for food. No stars for customer service. My girlfriend and I went to Sabrina's this morning for breakfast. She got the always delicious stuffed french toast. I got a cheeseburger. The burger was ordered medium rare and came out medium, which would normally not be a problem, but it was very dry. What I'm really upset about is the not the fact that our waitress said the $20 bill we put in the check holder was not there, nor the fact that she couldn't find it on the floor anywhere, but the fact that the manager would not credit us any amount whatsoever to make it right. I understand it's he said/she said, but at least meet us halfway. We had to pay twice. I will not be going back. I'm appalled at the lack of customer service.
