Got kicked off my table for trying to watch the German-Italy game by myself after I got separated from my friends. Whatever happened to paying customers know what's right? Just wanted to sit there and enjoy the game - but I guess that may be too much for the bartender downstairs. I won't be going there for the Eurocup finals then or ever since there really isn't so much other than an accommodating sports bar atmosphere - which I guess there is not.
