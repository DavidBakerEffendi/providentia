Amazing food! I stumbled upon this place totally by accident three weeks ago. I was participating in a community event at the East Rock park a couple blocks away, and I was hungry. I saw "falafel" on the sign of this unassuming little corner market, and I thought, "Well, that might hit the spot." Wow--I had no idea. The falafel wrap they served me was arguably the best I've ever had, anywhere, certainly the best in New Haven. So good, so fresh, full of mouth-watering flavor with just the right amount of spice. And the guys who serve the food are super friendly. If you like Middle Eastern food, you must try this place. I live and work outside New Haven, on the Connecticut shoreline, and I have no reason to visit East Rock on a regular basis. Until now. I went back to the One Stop Mart & Deli for their falafel last weekend, and I returned again today. Delicious. I plan to go back next weekend. Really, it's that good!
