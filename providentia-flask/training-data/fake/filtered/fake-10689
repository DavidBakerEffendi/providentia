"Miami Mike" plays the same freaking song during every break.  Makes you feel like you are in the twilight zone also If you want to eat food that your dog wont even eat then this is the place for you.   Place has too little coverage so the wait for food and beer is forever.   Please take the extra 10 min drive and go to morristown for a better time
