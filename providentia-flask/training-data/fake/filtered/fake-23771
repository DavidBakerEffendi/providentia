Inventive highly creative tapas and small plates from around the world. Alta is packed on weekends, too much. The trick is to go during weekdays with lots of people. Get ready to share. Interesting that it's NOT a traditional tapa place. i like the mediterranean and morrocan small plates. Excellent wine selection, all prices.
