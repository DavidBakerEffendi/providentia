My family and I were visiting the city this past weekend and decided to stop at Entree. We wish we hadn't. Our meals were awful. My dad and I like our steaks medium to medium rare but when our steaks came out you would've thought we ordered them well. Â Way over done! My mom ordered the chicken and it was so dry!! I understand that cooks don't always get the meals right and nobody is perfect but 3 out 3 is terrible. Needless to say when we return to the city we won't be returning to Entree.
