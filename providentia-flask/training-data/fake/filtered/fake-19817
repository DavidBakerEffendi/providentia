This summer I had my daughter's birthday party at Guru Palace. The food and the decor are great more than i expected. The newly renovated banquets so dazzling in colorful led light. The food stall with traditional Indian touch make you feel like you are in India. The service that the owner gave is warm welcome. All my guests are impressed with Mexican counter that I specially order for my party. Thank Â you Guru Palace for making wonderful memories for my beloved family.
