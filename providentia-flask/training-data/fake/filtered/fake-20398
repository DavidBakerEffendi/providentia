we had a party of 9, they were only able  to seat six, refusing to push two tables together.  of the nine meals ordered three were edible, the rest inedible.  one smelled like cow manure (no exaggeration).  we are not new to thai cuisine, so it was not the cuisine, but the food itself that was so bad.
