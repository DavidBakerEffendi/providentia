Live in the 'hood, stopped here for dinner on a Friday night with my boyfriend after several other restaurants had mile long wait lists.   Seated immediately, restaurant was almost full but not loud, no trendy music blaring.  Low key decor, French people to our left, Israeli's on our right, and the food was quite good.  The chicken tagine was excellent, savory with apricots and raisins, and duck was tasty.  Good brunch as well, reasonably priced and good alternative to trendy, spendy others in the area.
