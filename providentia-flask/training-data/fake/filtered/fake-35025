Silva, I have worked in many 'corporate' buildings in my career from Iselin to Jersey City to Manhattan and have dined in far too many building cafeterias. Of the multitude of sandwiches, salads, wraps and dishes I have encountered coupled with the staff, cleanliness (or lack thereof) and options, your café here at 33 Wood Ave is truly a stand-out. The staff are warm, friendly and always accommodating. The food is by far the very best I have encountered in similar cafeterias. Most especially, the fare is always fresh and your options rival that of a restaurant three times your size. Please take comfort in that you and your staff are doing a truly outstanding job. I look forward to eating in the building and I always look forward to seeing the smile on your staff's faces. Keep up the good work. Sincerely, Paul  LEED AP Project Manager B & B Interiors, LLC.
