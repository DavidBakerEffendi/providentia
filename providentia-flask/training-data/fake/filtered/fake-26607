Horrible experience. Went in and asked how long for a table for 2. The host, a guy with glasses, a beanie, and a tattoo on his arm, said has a table for us right away; just give him one second. He did not take down our name even though he has a clipboard, which is understandable since he said he will be seating us shortly. That second turned into 30 minutes. He seated everyone behind us, including other parties the same size as us. When confronted why another party of the same size that came after us was seated before us, he said he was under the impression that they came first. The girl clearly came in behind us. She had asked the same question: how long for a table for 2. He said the same thing, he might have a table for them; just give him one second. The guy was unethical, unprofessional, and rude. He promised to make it up by giving us the next table, but ignored us and seated everyone behind us till there was no one left standing until us. We decided it was just not worth it and left. Â  There are plenty of delicious brunch places around the area. Chances are I won't be coming back again. Bad service is enough to ruin any meal. One star is already being very generous.
