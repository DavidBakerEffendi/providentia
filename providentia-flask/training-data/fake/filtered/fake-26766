I loved this place because i felt really welcomed and of course not only that,i loved their  well-cooked food as well, if not more!Our appetizers were saganaki cheese which consisted two LARGE chucks of mouthwatering Greek cheese  and crispy delicious spinach pie.For entree i had the most tender chicken kebab of my life with lemon potatoes and my husband had the broiled fresh scallops with, i think was long broccoli.You might think how good can a side be?well my lemon potatoes were SO tasty and my husband's broccoli was a surprise cooked with feta-cheese and garlic not to mention HUGE! And we finished our meal with two pieces of cinnamon-vanilla flavored, divine Greek custard, on the house!Overall  the food is delicious and the portions are surprisingly big depending on the prices at which sold!I really like it there!
