Although I have ony been once, I LOVE this place! The ambience is trendy and cool, but it is not overly loud and the servers are very attentive. The butternut squash with parmasian and pumpkin seeds, the beets with yogurt, the hamburger, and the pizza are all delicious. Both the chocolate cake with marshmallow icing and the ice cream sundae with salted caramel ice cream are unreal. I am not usually a fan of chcolate or ice cream, but I could not stop eating either. Plus, it is reletively inexpensive for some much food and drinks for New York City. I can't wait to go back!
