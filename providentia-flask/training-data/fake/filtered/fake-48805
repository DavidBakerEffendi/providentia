Kid friendly bar and grill. The "Shrimp & Scallops Casino" at 744 West Restaurant was nicely done, even without the glass of wine! The service was exceptional.  We ordered a quesadilla without onions for my finicky 6 year old son.  When they brought it out with onions the waitress, did not make any excuses, she just apologized and had another one at the table in less than 5 minutes.
