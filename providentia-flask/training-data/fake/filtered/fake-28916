This is a great bar with a relaxed atmosphere. All of the drinks are well priced and the food is amazing. You can go for a quick bite or with a larger group of friends for a party!....The bar area has lots of seating and dancing is always welcome. If you are looking for a good night out I suggest this bar 100%.
