I work at the Best Western Plus Fairfield Executive Inn, and we're always in a bind when it comes to finding 'lunch' options that fit into our wonky shift hours. After losing a former pizza shop in the same spot, I was excited to try Pazzo since I got tired of Chinese and burgers all the time. I was really surprised to find a pretty varied menu. They do salads/wraps/sandwiches, pasta dishes and really fantastic pizza. I was also thrilled to see "Fat Sandwiches". They're "overstuffed" and on these big doughy rolls. My only complaint is that my manager has to order them "Morbidly Obese" so they're filled to his liking. Personally I think they're a pretty hardy sandwich, but I'm 92 lbs of fury so we'll have to agree to disagree. xD I'm typing this while eating a BBQ Chicken slice. $3 isn't bad for a specialty slice. I like that they added sweet onion and I was very glad the sauce wasn't overpowering. I usually go in for wraps. The chicken/bacon/ranch wrap is a loyal go-to. They have a lot of options and the staff is really very friendly and accomodating. Everybody we send from the Front Desk has been pleased as well. I wish more of them would write reviews! :)
