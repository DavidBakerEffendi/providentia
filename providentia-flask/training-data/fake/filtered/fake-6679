The Malagueta Restaurant is an absolute GEM hidden in LIC. I have been dining at Malagueta since it first opened. The owners are both truly wonderful, kind, and honest people who REALLY know how to cook an amazing meal. The decor is very simple, Brazilian chic with the fabulous screaming Carmen Miranda painting on the wall. I highly recommend this restaurant, especially since the prices are and have always been VERY REASONABLE! Enjoy the fried yucca with Brazilian sausage appetizer, and anything from the dinner menu is DELICIOUS, but you must DEFINITELY not pass up on the Passion Fruit Mousse! :)
