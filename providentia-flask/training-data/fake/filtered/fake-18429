My husband and I chose to visit this restaurant after reading reviews on yelp and it didn't disappoint! We went on Valentine's Day and were given a late reservation which was fine with us because we didn't close our restaurant until late anyway. The service was amazing, from beginning to end. The atmosphere was cozy and low lit with a single candle on the table, perfect for our valentine's dinner. We started off with Empanada de Verde and the Alma Sampler. My husband also ordered there soup special which I don't remember what it's called but it was great too. Everything was delicious, of the three I would definitely try the Alma Sampler it was amazing, I don't have words to describe the taste. Since we had never been to a Latin restaurant we really weren't sure what to expect or even order but our server was very helpful in that area. We then ordered the Rum Cured Duck Breast and the Vaca Frita for our main course, everything was great with the exception that there was a stone in the black beans of the Vaca Frita. Definitely a turn off for that to happen while you're enjoying your meal however not only did they replace the food but also removed it from our bill along with the cost of our two desserts! To end the night we had their signature Chocolate Cigar and Dulce de Leche Crepes. Once again amazing! This place is my new favorite restaurant and I will be returning soon!
