This was a really lovely, unexpected restaurant.  I ended up in Burlington by surprise and went in search of dinner and we saw Mexican food inside an old-fashioned diner--cool, right?  Unfortunately we were very tired and had to drive, so we couldn't try the drinks, but tacos and water were plenty.  The taco plates are a really great deal--1-3 tacos plus sides (can't go wrong with rice and beans).  The tacos themselves are really quite nice and combine really interesting flavors.  The lengua taco in particular was heavenly, the lengua was prepared really well.  We had the Mexican chocolate brownie for dessert which was really special, just the right amount of spiciness and really rich chocolate.  Highly recommended for good Mexican food and a chill atmosphere, plus really friendly servers.  Would love to go back and try the margaritas.
