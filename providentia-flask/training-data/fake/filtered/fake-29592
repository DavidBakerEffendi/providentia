Walked the Williamsburg Bridge to check this joint out. Have to say it was quite disappointing. For starters, besides the fact its hard to find, the signs was barely a piece of cardboard! Got the Chicken Box meal which is 3pieces of chicken 1 biscuit 1 side [quite a lot] -Chicken wasn't anything to rave about [and this was when I was hungry, I'm usually unprejudiced when I'm hungry] -Biscuit was still doughie in the center=( -Split the Mac'nCheese and Creamed Spinach sides! The best part! Though the staff is super friendly, food isn't worth trekking back for.
