My boyfriend and I live outside of Doylestown, PA.  Having grown up in Trenton, I've been dreaming about having a Trenton tomato pie for years.  Finally I convinced my boyfriend to take the drive to DeLorenzo's in Robbinsville to experience Trenton tomato pie.  We thought it was pretty good even though I thought it was a little skimpy on the tomatoes.  What I remember is the distinctive rich flavor of the tomatoes.  Well, last night we decided to try Papa's version now down the street from DeLorenzo's in Robbinsville.  BINGO!  That's what I remember!  It was perfection!  This is the place to go if you want a taste of the classic "Trenton tomato pie."  Thank you, Nick!  You'll be seeing us often!  It may be a 40 mile drive but it's worth it!
