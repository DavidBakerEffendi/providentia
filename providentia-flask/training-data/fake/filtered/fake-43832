Disappointed!! My family of 4 went there for the first time.  4 out of 4 water glasses were dirty with lipstick stains.  My 7 year old son ordered spaghetti.  It had random pieces of corn in it (which he then would not eat his meal).  When I asked the staff why that would be, I was told they use the same strainer to strain corn and spaghetti.....shouldn't they rinse/wash it first?? I would have if it was made in my own home, much less a restaurant.  I got the French Dip, which was overcooked and fatty.  The only thing that was good and cooked well were the French fries.  Our server was polite and attentive, however it took a lot longer than the average diner to get our food. Very disappointed, especially considering the amount of great diners within driving distance to this one.  PS we sat near the window and it was cold, all 4 of us ate with our jackets on.   There were dead bugs on the windowsill, but even worse a small fly flew into my daughters food while she was eating. ....and we went on January 12th.  Shouldn't all the flies be dead?...because they are dead outside.
