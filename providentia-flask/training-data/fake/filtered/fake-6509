Experience would have been a whole lot better had the hostess actually known how to do her job.  Walked in and were told it was going to be a 30-40 minute wait for a table.  We had no problem with that.  After reading the reviews here and figuring we were a walk in on a Saturday night without reservations it all seemed pretty good. Sat at the bar and watched as other parties large and small walked in and were seated before us.  Based on the conversations we overheard, not all had reservations either.  The trick seemed to be standing in front of the hostess which appears to be the only way she remembers you asked for a table.  We also checked in with her while we waited and were told it wouldn't be much longer. Finally, one hour and 40 minutes later - after we were the only ones left at the bar -  we were seated with no apology.  Table service was good.  The food was okay, it definitely didn't live up to the raves people gave it here.  There's nothing unique about pasta with shrimp or sauce, fresh mozzarella, flat bread pizza, a 1/2 roasted chicken or fried calamari in the NY City area. Absolutely no need to go back here, I've been to better restaurants than this in Staten Island.
