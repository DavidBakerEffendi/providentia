Look I will only say this once:  This cafe is the best in town for noodle soup noodle!!! I have read other negatively reviews and it just ain't true--sorry to say, but you may have to be Asian to tell if this place have good Pho.  This is the one restaurant that all singers and stars stop in when they are in Philadelphia. Again, all they serve is noodle. The only thing I suggest for the owner is they need to expand their business for more space--the current space is too crampy.  I never have enough time to finish my soup because there are so many people in line. Congratulation and wishing you much more success!
