Spectacular food, incredibly warm and comfortable atmosphere, superb staff! The grilled octopus and mushroom paella are simply out of this world. But so is everything else on the menu... Plus, you get complimentary sherry and delicious biscotti with any dessert order. Chef Flay with a modern Spanish flair. What a treat!
