Tampopo? More like TamPOO-POO. This place is disgusting. If you're thinking about ordering from here, think again. Upon opening my take out container the room was immediately filled with an unidentifiable stench. After force feeding myself in order to get my ten dollar's worth (not a good value), Â my stomach was writing in pain. I would rather starve than ever order from Tampopo again. Save yourself the heartache and stay far away from this establishment.
