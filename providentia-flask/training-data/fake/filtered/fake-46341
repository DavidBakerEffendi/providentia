Nice ambiance. Lovely decor. Friendly vibe from employees. Young and upbeat atmosphere. Food is pretty good. Presentation is excellent. Filling and delicious on a cold, rainy day. + What everyone else said. + I saw Sarah Jessica Parker waiting in line to eat here. (Yes, she was waiting in line. I know. Weird. Celebrities gotta wait in line?)
