I feel rather alone in this but I was not at all crazy about Ah Pizz. Tried it for first time on a Saturday night around 6:30 and they were not at all busy. We were able to snag a spot right in front. I was a little skeptical at the lack of clientele but still willing to give it a try. I didn't love the crust which although thin, was still doughy and undercooked. Middle of the Margarita pie was soggy and unable to hold its shape so the cheese slid right off and ended up on the plate. They simply do not give their pies enough resting time and they are not at their peak right out of the oven. The second pie we ordered was the Montclair and yes the ingredients were top notch but $18 for a pie only as big as a large dinner plate is just not worth the money unless you are in NYC which is to be expected. Our arugula salad was OK but a bit heavy on the Parmesan shavings and too light on the actual salad? Our waitress brought our first course to the wrong table as we watched her knowing she was making a mistake and waiting for her to figure it out. I just chalked it up to inexperience and lack of attention. The host was friendly but I think he sensed that we weren't raving about the food and tried to over compensate by his heavy use of meant-to-entice adjectives to describe what we were eating AS we were eating it (not a fan of having to talk with a mouth full). Overall, not a bad experience, pizza is good and even filling but for both the money and quality of the food, to say nothing of the portion sizes, Arturo's in Maplewood is far, far superior.
