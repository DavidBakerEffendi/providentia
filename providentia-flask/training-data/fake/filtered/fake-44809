First and last time I will ever place an order for delivery again. Not even sure I would go and dine there either since the food was bland, soggy and not worth my money. Called and placed an order for a Fat Elvis sandwich (arrived cold and the fries inside were hard as rocks plus the bread was extremely soggy), Caesar Salad (good portioned salad with enough dressing for a salad half the size), and fried Calamari (breeding was soggy and the order was cold). I've had plenty of deliveries from other places that arrive nice and warm, there's really no excuse.
