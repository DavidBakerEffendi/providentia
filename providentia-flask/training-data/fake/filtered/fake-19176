I will have to admit that I have not yelped about August yet b/c I want to keep this a secret from the rest of the world but it's just not fair so here I am.  August is my absolute favorite restaurant in Philly, not just S. Philly but ALL of Philly - pretty bold statement your saying well it's that good!  I have never gotten anything here that was not absolutely delicious, from the beet salad that is perfect every time to the different flavored creme brulee's, everything about the food and the atmosphere is always divine.  On most occasions the owner even came to the table to make usr everything was ok, how often do you get that kind of treatment these days at upscale restaurants?  My only complaint would be the servers are not very friendly, they are attentive but it's not the kind of service that you would boast about, even when I we have eaten there and had the same server they still seem very stiff and bored to be waiting on you and so far they haven't remebered us and we have been there at least 15 times but hey, the owner talks to us so whatever.  The service is the ONLY reasonj I didn't give this place a the full 5 stars.
