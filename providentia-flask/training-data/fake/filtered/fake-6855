Just recently went here for a friends birthday and had an absolute BLAST. The food is excellent and the ambiance is very fun and unique. Great place for dates. I suggest the foie gras doughnut...its amazing but share it because it is rich and intense. I also love the option they have to graffiti the bathroom. I like places that encourage breaking boundaries and this place really does it. The menu is creative and even though the prices are a tad high (round $20 a plate) you get a really full meal. The chicken and woffals and fish n chips are huge servings, so sharing is a definite. Bravo!
