Amazing spot in the West Village! I have lived in the area for 4 years and we have been waiting for the perfect, local Italian spot with innovative food, a friendly staff and a fun atmosphere. I went there for a Friday night date spot with my boyfriend but I will definitely come back for my next girls night out!
