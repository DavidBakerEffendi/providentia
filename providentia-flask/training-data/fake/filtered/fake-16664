Been to this restaurant a few times. I love their calamari...it is awesome. They make it really fresh and it melts in your mouth. I also ordered it for delivery and it came rapid fast and still piping hot when I got it. Â I also am fond of falafel and they make a beautiful falafel platter. I've only tried one of their fish dishes, the Sea Bass, and it was so light and grilled to perfection. I would recommend this restaurant if you like seafood and like to try different things. By the way the service is excellent.
