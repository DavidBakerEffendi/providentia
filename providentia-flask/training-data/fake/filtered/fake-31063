My girlfriend and I adore this place!  We were out late shopping one evening, and stumbled upon Prme 16 in Orange, releived to find that the kitchen was open late.  The burgers are amazingly imaginative, the ingredients fresh, the beer selection out of this world.  Great people, great staff.  We'll definitely be back!
