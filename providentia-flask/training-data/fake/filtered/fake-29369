I've been a loyal fan since I was 7 years old with my dad.. Though the price has been increased to $2.50, it's still very much worth it --- Falafels used to be my favorite, but I love the hummus, babagannoush and tabbouleh sandwiches here as well to vary it up (all $2.50 as well) Open until really late so great snack after a wild night out - If you haven't tried a Mamoun's Falafel yet, you're totally missing out
