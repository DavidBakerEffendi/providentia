DO NOT GO HERE   The "waitress" was so rude, my party of three was forced to leave mid dinner.  We walked in before the dinner rush without reservations and were told we could take a seat.  If we weren't welcome, they could have just said so and we would have gladly gone anywhere else.  The waitress was SO shockingly rude, I almost fealt like bursting into tears.  Let me make it clear that my guests and I are just normal, polite, young women and did not warrant the behavior in any way whatsoever.  When we placed our orders, one entree and two appetizers, the waitress responed with, "That is all you are going to order?".  I was literally shocked.  We left then and there.  Not to mention, the owners are Polish and I happen to speak Polish so I was able to understand everything the horrible waitress said about us to the cook.  PLEASE do not give them your business.
