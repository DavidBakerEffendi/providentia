The only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because the food is great. The service on the other hand is not. My sister made a reservation with a months notice. There were ten of us sitting at one round table. I had to place a plate on my lap as I ate because there was no more room on the table. Eventually a glass of wine tipped over costing my sister her shirt. We were not asked for drinks. I understand it's a BYOB but not everyone wants to drink wine at dinner. It was my birthday so I had to talk with everyone at the table. The waitress kept asking me what I wanted to eat. I didn't even get a chance to pick up a menu. I let her know twice. She then stood over me as I looked over the menu. I couldn't take the pressure, and I ended up not getting an entree. When we finally moved to a bigger table things became all right. We got a different server, his name was Chris, and he was lovely. When we got the bill there was a $40 fee added to the appetizers section. When my sister asked they waiter let us know it was a cake fee. Why would you put $40 fee under an appetizer section, and not just a fee? I guess it's a good thing we checked over the bill. My sister already asked if there was a cake fee, and they said no. The waiter said sorry so many times, and the $40 fee was deducted from our bill. Â  If you're not of the up most class or to their standards don't expect to be treated kindly.
