Very disappointing. small drink high prices, as well as the drinks were not made correctly.  Worst  mojito ever.  The think the bartenders need to go back to school to learn to put alcohol in the drinks and learn how to actual make drinks, not just pour tequila.   The food was ok - actually not.  Very bland but you can add hot sauce, still did not help.  Sorry there are a lot of other and better choices in West Hartford center. The ambiance is nice and the wait staff was good.
