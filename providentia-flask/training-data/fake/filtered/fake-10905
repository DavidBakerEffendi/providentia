Let's see where do I start. How about I can't Give negative stars so I am forced to give 1 completely undeserved star. Well, we were seated and then asked to move because this particular table in a room of open tables was reserved. Menu seemed promising, food had no flavor, house salad is dressed in oil, asked if salad could come with no onions and was told they do not come with onions, imagine my surprise when the salad comes out with a huge red onion right ontop. I even asked for a plate to place my onions from my salad on and the waitress didn't get my sarcasm. My side pasta tastes more like spaghettio's, actually I think that may actually have more flavor. When we didn't finish our meals no one asked if everything was ok with our food, and we waited 25 minutes to get our check. We actually were standing up to basically slap a 20 on the table and leave, but as we stood we were finally approached and given check. When she came back with my change it was a dollar short, this bothered me because she was getting zero tip, miss personality didn't deserve it. Staff just looked bothered by being there and the decor was like a run down Olive Garden. Will never recommend, ever!!!!!
