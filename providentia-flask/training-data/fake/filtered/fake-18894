One word - WOW! Definitely worth the wait. Sat bar side with friends. Our server/bartender Victoria was the best. Her suggestion on the devil egg appetIzer and her skillful hands in crafting drinks made the whole meal that much better. Cannot describe how delicious the Mac and Cheese and full bird was - try it and see. Completely over the top!
