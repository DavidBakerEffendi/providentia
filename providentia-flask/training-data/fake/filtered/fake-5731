Since the last time I was here for takeout, which was a couple years ago, this local Chinese restaurant has gone from just OK to just awful. I brought home dinner for my family of four the other night, and it was simply inedible.  The won ton soup tasted like dirty dishwasher must, with no flavor or seasoning whatsoever, and wontons that disintegrated and turned to mush as soon as they hit the spoon or your mouth.  Mealy and disgusting.  The sesame chicken was equally nasty, overcooked and dripping with a sweet sauce straight from a jar... or from three days ago. I should have known when I went to pick up my takeout and only one person was in the dining room.  Avoid this restaurant at all costs.
