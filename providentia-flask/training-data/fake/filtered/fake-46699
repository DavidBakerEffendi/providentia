Turkish food with a simple focused menu and reasonable prices on the upper east side. The selection of meze's was very impressive. I've tried 9 of them, and all of them were quite good. Especially, Arnavut cigeri(Lamb's liver) and Mercimek kofte (lentil kofte) were delicious. The Shepherd's Salad was just as it should be with all the fresh ingredients. Try to go slowly with the meze route preferably with raki. A major downside is the atmosphere. The decor is very nice yet the music was far from authentic.
