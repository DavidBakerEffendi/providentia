Govindas' has always been disorganized and completely devoid of customer service in any way, shape, or form. In fact, their food was the only pleasantry about the entire establishment.  Even so, the quality of the food has declined so rapidly over the past couple of years that even their most popular dish, the chicken cheese steak, has gone from delicious to practically inedible. The fake meat is hardly cooked, drenched in fake cheese and veganase, and carelessly thrown into a depressing, flavorless wrap.   On top of that, the prices have increased! Inexcusable. Disgusting. Stay away.
