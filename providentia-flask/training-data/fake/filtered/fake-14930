The owner/manager was VERY rude to us. He called my family, in front of my 7 year old son, an a**h****. We went to Mama Palma's for dinner when our daughter, who lives out of state came into town.  We arrived before she did and was seated at our table. While we waited we ordered an app and two beers.  My husband had to go outside to give directions to our daughter and while he was away our server came over and told us that the owner said we had to order immediately or we had to pick up our app and two beers and sit in the hallway and wait until my daughter arrived. We ordered our pizzas without our daughter arriving yet. After we were done our meal the owner told us to never come back again. As we were walking the outside of the building the owner walked to the window, knocked to get our attention and waved to us in a mocking manner. He then preceded to walk out of his restaurant and call my family including my 7 year old son, a**h****.and than kept yelling at us. I will never be back again nor will I ever recommend it to anyone else.
