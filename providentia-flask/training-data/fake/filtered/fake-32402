I love this place.  If you are in the mood for a gourmet pizza, this is the place to go.  The Old Smokey is unbelievably delicious.  The owner is often there making pizzas and tending the register himself which is good to see.  There isn't a ton of seating but they do set out tables on the sidewalk and most of the time, I'd take it with me anyway.
