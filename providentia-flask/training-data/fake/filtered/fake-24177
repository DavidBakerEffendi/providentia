The food is the best!  The most delicious sandwich you will ever have no matter which one you order (and then you will dream about it later.)  We are from L.A. California and visit Hershel's any chance we get to be in Philadelphia....even take to go back on the plane...seriously!!  The people are the nicest and really care about their customers.  We were never disappointed.  THANK YOU STEVEN AND YOUR WONDERFUL STAFF!!!! WE LOVE YOU AND CAN'T WAIT TO COME BACK!  You truly make us feel like we are family and we wish you the best.
