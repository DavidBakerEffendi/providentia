My experience from beginning to end at Yerba Buena was phenominal.  I met 4 of my girlfriends for dinner and was greeted by the friendliest hostess who immediately offered to take my coat.  They were right on time with our reservation and the nicest manager ever walked us to our seat.  Then the food and wine, where do I begin!?  The Malbec and Pinot Noir - wonderful. The fish tacos, arepas and cod left me moaning with each bite.  And they have THE best calamari I've ever had.   Every time I needed a refill or anything at all a new staff member was there assisting with a smile.  Then at the end of the dinner, we paid our bill (which by the way, was not that expensive) and sat at the table to catch up more.  The manager, Angel, needed the table for another 5 top and instead of just telling us we had to leave (which i totally understand needing to turn tables) he graciously and politely asked if we can give up the table and in exchange would buy us a glass of Champagne.  I have been to so many restaurants in the City and cannot stop telling people about my wonderful experience here.  I cannot wait to go back!
