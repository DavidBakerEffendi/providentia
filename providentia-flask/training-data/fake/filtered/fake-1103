5 stars because it's delicious, has an expansive menu, is totally affordable (borderline cheap), food comes out quickly, waitstaff is attentive, and it is delicious.  Roti canai, mango tofu, pad thai, fried banana, etc. all sooooooo good!  They deliver.  They take credit cards.  They are open at 1am.
