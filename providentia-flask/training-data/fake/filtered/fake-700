Wow. Coming from California I am a very picky Mexican food eater. This was incredible. I had the soup with avocado, cheese and tortilla strips. The perfect amount of spice and flavor. My friend ordered the huevos con chorizo and it looked incredible. They have home made corn tortillas and delicious salsa. The atmosphere is darling. There are Chinese lanterns hung up, a few booth-esque options and a really long community table. Service was great. Casual and delicious.
