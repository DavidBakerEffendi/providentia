I would like to be able to comment on the quality of food here. I would also love to be able to tell you that the staff was friendly and the atmosphere welcoming. I'd love to tell you that me and my group of nine friends happily spent too much money on Udon noodles because the experience was so great. Unfortunately, all I can tell you is that the rude and arrogant staff decided to type cast our group, invent an unreasonable minimum after giving us the run around, and turned away an excited group of diners when their establishment was empty. In a neighborhood with more than a few options for delicious food, with tons of those offering the exact same fare, I recommend finding a different restaurant.
