Five of us had reservations for this past saturday night at 8:30. We walked in right at 8:30, the place was a  mob scene.. The hostess said it will be about 15 min. We got a drink. Stood in the craziness for almost an hour, checking once with the hostess, after about 30 min. She told us to be patient.  After 20 more minutes and trying to call other restuarants, to try and eat something. We ended up leaving. The hostess actually seemed happy that we were leaving. Probably to free up  some space.... Never go back, total disaster...
