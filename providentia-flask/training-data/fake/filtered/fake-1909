Looks cool? Really people? This is a jersey shore restaurant in the middle of redhook complate with fake retro kitsch atmosphere. So sad as this part of Brooklyn is full of people who care so much about the arts(of which food is one). Great place to go in your convertable Ferrari and fist pump your buddies while getting crappy food at best. Lame
