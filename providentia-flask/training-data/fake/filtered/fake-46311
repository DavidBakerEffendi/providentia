Really fantastic Ramen. I have been there twice and I try and go there whenever I am near it. And with two notable exceptions, I always fail. Seriously, the line is always two hours. I was able to go there once on the night spring break started and all the students had already left, and once when I came 15 minutes before they opened on a rainy day. I'm giving it 4 stars because the staff can be a little aggressive (based on one time, which was partially our fault). But the food is really great.
