I recently had a party in the Barrel Room downstairs in Park Avenue Tavern.  What a success!!  Every time I turned around I saw smiling faces and my family/friends having a great time!   The mimosas (and other drinks)  along with the appetizers we ordered were delicious!!  The televisions were perfect for the basketball games followed by a yankee game. Eugene and Matt were wonderful to work with.  They were always making sure the party was running smoothly!   It was a huge success and took a lot of weight off of my shoulders knowing that they were taking care of everything. The event coordinator was a pleasure to work with on email throughout the planning process.  She was always ready to help and answer questions.   The bartender was great and kept the party going throughout the time there! Thank you so much!  We look forward to having more events and attending parties at Park Avenue Tavern in the future!  If you haven't been there yet, definitely check it out.
