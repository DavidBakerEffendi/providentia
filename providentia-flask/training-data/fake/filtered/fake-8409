Very disappointing all around.  Food was so-so (chicken and waffles and brisket sandwich).  Not nearly as good as some people on here suggest.  (I guess their taste buds are dead).  It is also extremely loud.  I have been to bars that are quieter.  Speaking of, it seemed like 1/2 the place was full of drunk people, and it was only 10pm.  Music is blaring.   Annoyance: People just walked in and out, sat down at tables, and didn't even order food.  Just joined their friends and took up space, while me and my fiance had to wait to be seated.   Service was decent, our server was very nice.  Bathrooms were foul.  I walked into a stall that smelled like a someone dropped the Hiroshima of farts.  I almost barfed my meal.     If you are looking for a fun place to hang out, Jones is ok.  If you are looking for a good meal, this is the last place I would suggest.  The chef seems to churn out food factory style, rather than with individual flair.  They should just convert Jones to a bar and call it a day.   Final verdict: Walk by Jones quickly and make your way to the Thai place across the street (or any other place for that matter).
