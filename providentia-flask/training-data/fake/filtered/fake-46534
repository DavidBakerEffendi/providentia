Great pizza. Horrible service. They just take the orders out whenever so someone who sits down WAY after you could end up getting their pizza before you. I know that sounds a little nitpicky but that sort of thing really ticks me off. The pizza itself is really good. If you have to stay in line for over an hour save your time and come back a different time or go to the one in Hoboken.
