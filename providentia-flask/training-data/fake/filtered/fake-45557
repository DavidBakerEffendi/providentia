My husband has been coming here with his family since he was a little boy in the '60s - the food is home cooking at its best and the portions are abodanza!!!  We went there on our first date and we had zuppa de mussels and steak pizziola.  I was hooked right then ;)  There's home-made house wines red or white. No other alcohol is served there. I've had so many things off of that chalkboard menu since that first date and every dish outdoes the one before it.  My favs are the baked clams, linguine w/clam sauce, chicken/veal Don Pepe, Suffed Artichoke and cold tomato/greenbean salad.  Who am I kidding I can't even name favs because I'd have to keep writing all day!  Just go.  If you have a craving for grandma's old world cooking and can't make it yourself, then take your family over for the best meal served family style.  If you're lucky enough to be there on a night when the cheesecake is ready, OMG is all I can say.
