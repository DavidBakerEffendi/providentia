I wish I could give it a rating of zero stars. I heard through the grapevine that this place has a ROACH and possibly a MAGGOT problem. Even though I heard this through the grapevine, I know it to be the truth, because the person who said it works there! So there is definitely some truth to it. I find it utterly disgusting and alarming that this person wouldn't speak up and let someone like the health department know! Too worried about getting paid, than letting the public know about this stomach turning problem. I've warned a lot of people, but to no prevail, so I hope this catches someones eye. P.s. I heard of a recent situation where someone found a roach and/or spider in their chilli coney. I'm sure there's some truth to that as well. DON'T EAT THERE!!!
