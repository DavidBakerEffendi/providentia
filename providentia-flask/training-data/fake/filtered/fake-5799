Headed to the Counting Room last night to meet up with friends for drinks and bites.  This place is such a perfect  spot--the garage door up, warm light from the setting sun filtered in, gently illuminating the bar's woodwork-meets-industrial feel (amazing woodwork, by the way!), we easily lost track of time. The service was great; the staff are friendly and helpful with food and drink selections, though truthfully I think it's hard to go wrong.  The wine list is amazing and the food is ever so tasty.  Not to be missed: the warm bag of croutons, the cheese plate and the Counting Room Grilled Cheese. Loved the downstairs cocktail lounge... great bartenders serving even greater cocktails!   Count me as a fan!
