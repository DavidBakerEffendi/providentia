Great experience!  We just had dinner at this delightful restaurant and had a wonderful time.  Nice wine selection in an intimate environment - the tables are pretty close to each other but we didn't mind.  The appetizers and dinner selections were all amazing.  On the night we were there, they had an heirloom tomato and mozzarella said which was perfectly seasoned.  Service was attentive, very happy to stumble upon this place!
