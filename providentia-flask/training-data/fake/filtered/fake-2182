I went there with my whole family and we had 2 kids! The hostess at the door both are very rude and are always on their cellular phones very unprofessional! then they threw us in this so called "kid room" where they throw all the people with kids! Loudest room I've ever been in my whole life!! they gave us this little coffee pot which was kind of nice until i opened it and seen mold in it, it looks like they don't wash them they just keep reusing them! my coffee mug had lipstick all over it! and my kids eggs had black curly hair inside of it. The waitress we had was a very rude fat lady with a huge belly idk if she was pregnant or if she drank beer but she was very bad mannered and she scared my children! When i went to pay my bill i see that one of the hostess with a really tight shirt on and one of the owners I'm guessing its his father were screaming to each other in front of all the customers then completely ignoring the fact that Ive been standing at the register for about 5 minutes they both walk away and leave. keep that personal stuff at home! both of the owners are so rude and do not know how to smile! idk why they own a business like this if they cant be friendly!! I've been to a couple diners but this is the first time I've seen this kind of behavior! Then my mom and dad shared a meal because their portions are huge well they charged us for every cup of coffee that my father drank! idk but these people really do not know how to run their business!!! People i do not recommend this place at all! i think you should stay home and sit down like a nice family and eat break-feast in your kitchen because family time cant be replaced with anything!! and if you have kids that will be very important growing up! Have a wonderful Day and GOD BLESS!
