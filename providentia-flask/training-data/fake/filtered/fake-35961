to start, i'll say i was pleasantly surprised. i was genuinely confused when friends raved about roberta's. my confusion undoubtedly stemmed from the fact that from the outside roberta's looked like the shadiest of shady places. however, you are, in fact, pleasantly surprised when you walk in to a cool place, with a warm feel to it. the food takes too long to get to you, and isn't all that spectacular in contrast to what you pay. but overall, it's not bad, and is a fun neighborhood spot. i also hear brunch is awesome, but i've not experienced it myself.
