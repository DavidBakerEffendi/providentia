Great Banh mi fix.. Love the beef bulgogi and don't forget the Joju Banh mi fries and remember to load it up... it's a clash of the american fries with a vietnamese twist... so must better then the old ketchup and pepper topping... Also for a wake up call the Vietnamese Coffee is a great kick to jump start the day no matter what time of day or night it is!!
