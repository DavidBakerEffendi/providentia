I love Cheesesteak!  It is one of the first things I look for on a menu.  Unfortunately, a very rare few places around the country actually serve up a real Cheesesteak Sandwich.  I made it a point at one time to make a trip to Philly to get the real thing.  Fortunately, I had the help of a local friend who directed me to Pat's King of Steaks above all others in town.  They do not disappoint.  Granted, this South Philly neighborhood is not the most ideal to bring the wife and kids, but it is the best to find a REAL Philly Cheesesteak.  This is a world class experience like none other to stand in the footsteps of Rocky Balboa and order a good ole "Cheese Wit." If you are looking for the kind of junk you find on most American Menu's, then yes you will be disappointed.  But if you want the real thing from the place it originated, Pat's is the place to go.
