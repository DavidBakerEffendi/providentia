Tinto being called a disappointment would be an understatement,Tinto was horrible. I'm a 12 year old kid who has had the opertunity to eat in top restaurants by chefs like Tom Colichio, Bobby Flay, Wolfgang Puck and other amazing chefs. This so called "Iron Chef" made me think why am I here. The service for drinks was unbelieveably slow. My parents said it was one of the worst drinks they had ever had. The food was completely mediocre. We had one dish, the butter poached lobster which blew my mind. But everything from there was not good. We ordered about 8 dishes. About 6 of which were meat, fish or shell fish. The "kobe beef" was tougher than leather, the octopus was very tough as well. The tapas style dishes are fun, but  don't charge $7 for 9 peices of glorified tater tots that you call "crispy potatoes" with"tomato compote" that tasted like sour candy and blue cheese sauce that didn't seem like it had blue cheese. In fact, most of the dishes lacked flavor. Back to the tough octopus served with a soggy and stale tasting homade potato "chip". Have I said enough? NO! The pork belly canopy  was all fat little to no meat and the mushrooms were over salted. So I tell you today that Tinto had careless service as well as mediocre and over priced food. So just don't go. "Iron Chef" Jose Garces you should not be the next Iron Chef.
