This restaurant is a hidden gem in Newark. Do not expect a 3 Star Michelin ensemble, this is a take out place with a few tables to accommodate 20-30 people tops. This is a two person operation with a chef & a waiter and it gets busy at times causing some delays well worth it specially when you know you will be satisfied. The place is managed by chef Jean George Luis Alberto Monteiro which at times comes to your table, one perk you may not have if you visit the likes of Per Se, Nobu, Le Bernadin only to mention a few. Entree - Several dishes will blow you away such as: - "Picadinho"  Pork Cubes w/Shrimp sauteed in white wine peppers & onions" - "Dobrada" Tripe & Beans Stew  only available on Saturdays - "Churrasco" dry basted Chicken and/or Pork Ribs rotisserie style. Yum! Yum! Yum! respectively for the dishes mentioned above. Dessert - Rice Pudding is a must and the Flan when available is phenomenal not your typical rubbery Flan you get at your local shop this is the real deal soft but firm scrumptious at every bite. Pricing- A family of four (4) can dine here for less than $ 20.00,  unheard of in this day & age. BYOB  makes it even less expensive. Enjoy a good meal without leaving you wallet behind.
