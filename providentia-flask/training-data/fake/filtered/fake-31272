I went there with my wife tonight for our anniversary..  ordered the median steamed shellfish, which turned out to be bad.   The seafood wasn't fresh at all, 4 clams, 2 snail, 2 crabs, they were all gone bad,  that account for 30% of the food on the plate..  Also, at the end of the meal, we tried to get the noodle which should be free since our order was median size, but the waiter told us, they would charge us extra for it since he told us, "small' order doesn't include noodle... I was like, "can't you distinguish between small and median size".. I would definitely not want to come back again.. for a food with $50 and the bad experience..
