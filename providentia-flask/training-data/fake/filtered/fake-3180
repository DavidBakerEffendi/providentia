Went there on July 23, 2011, for the first time, went with my wife, my best friend and his wife. place is very nice, the food is up there with Solar do Minho, for which we all been going to for many years. I would go there in the future, but what turned us off was just after paying the bill, the waiter came to us and asked us to hurry up cause they needed the table for others, it was 10pm I didn't notice anyone waiting for a table, the bar wasn't busy at all, and I also saw other open tables. This was very unprofessional. I give it only 3 starts cause of them telling us to leave
