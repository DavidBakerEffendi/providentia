The first time I tried the southern sandwich. The chicken was so deliciously breaded and everything in it was so good I had to try another sandwich the next day. I got the buffalo and it was amazing. The chicken did not disappoint, the buffalo sauce was not like anything I've had, and they used real blue cheese chunks (not the liquid, ranch-like form). The sandwiches taste good even as heated leftovers. The sandwich size is between a shorti and classic from wawa, but the chicken pieces are large so it's filling. I definitely want to try their entire menu.
