Yes, this place has huge portions but all the dishes are over sauced. If I wanted soup I would have ordered soup! Also, I used to come for lunch or dinner and spend a good amount of money AT LEAST 1 time a week and never once did I get a free refill or even $1 break on my bill. I'm not asking for any favors or freebees, but that is not the way to keep customers. I haven't been there in a while but I also heard they raised all the prices and now charge for every little things, as well as some changes made to dish ingredients. People used to like this place because of the good food, low prices, and good company... Which it now has none of the above.
