This place is pretty close to perfect.  Amazing brick oven, wood fired pizza, incredible heros made with homemade, amazing dough.  Sauce is fresh, barely touched using great products.  Incredibly warm and nice staff both in person and on the phone.  This isn't a complaint but a request.... I wish they had a few more appetizer choices, i think they could do a really good fried mozzarella app, fried calamari, maybe an arancine? I also wish they would make a clam pizza which when done well by great pizza restaurants is absolutely amazing.   I just feel like they would do everything well and this would be great.  Keep it up Peppinos, you guys are great in every way.
