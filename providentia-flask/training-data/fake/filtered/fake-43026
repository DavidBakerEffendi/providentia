This is one of my favorite restaurants.  It's a perfect blend of classic and modern, and on top of that, the sushi is top notch.  I no longer live in the Hartford area, but whenever I travel there I make a special effort to visit Feng's.  I'm never disappointed in the service or quality.  In fact, I'm always impressed.  Servers and bartenders accurately explain the specials and take care of all customers as if they are regulars.   I can't say enough good things about Feng's!  Get down there, listen to some classic jazz on the sound system, and enjoy some awesome rolls. It's all good!
