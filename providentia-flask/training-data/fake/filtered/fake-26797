Love it!! Thanks for something new, different and delicious! You must try it!!! Just went by to try the Prosciutto and I loved it!! 1 pizza was enough for 2 people, the servings were vert vast, the sauce was delicious, and the dough AMAZING!!!!! It was cook in only 90 seconds, yes totally cooked in a wood oven!!! My only recommendation is to have Deliver Service, it has a good location but with the winter coming, I'll double think to dress up and walk in the snow instead of ordering another pizza.
