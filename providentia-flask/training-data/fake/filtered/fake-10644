The sushi is very good, if a little samey from dish to dish.  Good flavors.  Nice people working there. However, the restaurant is so, so small that after I sat down to eat, some dude and her awful boyfriend plopped down at the same table.  (There are only three in the whole place; evidently we're just expected to sacrifice all privacy.) I really dislike other people.  Must I be forced to endure their existence while trying to enjoy my food?
