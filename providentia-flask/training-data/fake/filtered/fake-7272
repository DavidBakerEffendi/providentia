balthazar is completely overrated. from bad service to bland bland food, its really disturbing that this place is an "institution" in nyc. blah. from burnt french toast to bland scrambled eggs, it was the worst brunch i've ever had. that and they seated us 30 minutes after our reservation time. the space is so incredibly loud. only saving grace, their bakery. their bakery is completely worth the hype and the line.
