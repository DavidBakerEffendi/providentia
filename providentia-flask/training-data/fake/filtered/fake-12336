This diner had a stigma attached to it from years past but it has changed hands and been rebranded Americana Diner.  The menu has been redone along with fresh baked goods, daily specials, and as to be expected top button stretching portions of mouth watering food. Forget the past and take a chance on the future.  Americana Diner is the best food for your dollar to be found in the area.
