If you are up for South-american ethnic Venezuelan traditional food this is IT. The common item on the menu is the 'arepa' filled with a home-made like stuffing. Is is so AUTHENTIC that the serving people make sure you wait for 20min before bringing the menu to the table, and you have to wait even longer before having them bring water and to take your order (in that case you are about to wait for the arepas pies to cook since the food is prepared fresh after the order) You the customer requesting a service for food and willing to pay for it; are subjected to wait while the attendants are chatting and gossiping among themselves, ignoring you for a long while. I think they are willing that you memorize the menu items on the second waiting period, either that or they want you to learn spanish by shock; the Latin music on the stereo IS very loud for such small area. * Food very good. * Price: $ (versus $$ at other restaurants of the same caliper) * Service: be prepared to leave the restaurant a lot older of waiting. ***TIP To avoid the PAINFULLY SLOWNESS ATTENTION it is imperative that you make sure the owner is in the premises, ASK FOR HIM / HER and pretend you want to meet with him / her. ONLY then is when the service is a little better.
