Amazing beer selection, knowledgeable and friendly staff!!  The menu serves up more than just burgers/wings, which I love.  Kudos to the chef as I've never had a bad meal!  Very spacious (never feels too crowded), dim lighting, dark wood, great music (which is neither club nor loud as stated in a recent review) - makes for a classy, cozy and relaxed atmosphere.  GO. NOW. You will not be disappointed.
