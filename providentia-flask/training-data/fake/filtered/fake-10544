We greatly enjoyed our dinner at Seoul Restaurant.  The owners waited on us and they were both so friendly and helpful.  They were very accomodating to my Vegan brother and his vegetarian girlfriend.  They even brought special appetizer dishes out for them with no meat or animal products.  My dol sot bi bim bap was delicious!
