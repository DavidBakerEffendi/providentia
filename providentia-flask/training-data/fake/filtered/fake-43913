After eating the meatloaf at Llama Tooth, I have cravings for it. It is turkey meat with broccoli, green peppers & onions with a tangy barbecue sauce, MMMMM. The crab cakes and the ahi tuna salad are also delicious. The patio is so perfect Â with the murals & tiki bar. I can't wait to try the brunch, on a september morning, on the patio !!!
