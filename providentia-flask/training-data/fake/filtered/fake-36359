My girlfriend and I were looking for a romantic spot to eat at for Valentines day, so we googled " romantic restaurants in NY" and Scarpetta came up; so we figured why not?! I have to say, it was a wonderful choice. Food was impeccable, and the service was amazing. Atmosphere was very romantic. I recommend this spot to anyone looking for an amazing pace to eat in the beautiful Chelsea, Ny. :) YES! It is a little pricey, but everything is worth it!
