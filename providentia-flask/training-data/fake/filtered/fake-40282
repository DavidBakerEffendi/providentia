Wow, amazing pizza.  I wouldn't call it the best in the city, but it's easily top 5.  We specifically stopped here on the Q train on the way to a Brooklyn Cyclones game out in Coney Island, and wouldn't you know it, they were closed for an hour (apparently they do that at random times during the day so it might make sense to call ahead).  But we begged and pleaded and they were incredibly gracious to let us in.  If you live in the five boroughs, you should make it your business to check this place out.  It's well worth the trip.
