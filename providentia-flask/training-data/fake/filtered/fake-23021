Fantastic food, great service, amazing selection, and fairly priced!  My friend and I went on a Friday night at 7 (with reservations) and we were seated right away.  I'm a very picky eater and their menu is quite extensive and they are very amenable!  The salads were fairly priced and great portions!  I do have to say that the dessert was a little overpriced.  It was $9 for basically a cookie and a scoop of chocolate ganache with 4 raspberries.  The atmosphere was great and the wait staff were fantastic!  I'm already planning my next trip :)
