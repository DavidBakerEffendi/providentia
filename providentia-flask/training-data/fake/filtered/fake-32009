Chengdu has to be the best of the best Chinese restaurants in Ct., let alone West Hartford.  It puts the Butterfly to shame, like apples and oranges.  The food is plentiful, the service outstanding, the drinks always made to your specifications, and prices are extremely reasonable.  The owner, who is also the bartender (A very smart move on his part!),  always says that "if we don't have it I can make it for you".  The menu is diverse and one can get authentic Chinese or American, all you have to do is ask.  Our family visits their at least twice a year for celebrations.  Enjoy!!
