HAHAHAHA I just joined Yelp today, and I wondered what people have to say about this place, since I hear about it so much, but when I visited and tasted the food I really did not understand what the noise is all about. So now it's my turn, and I only need one sentence to explain the it (from my point of view;)) when you had enough alcohol, then no matter what you are going to eat, it is going to taste great LOL Go and try Falafel and Shawarma in other places, and then decide if Mamun is really as good as they say, or just a nice place in a great location...
