I am a fan. Brisket was very tender and delicious, spare ribs were fall off the bone, wings were solid and sausage was good. This is a cafeteria style spot that has its charm, but I can see where this could be annoying if it were busy. First come first serve on the seating so a busy night will bring the hover! Overall I believe Dinosaur BBQ in Harlem is much better, but the brisket at Mighty Quinn's gets the nod. Still no one can compare to the wings at Dinosaur!
