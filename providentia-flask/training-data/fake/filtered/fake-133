This place sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Both Pat's and Genos are not worth the hype. If youre from Maryland, save the trip and just go to Jerrys or Continental down in kensington near DC. The service was horrible and there were no toppings! The flavor was so bland, we saved the subs and took them home to add toppings to it to not make it taste as nasty. Again, not worth the hype
