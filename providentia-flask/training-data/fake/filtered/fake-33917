LOVE this restaurant !!!! Amazing food and service. Incredibly flavorful food and drink. Innovative. Last dined there 1/29/11. Beet salad was phenomenal! Loved the Bronzini (type of fish) entree with the sage polenta side dish. Husband's rib eye entree with Irish cheddar mashed potato side was delicious and filling. Wonderful dessert which was an assortment of mousses referred to as "dirt" desserts on menu. Cocktails are soooo delicious! Was our second time here. First time had been about 1 year prior and it was good to see that it was still as wonderful as we had remembered it to be. Will definitely be back soon!!!!!
