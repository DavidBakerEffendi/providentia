I visited Amy Ruth on Saturday for dinner.  The line was not bad, we was able to get a seat fast since it was just two in our party.  I had the chicken and waffles with a side order of mac and cheese with sweet tea.  The food was fabulous!  I could not eat it all.  The food was served promptly and I was so surprise how fast. The cornbread was great with the butter. The trip to Amy Ruth was well worth the subway ride from downtown NY.  The next time I am in NY, I will go again.
