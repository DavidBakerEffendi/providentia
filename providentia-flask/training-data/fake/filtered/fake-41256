I had the cheese platter to start and all the cheeses where disgusting. The cheeses seemed like they where taken from a year old lunchable. Also there wasn't a wide variety of cheeses, cheddar, brie, blue cheese, all served on cold bread.  Then I had the burger. The burger was okay, not great but okay. The burger was well done when i asked for medium rare, the bread was cold, sweat, and trumped the fairly large burger in size. I have been here before and it is a nice place, the ambiance is nice and it is a good place for a pit stop for lunch. However there are some troubles.  If you want a high quality, every dish great, this is not the place. Luluc is more of a breakfast/lunch place.
