I loved this place when it opened!  Amazing pastas, great meats and most importantly...INSANELY good focaccia...but that has changed. Some rocket scientist over in the bakery department thought it might be a good idea to change the dough used in the focaccia...why? well because I guess Americans don't deserve to taste the real focaccia they make in Italy...and please don't try to wow me with telling me what mill you get your whole grain oats from...I don't care. I'm not eating focaccia to be healthy...I want to enjoy every sinful bite!  I am really disappointed...I grew up eating the original stuff in Italy and i was so excited to have access to that again...and then they changed it. And worst of all, they don't want to hear any complaints! One of the women at the focaccia counter pretty much told me I was wrong and unhealthy for wanting the original focaccia...One thing I have noticed though is that there is NEVER a line anymore at the focaccia stand and every other person who works it has told me they want the original back!
