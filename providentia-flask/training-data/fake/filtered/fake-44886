I live in the area and my boss recommended this place, so then I obviously had to go. I've been a few times now and love it every time. The two times I've been could not have been more different. First time was with boo, so nice and romantic by the front window, and the second time was with a large group of co-workers visiting from San Francisco. If visiting with a large loud group like I was, you may get a dirty look or two, since the ambiance is generally softer and more romantic. The food though, is awesome. In a city with a million different Italian restaurants, Emporio comes up with unique, interesting dishes that are deeeeelish. The waiters are very friendly as well. Probably one of if not my favorite Italian place in NYC. 5 stars!
