This place was amazing. Great sandwiches (I had the pork belly, and it was melt-away tender), but what sets the place apart are the loaded kimchi fries. They were unlike anything I've ever had before. Crazy delicious. We also sampled the chicken wings. They have a soy-garlic glaze that is really something special. We left stuffed and happy.
