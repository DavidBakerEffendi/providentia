A  mediocre wine bar with weird food and a glaringly bad vibe. The only way this place gets good reviews is because twenty-somethings flock to this place when they offer discounts. Only go if you are not paying, or not paying full price (when I was there everyone else in the bar has a coupon from  LivingSocial).   The second time I went, there was a homeless dude sitting right outside the window. Gross.
