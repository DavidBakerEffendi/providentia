Cafeteria-style service that serves Pakistani food. The food is oh-so-awesome. I'm Indian, and I believe these guys make up for the lost love between the Indian and Pakistani governments. Jokes aside, their kababs, rolls and biriyani are very fresh and delicious. Warning, maybe a little on the spicy side for those who can't handle spice. I have yet to taste their sweets, but when I do, I will review that as well. The service, however, is a little slow. Do plan on waiting a while before you get your food.
