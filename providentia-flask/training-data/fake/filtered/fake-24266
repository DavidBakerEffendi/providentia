Not sure about all the 4+ stars.  This place is terrible.  Definitely will not last long if they don't switch chefs ASAP.  Had chicken wings - very bland; grandmas fried rice with pork belly - even worse.  Only thing that might be redeeming was the thai burger.  We really need a better neighborhood Thai.
