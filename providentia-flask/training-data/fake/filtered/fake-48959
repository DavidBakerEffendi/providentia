Cozy and intimate atmosphere.  The food was very flavorful and delicious.  And the service was warm and friendly.  We started with the Moroccan salad and eggplant salad.  The eggplant salad was one of the best I've ever tasted.  For entrees we had lamb tagine and chicken couscous.  The sauce for the lamb was full of flavor and the couscous dish was seasoned nicely with delicious vegetables.  We finished with Moroccan tea which was also unbelievably flavorful, with a hint of mint.
