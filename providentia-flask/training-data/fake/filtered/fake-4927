Been eating here for years and the quality is consistently outstanding. I highly recommend the pollo Francese or lobster cannelloni. You can't go wrong with either and you'll want to keep coming back again and again to have your favorite dish. The restaurant is a bit on the small side and it can feel crowded and noisy in the heat of the dinner rush, but it's worth the trouble. The staff is extremely friendly and you generally don't have to worry about dealing with tourists. It's more of a neighborhood restaurant with lots of locals that the owners know by name. This may not be the best Italian restaurant in New York City but it's definitely one of the better ones and you won't be sorry you tried it.
