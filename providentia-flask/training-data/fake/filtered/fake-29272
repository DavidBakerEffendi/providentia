Whenever I'm in the west village, I have to go to Mamoun for a late snack after a long night of drinking.. It's either a falafel sandwich or shawerma they are both so delicious and with good price.. Just keep in mind, they don't automatically put napkins in your brown bag to go so if you don't have extra napkins on you, you're in a big mess.
