Hey Kids,...I grew up on this man's pizza having lived in the neighborhood all my life. You think its good NOW, you should have eaten it back in the 70's when the place was cleaner and there were no lines to get a slice. This whole hype thing is so funny to me as I have been eating this pizza for years. All I can say is that I love DiFara's  pizza and I will always have fond memories of walking up to the window on a Spring day and getting a slice. The pizza  may not be to everyone's taste, but it is a Brooklyn original just like all the other great pizza places in Brooklyn. Whatever you do, DON'T bring your car. There is no parking within 5 blocks of the place except on a Saturday.
