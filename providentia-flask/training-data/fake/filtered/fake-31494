My girlfriends and I were super excited to try this place for dinner. But were quickly disappointed. After we were sat at our table the waitstaff ignored us for a long time until one of us finally got up and hunted one down explaining that we were ready to order. Then the waiters continued to ignore us all night! It took about 30 minutes to get our cocktails and almost an hour to get any food. When the food arrived nothing was hot and seemed like it had been sitting under a heat lamp. Some of the dishes had some good flavor, but not good enough to offset the horrible experience. We skipped dessert as a result.
