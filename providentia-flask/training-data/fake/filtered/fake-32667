There's a reason PUB46 got voted BEST COLLEGE NIGHT BAR ON THURSDAYS!! It's a guarenteed awesome time no matter what night you go. Each night has something that fits everyones style, check out pub on facebook! My 2 favorite nights are the brand new Wed nights which consist of Karaoke, BP Tourney - CASH PRIZE $$$ and flip cup. The other night I really enjoy is Thursday nights aka COLLEGE NIGHT, 18 for ladies & win a trip to vegas, cancun or puerto rico, who wouldnt want that???!!! Every night has drink specials that are better than any other place in the area along with THE BEST bar food around. Everytime I'm there I could order the whole menu :) Shot specials throughout the night and Happy Hour is great as well especially on pricing !!!! Guarenteed a great time, I love everything about Pub46, especially the bartenders!... Don't be left out of the crowd, go down and it experience it for yourself!!
