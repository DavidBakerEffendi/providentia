Dined here once before and food was pretty good for Mexican food--not the best, but  good(wish I could find a great Mexican restaurant  in Essex county). A week later I ordered takeout on a Friday night for 3 of us. Don't recommend ordering burritos for takeout as it was very soggy when I got home.  Biggest problem was that when I got through half my burrito, I bit down on a piece of metal. Couldn't believe how lucky I was not to swallow it.  So I called the restaurant not even to complain or yell like some would but rather to let the manager/owner know what happened. I wasn't even looking to drive back to have it replaced with a new one(which I expected would happen).  His answer to me was " ok thanks for letting me know". That's it---no apology, not even an offer to get another burrito.   Needless to say I will be looking for another Mexican restaurant
