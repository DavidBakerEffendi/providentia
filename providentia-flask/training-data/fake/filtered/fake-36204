These people have some nerve! First off let me start by saying i signed Â up just so I could rate this dump. Sabor Peru offers subpar food for gourmet prices! Everything was bland and the host was over friendly in a annoying and creepy sort of way. Over priced and under seasoned! There's only one toilet in this place but luckily for the customer there's a park across the street! First and last time! Also, I should mention I'm Peruvian sooooo... DERP!
