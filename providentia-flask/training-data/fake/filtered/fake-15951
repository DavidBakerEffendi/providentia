Order Chicken Wings with pork fried rice as well as Pork Lo Mein- BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. Chicken wings were rotten, yes spoilt, call back to talk with the manager, he basically said that the Cook said the wings were good Pork Lo mein- contained either peanut oil, or peanuts or was cross contaimenated with nuts. Reason being that my both kids age 2 and 8 had allergic reactions to it. They are both allergic to nuts. Called to inquire whether they cooked with Peanut oil or nuts and of course they denied it. So as result of this report them to the local health board, so much for the "A" on the door.
