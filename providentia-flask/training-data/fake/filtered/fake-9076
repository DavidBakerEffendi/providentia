As a student I can honestly say that that nothing beats the wonder of this local institution.  The different combinations that are offered may at first seem odd, but each one is delicious in its own way.  A trip here does require some planning, because it doesn't accept cards or have seating.  However, the sandwiches are definitely worth any necessary considerations.
