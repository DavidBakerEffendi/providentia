I can't help but keep going back to Pisillo. I am never disappointed by their huge, awesome-tasting sandwiches. The price is a real bargain, considering the size of the sandwich and the generous amount of high-quality stuffing. This time I got the summer special 3, with authentic Italian ham, fresh mozzarella, arugula and tomatoes. I ate the whole thing and almost fell into a food coma. Great experience as usual.
