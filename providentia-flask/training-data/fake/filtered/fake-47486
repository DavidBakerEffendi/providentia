The food is pretty good, but the service is horrible to be very honest. It's ok to wait long hours outside (cuz it's popular), but it's not ok to deliver our pizza to the people next to us and have us waited for another half an hour for another pizza. Also, we ordered four toppings, but when the pizza came, it had only three. I asked the guy in charge about the mistake, he didn't even apologize, but he did ask if we wanted another one (come on, we've waited for an hour outside and another half an hour inside for their mistaken delivery ALREADY). When we got the bill, we just wanted to confirm the service charge (cuz nothing was explained on the bill), the guy acted as if we were to leave without paying, and said "you know what's twelve plus eight right?".....anyway the service was a huge disappointment and the bill part was even funnier... I know it's a popular spot and nobody there really cares if a few customers are treated in a pretty rude way, but in the future, this won't be a good sign for its development.
