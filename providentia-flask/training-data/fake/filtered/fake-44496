I went to this restaurant last week with a couple of my friends for dinner. Boy, was that a mistake!!! Food was below average and over priced. The service simply sucked. We had to literally walk up to the register for our cheque!!! WTF. Now, if the restaurant was busy, it is understandable, there were barely anybody!! Many of the reviewers are being too nice. No offense to anybody, if you know what good Indian food tastes like, this restaurant would get a big thumbs down. Hopefully, the restaurant management would see this and improve.
