My favorite place to get sushi!!  I am not a huge sushi eater as I don't eat fish, but I am still able to come to Miyas and get a great variety of choices of vegetarian sushi that offers fun and inventive tastes and textures to the non fish eating crowd.....Full of flavor!!   The TOKYO FRO's and soup are delicious also.  Add the friendly staff and comfortable atmosphere and you have a robust event you will not forget.   Along with having food that is an art form, Miya's is also exceptionally conscious about the imprint it's leaving on it's community and environment and takes great care in affecting it's surroundings.  This is not something I come across very often when it comes to where food is being sourced from and I am impressed with the social consciousness and responsibility that Miya's shows. I am always looking forward to concoctions that they come up with and the stories about how they came about, and appreciate their willingness to try new things.
