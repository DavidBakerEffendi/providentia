Went back there this past weekend with 2 other couples. We have not been there since Summer. . Its great to go back to a restaurant after a long time and still see the same familiar faces. We were seated in the big room with the high ceilings. One couple had never been there, so i was excited for them! We started off with a few appetizers, the specials are always worth a try! we got a stuffed mozzarella carroza that was delicious as well as oysters rockefeller (my choice). Both were really good. The server was a really nice guy, explained the variety of special entrees to us in depth. The guys all ordered the ribeye steak. GOOD DECISION! The steak is hugeee. I got the dry rub on it, med rare, came out perfect. This thing probably weighs about 2lbs. The girls got ravioli specials and a stuffed salmon, which also looked really good. The atmosphere was fun, couple of birthday celebrations nearby which we all chimed in to sing happy birthday. ALL 4 Bottles of wine were finished by the end of the meal . We shared dessert, a rum raisin tiramisu, which i later found out from the server that the desserts are all homemade too. Gotta love the homecooking! Reminds me of growing up in an Italian household. We will be back soon, this time we wont wait as long, as I am already craving that steak... Enjoy friends
