Wen here for early evening dinner with my sister and brother-in-law a couple of Sunday's ago, and had one of the best meals of all time:  the salmon entree with a creamy mustard sauce was wonderful, and the Caesar salad side was good enough to go back for by itself.  My companion's chicken marsala and half-roasted checken were excellent as well.The service was a little slow, given that it was pretty busy, but it was friendly and informative. On my own, I go here for drinks a couple of times a month and really like the neighborhood/sports-bar atmosphere.  Often wind up having good conversations with someone sitting near me.  For appetizers, the spinach dip is good, and the pizza is surprisingly so.
