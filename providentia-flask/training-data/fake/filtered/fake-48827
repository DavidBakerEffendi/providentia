Who is giving the restaurant all these high ratings??? I went here 3 times... months apart. I kept going based on the strength of the ratings. Each time I felt the rice was cheap quality and overly soggy and the meat (I had oxtail, curry goat and curry chicken), was poorly seasoned. My family is from the Caribbean and we know how good island food should taste. This is not it.
