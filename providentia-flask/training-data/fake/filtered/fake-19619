So good!  I initially didn't want to eat here because I was weary of "comfort food" and everything being loaded with fat and grease.  So when a bowl of potato chips came out with the waitress, I was even more flustered.  Firstly though, the place is nicely renovated, very clean and modern decor (also has a front patio).  The staff was friendly and attentive without being overbearing.  The only "healthy" items I saw on the menu was the Nicoise and Mediterranean salads. Since I wasn't in a salad mood, and because I already gave in and ate half the bowl of potato chips, I ordered the Rustica chicken.   My husband got the fried chicken.  My dish was relatively large with a breast and thigh, heaping pile of Brussels sprouts, and requisite mashed potatoes.  The chicken was so savory and fresh in a garlicky, Parmesan broths sauce. The sprouts with craisins and goat cheese were awesome, as were the mashed.  Three pieces of fried chicken on my husband's plate.  Perfectly fried and tasty. The coleslaw was really good and stil crispy (even though it was almost 9pm), and the cornbread was not too dense and still had a fluffy moistness about it. Overall, great dishes.  My only gripe is the teeny water glass sized iced tea.  When people are eating comfort food, they need at least a pint of iced tea! Next time I feel like splurging on my calorie count, we'll be back to try the buff Mac and cheese.
