I visited Sports Haven for their Thursday Night Trivia and it was better than I expected. What was once sort of a creepy place for OTB has had a huge overhaul. The trivia was a lot of fun, the prizes were generous and they had a lot of give-aways too. I was impressed by the friendly bartenders and the food was great. I really enjoyed all the appetizers and the steak sliders were real steak. If you're looking for a place to go after work for trivia that isn't over crowded or over priced this is the spot!
