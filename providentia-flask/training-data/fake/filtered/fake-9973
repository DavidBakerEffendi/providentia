Friend found a fried roach in her fries...I have seen many roaches at various times of day crawling on the wall. The staff did whatever they could to accommodate us. The manager? we dealt with was great so we keep giving this place a chance. I live closer to Green Eggs, but can't deal with the horrible service every time. Â So, Sabrina's we tried again today. Oddly enough, the service didn't quite seem the same. Are there new servers? Our food took a while. I order the "Lord of the Rings" stuffed french toast and my girl got the breakfast burrito. I felt as if we waited longer to get in, even though we called ahead. Our food was mediocre at best and I probably used up all my calories for one day, just from eating half. Giant portions don't make your food better, just bigger. Maybe I'll stick to MoGlo. It's a staple that I can deal with. So one star for you Sabrina's. And you get tgat one because the staff and mgmt are great. Sorry to all you lovers of this brunch. Adios mis amigos
