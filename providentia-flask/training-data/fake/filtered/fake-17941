My husband and I had dinner at Fricasse this past Saturday as well. Â We did not have a reservation but were fortunate enough to be seated. We shared the mussels for an appetizer and they were amazing. I had the Tuna and my husband had the hangar steak. Both were cooked to perfection. The Creme Brulee for dessert was the perfect ending. The restaurant was extremely busy and the entire staff was friendly and accomadating. Our waiter informed us that it was their third Saturday being open. I am sure they are aware of any short comings and will work on correcting them. We will definitely go back.
