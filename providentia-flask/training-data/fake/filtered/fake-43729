I love the food at Alta but that's about it.  I've enjoyed delicious meals here several times because the food is good but this review is really about the service.  I called to make a reservation on Thursday May 17th and I cannot even explain how rude the women in charge of answering the phone was.  She could not have been more annoyed that I was making a reservation.  When I confirmed the reservation on Saturday the person answering the phone (sounded like the same woman) was still very annoyed.   What the heck Alta?  Sounds like you need an attitude adjustment.   The food wasn't as good as it has been in the past The server was running around like a crazy person (I had to flag her down about 3 or 4 times to order, see a desert menu, get the check) After having to deal with the rude woman on the phone we were still seated about 20 minutes late There are way too many amazing restaurants in NYC to settle for this type of treatment.  Nice knowing you Alta.
