One of my favorite places to get brisket! All the food here is so delicious and the sides are great too! You get what you pay for and the food fills you up so go on an empy stomach. Â I give this place 4 stars because they are a bit on the pricey side as well as while I like the servers outgoing nature many of them are very sarcastic and that can upset certain customers.
