Went to the All You Can Eat Buffet at Mesob yesterday - it only happens once a year, on the Ethiopian New Year.  Everything was so fresh and delicious - 15 different dishes, vegan and meat, hot and cold, mild and spicy.  The house dressing on the mixed green salad (Ye'Mesob Selata) was excellent - just the right blending of seasonings.  It enhanced the taste without smothering it.  And I loved those crisps of spiced injera on top!  The buticha (pureed chick peas with spices) was a textural treat.  The little descriptive signs next to each serving dish were so helpful.  It gave me a great idea for my holiday party this year - I found out that Mesob CATERS!!
