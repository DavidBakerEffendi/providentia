The food here is subpar as far as Indian food goes, but sometimes I want a change from Chinese or Italian.  But the delivery service is TERRIBLE and not worth it.  I've tried ordering three times, and I get charged for delivery, even though I'm within 5 miles from the restaurant and order over $15 (their menu promises free delivery for under 5 miles and over $15).  My food is always lukewarm, and the naan is always soggy.  Also, the customer service over the phone is terrible.  They always rush you off the phone and are just rude.  I will not be ordering from them again.
