my kind of spot. not only is the food fresh and very tasty. but the people here are so nice and wonderful. from the mother to the son, all the way to the cooks, everyone is o helpful and always takes care of me. i also feel so comfortable in a restaurant when i can ask for something whether it be big or small, they always say yes, always. last but not least the price, for the amount of food they pack into that burrito, it's so worth it. not a week goes by that i don't stop by and eat.
