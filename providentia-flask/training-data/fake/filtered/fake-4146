Brooklyn Commune's dinner menu has done the impossible and trumped their awesome lunch/brunch offerings. As a vegetarian, I sometimes have trouble getting good dishes at non veggie places. Not here. The Brussels sprouts and potatoes are divine, and choosing between carrot risotto or Dijon pasta (which they do with or without duck AND discount if you go no Donald) is really, really hard. Â Oh and did I mention poprocks on sorbet for dessert? Yes! Brooklyn Commune for the dinner WIN!
