I placed an order on-line for 3 pies and 3 bottles of soda - total bill came to 100.00 - to be delivered to a university group on campus.  In the special instruction area I gave the phone number and name of the person who would be receiving the pizza.  The delivery drive dropped off the pizza to the building of the event, NOT THE ROOM, and gave it to students.  He never called the recipient of the pizza and we never received the pizza, BUT WE GOT BILLED FOR IT. DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM!
