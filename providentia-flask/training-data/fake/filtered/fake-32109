This Bahama Breeze location in my opinion is the best one in North Jersey. The service, quality of the food, and flexibility as far as getting what you want and how you want is what keeps us coming back. If you are ever near by, although getting a table is great, sit at the bar. The bartenders are great. Order appetizers and drinks. Kickback and have a great time.
