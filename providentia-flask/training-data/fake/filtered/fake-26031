this little cafe is really lovely - everything about it! its menu is eclectic, but don't let that intimidate you from trying a variety of items on the menu. i live in the neighborhood and go there often. among my favorites: classic cheeseburger (sooooo good!); coconut fried fish sandwich; pappardelle bolognese; vegetarian lasagna, zoe's malawa (for weekend brunch only - please try this); and the desserts are fabulous. all the ingredients are fresh, and they try to use local and/or organic produce whenever possible. the staff are incredibly friendly and kind, and there are so many regulars from diverse demographics. all in all - it's a lovely neighborhood cafe with delicious, fresh food.
