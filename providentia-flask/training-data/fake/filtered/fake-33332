The Tap Room never ever lets me down. The food is as good as it gets, service spot on. I just love this place. It's casual and the food is always amazing. The room itself is my idea of what a New York City restaurant should be: elegant, relaxed, NEVER stuffy or unwelcoming. Mile high windows bring in the excitement of the whole High Line thing but without fighting the crowds. I eat here a lot. The management is kind enough to hold our favorite table by the window. That's kind of how the whole place rolls. Hospitality a priority.
