First visit and not impressed. As others stated, no sign when you walk in so not sure if you should wait to be seated or seat yourself. Finally said the heck with it and sat down. Asked our waited what his favorite menu item was and he said the burgers, but don't order the house burger, not that good, order the locally grown ones. Hmmm...I ordered the Shepard's pie and my husband had the stew. My Shepard's pie was luke warm at best and my husbands stew had 2 pieces of beef. NOT what I expected. Would have sent my food back but by time the waiter came back to see how things where everyone was just about done eating. Told the waited my food was barely warm and he really didn't seem to care. Asked for a dinner roll, got a stale, toasted roll 10 minutes later. I could understand if the place was packed but it was not. Just seemed the waiter didn't care and it showed when he squatted down to take our order and laid his head on the table while he waited for us to decide. Trust me, his tip reflected his bad service.
