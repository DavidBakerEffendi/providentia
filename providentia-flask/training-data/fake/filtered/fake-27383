Honestly I don't get the good reviews about this place. At first looks great then you realize you made a big mistake. Food is terrible, pizza half cooked, bathrooms very dirty and not a single Italian working there. For a place to claim family own for so many years it's a crime. You can better pizza in Manhattan or Jersey.
