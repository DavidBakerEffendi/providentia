This was the second time I've eaten at the London and this time was disappointing. We were not served bread but noticed the couple seated next to us got their bread. (Different waitress) The dinner menu we were told is mix and match. As an appetizer ordered the Spring roll stuffed with duck which was very good but served just warm not hot. For the main dish I ordered Striped Bass with artichokes and it was tasty, however my boyfriend ordered Salmon over white fish and the size of the salmon was really small and didn't come with anything. So, he said to our waitress "Is this it?" who asked if he wanted to order something else. For the price of the dish we expected it to come with potatoes, rice and a vegetable. But I guess their dinner menu is a la carte. My beer was excellent; the Yards Love Stout.
