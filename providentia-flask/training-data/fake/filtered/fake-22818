This is probably the best find in the city for a cheap lunch or breakfast that isn't overprocessed, frozen, squeezed out of a bag food. As a student, this is a godsend if I need to grab lunch in the city. Do you know how difficult it is to find a sandwich in center city for under $5?! And even more, it's usually served with a smile and made fresh while you wait. (deli sandwich meats are sliced when you order!) The burgers are hugeeee, not amazing, but if you're in class for almost 6 hours straight, it'll hold you over til dinner. They serve breakfast allllllll day! Bacon, egg, & cheese is one of my favorites. For about $3.40? you get a freshly cooked egg, bacon and melty american cheese. I'll take that over the processed garbage they pump out at Dunkin. Their pancakes are mammoth and if you get a side of bacon, they're actual thick rashes of meat; unlike that poor excuse for a side that IHOP serves. Don't go out of your way to find this place if you're a tourist looking for a bistro lunch. But if you're running around the city and need a bite to eat, this is the place to go. Students and people who work in the city make up the majority of the customers. It's about as cheap as a food cart, but without the questionable hygiene.
