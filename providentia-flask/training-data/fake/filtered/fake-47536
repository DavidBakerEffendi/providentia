soooo we waited in line for 2 hours.. and it is quite annoying being a party of two and having parties of 4, 5, 3, ok one more party of 4 all behind us in line and seated before us. i felt like the ugly girl trying to get into studio 54 or something. then the pizza.. fresh moz, fresh salty olives, great! but the crust (i DO like thin crust) was burnt and not edible. after waiting 2 hours to get in i was STARVED and intended on devouring the whole pie. oh well. johns pizza in the west vill on bleeker st has the same coal brick oven pizza with no wait (well maybe like 10 mins).
