Love this place! Stopped by here with hubby and little one on a weekend walk on South Street over Memorial Day Weekend. We were not disappointed! We ordered two Turkish coffees and a Bulgur Salad Wrap. It was delicious! We ordered our little one a "Turkish Boorek," (i think I spelled that right!) which is like a cheese with potatoes inside of fylo dough. It was all delicious! The lady who works there (we think she is Turkish, because the restaurant emphasizes Turkish food) is just the sweetest lady around! I read a few of the others reviews, and they are right! It was like being at home with my husband's mother...only this lady was much more pleasant! ;-) Overall, it was a breath of fresh air to find this quiet gem on CRAZY south street and it spared us from the heat, but also the craziness outside. We will definitely stop by on our next trip.
