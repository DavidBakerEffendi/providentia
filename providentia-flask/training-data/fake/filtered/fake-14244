If it weren't for the fact this was fast food, I'd give it a solid 5. Only reason it's 1 star down. For what is regarded as fast food, Chick-Fil-A does a great job with keeping it relatively healthy. It is probably the last fast food joint that I still visit on the occasion. I particularly enjoy their spicy chicken sandwiches and their chargrilled chicken sandwiches. Personally, the simplicity of their sandwiches is their strong point. While I can't speak for other branches, in this Hamilton Chick-Fil-A the service is great. I usually go during their busy lunch rushes, and they do a great job of getting you to the register fast and then getting your food fast. The attitude of the workers definitely reflects the nature of the company, always willing to see to your needs and courteous all the way through. There's controversy over their CEO's stance on gay rights, but hey, he's one guy, let him have his opinion. Go to enjoy the food, leave the politics out. Or if it matters that much, don't go.
