What a delightful restaurant!  With its relationship to Dell'Anima, one expects superb service, fantastic food, and an excellent wine selection.  L'Artusi doesn't disappoint. Service seems very smooth considering how short a time they've been open.  The food was sublime.  There's an octopus appetizer that will suprise and please even unadventurous patrons.  The pasta dishes we tasted were excellent - the orrecchiette with sausage and bitter greens was delightfully spicy.  The spaghetti and meatballs is getting very popular, the server told us, and we could see why.  One dish - the tuna entree - included melt-in-your-mouth tuna, but an unidentifiable sauce.  Fortunately, there was no real need for the sauce.  The food on the plate was better off without it. Dessert is as you would expect.  Creative, delicious, with some incredibly delicate and some powerful flavors.  The Olive Oil Cake was to die for. Without wine, dinner was entirely reasonable; the addition of drinks would bring it to 'spendy!'
