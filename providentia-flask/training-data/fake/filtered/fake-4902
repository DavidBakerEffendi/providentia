WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER IN NEW YORK!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I am a lifelong resident of New York and was quite frankly shocked and appalled by the service at this restaurant.  The manager / owner was not only rude but threatening.  I have read the reviews here and while I will not comment on the food, there are tons of great Italian restaurants in the city and patronizing people who threaten customers is not something I would recommend.   With all the great restaurants in the NYC, especially Italian ones, I would recommend going somewhere where you don't have to feel threatened by the owners.
