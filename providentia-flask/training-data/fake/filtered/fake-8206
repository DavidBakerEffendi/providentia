I absolutely love this place. It is by far my fave spot in the LES. I have recomended several friends and no one seems to have complaints. If you go to Yuca Bar, order the "Pinchos Variados" which is an assortment of Skewers( chicken, beef and chorizo) on a bed of chimchurri sauce, served with a tangy tamarind like sauce, a bbq sauce and a chipotle sauce. It also comes over a mini flame grill so you can reheat your pincho Â while sipping on the Sangria and talking to your friends. The Sangria in this place is like OMG!!!!!! You only need two of them to feel the buzz, trust me. They are super strong, but sooooo DELISH. The Shrimp Quesadillas is Superb, the Guacamole mmm mmm mmmm creamy and delish , and the Expresso Ribs, are devine. The best day to go is on Tuesdays and Sundays because of Happy Hours, everything is half price. You can always sit out side depending on availibity, It's always nice to view the neigborhood that is up and coming especially if your from there. The staff is super cool and polite. Please note this place gets super crowded, so be prepared for a wait, but its oh so worth it. I LOVE YOU YUCA BAR!!!!!!!!!!
