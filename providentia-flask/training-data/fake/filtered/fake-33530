I was in confessional last week and I had an amazing experience!  The food was great (I recommend the taquitos, the empanada and the chicken!) the service was excellent.  when it comes to drinks, they are the best! My favorite is (devils advocate) the decor was amazing along with the "confessional" wall where you can write down your "sins" Overall - great experience!
