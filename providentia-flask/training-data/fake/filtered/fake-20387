I saw this establishment open recently but only got to try it this week for the first time. I've already visited twice this week and plan many future visits. I've eaten Indian at quite a few places in the city as well as in Northern NJ and I have to say that I thought the food here was well beyond any of the other Indian restaurants I've sampled in terms of freshness, quality and particularly flavor. I'm not quite sure what they're doing differently but dishes that are standard fare elsewhere stand out here on their own. The Chicken Tikka Masala has a creamier texture and a bolder flavor. Given that it's a regular buffet staple, I was shocked to find that it tasted like a brand new dish. I had it both at the lunch buffet and as a main dish for dinner and they were equally good. The Chicken Sagwala (it goes by a different name at Mausam but it's the same dish) was equally delicious though I would like it slightly spicier than the medium at which the dish was ordered. The Chili Chicken (yes, my family are all chicken fans) was hands-down the best version I've had to date. The chili spices stood out and gave the dish an Asian feel and flavor. Overall, the menu has an incredible variety and the owner will cook things to order. Add to this the constantly provided fresh garlic naan, the mint and onion chutney's and the crispy papadum and Mausam is a strong candidate to beat out its local competitors. I strongly suspect that I'll be wearing this restaurant out over the next year.
