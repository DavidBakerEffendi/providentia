While I like the Max Restaurant chain, I was slightly put off by an incident for my boyfriend's birthday. When I called 48 hours prior to our reservation of 6 to see what type of birthday cake they had, they gave me 2 choices, both of which wouldn't have appealed to him. So I asked if I could bring my own cake, and they said ok. Nothing more.  I bought a $35 custom cake and when I arrived, they told me I couldn't bring it in. I told them I was told I could and they proceeded to tell me that I would be given a $3 plate charge PER PERSON!  At that point, I needed a birthday cake and reluctantly agreed trying a couple times to negotiate this.  So my $35 cake turned into a $35 plus $18 cake and to top it off, the wait staff didn't box up the remaining cake but ATE IT!  I couldn't believe I was paying the wait staff to eat my already overpriced cake.  Lesson learned, and I am less than thrilled to go back to this part of the chain.
