Good pizza ...... waiting on some line for an hour  to eat pizza in New York is the biggest turnoff ever and I mean it. I may have given this place 5 stars or at least 4 if there wasn't a line. Hey people WAKE UP, there are thousands of pizzerias in NYC and be assured there are several much better without a 5 minute line not a 1 hour line. Thumbs down here. This is pizza guys its not  Kobe steak...
