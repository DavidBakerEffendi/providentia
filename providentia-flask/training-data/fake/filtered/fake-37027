Great food, questionable service. Been there twice now. First I left because after waiting 35 minutes, we still had not been served...even though other who came in after us had been. When asked about our food, the waiter didn't seem to care, and said it will be out shortly.  Waited another 10 minutes and still no food. We asked again, and he stared at us quizzically.  Proceeded to leave without eating and got pizza. Second visit was much better. Fast service and great sandwich ( I got the turkey Dijon sandwich). Very good. Was hungry a couple hours later, but I do have a big appetite.
