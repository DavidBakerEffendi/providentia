6/13/2013. Ordered a thin crust pizza. got it after 1h!. Pizza was cold, crust was hard as if this had been out all day and basically thrown in a bag and delivered to me. don't often write reviews but this was awful and though I have been ordering from Vinnies for years will never order again after this!
