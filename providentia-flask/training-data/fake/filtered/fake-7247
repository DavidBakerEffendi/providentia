Don't be afraid to venture a little deeper into South Philly for a cheesesteak.  It ain't pretty looking (but none of them are) and it isn't in a touristy area, but the cheesesteak is for real. Added bonus:  you don't have to put on that fake act where you have to say 'wizwit' or risk looking like a cheesesteak rookie.  Feel free to order how you please.
