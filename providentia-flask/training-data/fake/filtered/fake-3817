Wow, I went here last night (May 15, 2012) for the first time and it was INCREDIBLE. I live right on Osborne St for the last year and have never seen this restaurant. My mom and dad were in town from Michigan and pointed it out, so we went. The food was very delicious (we're foodies, but not snobby elite foodies). Quang, the owner/chef, came out to visit and brought two gratis dishes to show off his skills - as he should, because it was fantastic. I can't believe I've gone a year without visiting here, we will definitely be back.
