No doubt this pizza is damn good.  I've based whole days around going there, and you kind of have to because you'll likely wait a long time.  It's also quite expensive for pizza.  But hey, supply and demand...I know what I'm getting myself into if I go there.  So I'm still giving it 5 stars: some of the best pizza I've ever had.
