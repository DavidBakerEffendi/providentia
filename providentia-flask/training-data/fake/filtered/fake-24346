This place is awesome! My wife and I love Mexican food but have to make the trip down to South Philly to get it- not anymore! The food is delicious and authentic, and to top it off they deliver to our house at 55th and Catharine. Thank you Guacamole for saving my wife and I from all the pizza joints and chinese spots. We will be ordering again!
