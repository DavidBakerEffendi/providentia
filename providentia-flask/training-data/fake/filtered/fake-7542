BEWARE!!!Food is decent but it is dangerous place to go. They have unarmed security parking lot but security is obviously working with the locals to break into cars. Â Several people have had car windows smashed in lately and owner refuses to compensate for the damages. It is not worth the meal to fear for your safety.
