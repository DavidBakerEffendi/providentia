My daughter suggested we go to Kanella's for my birthday and I'm so glad she did. We were a party of 4 and everyone of us enjoyed the meal. We started with the dips of the day--3 really tasty dips served with pita and we also ordered the flatbread with zucchini, eggplant, goat cheese and arugula. That was also delicious.I ordered the fish of the day--Brazzino- and it was excellent. We shared 2 desserts that our waiter suggested. One was the lemon tart and the other I don't remember it's name but it was out of this world! It was a custardy pie that was made with thin layers of phyllo dough. I will definitely go back for that and also to try some of the other entrees that looked interesting.
