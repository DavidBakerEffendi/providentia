I am a pizza guy.  No bones about it.  Ive tried all the known places in NY (and many unnamed ones) -- from old school standards such as Patsys, Grimaldis, Lombardis, Nicks, di fara -- to the new artisan spots such as Motorino, co. etc.  Fo many eyars I have been dying to hit New Haven and try the Wooster Street joints.  So on a drive back from rhode Island we made the stop. Frst, we hit Pepes.  Wait wasnt terrible when we went, but who cares, its about the pizza.  we ordered two - standard margharita and one with topping.  We were disappointed.  Sorely.  I am a crust guy, and will admit that the crust was Excellent - firm, with a bit of char, but not too crispy, and with enough of a chew.  Really good crust. But thats where it started and ended.  The cheese was unremarkable.  But the sauce - the sauce, is where it all comes together and gives you the lasting impression.  And it was just awful.  Really bland, and tasteless. I am willing to give it another try, it could have been an off day, but I doubt it - these recipes are fixed and the result generally doesn't change from day to day.  My guess is that it was once great, once upon a time, before it went commercial and launched 5 other locations around CT and Yonkers.  I would say that it rests on its history and laurels.  Bet it loses blind taste tests.  I'd stick with Sally's; much better flavor.
