Went to Jones last night with a group of twelve. Lovely staff from the hostesses to our server. The server did a great job taking our orders and providing friendly service. Very sweet and professional. The place was busy but not crazy. The food, as agreed by everyone, was average to good but nothing special. The hardest part to understand was in the delivery of our food. Six entrees came in a timely manner. The other six entrees came ten minutes later. Ten minutes doesn't seem long, but it is when the six people didn't want to be rude and eat without everyone. Â Their entrees were getting cold and we of course insisted they eat. The Starr Group has really been slipping over the years. Time for some change!
