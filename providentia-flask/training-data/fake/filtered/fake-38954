I'm baffled. So many reviews I read said this place was delicious and inexpensive, but it was neither of the two. It's a cute place, don't get me wrong, maybe good for a coffee and dessert (the Daquoise cake was quite tasty), but all of the $8 and less things listed on the menu were appetizers even though the menu doesn't make that clear. I was hungry so I ordered the "spicy" chicken and guacamole and fries-- what is this dish? Mexican, Chinese, French? Some cut up chicken breast and a half a plate of very greasy fries. It lacked flavor and was not even spicy. I would not be complaining, but for $17 I expected something much more substantial. This was basically fast food. No one at our table was particularly excited by their dish, everything was rather bland and overpriced.
