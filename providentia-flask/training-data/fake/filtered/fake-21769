I give the reading terminal market a solid three stars.  There are some great things in here and some average things.  The best part is that there are many choices of food.  The bad part is that there are some shops that have no significant value.  Also no great place to get a drink.  Crepe place is ok, cookie place is good, but lost of employees talking about their personal stuff loudly.
