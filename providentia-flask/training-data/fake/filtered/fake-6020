The best brunch spot in brooklyn in my humble opinion. The food is incredibly delicious and the servings are ample. The $5 specialty cocktails just put the whole experience over the top. A fantastic Sunday starts with Peaches Hothouse. The only downside: You're gonna hurt yourself on all the deliciousness.
