Best onion rings in the state as far as I'm concerned.  I enjoy coming here with my family.  We usually take separate cars and meet up.  It's kind of a tradition of ours.  All sorts of people come to Holstens for their delcious food and ice cream, families, young urban males and even middle aged men in member only jackets.  Just a great place to eat and even better for dessert.
