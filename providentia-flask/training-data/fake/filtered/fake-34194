I went to eat there the other night and was shocked to find 2 endangered fish on the menu. Both Blue Fin Tuna and Patagonian Toothfish (Chilean Sea bass). Both of these fish are near extinction and couldn't believe it was on the menu. I've heard great things about this restaurant, but until they take those items off the menu, I'll never know.
