This was my first time at this place and I was a walk in. I ordered one slice for my son and two drinks. The 20 ounce drinks were listed at $1.50 each. The man behind the counter who was making pizza with his bare hands charged us $2 each. $6 for one slice and two drinks? We could have gone to McDonalds for that price and BOTH of us could have eaten at a place that uses gloves when they handle food. When I asked why he over charged us he replied it was because I did not sit down. if I had known they had a place to sit down I would have loved that but since nothing was mentioned until AFTER I paid I can only assume they like ripping off their customers.
