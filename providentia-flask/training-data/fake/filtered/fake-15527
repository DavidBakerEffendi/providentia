I like coming here for the Knicks games from time to time. It's kind of upscale but not too crazy and it's nice to not be around a bunch of wild cats. The food is good, the service is great, drinks are on point everything is aces. The only thing stopping me from giving it 5 stars is the fact it feels more like a restaurant with big T.V.'s than a sports bar, but that could be a good thing depending on what your looking for.
