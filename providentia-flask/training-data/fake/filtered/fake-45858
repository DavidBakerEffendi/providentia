The food was bad, the management was rude, they seem to have a tendency Â for calling the police on people who complain I watched a man and his family have the cops called on him after he complained about a steak, after the manager told the patron "the meal is free, just do not ever come back here" the man left and the cops showed up just in time to pay the bill from what i could see from what my officer friend said this is not the first time that has happened. frankly this place will just be another failed experiment in the West Essex area. I ordered some of the Asian style food, General Tso to be specific, it was about as good as it would be from any given Chinese place....but cost twice as much. Avoid this place like the plague
