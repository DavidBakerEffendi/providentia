This place is great! We had to wait an hour, but it was worth it. The hostess uses an app that texts you when your table is almost ready so you can go somewhere else for a drink while you wait. Really fun atmosphere-- the entire staff cheers each time a new party enters the dining room! And of course, the food was great. I will definitely come back!
