this is in a ROUGH area with no parking.  The cars we did see parked on the street were in tight spots (common in a large city).  What is crazy is that the gangs appear to take any vehicle that sits for two minutes as a canvas so some were incredibly tagged.  We went here based on recommendations and the rivalry with Geno's.  Our gamily liked the cheese steak here very  much and would highly recommend it.  Both are worth trying and seeing what you like.
