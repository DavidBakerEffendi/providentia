Service abysmal.  An hour wait in line outside, then a 15 minute wait just for menus.  Another 10 minutes for water and drinks.  A full 2nd hour between getting in the door and pizza on the table.  Refill of drinks?  We asked - several times - okay - but it never happened.  How is the pizza?  Who gives a damn at this point.  One of the worst restaurant experiences of my life.  They could hire two college age waiters/waitresses with a better attitude and work ethic and eliminate the lines, the wait, keep people happy by refilling their water and bringing a second beer while you wait, write down the orders rather than relying on memory.  They have been in business since 1928.  It can't always have been this bad.
