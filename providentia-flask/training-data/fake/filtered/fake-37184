The service was fantastic.   I have no complaints whatsoever on that front.  My girlfriend wanted to start with a caesar salad extra light on the dressing.  It was delivered with WAY too much dressing.  Not only that, the lettuce was in spears.  We asked our server if she could take it back, take off about half of the dressing and chop it for us.  She came back saying that the chef had put the dressing on himself and that there wasn't  too much on the salad and outright refused to chop the salad!!  What?  Sorry, I bring clients into NYC all of the time to experience one restaurant or another but will never bring anyone there again.
