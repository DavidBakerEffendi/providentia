Worst dining experience of 2010.  I went for brunch on Labor Day and was treated to the worst service of the year.  Food took about 45 minutes to come out and our waiter was more or less nowhere to be found.  We ordered a burger and two poached eggs.  45 minutes!?  When the food arrived finally it was a buttery, salty fiasco.  Totally overrated.  The girls next to us found a hair in their french fries and had to wait about 20 minutes for a new order to arrive----and that was only after they caused a stink about the whole thing.  First and last time for Spotted Pig.
