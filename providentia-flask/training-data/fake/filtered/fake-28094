Very spicy food.  I couldn't even taste any of my chicken, just the hot spice.  They should fore-warn you about how spicy it can get.  The naan was not completely baked...one edge was still doughy.  Anyways, plan ahead if u are going to pick up, because they give preference to deliveries rather than to customers that pickup.  I waited for along time to just have my mouth hell-burned.  I don't recommend!
