So I am in the mood for Italian and I try Stella Rossa When I got their with my family it looked okay I was seated at a small tbl With too many things on it . there was discrepancy over who our waiter was It took  several min to be greeted  first a female then a male we told the male waiter We already ordered drinks. Now the food had really no life to it I mean It's pretty much your basic red sauce restaurant  nothing here is impressive Yet the prices your gonna be paying you would think their would be more But no and I am still trying to figure out how it took over 30 min for just the soup to come out they only have one to choose  ????  I really regret going here I should have went to Olive Garden because even Olive Garden  is much better then this place Seriously !
