This place was really great, probably the best Indian food I have had in the city to be honest! I went in with three friends before a concert, and the waiter was so great to us- he got us our food in time, and even threw in free dessert (wish was delicious!). I wish I lived in the area, I would order delivery from them all the time! I will definitely go back. The restaurant is in a weird area, not directly on the street, so I think they are looking for more business! GO HERE :)
