I'm not eloquent or a food critic but I can appreciate great food when I eat it. So architecture, serving ware, decor, and atmosphere have been covered in other reviews to a point I agree with (Modern, truly swanky Japanese style Ramen ware and oddly fascinating octagonal chopsticks, a university crowd and a wide variety of music of which YMMV).  Now onto the food I had and may have stolen of my friends' meals.      I had the Spicy Miso Ramen. Truthfully I was one of those people who never had any ramen that was not the instant poor/rushed person's ramen and this dish taught  me I was missing out on truly good ramen beforehand. I think the spice level was good for eating as in a small slow burn that satisfies your heat craving without you wanting milk to cool it down.    To make this story shorter: the soup/broth is amazing, the chashu was nice and tender, the corn was a bit of a novelty as were the wavy noodles, and naruto makes my inner anime geek giggle (That last part is irrelevant to the food experience.)  My friend had the regular Miso Ramen in which I sipped a bit of her broth and found the miso flavor to be more apparent. Good for people just don't feel like or can't take spicy food.  Another friend had the Kara Kara Tonkatsu Ramen of which she simply said, "So good." and proceeded to stuff herself.    I had also ordered the takoyaki for us to share. There were six pieces if I remember correctly. My thoughts were basically "Yum." The takoyaki sauce itself was a bit salty but that saltiness only really helped to flavor the takoyaki itself. So the lesson is takoyaki sauce in moderation = good. Just pick up the takoyaki ball and eat it with whatever amount of the sauce is on there and all should be good.    My friend who has been to Japan says it is legit because it tastes like the takoyaki she had in Osaka. My suggestion: Go eat there! The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because I haven't tried everything yet.
