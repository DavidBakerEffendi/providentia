I have been ordering food from here for years now, and the quality has been very hit or miss.  I recently made a large order (nearly $100).  When I got home I found that most of the food was absolutely ROTTEN.  I mean it was giving off an offensive odor.  This is unacceptable.  There is no way they couldn't have realized this when they sold it to me.  Clearly the food was old.  I contemplated calling them to complain but then I figured it wasn't worth my time, especially if they are willing to sell food that is obviously spoiled.  Apparently they are reopening under a new name soon but I will never go there again, regardless of what they're calling it.  AVOID.
