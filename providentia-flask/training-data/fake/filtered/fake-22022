I know. I know. There are a million reviews on this place, but I just have to comment on how much easier the produce stands make my life. There is the one in the middle of the market that does $1 bags of random fresh produce. In the Italian Market you would be buying some things on their last leg, but I bought a bag of Asian pears (4 for a dollar!) and they have lasted me four days so far. aaaaaamazing!
