After being bombarded on the local Indian radio about this eatery we decided to give it a try and drove all the way from Piscataway to this 'restaurant' for lunch. Boy, were we mistaken! We walked into an empty and darker than a moonless night, ugly room and were seated in a booth. There was one waiter who, when asked what is'Inchin', bluffed that it was a Chinese word! I had already figured that it referred to INdian and CHINese cuisines. The luncheon menu was a short list and all we could do was choose an entree which came with a spring roll, soup and rice. We chose a chicken and beef dish, hot and sour soup and the so-called spring roll. The soup was a disgustingly vile concoction of Soy sauce and black pepper with hardly any vegetables, let alone meats. Neither of us could down more than a spoonful. The spring roll was stale cabbage wrapped in an egg roll wrapper and fried... and nothing much else. None of their 6 bottled sauces did anything to change its acceptability. We then were served the chicken and beef dishes. Neither of them tasted Indian or Chinese or a happy mixture. The texture of the meats was good and velvety. For this I give the place one star. The acceptability of the dishes was however low. There was no inviting taste in either. The crowning glory was the wretched service. I had to walk into the kitchen to demand my check. The whole experience was most awful. I would not recommend this dump to my worst enemy! UGGH! The Indochinese food at Nanking and Bombay Wok are far superior and the service superb. Best of all I don't have to drive more than 5 miles.
