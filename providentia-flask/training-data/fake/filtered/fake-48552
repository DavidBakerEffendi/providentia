I went here for dinner with my boyfriend. He had served time in afghanistan and always talked about how much he enjoyed the afghani food, especially the basmati rice.   At first, we were a bit skeptical about some of the reviews about the lack of service here.  In fact, when we were at dinner the table next to us was complaining about the waitress.  However, before going we did some research to find the restaraunt is family owned by afghan immigrant. The service was not rude, but quietly attentative.  My boyfriend pointed out that their demeanor was typical from what he had experienced from afghan locals.   Overall, we had a great experience and loved the food.  We now frequently order take out.
