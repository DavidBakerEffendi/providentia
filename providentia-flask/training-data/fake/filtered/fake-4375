I'm at a loss for the popularity of this place.  It has a lot of great beer, but they don't make the beer...and you can get great local beer at a lot of places. So it must be the food, right? but the menu is amazingly small on choices and the only things that are decent are the burgers...which ain't really that good.  I have been there many times (with groups that insist on going, again, for reasons I can't explain) and always get a burger only to find it amazingly average.  The roll seems almost stale most nights and its usually overcooked no matter how I order it. And as others have said its oddly packed and annoyingly loud and cramped.  And yes, very overpriced.  There are about 10 other places in Burlington at the same price point which are just far and away better, so I have no idea how this place does it.
