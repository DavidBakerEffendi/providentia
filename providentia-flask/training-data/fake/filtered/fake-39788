Tonight was my first time at the London Grille and I was impressed with the bar staff. The drinks were excellent and reasonably priced. The atmosphere was homey (there were Christmas movies playing and it smelled really lovely), comfortable. There were several regulars and everyone was really welcoming and friendly. As a lesbian, I also felt especially welcomed with the human rights campaign sticker in the window. What I am trying to say, is that this place is exceptional and I would recommend it to anyone. The night I visited, Kelly was working the bar and the day bartender (John?) was there. There were several verbally abusive customers who were harassing Kelly. I was so impressed with Kelly and John's professionalism in handling such unruly customers. Even after the customers became physically violent, the situation was quickly handled and every attempt was made to make sure that my friends and I felt safe and taken care of. They are both exemplary staff members and the epitome of what makes London Grill a wonderful place. Â  I think it speaks volumes about the quality of this establishment that I felt compelled enough to write my first yelp review because of the way the staff rose above the unfortunate circumstances of the altercation. I realize that the events of tonight were not usual and would recommend the London Grill to everyone and have found my new "neighborhood spot". I look forward to frequenting this place often.
