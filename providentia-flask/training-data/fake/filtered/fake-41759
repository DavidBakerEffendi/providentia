I can't understand what is going on with this place. A small menu with Bistro classics that should be executed flawlessly by any Chef with some NYC chops, Don't let the low prices fool you you get what you pay for. The country pate was ice cold and definitely store bought The torchon was past its prime and had a harsh metallic taste. Ricotta & bibb salad???? weird Escargot were excellent and had plenty of garlic and not rubbery AVOID the mussels, gritty and poorly executed The thai version was strange in flavor and some of the mussels were raw. The steak was small but very tender but the peppercorn sauce was "starchy" it is the way I would describe it. Good fries as well The burger was very very good and the best deal on the menu Slow cooked salmon was fine but the side were bland as was the dressing Skate was very good and well prepared
