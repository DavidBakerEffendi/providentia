I did hear good things about this place so I decided to go with some buddys on a Sunday a few weeks ago for some food and drinks. The service was pretty terrible. We had a short, blondish/white haired server who was just slow and disinterested. I watched her go smoke ciggs and talk to the other staff for a while. She reeked of ciggs when she came back. Our food was just OK but the beer was pretty good. My fries were a bit salty and my burger was dry. I asked for no cheese but I knew some how that our server wouldn't get it right. One of party was brought out the wrong food but he didn't feel like waiting for the right order since the food took a while to come out. Â The vibe was to "to cool for school" for me. Seems like a younger persons hang out.
