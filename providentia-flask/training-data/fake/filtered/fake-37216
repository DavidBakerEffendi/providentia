The place has a really nice service, spinach dip is really good. They are famous for their ribs, which taste absolutely phenomenal. However, I'm a big fan of their jazz band that plays there every friday and saturday after 7pm. All of them are world class musicians, and you get to hear them without a cover charge. I strongly recommend this place. John.
