Pretense with a side of attitude! Awesome hostess let,s us know that the kitchen is closed @ 3:30, no problem, just want to get a drink. She says both bars are open, so we go upstairs to be greeted by pissed off waitress number one, who let's us know the kitchen closed at 3:30 . No problem we would just like a few drinks. Pissed off waitress number two informs us that the section we go to sit in is closed and that the kitchen closed at 3:30. Ok, we get it, the hostess was wrong, and the waitresses are simply pissed that they are at work. Oh, I should mention that this is our first visit to the city and this was our first stop. Welcome to Philly, no pass on Continental, and go to Varga! Way better service and staff and it made Philly way better! Steven Star, review your staff policies relating to how hospitality works or just close the place, it would be a public service either way.
