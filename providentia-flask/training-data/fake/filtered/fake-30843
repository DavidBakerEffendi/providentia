Great value, with respect to the quality of beers - really well priced. I went to the Double Windsor with 2 friends on a hot & humid Saturday at around 5:30pm, so it wasn't crowded at all - maybe at 40% of capacity. We went to pregame, do a few shots and grab a bite before heading to the Siren Music Festival on Coney Island...sponsored by Bud - so we went to get a buzz with good, quality, strong beers. The Windsor afternoon crowd was mixed, from age 22 to 62, everyone was just chillin, having burgers, salads and having a good time. Seemed like a no stress spot you could drink at all day. The bartender was this really laid back easy going type who didn't say much...except to suggest a good beer. Most beers were strong and cheap - good bang for the buck. The cider beer was also quite nice. The Whiskey shots were $5 each and the service was quick. Likes: - Great quality beer selection - The inexpensive beer flight (sampler) - Great burger - Easy going staff - Good atmosphere - Good service - burger came out fairly quickly - Close to the train station (1 block) Dislikes: - N/A It's definitely a good spot worth checking out, there is no sign, so it's a little incognito and plain Jane, but it works well. Extra points: I left my favorite hat there, I called 20 minutes later and they grabbed it and held it all night until one of my friends could pick it up...nice customer one service. I will definitely be back again, next time I will get the Ribs, they looked AWESOME. Happy Drinking!
