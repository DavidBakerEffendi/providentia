Growing up in union county new jersey, we always ate at the Penang in Edison. I was happy to see a Penang in this area when we moved here 10 years ago. Food is always delicious and never a long wait. We typically order the same dishes but have tried other things from time to time. If you are unsure what to order, just ask and the staff will always help explain the types of food on the menu. Surprised by the negative reviews here but everyone has their own opinion. My only complaint is you pay extra for white rice. Hence the 4 stars... LOL
