Pat -- We dropped into Lucky Lou's Labor Day weekend.  It was a gorgeous night and we sat outside.  I had the Seafood Linguine, which was prepared well and delivered on time.  But the best part of the evening was listening to the patio entertainment (Sinatra performer) and watching the families dancing to his music.  A lovely time in Old Wethersfield. Bob-Lucky Lous is a place you keep coming back to.  Whether it's the Lobster Sliders or the energetic patio seating this restaurant is a gem in Old Wethersfield.  Our waiter was solicitous, humorous and quick.  He clued us in that staying around for the night's entertainment was worth it (he was right).  The Maine Seafood Platter (featuring Alaskan cod and gulf shrimp) was lightly batter dipped and fried well (without that greasy, nasty taste and texture) but somewhat out of place on a menu that features fresh food prepared lightly.  Still it was a wonderful meal and a better time.
