Went to visit Staten Island and chose Pasticceria Bruno  for our girlfriends  night out.  Food was excellent !  We chose calamari panteschi for or appetizer  - unique and delicious flavor with portion large enough to share amongst three of us.  We had three different dishes - my salmon was moist and flavorfull!  The waiter and the manager were very attentive and focused on making we as customers comfortable in a very homey environment.  High marks for service.  Nice wine selection and tasty dessert menu.  Great value  to taste/quality/portion size.  Go there and you will not be disappointed (and you will leave with happy taste buds)...
