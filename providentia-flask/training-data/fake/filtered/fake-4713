May 27, 2014 Mr. Julian Gaxholli Blue Restaurant 115 Richmond Terrace New York, NY 10310 Dear Julian: I am writing to thank you for a wonderful dining experience at your restaurant on Saturday, May 24th for my mother's birthday.   From the minute we arrived at the front door, we were assisted by a young man who helped us with my dad's wheelchair as we entered the restaurant.  Those who were in the bar area greeted us pleasantly and Lee made it a point to help us to our table.  We were so pleased to note that our table was ready for us with a place for my dad's wheelchair and we were seated comfortably at a great table right next to the window.   It was especially nice of you to come to our table and introduce yourself to us.  It was a pleasure to finally meet you.  Your graciousness and hospitality was genuine and your attempts to make us feel welcome were greatly appreciated. Needless to say, the service and the meal itself were excellent.  We all enjoyed your culinary talents immensely.  Your soft shell crab was the best my mother and I have ever tasted - and both she and I are great fans of soft shell crab.  From beginning to end, the meal was outstanding. Last, but not least, I would also like to thank you for treating both my parents to dinner.  It was very unexpected and generous of you to make that gesture. All in all you and your entire staff made the evening a great success. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for allowing my agency to print the menus of all three of your restaurants in Braille.  Your attempts to make your restaurants accessible to those with disabilities are very much appreciated by me and the disabled community. Thank you again, Julian. Please be assured that I will be recommending Blue to everyone I know. Sincerely, Lorraine De Santis, Executive Director Staten Island Center for Independent Living
