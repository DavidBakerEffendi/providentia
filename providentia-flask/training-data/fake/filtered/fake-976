First time tonight (Saturday). Requested a table for 6 at 6pm.  Was asked to leave a deposit on my credit card because they were busy!  No way Jose!  Was actually very quiet on arrival, but soon filled up. Food was very good.  Worth the 4*.  Could be a little more generous with the tortilla chips and the actual tortilla so that I didn't have to feel like Oliver! asking for "more". What I didn't like was the automatic 20% tip added to the bill.   Seems that this restaurant is all about making $$$ (or guaranteeing the last $$$ from you), but luckily for them the food is good enough to come back.
