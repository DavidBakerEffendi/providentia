My husband and I were excited to try this place. We sat outside on a lovely evening last week, but unfortunately it took more than 15 minutes to even put in our drink order. The server repeated my order wrong twice, then it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks. That being said, the drinks were very good, although expensive. The octopus salad was interesting. I had the salmon with brussel sprouts, it was so salty, it was almost inedible. The appetizer plates were never cleared, and we didn't see our server again until we needed our check. The service was poor, food was bad, drinks were very good.
