Wanted to try this place more that once, and on my second visit (two weeks after the first) I will say that this is an incredible Szechuan, Chinese restaurant.   They have authentic Szechuan food at this place and if you love HEAT and flavour you'll be in heaven.  My wife and I have sampled the dry panned lamb w chili sauce, spicy dry fried beef, classic and delicious shredded pork in garlic sauce (sichuan pepper sauce on the side since it wasn't a very hot dish), and a phenomenal fried rabbit  "special"  which hasbones, so be careful, and don't be afraid to use your hands.   The appetizers are also authentic we had the sichuan smoked ham (like chinese bacon, fatty but delish) (first tried at Brandy Ho's S.F.)  lamb dumplings, and the spicy baby wontons.   On my next visit I will try the tripe and the braised whole fish.
