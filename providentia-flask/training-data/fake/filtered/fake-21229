I am trying some of the recommended burger joints in Philadelphia and London Grill popped up on the list.  This burger was served on an english muffin (huh).  That was okay I suppose as I'm not super crazy about huge burger rolls anyway.  The burger was ok.  Not great, not horrible, but ok.  I had it with blue cheese and jalapenos, asked for mustard and none was forthcoming.  It was an average burger - very average.  I don't know in what universe this burger would come up as best of Philly when there are so many amazing burgers in this city.  Fries were coldish and greasy and did not add to the enjoyment of the burger.  Sorry London Grill but I won't be back.
