Used to love going here, the food was okay, the staff and service were good also, but the main reason was to meet up with friends.  Had gone here on and off since being a teenager, place closed then opened up again The food was always hearty and reasonably priced. What stopped me from going here was the then owner, Harry, not sure if he is still involved or not.  When this 'businessman' owning a customer driven business refused to accept my order because, 'it would dirty my grill', I knew it was time to never return.  Really Harry, a turkey burger  is going to dirty your grill in comparison to what?  Spending many years in the restaurant business myself, I was dumbfounded. Another reviewer mentioned hacks running a business, well Harry certainly fits the mold.  Hopefully, for the good of the business Harry no longer decides to show up and work the grill.
