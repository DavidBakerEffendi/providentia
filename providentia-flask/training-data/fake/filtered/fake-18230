another item checked off the bucket list. I must say that my dinner was truly a memorable night.  Rao's is special in a old school warm charming way. You can not replicate the vibe and feel of the place.   The place is pretty small and seating is tight and cozy, which I don't mind at all. The staff was warm and friendly.  Got to love a waiter that pulls up a chair and sits down at your table to take your order. The restaurant did have a couple of celabs in the house.  Not A-listers, but nevertheless celabs which I hear come to the place a lot. Now the food... I don't like to call myself a foodie, but I know food.  The food that is served here is simple decent food.  Many of the items menu items can be found on  pretty much any slightly upscale suburban pizzeria. Meatballs were pretty good, a bit to mushy and with to much cheese and fat in them for my taste.  Roast peppers were good.  Fresh Mozz and sliced tomato's were exactly what you would think they taste like.  I did really enjoy the seafood salad that was light and fresh. 2 pastas were ordered, one with plain tomato sauce  and the other with pesto sauce.  the pesto was very good, the tomato sauce pasta was pizzeria quality. No fresh pasta with these prices? Shrimp scampi was over flowered, over buttered, over salted and just not enjoyable. Veal piccata was also over floured.  Sliced steak was good.  Bro rabe was pretty ok too. After seeing the app's and entrees I knew what to expect from the desserts which were out of a box and very pedestrian. don't come here expecting good Italian food.  come for a cool experience.
