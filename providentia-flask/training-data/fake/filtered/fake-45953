Since I am from China and I have tasted many Nanzhou (actually Lan Zhou in current Mandarin Chinese) noodles, I could say with confidence that the hand-drawn noodles served in this restaurant is quite authentic. The meat that comes with the noodle soup is also very good. The service however needs to be improved.
