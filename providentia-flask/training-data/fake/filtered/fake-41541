Went there a few times already.  Each time the food got a little less tasty than the previous time.  Not sure why.  The steamed buns are very average to me. The skin is getting to be heavier than before.  The juice from the buns is bland. I have had better ones in Chinatown.  The rice cake is ok, a bit too chewy for me.  The wait can be long if you go in on saturday nights.  The tea they serve is like water.  So bland. Doesn't even taste like tea. The seating is pretty comfortable compared to some Chinatown joints, except last time I had a drop of a noodle on my chair which was not noticed. The waiters in general are very nice.  The hostess who seemed to pay more attention to the cash register most of the time than to the guests waiting was pretty rude to us.  Maybe she had a bad day.  Or Maybe she is just the cashier. Who knows. But we won't return to this place for sure.
