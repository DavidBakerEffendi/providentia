Two words NEVER AGAIN!  My boyfriend and I went for the arts and crafts on Sunday.  We left because of the rude girl working behind the bar.  We've never been treated this badly anywhere before.  If you like bad service with a bad attitude than this is the place for you.  Sorry I will take my business to one of the other 50 bars on South St.
