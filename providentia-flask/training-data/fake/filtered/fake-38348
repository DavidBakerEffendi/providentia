OUTSTANDING! Never been there before, Don't live in area, was there to see a show nearby, and found Ah Pizz on line, not knowing what to expect, we were delighted with tremendous perfect flavors. Crust was thin & Crispy, not burnt. The arugula was fresh, the proccutto on the Roberto was fresh and soft, not fatty. The fresh mozzarella that our waiter Frank said was made at restaurant was so good, Â not oily, perfect and fresh. They definitely use high end ingredients. Im certain thay if Emeril Lagasi ate there he would say "Bam!!" to the delicious flavors! I will go back to try the "Mezza Luna", which is half calzone & half pizza (truly unique!) Look on line on google images to see what quality food they offer. I was amazed & would like to borrow Emeril's "BAM!!"
