Fantastic Restaurant. Excellent service and delicious food. Went with my wife and friend on Sunday afternoon and was transported to a Parisian cafe. The Peach sangria is a spectacular starter, especially for a warm day. We shared Mussels and didn't leave a drop of sauce from the dish. We shared a beet salad, Crepe with cream spinach and mushrooms and Croque-Monsieur, which were all outstanding. We were completely full but our friendly waitress convinced that we should try a light crepe and convinced that we could eat 10 of them because it was so light and tasty. Of course, we were not disappointed at all. We tried Lemon and Sugar - Crepe. This is an otherworldly desert. Finished it with a very good espresso and we're already looking forward to our next stip.
