I called up to make a order at this restaurant and my order came to $30 and most chinease  restruants give u a free iteam if you reach that amount this one excludes you from any free iteam if you use a credit card like its some type of penalty  I didn't like they way the guy answered the phone either this business is terriable and selfish and they don't vaule customers
