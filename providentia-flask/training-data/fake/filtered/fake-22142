What can I say about this place?! I have never been anywhere like it. I feel like I am taken back in time to the times of the old street markets ( though this is inside) Any time I find a unique recipe that I can't find the ingredients to I can almost always find them here. If you ever have a day where you can't think of something to do this is a great choice. I can get lost in here for hours..... looking at cookbooks..... buy cookbooks..... have something to eat while picking out a recipe for dinner....ok 5 ....10 recipes I HAVE to try.... spend the rest of the afternoon getting lost in all the amazing fresh ingredients one can find here! If you haven't been you must go!
