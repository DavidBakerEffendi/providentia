Great food, excellent service and nice restaurant. We'll be back.  We went to Uva with high expectations and we were not disappointed!  Has a nice look and vibe, tables were not overly tight, not overly loud even for a Saturday.  We were greeted by nice friendly staff. Wait person was excellent. Great food suggestions and knew her wine. (the Super Tuscan by the glass is excellent as was the Rose Prosecco) Some of the best prosciutto I have ever had. We both had pasta dishes that were excellent. Perfect portions. Prices are very  reasonable.
