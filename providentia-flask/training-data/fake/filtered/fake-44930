I went in hoping to get a lovely, fresh green juice. I ordered "The Hulk" which is supposedly freshly pressed with spinach, cucumber, apple and lemon. It ended up being a few leaves of spinach, a few chunks of cucumber, and probably 80% apple juice from the fridge. And, surprise: it just tasted like apple juice. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING. On the plus side, customer service was fine.
