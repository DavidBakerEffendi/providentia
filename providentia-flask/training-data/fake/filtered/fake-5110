Love Figs for dinner, and the egg dishes at brunch are fine, but cannot abide Kraft syrup in little boxes (not maple but corn syrup) for pancakes and french toast - not to mention the stone cold banana/walnut topping. I'll still visit for dinner but will have brunch at The Lift -further to walk, but quality ingredients.
