The best wings in town. The worse service in town. I'm accustomed to getting so-so service from other girls, it comes with the territory. But this place was ridiculous. Our server was being visited by Aunt Flow or something, because she was rude about everything. The saving grace was that my wings were awesome, and my friends said the oysters and clams were top notch. If it werent for the great nosh this place would get a bad rating, but the food saved them. I love wings, and I'm always willing to give second chances, so I'll probably be back soon.
