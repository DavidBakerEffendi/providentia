OH MY LORD! I have found THE BEST slice  of pizza in New York City. Although the line is usually long outside this hole in the wall- it is well worth the wait! You HAVE to go to try Artichoke's when you are in town. First off the slices are HUGE!  The spinach and artichoke pizza is a party in your mouth.  The crust  is thick and crispy.  The toppings is cheesy goodness with a spinach&artichoke dip- like sauce  then its topped with artichoke hearts.  I inhaled my slice and if I had room left would have gotten another! You must try it for yourself because my words do this slice of pizza no justice!
