We have been going to this restaurant ever since they were located in Montclair and known as Udupi Village.  They took all of their furniture, murals AND delicious menu with them to Parsippany and have been great..... UNTIL we visited them this past weekend and noticed immediately the rice wasn't the same.  The savory basmati rice (with a few peas etc. thrown in) that you expect at an Indian restaurant has been replaced by clumpy white rice more typical of Chinese take-out. Rice may seem like a small thing but not to me.  We even asked the server about the change in rice, but he did not seem to know about it.  Has the management changed or are they buying lesser quality ingredients?  I then noticed the tamarind sauce wasn't quite the same either.....
