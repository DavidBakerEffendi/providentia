I entered this dark, dungey, and empty restaurant tonight for dinner. There was no one to greet me and waiter standing with his back to the entrance doing his work on a table in the middle of the dining room. I asked him why there was no greeter or host. His response : " We like to keep a relax feel". He was clearly not trained to perform the job. He mumbled things under his breath as he walked away and got several things wrong. The food was cold, uninspired, and not worth the money I paid. The place has a creepy feel, was empty, not a single person there. I hope this place goes out of business soon. Places with horrible product, lousy service, and clearly dont care deserve to go away. I give this place 5 more months.
