Surprise party for my 95-year-old mom. The surprise was for all of us (18). Mario's hospitality, the quality of the food and service were impeccable. The birthday cake, which I made, suffered some damage. Maybe it was due to the rest of Hurricane Irene. Â I was given all the help needed to patch it up.
