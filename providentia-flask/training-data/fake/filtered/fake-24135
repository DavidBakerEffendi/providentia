"Irrashaimase!" Â (trn: Welcome!) Hearing that from the cooks when walking into the store brings a smile to my face. To be welcomed and acknowledged is a great feeling and they give it to you from the get go. I've been a regular to this restaurant for a while, but I really didn't think about leaving a review here until I took a friend of mine there. She is Muslim and never had authentic Ramen. It's understandable since restaurants serve Ramen with pork broth, however, I had told her about Minca. They serve their Ramen in Pork and Chicken. I can not forget how ecstatic she was in hearing that. I took her the next day and as many say, the rest is history. Minca gained a new regular.
