The prices are WAY too high and the food isn't even good. My mother makes better food than the slop they sell in that place. The food isn't warm and the service is terrible especially the buffets which are too costly. All in all, unless Â you want a bad taste of Indian/ Pakistani food you should eat at this establishment- just don't expect much from it.
