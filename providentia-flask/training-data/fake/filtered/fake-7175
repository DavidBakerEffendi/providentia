Japanese food is more than sushi !  I have been looking for a pleasant, reasonably priced restaurant that serves a variety of traditional Japanese dishes in midtown Manhattan.  Katsu-Hana, as the name implies, specializes in cutlets of pork, chicken and shrimp.  These are excellently prepared, breaded, hot, crispy and flavorful.  For a reasonable price ($21) you get soup, pickles, rice, katsu and as much shredded salad as you want.  A good variety of appetizers (Age dashi tofu, Kimpira gobo are my favorites) and quick service round out my excellent rating of this restaurant.  I left over-full and I can't wait to go back.
