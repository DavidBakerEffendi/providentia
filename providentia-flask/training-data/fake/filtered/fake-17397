Six stars. I live in the neighborhood and was with my wonderful wife when we discovered this restaurant after dinner at Lucali. As we looked over the menu for a future meal, one of the owners, Jeremy, met us at the door and very kindly escorted us to the bar, where he recommended some delicious cocktails and an A+ steak frites (absurd dish for $21 with a very substantial cut of sirloin). Along with a side of kale and some Sancerre, the meal was sublime. I also recommend a stellar blonde beer called La Goudale that Jeremy was kind enough to pour. After he introduced me to his partner Damien, whose father authored the recipe for our memorable Apple Crumble with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, we finished with a lemon basil cocktail. I can honestly say we had unconfirmed plans with my wife's friend and will be coming back here tomorrow night. I also plan to bring our folks back here as they are also always looking for a great bite in Brooklyn. I really look forward to Winter, given there is a fully functional fireplace tucked away in the corner of the restaurant. Next time we're back we'll try the mussels and the seafood sp√§tzle. Merci beaucoup pour la nourriture!
