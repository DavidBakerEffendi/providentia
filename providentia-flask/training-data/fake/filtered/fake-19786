Great taste!!!!! I finally found the amazing smell that I sniffed everytime I left green apple! It's their grill. My boyfriend and I ordered two samosa ,a platter with chicken, lamb and .I also got a mango lassi. After last time I went to indian restaurant and got a salty yogurt drink, I have been craving mango lassi for some time. And their mango lassi was good! Samosas were delicious. But my suggestion is to cut it evenly, because I was sad that my boyfriend ended up eating two larger pieces :'( (LOL) The platter was of good size. Chicken and lamb kabob was flavorful and tender- I loved the smoky flavor from the grill. This place really have great food for cheap price! Was this review ...? Useful 1 Â Funny
