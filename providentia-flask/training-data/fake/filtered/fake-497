Geno's is a Philly icon, and for good reason.  The 'wiz wit' seemed like a bad idea at first, but upon my first taste, I realized how mistaken I was.  Provolone? Was I seriously getting provolone for that long?  God almighty, I was missing out!  I've seen a lot of bad reviews on this place, and I've decided that its a sign of the end of Western Civilization.
