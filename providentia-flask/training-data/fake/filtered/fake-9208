I have been to the Abbaye maybe a dozen times over the last 3 or 4 years.  It's been a while since I've been there but overall I'd say they have very good brunch food and drinks.  However, my last experience at the Abbaye has resonated and it has been 2 years.  Me and my girlfriend were sat for Brunch on a Saturday.  We ordered our food and about 5 minutes later another couple was sat nearby.  10 minutes went by and the couple who was sat received their order.  5 minutes went by and we asked the waiter about our order.  He said the kitchen was working on it.  Another 5 minutes went by and I asked again, this time saying "the couple next to us is finishing their order and they came in some time after us."  The waiter then gave me a blank stare and said "I don't know what to tell you."  Another 5 minutes went by and at this point I was pretty angry and I again asked the waiter what is going on and he could probly see I was angry.  Again, he said "The kitchen is working on it sir, I don't know what to tell you."  At that point me and my Girlfriend walked out.  A few steps out the door I decided to go in and tell the waiter the following:  "Next time there is a problem with an order that your customers are asking about and your not sure what to tell them, try telling the 'Sorry about the inconvenience' and making them feel like you give a shit."  To that he replied "I dont' know what to tell you."  That was the last time I was at the Abbaye.
