***PAY ATTENTION TO THE GENUINE REVIEWS HERE AND NOT THE CORNY ONES OBVIOUSLY LEFT BY STAFF AND FRIENDS*** Restaurants should be run by people that love food and service, not trust fund babies. That is what you'll find here if you eat here - if the waiter ever serves you. We were asked to sit at the bar while waiting for our table, Brandon, the server/maitre'd sat us there and then proceeded to stock pile customers at the bar next door and flirt with 2 ladies at the bar before taking orders, caring to his customers or paying attention to the order of who came when and what bookings he had. His timing was off by several hours - we were sat at the bar and told 10minutes wait time - we were physically seated at the table an hour and a half later, and watched a trio diplomatically discussing an even longer wait, to which they were kicked out for "causing a fuss". Pretty unfortunate considering we ran into them several hours later and heard the full story which was even worse than our experience and i hope they leave a review because the way they were treated was outrageous. The food we ordered was cold when we arrived - portions were decent - staff were obnoxious, COCKROACHES IN THE BATHROOM, IM NOT TALKING 1, IM TALKING 4-5 AND THIS IS COMING UP TO WINTER, PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! DISGUSTING!!!!! GOD KNOWS WHERE ELSE THEY ARE, IN THE KITCHEN?? Wouldn't be surprised and given the service, dont think they'd care!!!! My favorite part, waiting for the bill which took nearly as long as being seated, (JOY) - items added on which we didnt order, and absolutely no acknowledgement for the terrible service. These guys are as arrogant as it comes. Save your money and go elsewhere. ***PAY ATTENTION TO THE GENUINE REVIEWS HERE AND NOT THE CORNY ONES OBVIOUSLY LEFT BY STAFF AND FRIENDS***
