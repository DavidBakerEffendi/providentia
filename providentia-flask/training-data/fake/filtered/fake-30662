This is one of my all time favorite eateries! My family and I keep going back time and time again! Whatever you're in the mood for they have something for everyone. From grilled cheese to prime rib to killer eggs Benedict, it's all super yummy. Service is awesome, food comes out so fast, they have THEE BEST coffee EVER! Family owned and very friendly! My family usually goes there at least once a week. Always a great choice, always a good experience. Prices are average diner prices. Very neat and clean establishment. Highly recommended :)
