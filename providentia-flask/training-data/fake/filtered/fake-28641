My fiance and grandmother went to the Trattoria Rosa Bianca for a late lunch, and we loved it. The food was fresh and delicious. To start with have the Calamari and anti paste miste. Main dishes were spaghetti allaa carbonara, frutta de mare all' acqua pacca and salsiccia. Everyone of these dishes were delicious. Most important, the service was excellent. Reggie, our waiter was so helpful with each one of our selections. He was very nice, helpfully and attentive to all of us.  Thank you for great food, atmosphere and great service.  Mark and Martha Jones.
