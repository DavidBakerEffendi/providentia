Everything is fresh, succulent, and heaped on your plate. Hands down the best falafel I have ever eaten, bar none. Perfect texture, perfect flavor, every bite so satisfying. The hummus is excellent, the grape leaves are yummy, and they have the warmest little vibe of love in Center City. If you need some soul food, please come and have a plate for me. I went for the first time today and consider myself a regular customer already. I am still full from what I ate and already set to return for some more. The best meal I have eaten in a really long time. Simple, cooked with love, and to perfection. They know what they are doing, let them show you what's up.
