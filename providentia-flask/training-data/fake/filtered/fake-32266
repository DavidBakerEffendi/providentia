Found this by Urban Spoon rec, and man, it was awesome. This tiny restaurant was kind enough to open their doors early for us, to get us out of the cold moring air. Once seated we were treated to an amazing old-school cappuccino - no drizzled syrup on this badboy! the scrambled with salmon and spinach, served with mashed potatos, tinged slightly red from a tomato infusion, were whipped to perfection. True warm, cozy, comfort food on a chilly fall morn. Beware, seating is extremely limited, so you may have to wait. Say "hey" to Ramon when you get there...colorful server with an intersting music background...enjoy!
