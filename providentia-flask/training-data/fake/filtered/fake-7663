Williamsburg is not easy for me to get to, but that has not stopped me from going back here several times since it opened!  And when I'm not there, I'm dreaming about it.  Let's start with the Crazy Baba - it's babaganoush, but with extra yumminess in it that I can't explain. In fact, you can just order a bunch of starters and be in pig heaven - the Fatush salad, the baby eggplant, the falafel...they are all amazing.   My favorite main dish so far is the Cowshuka, but the Shawarma, the 5-Hour Bureka, and the oxtail are not too far behind.  You can just taste the quality of the ingredients and of the chef in every bite.   To make it even better, the staff is really friendly and the prices are totally reasonable.  It's totally worth the schlepp to Williamsburg.
