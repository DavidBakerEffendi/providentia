I'm surprised there's somewhat negative reviews here. I absolutely love L&B!! Not only is there pizza delicious and soft, but their restaurant is great also! I go here at least once or twice a month. The restaurant offers a great variety of Italian food, from the fried calamari to the Caesar salad, just amazing! Their waiters are super sweet and quick with everything. If you do go make sure to get the spumoni ice cream platter!
