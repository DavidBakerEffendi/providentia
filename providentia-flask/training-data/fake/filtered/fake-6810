Wow.  I have NEVER had an experience even remotely close to what happened to me today.  I ordered $800.00 worth of Restaurant.com gift cards from my United Airline Miles, it immediately sent me confirmation.  I found this restaurant fairly close to my house and I went and placed an order, I didn't read the fine print on the gift certificate that you could only use (1) coupon per visit, I had (4) totaling $100.00 and my food was over $75.00   I spoke to the owner who was...  he was horrible.  I ended up calling the police to find out what to do because he said I had to pay for the food and I had no money on me to pay for it.  When I called the police from the parking lot they informed me, the owner had already called them.  I ended up having to have a friend call in using his credit card, or there would have been civil charges against me.  I do take the blame for not reading the fine print.  But when a customer is telling you, they have no money and this was their last resort to get food. To cash in air miles...  And you go and call the police.  Just wow....  I would never want to patronize a business like this again.  I will tell everyone my story.
