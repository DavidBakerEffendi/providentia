The food is pretty good, but inconsistent. The staff on the other hand are awful. I have probably eaten there about a dozen times and the service consistently blows. They always try and rush you out of there. If you show up with more than four people it's like you just told them the World is about to end. They really can't comprehend how to possibly seat more than four people at a table. This morning I was there for brunch and after receiving the check (w/o asking for it) we asked for coffee. Since they obviously wanted us to leave they only filled up our coffees 1/4 of the way and then pretty much ignored us. There are better places to go in Park Slope for brunch.
