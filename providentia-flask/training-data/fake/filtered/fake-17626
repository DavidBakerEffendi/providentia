Such a lovely restaurant!  My sister and I shared the Salmon and Avocado Tartar - it was so flavorful and lite!  I do wish they had given us some more crackers to dip it in but the bread that they put on our table was a perfect dipping tool that added great flavors too!  For our entree, we tried one of their specials: a flattened grilled chicken with arugula and mozzarella cheese on top.  YUM!  So delicious and extremely lite yet comfortably hearty.  In addition, we got a side of their super dope brussel sprouts that were cooked to perfection and full of fantastic flavors!!!  Everything was delicious! Highly recommended!!!!
