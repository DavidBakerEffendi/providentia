I understand this is a new place but since they opened I have ordered there twice. And both times the orders were wrong! The cashier put it in right but when I received it, it wasn't what my recipt said. The first time I ordered chili cheese fries with peppers I got chili cheese fries with bacon and we also ordered onion rings I asked if it came with a sauce they said yes, but I didn't revive it thank gosh I only work down the street so I walked back for them to correct it. The second  time was yesterday I order onion rings once again asked if it came with sauce got back to work there was no sauce once again however the onion were burnt it was disgusting you couldn't even taste the onion  it self
