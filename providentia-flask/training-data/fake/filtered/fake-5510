There is certainly a lot to love about Sweet Afton -- great food (the best burger and fries in Astoria, if not the city), fantastic music (I rarely leave without a list of new songs I need to add to my iTunes library), excellent service (Adam is my ABSOLUTE favorite bartender in Astoria -- he always makes you feel welcome and serves a mean martini) Â and it's the one bar in the neighborhood where you can get a good glass of wine (no Yellowtail here, thank you).
