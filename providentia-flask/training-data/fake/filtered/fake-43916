I've eaten here 3 times so far and I'll be going back for my forth tonight. Every time I've been there the food has been awesome.  The first time I had the crab cakes which were my favorite by far.  Second time I order the lamb burger and it was cooked medium well as I asked, and the most recent time I order the gyro which was awesome. I'm excited to go again tonight because it seems as though they've made some changes to the menu...which is definitely something I like about a restaurant.
