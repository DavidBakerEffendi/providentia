My boyfriend and I came here on Saturday night for a late Valentines Day dinner and we couldn't be more impressed! We had originally made a reservation for 6:45. They called at 6:30 just to let us know we'd actually be sitting at 7. We arrived right at 7 and were immediately seated in this perfectly tiny restaurant at one of the private tables. We started with the wine list, quickly finding something we thought we'd like. Upon trying it I wasn't totally in love but for Graffiti staff that was no problem. The waiter and then owner worked with us to find a bottle of something much more our style even though it wasn't on the wine list. Onto the food! I eat a gluten free diet due to Celiac disease and the staff at Graffiti was AMAZING. We knew ahead of time that they would be accommodating based off of other reviews, and they were! I was able to eat almost everything on the menu. We ordered the pickled ginger scallops with GF toast, braised pork buns (1/2 on gf bread and 1/2 on regular bread), Chickpea crusted skate, and the Graffiti burger (again 1/2 on GF bread and 1/2 on regular) Â All of the GF bread was Udi's, a brand I know and trust, which made the experience so great. Overall this place is amazing. While it is unique and definitely a small space Chef Jehangir Mehta does not disappoint. What are you waiting for? Make a reservation and go on your next date night at Graffiti!
