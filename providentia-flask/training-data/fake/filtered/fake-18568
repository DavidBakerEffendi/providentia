We had heard a lot about this restaurant and it sure lived up to its reputation. We went there last Friday and it was packed like i heard. We requested for seating and were told that we would have to wait for 40 minutes, luckily for some reservations didn't show and before we could order a drink at the bar they offered us a table. Must say excellent service, the staff is very attentive and highly trained. The food was good too. I had the lamb sausages for the appetizer and then ordered the halibut. Both excellent choices, they were out of Halibut and they gave me another fish, I think it was trigger fish. It was too good. The only reason I gave four stars is that the prices were really high for two people we ended up paying $160, with two drinks each, otherwise five stars.
