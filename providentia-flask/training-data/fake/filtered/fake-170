Came here on a Tuesday with my sister. There was no wait and we practically sat wherever we wanted, that I like, there's a star. Â From the reviews I've read, I will never go on a weekend. Our waiter was nice and casual, there's another star. I just liked the whole area and the vintage cheesy pink and blue look of the place, 3rd star. My sister ordered some sort of egg white omelet that had beets and feta cheese in it. I ordered the eggs Benedict. As for food, I'll say meh. I didn't really liked their hollandise sauce, I much preferred Green Egg's sauce. I did liked the spinach however. The potatoes were just regular tasting. Very dry unless bathed in ketchup. My sister's dish was pretty bland. The beets and feta cheese didn't really do anything for the egg white omelet. I can probably make better egg dishes at home which isn't saying much since I'm not really a cook but I am obsessed with eggs. So in conclusion, I'll go there again if I just feel like getting a quick bite and I happen to be in the area. I won't be standing in any lines for this place. The biggest draw for me though is the set up, cute little neighborhood. Love the outside seating even though we sat inside.
