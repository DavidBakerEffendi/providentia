If you have never been to Shanghai, China then Joe's Shanghai is pretty alright. But for anyone that has traveled abroad and tasted the real deal, Joe's is a complete let down. The "Xiao Long Bao" that Joe serves is what they actually call "Tan Bao" which translates to soup dumpling. Xiao Long Bao in essense is a fraction of the size of the soup dumplings that Joe serves to consumers. With that out of the way. The actual taste of the 'soup dumplings" is mediocre at best. 1) the skin should be tender, almost the texture of soup wonton wraps, smooth. Joe does not deliver, the skin is tough and texture is rough. 2) the inside should not be overly flavored, the taste of the soup inside should be clean, clear, and resembles a good pork broth. Joe again does not deliver, the soup is a bit oily and overly flavored with other ingredients. Another negative is the color of the soup. All in all, advertising the product as Xiao Long Bao's is a misrepresentation of what it actually is, soup dumplings (translated). Oh yea, I won't even speak about the rest of the menu, the crowded uncomfortable atmosphere, and rude wait staff. P.S. Din Tai Fung might be an alternative to Joe's Shanghai, but even that place doesn't come close to the real deal.
