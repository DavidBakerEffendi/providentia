Ekta = orgasmically delicious, savory, heaven! JUST TRY IT!!!  They deliver.   Everything I've ever eaten from Ekta has been good, but my favs are: Paneer Tikka Masala =cheese cubes in an awesome tomato cream sauce Onion Baji appetizer = delicious fried onion fritters Malai Kafta = potatoe and nuts in a yummy ball, with a mild white sauce Saag Paneer = cheese cubes in mildly spicy spinach sauce YUM I'm moving out of Philadelphia and making a point to review all of my favorite treasures of this City before I go... and Ekta is hand's down, my FAVORITE restaurant in this city.   I too was a Tiffin fan but soon realized the bliss and amazingness of Ekta and hope you do too!
