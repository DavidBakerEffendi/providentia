Very cozy little place. Delicious and healthy food. The falafel sandwich is the best I have ever had. But my favorites are za'atar bread and lebne Â sandwich, they just go perfect with morning coffee. I love that they use multigrain bread, and they have whole wheat pita. The banana- date smoothie is yummy!!!!!!:-))))
