Had delivery.  Gave the man too much  money (overpaid $20).  Didn't realize it until after  the restaurant had closed.  Called the next day and he denied getting the extra money.  So I went back the day after to personally speak with him.  Still denied getting the extra money.  I was very upset and asked if it was possible to get a gift certificate for another time.  Owner told me no and that she believed the delivery man and not me.  Extremely poor business.  Will never eat or order from there again.  It's a shame how dishonest people can be.
