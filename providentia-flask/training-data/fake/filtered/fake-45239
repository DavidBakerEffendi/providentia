Whenever we're in the Hartford area, we make a point of dining at Abyssinian.  The food is absolutely delicious -- well-spiced and rich, but not excessively fatty.  The meat is tender and flavorful, the vegetables just right, and the injera is substantial but not heavy.   As other reviewers have said, everyone I've brought with me has loved it. Portions are generous, yet I've never left with a doggie bag, because the temptation to finish it off proves irresistible.  The prices are very reasonable, and the service is excellent -- the proprietor is warm, friendly, and projects a quiet sort of refinement that both puts you at ease and makes you feel like you're participating in something really cool.  Yes, parking is a little tricky, but the situation has definitely improved.  The Ethiopian music is essential too.  Highly recommended!
