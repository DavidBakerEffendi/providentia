I had breakfast with a friend yesterday and overall had a very pleasant experience. We were greeted immediately on entering and seated right away. Our server was very friendly and attentive.  Our order arrived within minutes and we both had the Lumberjack Slam (make sure you bring your appetite). The food was tasty and the portions were generous. The wait staff checked on us mutiple times and refilled our coffee cups more than once.  When my friend noticed that he was missing some bacon with his order, our server overheard him mention this to me and she quickly came back with a plate of bacon. The only criticism I can offer is that the restaurant is an older building and is due for a face lift.  For a quick tasty meal with reasonable prices this Denny's is a good choice.
