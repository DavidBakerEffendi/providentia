I went to Cafeteria last night with 5 other friends. So, I got stuck in traffic and ended up being close to 40 minutes late for the dinner. The rest of my party didn't experience much difficulty being seated, as some places like to be stingy with this practice, and they politely left a seat waiting for me. So I walk in and everyone had already ordered and their main course seemed to have just arrived on the table. The waiter politely asked me for my choice and my food arrived with lighting speed, well okay, in like 6 minutes tops! The food was delicious. I ordered the Crisp Atlantic Salmon and cleaned my plate--besides the grilled country crouton that the Solomon was resting on--which by the time I got around to it, was soggy and not so appetizing. The rest of the party ordered the Cafeteria Mac n Cheese, 2 people did and they loved it. The Crispy Calamari Salad--also earning a stamp of approval from most at the table. And the Crisp Crusted Halibut--also a crowd pleaser. Now on to the dessert: Generally delicious. We ordered the Strawberry Short Cake Parfait and the Warm Fallen Chocolate Cake. The short cake melted in your mouth and was infused with orange flavors that gave the dessert a nice kick. Now, the chocolate cake wasn't bad--but what got me was that it was supposed to be gushing melted chocolate and warmth--and that it wasn't. It was half warm--probably because they made this first dessert and had this one sit, significantly cooling it down. Overall: Decor/Atmosphere: young hip crowd, dimmed lights, pretty loud and fun Service: Excellent (a least during my visit); Timely and polite Food: Great--so much to choose from to appease any taste buds. Finally, I would definitely recommend Cafeteria and will be going there again very soon. Just make sure you make a reservation or you will surely experience a veeery long wait. Happy eating!
