I fell in love with Cooperage when I tried my first bite of "Breakfast at Muh's," their name for a Southern tradition I'd never before seen in Philly or anywhere else north of Virginia, ham biscuits.  The biscuits are perfect- flaky, buttery, soft enough that they melt in your mouth but definitely not undercooked.  And the thin slice of ham is just right, savory and delicious.  Sides of mascarpone cheese and jelly compliment well, but the biscuits and ham speak for themselves; this is an authentic Southern treat right here in Philly.  I've been back twice for dinner and devoured the pork chop (with incredible leak bread pudding) and their "Brekkie Burger," a must-try for any burger lover.  The bar tender recommended two whiskeys and both were good.  I happened to be nearby in the morning a couple of days ago and stopped into their cafe for coffee and a bagel (they have jalapeno cream cheese, it was tasty), which cost the same as Dunkin Donuts but were much, much higher in quality.  What more can I write?  I look forward to trying more items on the dinner menu, and I'll be stopping at the cafe again when I'm in the area for breakfast.  I'll be back often.
