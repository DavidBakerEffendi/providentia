The management here has a dozen persons in the kitchen and no one knows what their doing!  They called it old world service...which means sloooow and stubborn. I waited 30 mins for two soups to go! At that point I went to the "kitchen" found the soup bagged on the counter and a busboy all flustered about me finding it! Owner/ manager walks around bulling/interrupting everyone.  Theme, it's a place that charges it own employees for lunch...that speaks volumes. Don't go, unless you like a soup nazi.
