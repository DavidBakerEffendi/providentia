my sister and i went here one friday night for dinner. it was our first time to try ethiopian so we weren't really sure what to expect.  we basically got a vegetarian (not vegetarians) sampler of all different types of vegetarian goodness.  we asked the waitress, who might be the owner? to surprise us with whatever she thought was the best. she was cute, she was so nervous. which means she really took pride in what she was serving us.  it turned out to be a huuuge treat. was so great!!! even the popcorn (at the end) - an unusual, treat - and the cinnamonish/infused coffee was great. we're excited to go back. would recommend to anyone and everyone.
