Roberta's is well overpriced.Any place that only makes a 12"pie at an average of $15 a pie should tell you something.There oven is so hot that the dough is getting burnt before it's done cooking.The flavor isn't bad but that's the best I can do for a compliment.Channel 7 ABC put them in the top ten and I'd like to know where they came up with that.I wouldn't put them in the top 50.
