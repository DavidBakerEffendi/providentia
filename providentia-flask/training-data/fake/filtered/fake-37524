Here's the bottom line on Diamonds: If your looking for a typical mediocre jersey italian experience with poor customer service and sub par food, then by all means go here. Your stomachs sure will be full and your need for hunger will be satisfied. However, don't expect quality taste or service. Also I don't recommend taking a date to this restaurant. If you want to impress your date with a quality italian restaurant take her to Maggianos little Italy in Bridgewater but don't ruin her day with this cheesy dump unless you don't want a second date.
