Was craving some fish tacos so I decided to go to Lolita. Upon arrival I was seated right away and the waiter quickly came to take my order which was nice. my food came very fast to my surprise as the place was kinda of on the busy side. After receiving my food i wish i would have gone with something else. The fish was far from fresh and was topped with vegetables to hide what was underneath. Will most likely return in the future and try another dish.
