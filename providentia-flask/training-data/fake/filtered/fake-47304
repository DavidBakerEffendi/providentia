After receiving multiple faxes at my job, I decided to meet my girlfriend there for happy hour last week.  It was by far one of the worst dining out experiences I've ever had.  We sat at the bar, I asked my gf to order me a 007.  I walked in to a vodka with sprite.  Once i finished my drink, the female bartender proceeded to throw the ice in what I believe was the garbage can, then leaned over the ice bin, her hair laying in the ice, and scooping the ice with the same cup i had been drinking out of.  I noticed her do this with every cup.  My gf decided to order food.  She order crab cake sliders, they came out room temperature, and without the accompanying sauce,  my wings came out underdone.  She ate 2 of the 4 small sliders that came with the order for $11,  I ate 4 of the wings.  The final straw for me was the fact that the ice from peoples glasses that wasn't thrown in the garbage was dumped into a metal funnel attached to the faucet, draining into the final sink of sanitizer that the "clean" glasses are dunked in after being washed.  I was, and still am literally disgusted by the sanitary conditions of the bar.  From that day on, I have told everyone in my office, and anyone that mentions your restaurant to avoid it at all costs.
