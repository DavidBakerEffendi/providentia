I walked in without a reservation and didn't have to wait, which I really liked. The staff was friendly. The food was amazing. I thought it was very flavorful. I went there with an old friend and sat there for three hours expecting to be kicked out but they were super nice about it. I can't wait to try some of the other things on the menu.
