This new restaurant is awesome. Nothing left to chance. The partner/manager, bar manager and chef are very experienced and know how to put all of the pieces of a great dining experience together. The wait staff, especially Kevin, were very attentive and helpful. The maitre'd fromage (master of the cheese cart) chipped in beyond his role as well. Â We rambled through the menu starting with the cheese tray, arugula/chicken confit salad and hummus. We were off to a good start. On we went to the Georgia Shrimp and Raviola dishes. I finished with the pot pie and a side of grilled brussels sprouts. Everything was perfectly prepared and perfectly complex. Lots of flavors here. My daughter had one of the mixed drink specials that were equally complex (apple whiskey, cucumber juice, etc. etc.). Needless to say, we can not wait to return.
