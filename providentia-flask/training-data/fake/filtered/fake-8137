Came for brunch with a reservation, but the table they reserved for us was not big enough to accomodate our party. This was the most crowded, loud, steaming hot brunch emvironment ever. I couldn't hear the people sitting next to me and the waiter couldnt hear me, that's an issue. Food was alright, sangria was strong, but the ambiance and service were horrible!!!! The staff are incompetent and stressed out, and make their attitude known to everyone. They don't listen to customers, just do their own thing as if they're doing us a favor serving us.... I had to remind them what I ordered, chase after the waiters to get the Bill, and in the end they threw out the food I asked them to wrap home. The $17 eggs and sangria isn't worth it for me to come back.
