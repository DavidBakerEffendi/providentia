Barcraft event was going on with 80 to 100 people (standing room only).   Owner refused to expand out the event space to a second TV / seating despite nearly 2/3rds of the bar patrons being there for the event.  The extra TV would allow more people to sit down and order more drinks and food while alleviating the crowding in the middle of the bar. Additionally, they started charging a cover for people to get in but then refused to refund it when they ended the event early. Though there were communication issues between the organizers and the bar owner, it's still ridiculous to have an event with paying customers ended 2 hours early with little more than a shake of the head.  The organizers could have done a smoother job coordinating with the venue, but in this case, the venue did many things wrong as well.
