We love Little Fish, and have been going there for many years.  We've always had a great experience, with wonderful food and excellent service.  Unfortunately, last night, we had a very negative service experience, though the food was still amazing. We wanted a nice meal for a family celebration, but we didn't have a babysitter, and with a toddler and a preschooler, eating at the restaurant didn't seem a good options.  Friends of ours used to get take-out from Little Fish once a week, so we thought we'd call to see if we could do that.  The woman who answered the phone was unfriendly to the point of being rude, and told me that "we're not really a take-out restaurant."  I'm sure I have been going there since before she was hired, so I told her that I was very familiar with the restaurant and that we knew friends had gotten take-out from there before.  She went to ask the kitchen, and of course they said yes. Unfortunately, this woman continued with the negative attitude.  Instead of explaining the menu to me in detail, she just told me the four types of fish in the different appetizers and entrees -- no description of what went with them.  My dad went to the restaurant to figure out how the various types of fish would be prepared, and she gave him even more attitude, telling him they couldn't do certain types of dishes for take-out because they had broth in them -- even though the take-out containers are at least 4 inches deep. Little Fish, I know you can do better than this!  We would have been totally fine if she'd said politely that they weren't able to do take out, but to agree to serve us and then repeatedly treat us as if we're unwelcome intruders is a far lower level of service than I've ever experienced at the restaurant.  I hope you'll retrain this server or hire someone else who can provide the level of service to which we're accustomed.
