What a pleasant surprise.  I was coming from giving a tennis lesson and stumbled upon this jewel in the heart of  Montclair.  It takes over from where the previous  HLS left off.  The restaurant offers a good selection of healthy options including vegetarian and vegan selections.  They also have a great selections of teas both hot and cold, smoothies, freshly made juices and drinks.  I had one of their starters, the black eyed pea hummus with hemp and plantain chips.  I also had the Vitality smoothie which is pineapple, ginger, ginseng and coconut water.  The choices on the menu have a Jamaican twist but with enough variety to satisfy anyone.  The staff was friendly accommodating and fun.  I sat at the bar and we chatted like old friends.  If I could give it another half star I would.
