Our new FAVORITE restaraunt in the Hartford area... (our old favorite was where Chef Greg was for the last decade...)  Decor is attractive and service is friendly and attentive to your needs. We had Roast Lamb over barley risotto and Seared Scallops with a morraccan cous-cous.  Both were done to perfection with subtle flavors that had us going "Mmmmm" with each fork full.  For dessert, we split a Chocolate combo that had mousse, Chocolate-Ginger Brulee, a deep fried White Chocolate Ravioli, and a shooter of Chili infused Hot Chocolate... (excuse me a moment,  gotta get a napkin. I'm drooling on myself at the memory of that Hot Chocolate...)  While I did not check out the craft beer selection this visit, we will be back on a regular basis and I look forward to trying what I understand is an excellant selection.  Best wishes on this new enterprise !
