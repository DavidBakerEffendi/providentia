I am a Yale student and have eaten here before. However, I don't think I will be returning. I was getting breakfast this morning and I saw the staff show no respect to a group of people who were just trying to be seated as a large party. I was not even the target and it made me feel very uncomfortable. I will be getting brunch at Me N'U or Bella's from now on. I suggest you do the same.
