So, I ordered a cheese burger sandwich to be delivered. When I got the order there was no burger on the sandwich! I called BD'S and complained. The guy says "I didn't see burger on the order,so I didn't put a burger on it." Come on! It's called a cheese burger sandwich! Jeez! I will NEVER go there again. EVER! Be warned.
