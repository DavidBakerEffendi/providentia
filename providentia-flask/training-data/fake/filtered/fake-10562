lively atmosphere (kinda noisy) but with very delicious food. The specialty drinks are a must. we had a 10 PM reservation and the crowd had not thinned out so any intimate conversation was out. try getting a table towards the back (near the ABC Store side). it's quieter there. the rough-hewn tables were elegant. So much detail in even the smallest dish (salted radishes with butter are incredible). i would go back for sure, but i think i'll try the early seating and see if that helps with noise.
