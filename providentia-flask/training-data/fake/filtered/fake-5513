Adore this place! Living in the city I never really go out to Queens/Astoria but a good friend of mine convinced me to join him for some drinks.  As soon as we walked in I was very impressed with the atmosphere of this Bar.  I love the brick and wood decor along with the dim lighting.  Makes me feel like I am in an antique bar in the country some where.  Bartenders are super cool and sexy!  I had one make me a Michelada the authentic way and it was delicious.  We also ordered their cheese plate, about three times. If you're looking for a very chill place outside the city I highly recommend Sweet Afton.
