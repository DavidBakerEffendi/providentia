What's all the hype about? The food is nothing special at all. Very limited choices and very heavy handed with the seasoning.  I would have liked the fries if there hadn't been an entire bush of rosemary in them.     Too bad I wasted an hour of my life that I will never get back waiting to get in to this place. Also, the place needs a change in waitstaff. The gentlemen upstairs are incredibly rude and have no business being in customer service.
