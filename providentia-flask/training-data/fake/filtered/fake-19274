Wow!!! is what you'll say after a night spent at Mayfield. The vibe is spot on- relaxed but bustling. Amazing music and sound. Friendly, attentive wait staff who seemed genuinely proud of the food- as they should be! My meal was sick! If you like oysters, it's a no brainer, get you ass over there now! And you should throw in some ceviche for an added treat (it comes with popcorn!). I've been twice already in two weeks- yes, it's that good - and have loved everything. One night we went casual and had oysters, a burger and the sickest Cuban you've ever had (apparently the chef was written up for his Cuban a few years ago in NYmag- believe the hype!). The second time we went more upscale- kale salad (sick!!!) scallops (rich and buttery), veal pappardelle (outrageous!) and a brownie sundae for desert. Oh and the cocktails were great too! Try the honey bourbon one- mmmmm! You really can't go wrong here. Stop by for a drink at the lovely bar and order an app or two. Or go whole hog as i did- TWICE! You won't regret it. Your welcome :)
