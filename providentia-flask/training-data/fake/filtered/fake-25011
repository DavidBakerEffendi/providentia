It was cheap and amazingly delicious. As someone who once lived in China I can assure you that this is both authentic and appetizing. It is unfortunately pretty highly Zagat rated, so it is always packed. It is pretty small and seating is limited. A very popular tourist destination but rightly so. I would also just like to commend the woman who was working the cash register. She spoke flawless English, Mandarin, and Cantonese. Very Impressive. Would definitely recommend.
