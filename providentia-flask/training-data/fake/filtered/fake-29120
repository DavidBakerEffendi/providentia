City Steam Brewery is a destination pub.  About 80 columnists descended on them for a special buffet dinner and a day later for a catered lunch.  Excellent food and praiseworthy brews!  The building was designed by H. H. Richardson in 1887 (the same architect who did Trinity Church in Boston).  Rich detailing, amazing woodwork, and cool history is the backdrop to specialty beers brewed on site, such as Naughty Nurse and Blonde on Blonde.  The vibe is cool and casual and very friendly.  A+ Gold Star for the food!  Two blocks walking distance from the Hilton where our conference was held.
