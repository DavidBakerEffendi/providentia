Came to Philly for the day. Went on line to find a place for lunch. El Vez came up several times so we gave it a try. I am usually hesitant to take reviews at face value. Glad I didn't with El Vez. Best way I can describe it is new Mexican. Went as a group of 10. Big parties are not always easy to please. All 10 of us were more than satisfied. Everything exceeded expectations, service, atmosphere, food & drinks. Yes it's pricey compared to standard Mexican fare, but this is far from standard. All that was missing was a new interpretation of Chili Rellenos which would have earned 5 stars. Great place. I'll be back. So should you.
