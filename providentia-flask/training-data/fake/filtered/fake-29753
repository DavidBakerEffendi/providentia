How is someone from Massachusetts reviewing this place? I've worked just a couple blocks from Chris' for the last 12 years, they haven't been around that long, but I wish they had been. Food and service there is great! Chris and his staff are friendly, the food is fast AND still good quality/taste. I sincerely appreciate their existence b/c I eat healthy and there is only one other place for meals within 5 miles that is anywhere near on par for quality, service and speed. Sure there are a dozen fast food joints within 2 blocks but I don't eat that crap. If you want fine dining, don't go there. They are a small, family owned restaurant/diner...and for that, plus all the reasons I stated above, I give them 5 stars. I will say their home fries are bland, other than that, no complaints here.
