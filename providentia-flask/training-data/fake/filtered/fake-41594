We were visiting the area from Montreal and decided to stop by the Barcelona wine bar after hearing excellent reviews. The waiters refused to serve us any wine because our Canadian identification cards, all clear photo IDs with full dates of birth, were insufficient: according to the manager, the Barcelona policy is to only accept US drivers license or any other US-issued document. In other words, foreigners are not welcome at the Barcelona wine bar. We were all well over 21, and visibly humiliated. Note that being only a block away from Yale campus, the fact that a restaurant is unable to cater to foreign patrons is beyond me. I refuse to visit an establishment with such discriminatory practices. If you're from out of town, go to Bar or Geronimo's where they're always happy to have tourists.
