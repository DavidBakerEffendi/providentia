Dear all of you special jerks who eat somewhere and decide to go directly home to trash talk the place, BAR is the best, where else can you go in 4 inch heels, or flip flops and be treated the same way?  The pizza is the best in New Haven, not only because it's delicious you also can wait inside where there is a bar and heat or A/C depending on the season.  The service may be spotty but thats because its busy!  Everyone wants to eat at bar.  You can't get angry about a wait on a weekend night!  Bring a snack have a beer do a shot with the bartender and RELAX!  Or go out and get a life and please leave BAR alone. Love, BARs number 1 fan!
