Very disappointing experience. I got a nice coupon for $18 off an entree. I rarely eat out but decided to go there on Memorial Day evening. There were just 3 outdoor tables -  I didn't want to go inside on a nice day. When I stopped by in the afternoon, a busy waitress brusquely told me just to come on down, explaining that no reservations were taken or needed. I went down twice with my dog - at around 6:30 and 7:30. Both times all the tables were full. It was very disappointing as I'd looked forward to the experience and don't know  if I can use my coupon before it expires. With a negative experience and a disappointment, and with lots of other places to choose from, I doubt I'll go back.
