Your Crispy Fish dinner was Awsome, Spicy but perfect!  Staff was helpful in explaining the menu options.  Service was timely and neat.  We found meter parking right in front.  We enjoyed the spicy flavors in the appitizers as well as our dinners.  Portions were healthy, (doggy bagged the leftover).   Thank you for sharing the wonderful flavors of your home country with us.  We will be stopping back soon!
