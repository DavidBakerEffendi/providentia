I was pretty disappointed in this place.  The fish was decent but the service was lousy.  There were definitely some innovative rolls -- if you're a traditionalist, head to sagami instead.  However, there were also rolls that they just dumped the hot sauce that it's spicy tuna on top of a plain roll.   So, let's chat service.  The waitstaff told us that we had 1.5 hours to eat b/c the next table was coming in.  There were empty tables all night.  They definitely were not as full as they thought they'd be.  I understand that they need to turn tables but there are definitely better ways to do it. . . like how about provide faster service?  We couldn't get anyone to refill our water glasses.  We had to ask each time.  This is "operating a restaurant 101."  Then, we finished our miso soup and they didn't take away the bowls until we shoved them to the end of the table.  Rolls took forever to come out.   Overall, food was ok but due to the rudeness of the waitstaff, I don't think I'll ever go back.
