Great spot. We wandered by on a Saturday evening looking for a chill place to grab a drink and maybe some food and ended up walking out with a new favorite. They serve incredibly good sandwiches, I had a fried soft shell crab one that was the tastiest thing I've eaten in months - like, so good I wanted to immediately order a second one to go - and my girlfriend had a very fresh tasting summer lamb sandwich which was thankfully so big that she couldn't finish it and I got to polish it off. The drinks and beer selection was very solid, everything is NY local so there's a lot of quality on the menu. The interior is very well done and inviting, overall I can't think of a single negative thing. Will definitely be back.
