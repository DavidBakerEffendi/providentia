Absolutely the most unpleasant dining experience I've had all year. The people who work here are plain rude; seems like they don't care if they get your business. Some of the staff can't pronounce English numbers correctly so I noticed a lot of confusion when they were shouting out order numbers. I had plenty of time to observe as I waited 20 minutes for my order of 8 dumplings. Ick, doesn't seem like the cleanest place either. . . Take your money elsewhere.
