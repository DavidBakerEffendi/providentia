Have been here about 5 times since moving to Woodbridge -- never disappointed. Great curries, special mango w/ tofu (though we get with chicken), chicken satay, cashew chicken, tom yum soup ... and a few oranges for dessert to top it off! Everything is fresh and great meat to veg ratios. Only wish they didn't charge extra for brown rice though the prices are incredibly reasonable!
