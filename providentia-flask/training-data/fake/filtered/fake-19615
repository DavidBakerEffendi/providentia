The service is terrible! Don't go there! Our first time to go there. They don't even let me come in the restaurant. When it was 12:02, we stood in line at the first place. Then the owner let people behind us come in other than us. We came in to ask "can we order?". The owner surprisingly shouted "No! You own the store or I own the store?". We left and never come back!
