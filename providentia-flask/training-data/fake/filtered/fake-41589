AC and I had dinner here yesterday and it was scrumptious. If you love a good raw bar then you have to eat here. AC had a bowl of gumbo which was not what he expected. I had the New England Clam Chowder and i was not disappointed at all. We both shared: Angels on Horseback- raw oysters wrapped in cooked bacon with cocktail sauce and horseradish on top. I took the horseradish off. Great with Tabasco. Clams Casino- Clams were big were a mouthful. Spinney Greek Steamers- these were awesome with the drawn butter and tabasco. Fish and Chips- The fries were mad good. Fish was even better. Fresh and moist. menupages.com/menuprocesâ€¦
