While staying nearby, we were just Looking for a place to have a nice meal with a decent glass of wine, something a cut above the usual chain restaurant. We found the Yardley Inn on yelp and afte getting a little lost, were very pleasantly surprised! The place is very charming with a nice atmosphere, cozy, although a bit noisy on a Saturday night Â we were sat right away at a nice table overlooking the Delaware River. The wines by the glass menu offers an extensive list of choices beyond the usual suspects. I opted for a $12 glass of Trefethen Chardonnay, which was delicious and worth every penny. Had the crab cakes, which came with grilled asparagus and mashed potatoes. Also had a wedge salad that was a nice reasonable portion. All was very tasty. In addition, the service was unobtrusive, professional and swift. This was more than I could have hoped for after spending the day on my feet and in my wellies at a regatta. Thank you, a Yardley Inn!
