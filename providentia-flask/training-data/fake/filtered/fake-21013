I've been here both for dinner and brunch, both were amazing!  For dinner, we ordered the dips of the day and the bureki, which were both extremely fresh and delicious. For our mains, we had the whole fish of the day and the skate.  Our server was friendly, funny, and knowledgeable; attentive enough so that we could always find him if we needed something, but not overbearing.  Also, the fact that it's BYOB helps to keep the costs reasonable.  Overall, Kenella was fantastic.
