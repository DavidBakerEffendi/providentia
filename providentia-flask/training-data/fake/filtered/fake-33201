Delicious!!! "Small" describes the joint well but certainly not the taste. I ordered the mixed falafel platter and was greeted with a smorgasbord of fresh falafels, thick and hearty pitas, hummus, tabouli, and tomato salad. The three sauces were extremely nice - awesome flavor concentrated into these sauces. I washed it all down with a pear+lemon+mint smoothie which was amazingly refreshing and comes highly recommended. I was in Heaven! I'm coming back.
