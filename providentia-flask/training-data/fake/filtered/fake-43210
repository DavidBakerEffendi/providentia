As i woke in this coffee shop its smoky and crowded, but the lady approach us as we walk in being friendly all that makes us wants to stay and the fact that we are really hungry, luckily thay have an open table for 5, as she sat us down she autmaticallly ask for drinks thats makes even better since we all are cranky not having our coffee yet so we all order coffee, and their coffee is amazing i dont belive in all organic crap but damn thier organic coffee is amazing. Then a guy took our order, we ordered waffles biscuit and gravy, hungry sampler, eggs benedict, savory stuffeed waffle saus egg and cheddar to be exact (yes its inside the waffles) and vanilla sugar waffle stuffed with white and dark chocolate) it is all fantastic.. I never thought of waffles like that and theres tons of variety you can choose from stuffed fruits, then savory stuffed, and then traditional ones, i mean they kicked eggo waffles a$$ lol.. i just wished they have beef sausage and the table next to us a grown man is sipping in a juice box, sugar free syrup.. Â but other than that, service is good , food are great, place is a lil smoky but tolerable, we will definitely back....
