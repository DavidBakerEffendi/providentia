Whenever I need comfort food, I know I can always depend on Grill 21. The food is definitely better than the other Filipino restaurants I've been to in the city. It's as authentic as it can get, and tastes home-made. I always go for the Sunday breakfasts, especially the Tosilog. And the Kare-kare is delish! My friends and I have been to Grill 21 numerous times that the owners and the waitresses knows us so well. Grill 21 is the place to go!
