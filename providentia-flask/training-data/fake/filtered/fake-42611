I have dined at Sitar for lunch now at least 5 times. The restaurant is clean and decorated nicely, the waitstaff is satisfactory. I think the buffet is worth the price, but I don't recommend you order anything off the menu. I was craving lamb, and they don't include lamb in their buffet, so I ordered the lunch portion of the Lamb Curry. When it arrived, I was really surprised. It came in a small bowl. When I went to spoon some over my rice, I realized that there were only 4 small pieces of lamb. The rest was all sauce. The lamb pieces were about a cubed inch in size. I asked the waiter, assuming when they filled the bowl just didn't realize there wasn't much meat in it. His reply was that the lunch portion only comes with 4 pieces (SMALL pieces) of lamb -- ($5.95). The dinner portion comes with 8 ($11.95). I don't eat huge portions but I have to admit, it was really small and sad that they actually count them out. That is a first for me. I was disappointed and ended up not being satisfied by the small portion. I have been to Tandoor (1226 Chapel) and Zaroka (148 York) Both are just as good or better and you will get a reasonable portion. They don't count out their pieces of meat, either. Both have buffets that are also very good.
