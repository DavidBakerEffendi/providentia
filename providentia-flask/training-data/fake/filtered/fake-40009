The part of Manhattan where Cafe Cluny resides can be tricky but I'm glad I found it. The area is quite residential, reminds me of Brooklyn Heights actually. Anyhow, the restaurant is small and cozy and the staff is quite friendly. I went for breakfast and had the French Toast which was quite good. However, there could have definitely been more on the plate. One piece of bread cut in half just isn't cutting. Even with that, I'd recommend this place. If you can appreciate coffee, they keep it coming and its good...far from dinner quality. I'd definitely go there again and again.
