By far the worst bar I've ever been to, and that's saying a lot. The drinks were weak, the bartenders were slow and rude, the bouncer was a complete jerk who tried to act like a cop because he is depressed that he's a bouncer at a college bar and the entire bar was filled with rowdy college kids and old washed up grandmas trying to hit on them. I literally walked out after my first drink. It was a horrible experience that I wouldn't recommend to anybody.
