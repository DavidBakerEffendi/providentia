I cannot believe we didn't find this place earlier. Great atmosphere, with gorgeous wrought iron and antique colored glass bottles. Great drinks, with innovative combinations and old classic renditions, offering every spirit under the sun. Great food -- we had the bacon-wrapped dates and they were like heaven in my mouth. The thing that's really special is the Bespoke Cocktails. You talk with the bartender about your tastes and preferences, and he makes something just for you. Â I had a strong, bourbon-based, cardamom-scented drink that was great, and my husband had an incredible drink with rum, frothy egg white, and spices (nutmeg and cloves, I think?). We'll be coming back soon.
