Go for the atmosphere and good service, but the food is average. I've been to Blue four times, the first time was a month after opening with a large group and the food was great; the second and third time was several months later and the food was average. The last time we sat outside and it is one of the few places you can enjoy watching tug boats and descent food at the same time. Watch out for falling leaves and berries, I got hit a few times and some landscaping is needed. It can get very loud inside in the colder months, but during warmer weather, the outdoor area is open and beautiful Gothic style windows and doors are open, which helps with the noise issue.
