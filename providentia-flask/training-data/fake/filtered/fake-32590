This is a mixed review. I agree with most of what other reviewers have noted about this place. When it first opened, I was a fan. The staff was french and they tried to make the restaurant decor feel authentically French, which was nice. In any case, I was compelled to continue to frequent this place to help support a restaurant in my neighborhood. However, I went there recently on a busy night and it was the worst experience. First, the staff was so flustered that the quality of the service and the food suffered as a result. They were all running around like headless chickens and the food was late and cold. I was there with family visiting NYC and it was a complete nightmare. And whatever you do - when they ask how things are don't feel inclined to give an honest response. They don't take criticism well. I don't think I will be going to this place again - certainly not on a busy restaurant night. A Tuesday afternoon may be okay and manageable for the staff.
