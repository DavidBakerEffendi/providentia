This new ippudo is wonderful. It is a lot more open than the original restaurant downtown, has a shorter waiting time, even a little upstairs area that could probably be used for a small group, and all with the same great food we have all come to know and love from this name. I recommend this branch over the downtown location if only for the better lighting and shorter wait time.
