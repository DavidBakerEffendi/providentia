Too bad, so sad. What was once my favorite place is now a place to never return. Beer list is awesome, but Philly is a city full of restaurants with great food and craft beer lists, so on to the next. Manager took my empty beer glass from table. Didn't ask if id like another. Nice to have sat in a booth next to the bar; I didn't have to get up and walk too far from my table to ask for another beer after waiting for our waiter, to no avail. We had a friend show up later and ordered a beer and sandwich. Beer came and after about 45 minutes of waiting, no sandwich. Surprising seeing as how the manager took tht order... They offered to comp our forgotten sandwich Â if we waited while they prepared it at tht time, but after waiting so long we opted to go elsewhere. I was surprised and a little taken aback by the fact that even after speaking with a manager who was very apologetic about the errors of the evening, he was happy to charge us full price. No worries, we won't be back. Judging by the lack of traffic compared to the past, I suppose many other locals have opted to go elsewhere as well.
