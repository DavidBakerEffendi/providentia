I liked this place very much but was a little frustrated because it took an hour to get our food even though there were only 3 tables with customers.  Also, what kind of restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for the customers?! Aside from that, their food is good and it has a cozy atmosphere.  I reccomend their rosemary fries and mushroom cigars
