Great food, fantastic service. We had a party of 4 for V Day and as crowded as they were, still had a great wait staff and amazing food. Going in expecting small plates tapas style, but moderate prices. We had 7 plates for 4 and had a very satisfying meal. Thanks to Eric for giving up his V Day to hang out with us, he felt more like another friend at the table than a waiter.
