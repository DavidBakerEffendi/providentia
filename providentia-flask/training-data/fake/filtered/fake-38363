I have been coming to Bondurants since pretty close to their opening day. Their craft beer selection is superb, and ever changing. It's rare to go back and see the same things more then once. The whiskey selection is equally as impressive and whenever I order an Old Fashion, I watch the bartender use fresh orange and ingredients. The food is awesome - I think i've tried everything on the menu at this point and have yet to be let down and have eaten brunch, lunch, dinner and late night here. The staff is also extremely knowledgable, friendly and helpful. I also really enjoy the atmosphere, from the hidden TVs that only come out for big sports events to the music to the gorgeous wood bar.
