Warning Guys be aware of that place, they get your money sheet on u, bad food, reduce the size of your sandwich and charge extra at the register always add $0.50 - $2.00 extra and fool you. They have a fake student discount 10% which they calculated as 5% or 7% They charge for any thing double has a cockroaches and flies every where. I used that shop twice, first time they charge extra and second time I found a fly in my sandwich. I will never go back again
