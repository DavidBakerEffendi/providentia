I have to give it to them for their delicious pizza! I've gone there multiple times for lunch and never was displeased. The manger is very very nice, and the food is really good! But the ambiance of the place isn't exactly appealing. Sanitary levels aren't so high and the place is definitely not top notch. If your looking for somewhere to just grab a quick bite or get a lunch for a great price, I definitely recommend it. For a night out or time to socialize, I don't.
