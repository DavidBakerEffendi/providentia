This Mint Thai Cuisine is FANTASTIC Thai Restaurant. The food is fast, fresh, and delicious. Great portions, awesome prices, and super vegetarian / vegan friendly. I love that all of the dishes are veggie packed and all entrees come with a generous portion of rice. Note that this place is very nice and well decorated , seats like 15 people max, so the servers might be a little frazzled because there are so many orders called in, people trying to eat, and people waiting for takeout. Everything I've ordered has been absolutely wonderful, no complaints here. This has become my go-to Thai Restaurant.
