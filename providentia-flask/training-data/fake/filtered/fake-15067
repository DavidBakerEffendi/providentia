RIPPED OFF...  NEVER AGAIN!   OK, so I've been here for dinner before, and had a nice time.  It's not cheap, and they squeeze 3 or 4 of you into a 2 person table to get the biggest bang for their buck...  fine.  That's cool.   I take 2 friends here on Tuesday and am told it's a 15 minute wait.  No worries. I step out to take a call, and step back in and am told I'm at the bottom of the list again...  I missed my spot.  Hmm... OK.   Another 15 minutes.   We finally get seated on our tiny table and order some drinks.  My friend and I order the pinot , but they're out of it.  The waiter suggests the sav blanc.  Fine, that sounds reasonable...  so we get it, and end up having 4 glasses.   All going well until we get our bill... whoops, the sav blanc was $18.50 a glass??  Almost DOUBLE the pinot grigio.   I mean WTF?  It was a completely ordinary 'house white' quality and they're charging $18.50 a glass???!  90% of their meals are under that price.   I can get some nice French champagne around the corner at Fedora for $14, but there I get the ambiance and other bs that comes with the price.  And I'm happy to pay.     So in summary, love the food and the service is OK, given how busy they are, but I HATE feeling ripped off.    If you're going to suggest an alternative to something because YOU ran out of the first choice, TELL YOUR CUSTOMER IT'S ABOUT DOUBLE THE PRICE YOU F***ER.   So despite living on Bleecker, on principal. I'm NEVER coming back here.
