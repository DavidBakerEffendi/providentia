Might be my favorite restaurant in Williamsburg (switches off with Marlow) The menu isn't as adventurous as Marlow or Diner, but everything is consistently great.  Can't go wrong with the French Dip, which is served with a huge dollop of fresh horseradish sauce.  Both steaks on the menu are nice, and cooked perfectly. Be careful - can get very crowded at peak times (hell, even off peak times).  If you get a comfy seat at the bar while you wait it is VERY easy to rack up a $100 bar tab before you even sit down.
