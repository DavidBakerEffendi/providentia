The club is amazing.  Wearing a jacket to dinner is not my thing, but the food here is great and the service is impeccable.  For the quality of the food you can't beat the prices.  Most importantly all profits go to charity.  Great place for special events and unlike other places the food is consistently good.  You won't have the best meal of your life here, but you will never have a bad meal.
