Pies N' Thighs let someone who is not authorized to take delivery orders take my phone call.  After spending 15 minutes waiting for him to find a pen, they have the audacity to call me back and tell me, even though they had delivered to me before, that I was half a block out of their delivery zone.  While the food is delicious, nothing can replace customer service, especially after someone has been patient with you.  It will be a long time, if eve,r before I eat there again.
