Good breakfast. In town for a few days.  Had breakfast the first day at Lindy's at 53rd and 7th.  That was awful.  Since we had good experiences the previous year at Junior's, decided to take a walk.  It was worth it.  Great potatoes; crispy and tasty.  Many strips of good bacon.  And they gave a couple of pastries while we were waiting. Would go back again then next time we're in the city.
