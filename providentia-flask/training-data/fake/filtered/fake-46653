great lively vibe in the space.    i have to say unfortunately the food is "masked",  what lies beneath is the most horrendous and rancid oil!!!! the hummus is  tasty,  mainly tahini and little chick peas.  that's what makes it so thick and tasty.  eggplant spread good...salad before you add salt and pepper and just tasting the oil and lightly seasoned.....RANCID OIL!!!!!  totally unacceptable!!!!
