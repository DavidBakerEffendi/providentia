Stumbled upon this place for lunch today with my son and mother!  Absolutely fantastic food!!! Grew up in Bergen County, Upper Saddle River, live in Manhattan for 10 years and now live in Rutherford and this is one of the best Italian restaurants I've ever eaten in!!!  Really nice decor and great service.  Matthew the owner was there and was very warm and friendly.  So happy to have found this place.  Will be going back with my husband soon!!!
