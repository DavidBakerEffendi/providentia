Simply said, food: delish, service: craptastic.  We had such a bad experience here tonight with the rude, unhelpful staff that we won't be back.  A shame since I used to live in the neighborhood and have been coming here for almost ten years. Holier-than-thou, aloof hipster attitude doesn't match the inventive food or the upscale prices.  I'll stick to Dressler from now on.
