Tepid, Lackluster : Stopped in here for dinner and was immediately put off by the less than friendly greeter. My date and I both had the Jaeger Schnitzel, which was completely unimpressive - a bare piece of pork (?) seemingly boiled in the same thin white mushroom sauce it was served in, lukewarm. Plain white rice, no garnish. Nothing else. The plate was cracked too, though I might be imagining that. In short, I feel this is the type of place that might have been good once, but has slipped through apathy. It's got a certain down at the heels, even slovenly atmosphere that's far from charming. I will come back, though - Â when I'm very, very hungry and in the neighborhood. Perhaps after the Apocalypse.
