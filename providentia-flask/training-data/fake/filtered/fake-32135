I used to love the Raspberry Habernero wings but now they taste differnet, im very dissapointed. i dont know why this is. There are very few good people in the waitstaff and sometimes ive heard yelling from the kitchen. Sounds like the chef or manager back there needs a visit from the dept of labor, Get a pizza they are fantastic and ask for Will to be your server.
