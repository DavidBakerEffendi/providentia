I have nothing but great things to say about this place. From the moment me and my mom walked in for brunch, we were greeted by a friendly man (who could have been either the host or the owner) and our server was excellent (attentive but not overbearing, knew the menu, friendly and prompt). It's a really cute place with a laid-back yet sophisticated vibe. Beautiful art work around the venue and a great place for relaxed conversation. The food we had was delicious and inexpensive for the quality of ingredients. When we left, we also had a very friendly exit with the staff. I was very pleased and will return again. Keep up the good work, Gold Standard!
