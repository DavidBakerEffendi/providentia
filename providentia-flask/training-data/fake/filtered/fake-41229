Delicious, hot, rich, fulfilling. This is not a place you come for a snack, if you want bowl of delicious spicy freshness then this is where you come. Order the pork appetizer if you don't like meat, get the extreme hot if you like it hot, order a Sapporo or two and enjoy. The wait sucks but we all go through it barbecue it's just that good.
