We stopped by Jim's on the way to the airport for a quick bite. Since we were in a hurry, I called ahead and ordered three philly cheesesteaks to avoid the line. Folks, if you're in the area and looking for amazing cheesesteak sandwiches, it really does not get better than Jim's. Now, pull pork -- that's a different story!
