I was in the neighborhood looking for a cozy, inexpensive spot for dinner, when Paprika came out in our search and it was the right choice. Restaurant was about half full (it is also freezing outside). The service was good, personable but very unpretentious, what I liked. We got two glasses of red wine, you can't go wrong with Chianti and ordered our dinner. I had their special artichoke salad and my husband had beef carpaccio. Both of the appetizers were fresh and flavorful. I am usually not a fan of artichoke, but decided to try it and loved that it was an actual salad, rather than whole artichoke. Our entrees were heavenly good. Honestly, I eat out pretty often, but not as often I get quality, mouthful dishes. I had black ink linguini with seafood. And my husband had a steak. I honestly suggested him not to have a steak as I only prefer to get steaks in steakhouses, but this was surprisingly good, all you can ask for in a steak. Overall, we will be back when are in the neighborhood.
