I went to Maialino on Friday night for dinner for the first time and had a great experience overall.  The food was quite good, as I expected.  I had the Bolognese with duck ragu, which I would highly recommend.  We started off with a selection of 7 cheeses, which were also very good.  The server was very friendly and while it took him too long to take our orders, we were enjoying our wine, so I didn't care all that much.  He was very thoughtful and checked in with us frequently afterwards.  The menu is a bit hard to understand, which is slightly frustrating, but the server provided some great recommendations.  My girlfriend had a homemade pasta with pepper sauce which was delicious.  Their cocktail list could use a little updating, as no one at the table loved their cocktails, but again, not enough to keep me from coming back.  Overall, the atmosphere was great, the food and service was good, and the prices were reasonable.  I'll be back!
