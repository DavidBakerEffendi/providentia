Absolutely delicious food!  If you are looking for a "hole in the wall" with authentic Mexican food that tastes great then this is it.   Driving to the place would worry most because the area is definitely not upscale.  The restaurant is a plain, rectangular corner building with a small sign over the door. The employees are very personable unlike most Mexican restaurants the employees spoke and understood English very well,  which actually gave me a wrong first impression thinking if they speak English this well, they can't make good Mexican food.  That impression was as wrong as it was prejudiced.   They have a vast menu. Tacos with every filling you could imagine except ground beef, which disappointed my wife only up until she took the first taste of her Chorizo.  She found the Chorizo to be perfect. The restaurant is only slightly bigger than the space needed for the kitchen so the "dine in" area is nearly inside the kitchen.  You could watch them make your meal from the table and my wife noticed everything was prepared fresh as needed.  The wait time from ordering to food on the table was acceptable.  I could be wrong but I think the owners live in an apartment right off the corner of the restaurant because as we waited I witnessed a woman come out,  make something to eat then brought it back into the apartment. I am under the impression this is what a restaurant in Mexico would be like.  There was no fancy decor, no Mexican blankets,  no Mariachi singers, no morracas or any of that stuff you see in a commercialized place. I received excellent food at a decent price with good service.  I would definitely go back again. Don't be turned off by location or lack of the commercialized look.  If you are in the mood for great Mexican food don't miss this place.  Just remember to bring cash!
