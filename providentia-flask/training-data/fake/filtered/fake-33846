The rudest waiter I have ever encountered anywhere. I was enjoying an early Sunday evening dinner with a fellow diplomat.  because we both served in Latin America, neither of us could pinpoint waiter's origin.  This is something diplomats and many others do in identifying heritage of waiters which is a fun thing to do in such a richly diverse place like NYC.  It gives the guest an opportunity to interact and connect with the waiter and say thank you.  When I asked the waiter where was he from he refused to say and rudely said he was too busy and not interested in engaging in any other type of conversation...maybe he thought we worked with dHS?  he even refused to answer in Spanish.  i paid bill, did not order coffee, desert or after dinner drinks and left.  Will never return. Pasta dishes were expensive for portions and for pasta. The gnocchi Gorgonzola did not have the slightest taste of blue cheese.  It tasted mostly like cream.  Management should put wait staff through training.  If one engages the guests the tip will be better and the guests will feel engaged and welcomed and will return.  We also were testing out the restaurants for a much larger dinner to take place later this month. Clearly this place is no longer being considered.
