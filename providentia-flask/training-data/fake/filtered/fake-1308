Food is good but service needs improvement.  I ordered a speciality pizza which said one price on the board behind them at the counter.  But when it came time to pay they said the prices have all gone up but they haven't had time to update the price board.  Really?!  Just get up on the chair and change them now!  It was false adervtising at best but more like fraud.  And we're not talking a dollar or 2, try $32 for a special pizza, are they out of their minds?  Good food but not worth the price or hassle of the bad service.
