I'll probably have to agree with mostly everyone on this site who says that Rutt's Hutt is the greatest hot dog ever created on this earth.  I've been going there for at least 5 years religiously now and have never been disappointed.  I order the same meal everytime and for a quick in and out lunch this place cannot be beat.   The hot dogs are simply heavenly, the french fries are always crisp and hot, the onion rings are a greasy gift from God and the atmosphere is just, well, very simple and bustling.  I also highly recommend the relish which makes the hot dog all the more "gooder" Try it!  You will not be disappointed.
