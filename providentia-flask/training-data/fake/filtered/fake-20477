An amazing experience!!!! I reserved for a special night with my wife to celebrate her birthday and recent career accomplishments. I organized with the restaurant Manager to have a tour and meet the chef but for our surprise we were welcomed by the owner herself. Ellen took my wife to a private tour and she had the opportunity to meet and talk with the chef. The food was amazing. I had the Chef Tasting Menu Â and my wife scallops. We also started with the charcuterie. I have to point out, all what you eat at this place is fresh and made there. I mean, the bread, desserts, pasta, and even the charcuterie is curing downstairs. Service was excellent and I recommend requesting Dan as your server. We live and work in CC and go out a lot but we have to say that Fork is a truly Philadelphia Gem and they have won customers for life.
