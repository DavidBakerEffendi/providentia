I don't even know where to begin! Friendly faces throughout the whole store. It's a family owned Quiznos and these people are amazing. The woman making my sandwich asked me about my day, and told me a couple of jokes to make me laugh. The guy who rang me out gave me a free drink with my sandwich! The food here is undoubtedly the best in Orange. I'd recommend everyone in Connecticut check this Quiznos out, I'll definitely be back.
