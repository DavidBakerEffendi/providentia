I went to Osteria Morini last night! I was SO excited to try this place out! I will start off by saying that the food was delicious...the meats melted in my mouth and the gorgonzola dolce, which is my favorite cheese, was also smooth and rich! The portions were decent as well...we got the Fried Appetizer (on menu under cheeses) for one person. This was also tasty but a somewhat strange arrangement of appetizers on one plate! We got the pasta with cream and smoked prosciutto (your typical pasta carbonara but w homemade noodle pasta). The serving size was a LITTLE too small for $18.00 but very fresh and good, none the less. I got the ravioli w marscapone and truffle butter! Good portion, smaller version of ravioli, and creamy! mmm! Again, for $19 (due to the truffle butter I assume) I think the price couldve been a fewww dollars cheaper! Especially when you look at true italian pasta dishes in Italy...they are decent portions but on the smaller side and quite cheap since they are served as a course in between many other courses. Over all, great food, GORGOUS AMBIENCE, and friendly staff.. there were a few confusions with our simple three meat platter, water's were not filled very often, no knives on the table and the service was just so-so. I am sure with a few more weeks this place will be flawless!
