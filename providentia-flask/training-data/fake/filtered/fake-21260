My boyfriend and I were loyal customers of Bogota for four years, consistently leaving generous tips. One night, they brought the check, we added a 25% tip, and right before the server took our credit card, we noticed a line item for an automatic 18% gratuity. The line was not prominent in any way. We asked the server why there was gratuity added, and she said they automatically add gratuity for checks past 10 PM. Well, we typically eat late because of our jobs, so we must have paid this subtle 18% gratuity multiple times without even realizing it, each time adding an additional tip on top of it!  When we said we felt that was deceptive, the bartender walked over and said it was standard policy for the restaurant and they had a right to add this 18% gratuity. Well, I beg to differ Bogota, because now there's a class-action lawsuit against NY restaurants with deceptive policies like yours. I'm just hoping you're one of the restaurants named in the suit. If not, I've still got a copy of that check. From today's news... news.yahoo.com/blogs/sid…
