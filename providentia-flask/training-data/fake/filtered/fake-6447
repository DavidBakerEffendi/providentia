We recently had our wedding reception here, and I cannot even begin to say how happy we were from beginning until end. From the first moment we spoke to Bobby I felt like I was talking to my brother! He was extremely honest and helpful when it came to helping us make decisions on food, room, lighting, etc. He was open to all my suggestions and sensitive to any of my concerns. On the day of our wedding (we had our ceremony and reception here), when I walked into the room it truly felt like a fairy tale wedding!! The lighting, probably one of my most favorite aspects of the wedding was AMAZING!! Countless chandeliers in every color you could imagine!!The food was outstanding. When friends and family found out that we were getting married here the first thing they mentioned was the excellent food! This time was no different. We had a buffet to allow everyone to taste all that they could. The food stations were generously refilled as we gobbled it all up!!ALL of our guests raved about the whole experience! Â Bobby was available every second of the night! Our cake was no exception to all of the amazement of the night! DELICIOUS!!! I would recommend The Appian Way for any event, especially if you want a very personalized wedding. Thanks Bobby....FOR EVERYTHING!!!
