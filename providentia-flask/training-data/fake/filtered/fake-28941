We came to salute one night due to it's high ratings and popularity. We parked our car in the garage (which the tickets are $5 less if your there for the restaurant) and took the elevator down to the road. We sat in a small corner with about 3 tables, which wasn't my preference but I wasn't going to make a big scene about it. First off, the garlic bread was AMAZING and the owner even gave us some extra to take home with us which was very kind and generous. I also got the Caesar salad, which was perfect, absolutely nothing wrong with it. I ordered the rose pasta, and it was probably the best pasta dish I've ever had. It was cooked and seasoned to perfection, and the meat added extra flavor. I would defiantly come here, even if it's a 2 hour drive, it'll be worth it trust me. Plus the xl center is like a 5-10 minute walk so you can hit the ice rink for a game than go to salute for a fun night out!
