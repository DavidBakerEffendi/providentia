I've been here three times since we moved to the area - so that's three times in about 6 weeks.  We really enjoy the breakfast.  Eggs, pancakes, toast, homemade jam - all are fresh and served hot just the way we ordered them.  The coffee is very tasty and the seating inside and out is comfortable.  The service matches the theme: laid back.  We do get refills on coffee and waters, but they are not in your face every two minutes, which I find is a positive thing.  Try the huevos rancheros or the Bonzai Pipeline.  The panckes are also very fluffy and yummy.  The only reason I can't give five stars is because I think it could be a little cheaper.  But, I moved from an area of New York that's cheap to live in, so maybe I am dreaming hoping for less expensive food in this area of Vermont!
