Went here on the grand opening. Of course it was worth the line-out-the-door wait! Lots more seating/standing room to eat at, compared with the original store. We didn't want to waste time waiting for "fancies" so we just got a dozen regular (Cinnamon, vanilla spice & lemon); and a 1/2 order of buttermilk ranch chicken. All were piping hot and delicious! We will be back for more!
