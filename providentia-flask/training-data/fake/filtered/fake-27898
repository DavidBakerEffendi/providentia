Simply delicious.  I haven't had their calzones yet, but I definitely want to go back to try them out!  The pizza is not even comparable to other, standard pizzaria-types; it's like comparing a home-grilled, juicy burger straight from the farm to a processed sandwich off the Dollar Menu.  Like I said, simply delicious!
