I went for dinner with my girlfriend during the week, we walked in and waited to be seated.  There were two waitresses that proceeded to pass us by and not help us for a while, didn't ask if we wanted to sit at the bar or table, don't know if they intentionally were ignoring us, but it took a while to get seated, and the place wasn't filled. The menu has traditional, average Italian food.  Drinks took a little while to come out, but the food and dessert came out quickly.   I would say this is like any other north Jersey Italian restaurant but lacking customer service.
