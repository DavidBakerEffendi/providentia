This was a very good indian place, they're many in Parsippany but this ones my personal favorite. I really wanted to enjoy the food and get the most out of the visit. So 3 of my friends and I went here for dinner. Its very nicely decorated and clean. First we ordered the samosa chaat and 2 chicken pakpras as appatizers. It was just our table that day but it still took long for the food to arrive. After we ate I ordered the goat vindaloo and 2 naan. My friends ordered many sizzlers and curry based dishes. The food was very good, it was also a little spicy, and I did not order it spicy. Other than that it was fine. It also took them a whie to get u some more water. The experience could have been better, I might be back in the future.
