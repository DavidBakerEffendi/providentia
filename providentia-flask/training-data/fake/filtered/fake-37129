I just did my first review on a bad excuse for a deli so it makes sense to review what I compare all other delis to. I lived in CT for 4.5 years and I'm angry that I didn't discover this until after a year of living there. I thought for a long time it was a really sketchy place because there were always police/ambulance/state trooper/campus safety/fire trucks parked nearby. Turns out, they all knew where to go for an awesome lunch! It is good for a basic meat/cheese sub (like my husband gets) or a more special ingredient sandwich.... Oh how I miss the Cali Chick sandwich with grilled chicken, pesto mayo, red peppers and fresh (!) slices of avocado. And huge portions too, that I could eat half for one lunch and save it for the next day. One tiny negative is how popular it is and how busy it gets during peak hours. Consider Friday lunch time when all the college kids use it for hangover cures and everyone else wants to start the weekend early. Amazing and WORTH IT.
