Communal seeting was off-putting upon entry BUT Food is DELICIOUS and the waitstaff is attentive and nice- no snooty hipsters here. The owner was present and charming, giving us some gratis sake and talking about his love of food ....just like an old world restaurant. loved the sense of family in the place- you would think you were at grandmas house.
