This lonesome star is awarded for the wonderful food this establishment is capable of dishing out. The 4 missing stars that would have been rewarded are missing due to the lack of concern the staff have for waiting customers. While it may be thought to be a plus to be able to sit at a table for as many hours as one wishes without ordering food or drink, this practice eventually results in the failure of many establishments. Three tables with yapping girls slowed out evening down with a full hour and a half wait at the door. Normally I would jump ship and head for another spot but it was 11 pm and I had no choice but to appreciate the food at this spot. Bottom line. If you eat here please be courteous and don't take up a table just to chat for hours. If the place fails because of you we all loose. Don't be selfish :)
