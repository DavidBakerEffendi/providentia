First time here and will be back soon. We had great service from the time we walked in until we left. Our server Genesis made great suggestions- wild mushroom flat bread and arepitas w short rib so delicious! We had $5.00 Bacardi mojitos all night long. haven't seen these prices for quality cocktails in years. The vibe was great, nice people around us and the view was amazing. Told my office about it today planning a night out soon and this will be the spot.
