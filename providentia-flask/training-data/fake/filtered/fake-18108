There isn't anything that isn't phenomenal at this place!   The laffa is fabulous and I could eat my weight in that alone. However, being a vegetarian, I thought that the marinated zucchini with hazelnuts was a delightful change and amazing!   I would splurge and get more savory dishes than using the valuable stomach real estate for dessert :)
