I visited this nice quaint restaurant, near the Holland tunnel entrance, it is great to take a date for a nice quiet dinner, perfect for any celebrities that don't want to be bothered by the paparazzo or fans . The Food was absolute amazing. The homemade French Onion soup was so good, I ordered a second bowl. The beet salad was so fresh and crisp. everything was first class. Great Wine Selection, even Wines from Israel were offered. A MUST VISIT one of the best French Restaurants, i have visited. Everything is perfection and home made. The staff was so accommodating and friendly!
