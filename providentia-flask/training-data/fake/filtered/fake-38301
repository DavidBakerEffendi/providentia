Had the Groupon, and I am open to trying new things....... Let me start by saying they would have got 5 stars but I have no previous experience in the food offered. Sal greeted us and sat us quickly, I enjoy South St best on a Sunday night everybody is open but most of the crazies are gone. The room was attractive the music was perfect our server was soooo nice and helpful! The best part was the food, we kept it simple ordering Babaganoush and Falafel both great! We opened our petete syrah wine, (which I have no clue about but Google said it works well with the food and they were right!) entrees were Tilapia with salad and rice and lamb meatballs. we loved both of our entrees the flavors were wonderful the tilapia was prob the best I have tasted. The grand finale was the Rice Pudding one of my favorite desserts, this too was great very crisp and clean tasting with no after taste. I can't wait to go back. PS wanted the leftovers for today but we dropped them off at Moms in South Philly, She loved it !!!
