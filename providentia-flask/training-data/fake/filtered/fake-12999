Stay away from this place.  The food is canned, the service is poor and the amazon that stands at the counter is rude and needs some lessons in customer service.   I was recommended to this place by some good friends.  They told me the price is right, but the place is cramped.  I felt like I was going through a maze.  There is no room to move.  We asked for a bigger table but the owner/manager/amazon/bitch said the bigger tables are reserved for 4 people (there were literally 4 other people in the place). My boyfriend and I ordered the pasta with clam sauce, a pizza carciofi and insalata campagniola.  We had to ask them for bread (it was stale and had no taste).   The salad came first.  The lettuce looked old and turning brown, the peppers were three little thin slices, but the best was the black shoe leather they tried to pass off as prosciutto.   Next came the pizza or should I say the cardboard with canned artichokes and mushrooms and again the black leather passing for prosciutto.  No taste what so ever. The pasta with clams was so disgusting....they give you 3 clams in the shells and the rest of the clams had a tinny taste (that's what happens when you open a can of clams and they stay in the can a few days). STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE, OR YOU CAN END UP IN THE BATHROOM ALL NIGHT TOO, JUST LIKE ME!
