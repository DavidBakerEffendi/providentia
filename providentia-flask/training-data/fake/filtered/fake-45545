Got there at 6:00 to avoid the wait. After being seated one of us immediately ordered for the entire table of 6.   We had no questions about the menu and made life easy for our waiter. Had our apps, pasta and then main course. To be fair the food was good.  Our waiter wasn't outwardly rude or obnoxious (at this point) but had been very matter of fact and not so welcoming.  Again, to be fair we were all fine with that. We knew the atmosphere and realized we weren't at a 5 star romantic French restaurant.    HOWEVER...at 7:25 the waiter came by and almost as if it were an inconvenience, asked if we wanted dessert. One of us said "yes, can you give us a second to decide." To which we were told "actually, no.  I can't. If you don't know now, I can't.  There is a line out the door"    Are you kidding me!  We were not sitting around chatting and sipping on water.  In fact, we ate pretty quick once our main course was finally served.  Never in my life have I been rushed like that.  Usually dessert is pushed on a customer. Instead we were pushed out the door.  Needless to say we asked for the check, since there was such a rush to get rid of us.  Never, ever again will I step foot in the place.
