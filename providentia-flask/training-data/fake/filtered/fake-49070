Stopped in here after a brief Brooklyn Flea stop this past weekend. The space is so fresh and clean. The decor is simple and inviting. I had the clam chowder, which was possibly the best I've ever had. Then moved on to to the crab roll which was delish. Also had their homemade lemonade and Old Bay seasoned chips, allll of which make me want to go back ASAP!!
