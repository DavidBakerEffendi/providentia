I used to live a half a block away from the Islands. The saddest part about leaving that beautiful duplex was definitely moving away from this unbelievable restaurant. I've been coming to the Islands since 2003 and its still my favorite place in the city. I've had them cater events, I've called ahead and taken over the entire upstairs for my birthday and even had them make me some special punch last minute on the way to a dinner party. The most amazing thing is the Stewed Peas. Get it if you're lucky or go EARLY because it sells out quick everyday. All your standard Jamaican fare is better here (no patties though...) and I also highly recommend the Calypso Shrimp and Whole Red Snapper. Warning, Its tiny! I mean Wonka tiny, like it doesn't seem possible these two lovely Jamaican women can even fit in their kitchen small. The upstairs room (like up super steep Aircraft Carrier stairs) actually gets smaller towards the back and has a tiny door to the bathroom. Like I said, Wonka tiny. As always, expect Caribbean Time.
