I literally waited 2 hours to get a seat in this place. Once we got inside, we spent 25 minutes because of how fast-paced the dining experience is. They rush you, but not in a rude way at all. That being said, the food really is great. The noodle are some of the best I had. Would I wait again? Probably not. It's too "no-frills" for me. It's like a factory: wait, sit, eat, get out. There's no enjoyment in the dining experience. BUT again, the food is very very good. So I'd say try it, but it's a one-time experience kind of thing.
