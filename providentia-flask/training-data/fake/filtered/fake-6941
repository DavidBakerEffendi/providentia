Just a warning, if you are looking for bad food, bad service and high prices, Franklin is the place for you.  Avoid at all cost.  One steak was overcooked, one under.  Manager came over agreed one not cooked right said the other one looked good to him and walked away.  Amazing.  Our bill for 6 was $420.  I guarantee that will not happen again.
