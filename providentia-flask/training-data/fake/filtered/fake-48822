I went to Pacifico the other night for dinner. I felt the prices were reasonable, the portion sizes were decent and the overall atmosphere was delightful. I loved the bright earth toned decorations and center pieces. I ordered the drink special and my date had the classic mojito. Both were delicious as were out calamari appetizer and dinners. I ordered a steak covered in pesto, sun-dried tomatoes, garlic/butter sauce. It was full of flavor and cooked to my taste. My date had the seafood medley plate- both were creatively presented. Overall, I had a great experience and would definitely recommend this restaurant to other people who would like a laid back, but delightful time. I think other people rated this place too harshly- but ultimately you should give it a chance yourself and be the judge.
