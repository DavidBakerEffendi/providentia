Last night I went to Miriam's for the first time (because of Bklyn Restaurant Week).  The interior is lovely, the service was excellent as was the food.  The prices were very reasonable, even when it's not Restaurant Week.  The owner, Rafael, came over to our table and asked us where we were from, was it our first time there, etc.  He was very engaging and delightful.  I would absolutely recommend Miriam's for a very satisfying, enjoyable dinner.
