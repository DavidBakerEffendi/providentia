I went here with a party of four at around 800 pm on Saturday. I flirted with the hostess a little and she hooked it up. We sat down and before we placed our orders we saw that a party sitting outside was finished and leaving. We asked to sit outside and they obliged our request. The environment and vibe of the place was awesome. They let us chill for a bit to take our order which was cool. We didn't feel rushed. We finally ordered our apps and entres. For apps we ordered the yoyos which are sweet platains stuffed w cheese and fried with a malta dipping sauce. Awesome. We also got platanos mochimeros. Its fried plantain with this mayo and grated cheese on it. Devine. Put the cilantro on it. For entre I got the La De Perlin arepa. It was really good. Could have used a little more salt. But the mango sauce they give you is real spicy. Amazing. Over all a nice experience. I would go back. There are more arepas to try, and I need those platanos mochimeros.
