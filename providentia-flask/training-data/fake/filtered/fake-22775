Portions are huge. And they actually have grits on the menu! However, they're instant grits -- why bother? But thankfully I didn't have to pay for the hair (plural, and long) in my food. Â When I pointed it out to the server and asked her to bring me another, hair-free dish, she went to the back, took out the visible hair, and brought it back. I coulda done that at the table. People rave, and this place is always packed on the weekends for breakfast, but really the food here made me kinda sick to my stomach.
