This place was really great. The food was excellent. Being from Phildelphia, we wondered if Steven Starr modeled his french bistro Parc after this place. Or was it vice versa? Anyhow, it was very crowded and lively on a Friday night. We had no reservation, but we got a drink at the bar and only had to wait about 25 minutes for a seat which was not bad at all. We should have went back on Saturday, since it was close to our hotel and the restaurant that we had a reservation at turned into a fiasco.
