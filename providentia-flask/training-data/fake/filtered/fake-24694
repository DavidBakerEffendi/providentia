I work in the area.  I was looking for lunch the other day, tired of the bodega sandwich.   Luckily, I ran into a friend on Spring Street on his way to Ba'al.  I joined him.  Incredible falafel sandwich.  The falafel was incredible.  Best I have ever tasted.  First, the pita is substantial and rich with flavor.  It does not split into soggy pieces in your hands. Second, the Falafel (best in the city) is so light and airy, seasoned expertly.  Third, the herbs are so fresh and vibrant, balanced with the spice of cumin and coriander.  Fourth, the sauces are perfect accompaniments.  Finally, damn it's gone. I went back to the office and bragged about it.  Maybe, I'll tell them where to go tomorrow.  Maybe.
