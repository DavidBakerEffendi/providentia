My family and I visited in-laws about a year ago and I wanted my kids to try an authentic Philly cheesesteak. It was tough to find parking and the area wasn't so great. On the bright side, we all loved the cheesesteaks although it wasn't really what we were expecting. All of my friends were telling me how amazing the cheesesteaks in Philly were so I was expecting an experience that was completely out of the ordinary. The sandwich honestly tasted about the same as some of the places that I go to into in the OC when I am at home. Still a good sandwich though...
