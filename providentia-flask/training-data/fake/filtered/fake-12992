I had (what I think it was) pieces of glass or plastic in my dish (pasta), when I told the waiter he called the manager which came and told me to PROVE IT. she said "it sound like a story". She didn't let me replace it with anything else. I left the place without eating anything. Poor service, Poor food. better pay few more bucks and spare the visit to the dentist. STAY AWAY!
