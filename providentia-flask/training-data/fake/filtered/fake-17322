Got an email stating that on 3/23/12 the oysters would be 1/2 price at TrePiani. When we asked about the 1/2 priced oysters, the waitress said, "People keep asking about that, but we know nothing about it." We called the mgr over to show him the email on my Blackberry. He reluctantly agreed to give us the 1/2 priced oysters but said that we could not have the Friday 1/2 priced wine by glass special. Guess we were being punished. Won't be back.
