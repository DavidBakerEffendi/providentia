Nice setting. Lively Mexican music and a very attractive chain style build. Service was competent but just fair.  The fare was not that good.  Seven people in our group did not even finish their servings.  It  just did not impress us with any semblance of Mexican or even Mexican chain food.   No flavor!  Do not expect a good Mexican food experience if you go.
