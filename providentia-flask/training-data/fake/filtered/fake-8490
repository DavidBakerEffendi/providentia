They are HIGHLY over rated!!!! The food has no taste atttalllllll. Where is the green seasoning??? Maybe because they have Spanish cooks and not rel Trini cookers why the food is soo bland. Â They are extremely over priced for no reason. I hate it....NEVER again. If you want great buss up and roti go to Trini and Bago right up Main St in Orange. Their food is muchhhh better.
