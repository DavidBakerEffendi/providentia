I grew up in the restaurant business. Italian born and breed. My parents owned two very successful ones using farm to table before it was in vogue. I know good food and love to cook, as many of us do, so not being pretentious just giving you credentials. First tip, if the bread at an Italian or French restaurant comes to the table and it isn't crusty outside and soft inside with good hole development....you may be in trouble. That was the start of our meal. Mushy bread....come on!  A vegetable terrine with mostly undercooked fennel...come on!  A special lamb sausage entree in a quarter inch casing and six inches long for $28 that was not special....come one!  A simple chicken entree which wasn't noted as organic so we asked the waitress who said its was (how do you believe that when it doesn't say so on the menu)....come on!  The French fries were okay...I should have gotten the burger or gone across the street to chipotle I would have saved $300.   I see the reviews coming in good for this place so maybe the kitchen had a bad night.  It happens but I feel there are soooo many other options at far, far better values than this place so it doesn't deserve even a two star.  Sorry Montmartre, I wanted to love you.   However, the service was professional. Waiter was informed and pleasant.
