Maybe the Smith has become a victim of its own success. We ordered food to pick up, which had obviously been sitting in the kitchen for a while, came tepid and was expensive, given the small portions (meat balls) and mediocre salad ("Mediterrenean"). Two mains and two starters $85! The bill was not correct, either. Sorry, but can't really recommend the place, although staff is friendly and pick-up orders are dealt with very efficiently.
