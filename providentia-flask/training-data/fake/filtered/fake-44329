Lunch time - and it madddd crazy and loud. It was more of a Rush you in / eat and throw you out kinda place.  It is not a place for you sit and relax. They REALLY want to turn the table fast. The Congee was bland and I had to add my own salt/ soy sauce.   It is a good ok if you just want a rush job as i told my friend but not a place I would go back to. I noticed that are other "noodle shops" all over the area. The tourist love this kinda place. but the local will tell you otherwise.
