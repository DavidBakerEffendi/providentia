This place is amazing!! Our first visit to Philadelphia, walked by this place several times in search of a good place to eat. We were tired after a long day of site seeing and decided to try this place as we were staying just across the street. WOW!! were we missing out. The lobster was as good as if we were in Maine. Crab and shrimp was equally Â good. Sure glad we tried it and, will be sure tell all our friends not to miss this treasure when visiting Philly! Thanks Luke!
