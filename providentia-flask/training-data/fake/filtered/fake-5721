I went to Textile from 1969-72, Phi Ep Pi frat house on School House Lane.  A group of us ate lunch at D'Alessandro's just about every day. I moved away from Philly in '74, and don't get back very often.  When I do, it's the FIRST and most frequent local destination.  There are imitators in other parts of the country, but D'Al's is the real deal. Never cared for the tourist attractions on Passyunk Ave in South Philly.  For cheesesteaks, D'Als' will always be #1 in my book.  Rizzo's Pizza in Glenside ranks a close second. [Note:  Rizzo's ranks #1 for a genuine Italian hoagie -- and if you ever move away from Philly, you'll salivate copiously at the thought of Rizzo's pizza (any way you like it).]
