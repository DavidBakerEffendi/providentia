An awesome after-work hang out. Solid beer selection. Mostly just a good place to go and unwind. The place has got 18 TVs, so there's def a lot to watch. Wandered downstairs and there was a solid looking party room. After trying it out myself, I went with a group of my friends. Since they're offering a deal through NookOut, we got 10 beers and 2 appetizers for just $40
