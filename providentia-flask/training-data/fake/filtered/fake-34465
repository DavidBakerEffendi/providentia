Stopped on the way back to RI from Rutland. My wife's large buttermilk pancake was "crisp" on the outside and soft on the inside.  My apple cider French toast was great.  Bacon and sausage patties were done just right.  Real maple syrup, knowledgeable and  friendly staff.  Well worth the stop for breakfast.  I am not a foodie or restaurant snob so I give it a 5 star especially for the location.  Give it a try because IMO you will not be disappointed.
