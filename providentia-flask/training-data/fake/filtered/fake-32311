I recently went to Le's for the third time, and it all came together: this restaurant is fantastic. The owners treat you like treasure, and seem to really be grateful for your business. They serve you a complimentary teapot of yummy leafy tea (not bitter at all) and a slice of pound cake. I got a combination of beef & chicken lemon grass over rice, and man was it tasty! There's some particular spice they add to it, which really enhances the flavor. For my appetizer I got some sort of vegetable/pork eggroll that has a fish oil dipping sauce on the side. It was okay, and I most likely won't get it again. The Vietnamese coffee with condensed milk (hot) is GREAT! However, it is over-priced as you only get about 3/4 of a teacup full with no refills for $3.00. The rest of the prices are hard to beat, as nearly all meals are under $10. They have Pho, noodle dishes, and rice dishes, with over 40 items in all. Lastly but certainly not least, the service is exceptional. Again, you're treated like royalty here in everything from seating you and taking your order to handing you your receipt. Definitely going here more often!
