Great view.  this place is only or mostly open for lunch.  I had chance to dine one Thrusday.  It is very ambitious to do what they are trying do.  They are limiting their meal service which makes buying and using product both challenging and expensive. They do a decent job but in my humble opinion they come up a bit short.  the Duck service suggestion medium rare was heat lamp cooked to MW.  The Deconstructed Key Lime Pie was OK though the crust part had gone stale.  Which is what one should expect when you are not doing the numbers to support the turn on product.  I think the restaurant would be a better place ifit was open more often.
