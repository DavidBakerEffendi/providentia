ANother of my recent discoveries. Never thought that sushi can be so delicious. Edemame and Seaweed salad - ah, how refreshing and healthy. Spicy salmon, eel, tuna, their sashimi, even ginger was better than anywhere. Absolutely tasty green tea with slightly smoky hint. Service was excellent as well, very charming asian lady was very polite and subservient. A place to go.
