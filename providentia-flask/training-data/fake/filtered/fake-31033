I haven't been here in a while but I am VERY happy I came again !!  The place was crowded but the hostesses greeted us right away and were very friendly.  Our server Kelli S. (#417) was FANTASTIC- VERY personable, VERY helpful & VERY patient with us as we did not know what to order !!  She told us about all the drink & appetizer specials as well as multiple suggestions for our meal !!  She also checked back with us a few times to make sure we were satisfied and we DEFINATELY were !!- THANK YOU "Prime 16" for serving AWESOME food and THANK YOU Kelli S. for taking such GREAT care of us- see you again REAL SOON !!
