I went here for a lunch this past summer and the burger is heaven. Pure heaven. If you need the best burger in the city- this might be it. It has to be. Buttery roll, perfectly cooked meat,  I don't know what meat is in it but it is by far one of the best I've ever had.  I'm absolutely against duck cruelty as well but, I tried the duck confit fries and I wanted to cry they were so good. Fried pickles, yum- if you've never tried them do it! But mostly, I just wrote this review because I work across the street since it has opened. I would be an obese pig if I didn't have self control or a religion that prohibits pork because the pork belly cooking and simmering- or whatever they're doing to it- it's f'n insane! I can't even go outside when I smell it, It's like a magnet! In any case, Whiskey Village is awesome and the cask conditioned beers are pretty stellar as well, even if you just try it once.
