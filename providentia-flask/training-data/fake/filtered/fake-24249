I've been to this restaurant many times but I must admit what keeps me coming back is the bar. Stopped in last night and as usual the bartender was personable and made awesome drinks. There were six in our party and everyone remarked on the quality of the cocktails. While there we ordered appetizers and as usual they were delicious. Keep up the good work.
