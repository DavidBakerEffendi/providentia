This place is amazing!  Old school Italian dishes, from pork and figs appetizer to the creamy fettucine alfredo, to homemade breads.  Veal chop primavera is so delightful and crisp, topped with fresh arugula.  I couldn't get photo's of them, but here are some of my girlfriends photo's of other delights.
