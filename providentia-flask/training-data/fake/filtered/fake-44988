Was inspired to start a Yelp account just to complain and warn about Wings over Hartford.  Yesterday I ordered at 10:15 pm or so and called again at 11:30 and was told the order was still out there.  No call at all, they had no problem charging my credit card and confirming after an hour food still on the way.  So food ordered, card charged and no call. I called today and spoke with manager Chris.  I complained and the initial person who took the call was rude and unapologetic.  I then got transferred to Chris who was verbally abusive, blamed me when I have perfect service and have no voicemails that the driver called and was told that charge would cancel instead of refunding me.  I was then hung up on after suggesting that food was not acceptable because his disrespectful staff no longer has my business solely based on this conversation.  There have been other previous issues such as no understanding fractions (1/4 one flavor, 1/4 one flavor, and 1/2 of one flavor apparently way too difficult) and timeliness so I am just done and disgusted I ever gave this chain my business.   I do not know who the night manager was on 7/23 but he messed up, didn't care about customer waiting who work the next day and the conversation with Chris on 7/24 made it so I will never eat at a wings over restaurant. I hope that my horrible experience makes others think twice and go elsewhere if they have any expectation of getting their food when charged to their card on time, accurately, or at all.   Thank you for being one of west hartford's worst dining experiences!
