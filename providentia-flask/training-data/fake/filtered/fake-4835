My name is Maria and I belong to a group which meets at the Red Stone every Wednesday.  I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!   The staff is so very friendly.   I haven't eaten anything I didn't like.   Feel comfortable ordering and trying everything on the menu..... IT'S ALL DELICIOUS!  Cool decor, comfortable settings, cool waterfall... just an all around  Great Place!  Thank you Red Stone :)
