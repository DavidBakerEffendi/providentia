We travel from the mainland to Philadelphia, shopping in Chinatown to find this hotel, we had lunch here. Our party of seven people spent a total of $ 138, 122 RMB per person , is still very cost-effective. The key is where the flavor is very good, basically kept the domestic Sichuan taste. The boss is also good, and finally gave us fruit. I feel very good! So come specially written praise.
