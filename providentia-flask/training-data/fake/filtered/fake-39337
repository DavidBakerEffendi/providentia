I've spent some time in Italy, (Sicily) and have come to know that Italians take they're cuisine extremely seriously. Being no stranger to Jersey pizzerias, I found Alfonso's to be a very delectible treat for those looking for a quick slice, or a romantic "Lady and the Tramp" kind of date.  From the pasta to their salads, you can taste every bit of freshness from the ingredients they use. They are very accomodating and have no problem communicating with you in Italian or Spanish if your English isn't as strong as it should be or if you just want to exercise your tongue. I did get take-out instead of dining in,  and the take-out bag was seriously burning my hand. Thank you guys for a epic meal!
