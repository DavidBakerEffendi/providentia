I went for lunch two days ago and the food was atrocious!  The tandori was dry,the chicken was dry, the rice reheated, the spinach clearly reheated and industrialized.  The food is an insult to Indian cuisine.  The air conditioner was put on ten minutes before we left on a very hot day.  $9.99 buffet was a total waste of money.  The service was courteous... but we won't be going back.
