This place is amazing, the coffee is excellent the staff is friendly and the backyard a tranquil get away. I sat down out back and ordered the thick cut prosciutto and toasted Italian bread an awesome filling snack. Followed up by the beat croissant ever. I'm looking forward to them getting their wine and beer permit this summer and laying out on the grass out back and doing my laundry across te st in between glasses.
