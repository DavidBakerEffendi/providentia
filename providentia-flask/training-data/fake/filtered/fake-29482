My experience at Amy Ruth's was one of mixed feelings. I ordered the Pres. Barack Obama baked chicken and it was very, very good. The problem was not the food cause I give it an A+ . I don't eat out often so when I go out to eat, I need ambiance....atmosphere, to make the experience a positive and memorable one. When we were escorted to the upstairs dining area, I wanted to turn around and leave. I felt like I ate in a barn! I guess I didn't expect that in Harlem. The lighting was too bright, no wall art, big brown wooden tables with no place settings or table cloths. I will enjoy my meal better when good food and ambiance are there together. Food was A+ but atmosphere was an F so only 2 Â stars on this one. Not saying that I won't patronage again but it will be strictly take out only.
