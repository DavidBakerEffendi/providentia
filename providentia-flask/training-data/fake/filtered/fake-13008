We came here at an off-time so we didn't have to wait for long to get a table.  The ramen here is absolutely delicious.  The broth is hearty and heavenly .  The pork belly is super tender and tasty.  I don't think I put my chopsticks down until I finished my entire bowl.  I will definitely be coming back.
