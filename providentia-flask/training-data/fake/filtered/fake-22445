This gem has some of the best food I have ever eaten.  Interesting takes on classics.  Homemade comfort foods was a twist.  One of my favorite things is the peanut butter and jelly bacon cheeseburger!   The menu is not substantial.   The restaurant is not large and with a smaller menu, children may not fair as well if they are picky eaters.   I have been numerous times and have tried many different dishes.  All were wonderfully prepared.  Wait staff is extremely courteous and prompt.   Only thing to remember is bring cash, they don't take credit or debit cards.
