I've never understood the hype with this restaurant.  The food is decent, but I have never had anything that is worth a long wait in line.  One of the things I judge a restaurant on, is the number of items I have to decide between ordering.  When you look at a menu and find 5 different things that look amazing, you judge by the quality of what you ordered and you make a point to come back.   Unless I'm at a place that is famous for their burgers, that is usually my "I give up" dish, which means that nothing else looked exciting enough, so I fell back on an old standard that may not be fantastic, but should be OK.   I usually get a burger and Lucky Lou's.
