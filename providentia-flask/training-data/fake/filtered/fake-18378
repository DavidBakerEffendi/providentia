Food was great and the service was excellent !! I would recommend Kochi to whoever wants to try out "REAL" Indian food.. ..certainly  the best and authentic Indian restaurant in the area. We tried Gobhi (cauliflower)  Manchurian , Paneer Tikka , Chilli Gobhi all were excellent and praise worthy. Their Butter milk was the best I've ever had. I am definitely going back there again. I've been there a couple of times ...Highly Recommended !!!
