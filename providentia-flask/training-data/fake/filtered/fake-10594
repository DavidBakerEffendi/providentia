Everything was delicious....the fried chicken and wings, macaroni & cheese, greens, cornbread, cobbler and sweet potatoes. YUMMY!!! Â The portions are gigantic and everyone is very friendly. We love the food at CAST IRON SOUL and look forward trying some new things....I've got my eye on another type of wing and catfish and Steve is thinking more of the same..his faves...chicken and macaroni.
