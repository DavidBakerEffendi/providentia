The food is below average for the West Village.   The food is comfort food -- spaghetti and meatballs, chicken, etc. Much of it pretty bland.   This is basically an overcrowded bar masking as a restaurant.   If you like the energy of crowds, this is fun (but not good food).  It is very crowded and very noisy. The service is poor.   I've been here three times.  Once as a couple, once with a group of 4 and once with a group of 6.   It is not possible to sit comfortably inside the restaurant with groups of 4 or 6.   We had a reservation for 6 and they seated us at a table for 4 and then complained to us that we were in their way.   If you want a nice meal at a quiet place, go across the street to Cafe Cluny.  If you want an Italian restaurant go over a couple of blocks to Corsino or to Malaparte.  If you want Spanish try Sevilla or Salinas or  If you want creative new American food try 84 on Seventh Ave.
