Some of the best Italian food I have ever had.  I had lunch there and the special was an eggplant parm sub with a caesar salad.  I hadn't really heard much about the place so I figured they probably couldn't hurt those two things. Well, my expectations were about to me blown away.  First, best caesar I've ever had.  The cheese,dressing, perfect croutons, wow.  Then I tried my sandwich.  Absolutely perfect Italian bread, layers of thinly sliced eggplant stacked with a pillow of cheese covering it.  The sauce was mild but allowed the eggplant to shine.  Every single bite was delicious.  The sandwich was also quite large, it was a big plate of food, though not overwhelming.   The staff was also incredibly warm and kind.  One of the best dining experiences I've had in New Jersey.
