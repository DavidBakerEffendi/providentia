This place has the best Indian cuisine, and most hospitable service in the city. The decor is very hip and colorful. The staff are very welcoming and accommodating. The head server/manager is very professional and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. He really cares about the place and the customers dining experience. The chef is a very laid back happy guy. I can guarantee there's no stress in that kitchen. And it shows through the quality and presentation of the food. The owners are very nice, and are not shy to jump in and help the staff. They also do private parties here in their upstairs room. Very nice up there. And you can have catered food delivered to your home or party at a location of your choice. They do it all here. From a delicious reasonably priced lunch buffet. To a dinner that can be customized to your liking. Nice moist fluff basmati rice. And the mango lassi is delicious. Also a great place to bring a date. Call ahead and let them know you're coming, and if its a special occasion, and they'll make it a memorable enjoyable visit.
