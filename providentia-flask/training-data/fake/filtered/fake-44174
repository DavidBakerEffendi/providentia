My guy and I, after not being seated at this place at least 3 times, finally get a chance to stop in. Perhaps those 3 times were tell us something. Beside the Â server being terrible, he also believed of not letting go of a situation without conflict. The pizza we had was cheap in quality, there are pizza places everywhere in that area and for the price we paid, we would have been better off in a grease spot. I'm thinking all the money was spent on decor and not ingredients. So... The server first asked..."Well do you make pizzas" and I knew the situation was going downhill. We were trying to be polite, just wanted to pay and leave, server offered to make us something else but we did not want it so strike two was "you've only tried two things, you can't base your opinion off those two things". But the issue is, this is a specialty pizza place, the menus is not so big therefore everything on the menus should be up to par. And finally the last thing the server said "Well everyone else likes it"... To say that "well everyone else likes it" diminishes individuals. We will not be returning. Money is better spent elsewhere. Also the Blood Orange Mojito was weak and I do not know why we had to wait for Mint .
