I was visiting the University with my brother. Being close to the Law campus, I stopped at this place. There was no menu to start with, you had to wait in line for 10 minutes for your turn to order food. The owner was very polite with a person just before us. Going through, and explaining what each food item was. When my turn came, I asked him about the what each food item was. The guy got irritated and started telling me "you have to move the line". I told him, he was rude, this did not bother him. We walked out without ordering anything. My take, stay away from this place. The owner is a rude & racist immigrant.
