It was a long 45 minute subway ride for me to get to this place from midtown but I had to do it...I had to see what all the hype was about.  Upon arriving, I was greeted by a really old and decrepit looking pizza parlor but that was expected.  I was also warned about this place not being clean and they weren't kidding.  The place was gross! Honestly, I don't get why this place is so well received?  the pizza was good but not $5 a slice wait on line good....  I mean come on, $5 for a slice of pizza???  seriously???  The DiFara family must be millionaires by now collecting that kind of money.  More power to them for finding a way to sucker in all the lemmings of NYC. Me personally...I went, I tried, I will never go back!
