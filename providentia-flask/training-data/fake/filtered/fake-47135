I have been meaning to check this place out for Â a while. I walked in with my friend without a reservation and we were told by the host that the restaurant was full, even though it wasn't, but we could eat at the bar. The bartender greeted us and asked if we'd like a drink and I asked if he could recommend wines to go along with what we would order. We ordered fried olives, fried cauliflower, fluke ceviche, lamb shank and a grouper dish, each one more unbelievable than the next. As each course arrived, the barman poured our wines giving an enlightening explanation why each wine matched each particular dish. Such a great night I can't wait to go back with friends. My advice, skip the reservation and sit at the bar!
