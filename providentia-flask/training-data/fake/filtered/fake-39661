Great food, though a bit pricey. Usually good service. I have ordered for delivery and gone in to eat, and each time the service is relatively quick and reliable. Tonight, we ordered about $75.00 worth of food, and over an hour and half later had seen no sign of its arrival. I called twice, both times someone said they would call the driver and get back to me. No one did. When the driver DID finally show up, there was no excuse as to why he was late and the food was bad. We ended up ordering from another place.
