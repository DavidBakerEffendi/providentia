My wife and I wanted to try a new place and heard some good things about this place. We stopped by The Counter in Clifton and I was not impressed and left disgusted by my burger. Being a server for 3 years during college, I really appreciate great service and always try to be nice to everyone. Astrid was our server and she was great. She was helpful and had a good understanding of the menu, she was upbeat and always smiling. My wife ordered a 1/3lb burger and I ordered a 1/2 lb patty. Food came out fast, maybe 10 minutes after ordering, but we got the wrong size patties with the right toppings. I politely pointed out that I received a much smaller burger than I asked for, and asked that they make a new one. They did... 5 minutes later I received the correct burger but I took two bites and it was raw in the middle. Safe to say ground beef burgers shouldn't be raw. Disgusted by the sight of my second burger, (I didn't want to complain twice) we just paid for all of our food and left. Very disappointed in my burger, although my wife really enjoyed hers. I'd rather go to five guys than go back there in the hopes of this place getting my order right.
