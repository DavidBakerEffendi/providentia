Dear all, Nestled in the serene confines of East Falls, Philadelphia, we come across an establishment that seems to embody the essence of what a true Italian restaurant ought to be.  From the moment one enters the door, they are greeted with pleasant faces, and a home like venue.  Not much bigger than a living room, the décor is reminiscent of a simple room in a home, amongst the contrast of eagerly waiting patrons ready to delve into the pleasures that lie ahead.  But for any restaurant to be considered in the upper echelon, all their stars must align.  The food, although good, was average at best.  The Gnocchi did not measure to the high standards I set for this delightful dish.  Doughy texture, lack of seasoning, and an overall 'mushy' character, left a dilemma of sorts when trying to judge this dish.  On the contrary, the veal saltimbocca was refreshing; perfectly seasoned and meticulously done, and I found my palate rejoicing with every bite.  Fiorino remains firmly established in my eyes as a staple in the East Falls community.  With its dining room reminiscent to that of a home next door, and greetings from a staff that embodies the ideals of family, I found myself immersed in an authentic Italian home.
