I was in need of a girls night out.  We decided on a convenient location between West Orange and East Hanover and decided to give it a try.  We ordered three different dishes so we could all have a taste.  The Rigatoni with fresh mozzarella, Chicken Murphy on the bone, and the Veal Milanese with arugula were all excellent and plenty to share.  Our service was excellent and the complimentary biscotti was just like nonna's.  I would recommend this BYOB restaurant to those who want to skip the hoopla and stick to the good food and conversation at the table.  Will definitely go again.
