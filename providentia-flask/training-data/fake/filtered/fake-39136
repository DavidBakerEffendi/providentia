To be honest I love 500 degrees. It's such a shame that their service is consistently inexcusable. I don't know if they even have a manager on the premises EVER, as that's the only reason I can think of that people would even think of acting that appalling ESPECIALLY while they're getting paid. What makes me even more suspicious of this is that while their hours are posted online, they consistently close early whenever it suits them. I don't know who manages this place. But that's ridiculous-- closing at 9:45pm when your hours say 3am? Someone needs to be held responsible for that because they won't be getting my business any longer.
