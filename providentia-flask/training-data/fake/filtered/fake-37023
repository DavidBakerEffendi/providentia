Took the tour with my wife and LOVED it!!  Not only is it a tour of a few great pizza joints, but more importantly you get the why, how and where to pizza.  What I mean by that is Scott has done the reseach like no one I can even imagine on where pizza started in America, NYC and the world, pizza types, how it cooks in one oven vs. another, type of heat/fuel used, cheese understanding, water used, family history to the original NY area pizzerias.  I could go on and on.  If you want more than your typical tour -- this is it.  If you like to understand the 'why' to things this tour is for you.  He also keeps things lively and fun.  Kudos to him for producing this tour.
