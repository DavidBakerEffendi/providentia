LOOONG overdue review...I've been eating at Sharky's for 10 years now.  They have fantastic food and the wings are in my Top 3.  I like them HOT and Sharky's wing sauce is not only HOT, but it's flavorful.  It's not very aesthetically pleasing, but I'm not going for the atmosphere, I'm going for awesome wings, great apps, and cold, cheap beer.
