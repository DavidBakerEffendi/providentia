I have been here 4 times. The place looks really cool. The service as noted in other reviews is lackluster and unprofessional. The servers look sloppy and lack attentiveness - but I guess that is what Northern Liberties is about.  You can tell too when you look at the condiments on the table- they could be cleaner. The kitchen closes weirdly for one hour between 4-5. All that being said - I will be back. The brisket sandwich is the best. I get it with less butter (if you don't it has way too much butter) Fries are awesome. The bottled beer comes out a little too warm - we all want nice cold beers. The bourbon pecan pie with sweet potato ice cream is excellent.  I also had the chile rellano and it was awesome as well. Really different than expected and I love that. Oh, and the soda is off too... it is not good. When it was Deuce's the soda was not good either - maybe they kept the same lines. Even with the service and beverage flaws, the food is SO GOOD (kudos to the chef)- I will be back. Love the hours too. Being open late night until 1am is a bonus. It is not often I go to a place with medicore service because the food is so good!
