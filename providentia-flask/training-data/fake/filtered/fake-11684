The receptionist for delivery orders is always rude. When I call for delivery and they do not have a driver the receptionist just forwards my call to an automated service that asks to put in the parties extension.... WOULD'NT IT BE MORE RESPECTFUL TO JUST SAY THERE IS NO DRIVER TODAY.........I will never eat at this place again......Plain Dave's has lost a loyal customer for the past 4 years........Do not even waist your time here.....
