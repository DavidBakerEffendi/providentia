Oftentimes reviewers are on target.  Not this time & I regret not reading Yelp (I stopped at Google). I have dined in whole-in-the-walls & the food was great!  The Wood Pit is the pits.  I thought I was going to break my jaw on that burnt quasi tough ribs; the collard greens along with the mac & cheese were bland.  I was afraid to try the chicken (it may have jumped up & ran).  No, I do not recommend!   I went to Teranga in Bloomfield (across from IHOP) about couple of times within the past year.  The food (not southern bbq) is edible & more affordable.
