I think if one word could describe the House of Small Wonder, it would be "cozy." I came in here a few Sundays ago in the late afternoon, and was struck by how laid-back everyone seemed. As relaxed as it was, the space in-between tables--which is close--somehow worked with the overall theme of the place. While I usually stick to the savory, I felt adventurous, and had the chocolate croissant, which I absolutely loved. When my mother visits from Jersey this weekend I plan on taking her here!
