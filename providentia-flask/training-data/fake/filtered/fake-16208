Its not  my first  time in there. I go there sometimes late after clubbing. This time i had the macaroni and cheese with cheddar and fontina and the california salad. Very good!!! The size of the plates were big enough. The only problem was that i had to wait a little be to much to get a table. I am going to come back soon.
