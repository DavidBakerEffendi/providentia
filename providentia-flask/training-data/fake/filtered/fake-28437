I ordered from them on seamlessweb.com, the estimated delivery was 30-45 minutes, after an hour I called to ask when I would be receiving my food and they said it was on its way.  10 minutes later I called again and then they told me that they were still cooking the food, that they would then have to wait for the delivery guy to return and estimated another half an hour.  I could forgive that if it wasn't for the fact that the woman on the phone was not at all, as one would expect, apologetic but rather very annoyed that I wanted to know when I could expect my food to arrive.  I told her that I didn't want it any more and she slammed down the phone at me.
