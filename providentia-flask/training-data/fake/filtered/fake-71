I've been to Nai a few times now and it always winds up being the perfect night out. First of all, the service is really top-notch. You're always greeted right away and the staff seems so efficient. The other night we enjoyed two small pitchers of sangria, the champagne and the mango. Both were excellent but the champagne is definitely my favorite. As for food, we shared six tapas. It was the perfect amount for two people. Prices were really reasonable as well. Can't wait to go back already.
