We love Penang. We can't say enough good things about it here.  Plenty of vegetarian items. The meat dishes (according to my partner) are amazing. Our favorites: Roti Canai, veggie Mee Siam, Beef Rendang, Curry Tofu with vegetables. I also love how they give you a traditional dessert for free (or orange slces) at the end of your meal.   Week after week, the food is flavorful and reliable.  Prices are very reasonable.  Service is attentive.  You really can't go wrong with Penang!
