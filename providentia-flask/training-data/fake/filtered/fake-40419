I have been a fan of SONG for quite sometime now; I regret not writing a review sooner.  I guess I just never thought they needed my review- that is how great I think this place is.  The decor is simple and functional yet chic and tasteful.  The food is delicious, cheap, and fast.  My wife and I go at least twice a month and the manager/owner(?) always greets us with a smile and a hug.  What more can you ask for?  When we go, we look forward to trying whatever new combination they have on the specials menu.  Oh...  And if you go on the right night- the guy with the rings is the best bartender; definitely opt for a drink while you wait for your table.
