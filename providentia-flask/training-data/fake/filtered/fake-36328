Food was absolutely delicious and service was excellent ... till a mouse ran laps (literally, back and forth three times) across the restaurant floor.  It was approx 12:30 am and all the patrons that were still there were appauled - but when we spoke to the manager, his response was "What do you expect?  This is New York City"  In the 10+ years I've lived in Manhattan, not only have I never seen vermin in a dining room, I've never seen a manager so rude in his response to patrons.  While the food was excellent, I will never go back.  Who knows what else is running around there!
