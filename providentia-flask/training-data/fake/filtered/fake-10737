This is my favorite place for food in the city.  The place isn't much, but the little room in the back is cool and comfy.  Their food is great and their falafel is by far the best in the city.  Their platters are a great deal, love the kefta and the beef kabob, and while their hummus is pretty great too, their rice is just not that good.  I eat here at least once a week, it rules!!!!!!
