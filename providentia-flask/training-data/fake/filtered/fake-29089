For an amazing, delicious and satisfying sandwich that uses quality ingredients I recommend Nam Pang all the way - Cash only which is something to remember I had every single sandwich and although they are all good I recommend The Pulled Pork, Â Hoisin Meatballs, and the brisket. the corn on the cob is not bad, but really messy, so make sure you have a place to sit in it in private.
