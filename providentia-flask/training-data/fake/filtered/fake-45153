This is a restaurant with a wonderful menu and truly delicious food, but I don't dine here very often.  I've never been able to put my finger on what it is that keeps me from going back over and over, and last night I finally put my finger on the problem. The service, the overall attitude, is cold.  Like they're doing you a favor. It used to be the kind of place that would bring you a complimentary glass of wine if you had to wait for your table.  But that old world warmth is gone. So maybe I'm nitpicking, but to me, that atmosphere is important, especially if I am consciously choosing to go to what would be considered a "better" restaurant.  Small things:  The candle holder was empty; we asked for a new one - How about the one on the empty table next to ours?  Minor, right?.  We waited forever to place a drink order. After we ordered our dinners, we overheard our waitress reciting the evening's specials at another table.  Specials?  There were specials?  When we brought that to her attention, it was a blasé, "Oh, sorry.  I've been here all day."  We weren't given the opportunity to change our orders, nor was there any type of concession for the error.  Complimentary glass of wine?  Complimentary dessert?  We weren't even offered dessert.   Just kind of an overall attitude that we were lucky to be there.  We were out with my very elderly, frail, Dad, and it was a big deal that he was out of the house for dinner, and treating us all to celebrate.  I really wish I hadn't felt so shuffled in and out - invisible. All that bitching aside, however, the food really is terrific, the bus boys were at the top of their game, and the place was packed.  Clearly, they're doing something right.
