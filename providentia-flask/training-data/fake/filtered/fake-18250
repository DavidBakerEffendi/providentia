Over the recent 2012 holiday season I had the meal of a lifetime while visiting Montclair New Jersey.  I've travelled and enjoyed restaurants in Paris, London, Bruges, Brussels, Amsterdam, Athens, Crete, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome, Toronto, Harare, Cape Town, and here in the states from Seattle to New York, and from California to Florida.  Never, however, have I had a restaurant experience or meal that could compare to what I experienced and ate at 1 Lackawanna Plaza in Montclair at the sensational new Pig and Prince restaurant. The name?  According to Chef and co-owner Michael Carrino, you can take it to mean either the 'duality of man' or a place where the 'casual and elegant can co-exist.'  The huge high-ceilinged space, which includes an expansive dining space and a cosy 'gastrolounge' tap room, is a gorgeously renovated railroad terminal.  Take a look at the website to see how beautiful the interior of the Pig and Prince is, and know that when it's filled with diners it's even more alluring. There were seven of us on that post-Christmas evening, four adults and three children, ages nine, eleven and six.  The old folks  ordered a variety of seasonal cocktails and the kids joined in ordering a sampling of the starters and entrees and deserts.   We enjoyed such a variety of flavors, beautiful presentation, and attentive service!  Yes it was expensive but, as I said, it was a meal of a lifetime, and we look forward to our next visit. Montclair should be cheering this new dining destination. Park Goist Shaker Heights, Ohio
