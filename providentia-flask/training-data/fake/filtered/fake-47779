Hands down th best PIZZA!!!!!! Don't go on the weekend, the wait is too long - they do not take reservations.  I live in brooklyn and often drive buy and buy a pie and take it home and finish it all by myself in 2 sets :)  I also always ask for the extra sauce and cheese.  Their sauce is great, made from the real tomatoes, not the paste and the brick over makes that thin crust too goooooooood
