My favorite Asian restaurant, hands down--also, one of my all-time favorite restaurants in general. This food is addicting--amazingly good (esp the DanDan noodles, Cumin Lamb, Wontons in Chili Oil, well, the entire menu). I have been coming here since they opened and am never disappointed. Aside from the wonderful food, my boyfriend, friends and I, all love the atmosphere. Han is down-to-earth, relaxed, entertaining, and serious about his food. I would recommend this place to anyone, and hope they never go anywhere! LOVE Han Dynasty--I honestly can't say enough good things about this place, and now I am craving some DanDan noodles!
