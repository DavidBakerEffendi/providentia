The service was very disorganized and inconsistent.  Our server could barely speak english and could not describe any of the rolls. We also ordered oh-toro, fatty tuna, and it came out served in thick semi-frozen pieces. Overall the sushi appetizers like the tuna tartare and medleys were very fishy tasting.  The clam sashimi was also very fishy tasting. The rolls were ok but probably because they were covered by so many sauces and other flavors.  The only one we really enjoyed was the Big Mac roll. On the brighter side, there is a decent selection of sake's and they were reasonably priced.
