Sabrina's is, quite simply, a terrific blend of quality food, great service, and a fun atmosphere.  Their menu, with a full page of special twists on basic items that changes every few weeks, allows for unique combinations to avoid repeating the same meal twice (unless you want to...).  The kitchen accomodates customizing of orders if you want a little more of "this" or hold the "that."  And the bottomless cups of La Colombe (is it redundant to say "the" and "La"?) coffee are as good a reason as any for getting up early.   The servers keep the busy weekend brunch customers ("Arrive before 9 to avoid the line!") satisfied with their attentive, watchful eyes, never letting a coffee cup get too low or an empty plate linger too long on the table.  A particularly energetic and "veteran" group (Maura, Eilidh, Gillian, Courtney, and Erin, to name five) of servers adds to the experience with witty banter and friendly conversation once they know you and how much sarcasm you can handle, and they seem always to help each other out to serve their customers well... Sabrina's - Callowhill is somewhere I've been going regularly now for a couple of years, and it is a staple for brunch when out-of-town friends are visiting.  Whether your tastes are simple (pancakes, omelettes, or a bagel), healthy (sliced fresh fruit - even the grapes are sliced! - mutli-grain toast, granola), vegetarian (tofu scramble or the egg white primavera frittata) or deviant (four halves of thick, carmelized challah french toast stuffed with cream cheese and bananas anyone?), there is truly something for anyone. Bring your appetite, though - half a portion is enough food on most days so prepare to leave with tomorrow's breakfast in a box as well!
