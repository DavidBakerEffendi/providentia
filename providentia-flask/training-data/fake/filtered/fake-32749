Only one word FABULOUS. My family and I went there to celebrate my birthday and I must say it was great. The food was great. We tried all the appetizer and recommend them all. My 3 year old granddaughter ate 2  duck spring rolls and wanted more.  For dinner we had the Tenderloin of Pork, Duck and Pasta with clams. Everyone cleaned their plate.Must try the Pears, Milk Chocolate Cake and the Almond Creme Bruele for dessert. Not only was the food and drinks OUTSTANDING but the service was GREAT. It is a very casual friendly atmosphere. I KNOW YOU WILL AGREE.                                                                JOANNE K.
