i live but a few blocks from Johnny Brendas and have gone there several times.  i want to love it, b/c it is local and gets great music acts.  however i cannot b/c of a few key things: 1. the beer on tap is ALWAYS flat.  always.  no matter which you choose. 2. the service is mediocre at best and sometimes downright lousy. 3. the menu is fairly stagnant & overpriced for what you get.  JB's is a gastropub only in their own mind. 4. try the wine? sure, if you want to pay No. Libs prices for plonk. 5. desert is where things can get really ugly.  their pecan pie looks & tastes like it came from a vending machine.   on the plus side, they make a truly great cheese burger and will cook it to order (including very rare).  their felafel and hummus are also quite good. i recommend only going there for live music and a burger.  but plan on drinking beer elsewhere.
