After tasting tacos in many places, this place is hands down the best fast food taco I have ever had! LOVE IT. I wish I had discovered this sooner. So much flavor in the ground beef. They only got my order wrong once, but it wasn't a big deal (missing cheese). It's a small place, barely any seating but across the street there is a public seating area so you can enjoy the day as well. Delivery is fast (15mins) and the staff are pleasant.
