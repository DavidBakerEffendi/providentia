great portions!  really.  my wife and a couple of friends we were almost full after the appetizers.  the fried green tomatoes was great in the they were cover in a mound of thick cut bacon.  yes the tomatoes were good too-- lightly battered in cornmeal.  but the bacon, yes.  also the jambalaya was massive bowl and well flavored and the meat was tender.  I have to say however surprising enough after tasting a bit of everyone's food the fried chicken which we came here for was not actually the best thing on their menu.  in fact i would recommend almost everything else first.  not to say its bad; although maybe i'm skewed by the hype.  everything else : dive in.
