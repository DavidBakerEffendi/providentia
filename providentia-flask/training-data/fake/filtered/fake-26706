Went there on a Saturday afternoon with a girlfriend and three young kids (3,5 &8).  The decor is gorgeous inside (very NYC).  The hostess greeted us immediately and we were able to sit down right away.  The waitress was fantastic.  She was so sweet, pleasant and gave the kids extra special care. The menu is tapas style so we were able to try a bunch of different plates.  Loved the cheese plate and truffle fries.  The kids loved the pizza.  We will definitely be back.  With the kids and without!
