Hard to find ITALIAN food like Cafe Colombia Restaurant in Woodland Park offers. We thought, because the name , they only serves Colombian/International Food, but NOT; The Cheff is being cooking in Italian Restaurants for Â years, and He really knows what to do in the Kitchen. Nothing to compare with other italian restaurants in the area. We recommend a 100% this restaurant......Amazing food and Service.
