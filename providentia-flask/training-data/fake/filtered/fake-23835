Decided to stop in here on my way back from work for an early dinner. Sat at the bar and ordered from the simple, handwritten menu on the wall.  Had a cheeseburger, fries, and a Glenlivet on the rocks. The atmosphere was casual, laid back, a good mix of people including students, professionals, ibanker types, and what seemed to be permanent fixtures at the bar.   I would say literally 2 minutes after I orded, my whopping burger was staring at me in the face. I took a bite and it was just awesome. They serve the burger and fries on plastic type plates with plastic forks. I love the attitude and no frills service. Great food, great atmosphere, and i'll definitely be back.
