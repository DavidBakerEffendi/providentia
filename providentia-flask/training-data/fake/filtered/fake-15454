Positives: The restaurant looks amazing! The inside decor is one of the most beautiful places I have seen. The furniture is also great. Negatives: Server was not knowledgeable of what the Restaurant's specials were or what kind of food was offered. When asked on how certain meals were prepared, the answer was: "I would say.." or "May be it is.." As for drinks, when asked if they had Petite Syrah, she said: "I don't know, I'll look at the menu." FYI, they had a listing of 6 wines only. She also was the bartender! We ordered an appetizer to share, to start with, and the server fired all our ticket at once, and we were served our main course with our first course. I ordered the Risotto, which came out not cooked through and very granulated to chew on. This was a "Special" offering at the Restaurant, and I was surprised that it was not prepared right. I replaced my order with a hot dog platter (thinking they can't mess it up since it's a BBQ Place). The only edible part on the plate was the hot dog, and the brioche bun was extremely dry. All in all, it was a very bad experience. I am positive that I will never go to this place ever again. I will also go out of my way to advise people not to go there as well.
