I just went to El Vez tonight, and I haven't been there in a few years, but it is soooo much different.  The food is good, but not as great as I remembered.  The margaritas were just so-so.  Service was great though and that always makes an experience pleasant, but this is just a little warning to all of you out there that used to go for the cool guacamoles, they aren't so cool anymore.  I remember one with crab and goat cheese, and there was a really spicy one, and now they are just kinda plain.  Just thought you'd all like to know.
