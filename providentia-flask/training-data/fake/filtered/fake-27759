After much acclaim, we decided to make an afternoon exploring Staten Island to visit Enoteca Maria.  After a rain-soaked ferry ride, we walked a few blocks to this charming, homey spot located directly next to the old St. George Theatre. The food was exceptional, although a bit pricey and unfamiliar in some respects (I wanted to ask our waitress a few questions about the preparation and ingredients I was not familiar with, but she seemed rather annoyed by my inquiry and barely made eye contact through her glasses.)   As a whole, service was attentive and prompt, but not especially welcoming as she seemed rather unfriendly.   Our pasta with meat sauce was wonderful and made me wish I had grown up italian and been exposed to this every Sunday growing up, as was our assortment of cheeses.  We played it rather safe, but we will be sure to venture out of our comfort zone a bit more in the future. The nonna huslting and bustling away in a kitchen even smaller than my own was quite the sight to see, and reminded me of my halles during the holidays. She too was a diminutive force of nature; seemingly tireless. I have read reviews about the music and atmosphere being too loud, but I disagree in this case.  Dining here is an experience, and the music, small confines, and the loud conversations in the exposed kitchen all add to the charm.  It's what makes Enoteca unique. I highly recommend the Tuscan Chianti (sorry...I don't remember the name, but I do remember the Tuscany connection).  It was simply divine, and reasonably priced!  We will definitely be back with friends.
