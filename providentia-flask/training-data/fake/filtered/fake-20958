I went to north end grill with Kelly for Her birthday .So I got 2 cherry temples .I called vesa to see how Joe was doing .He was doing good.The cherry temples were good.I liked the cherries .Then are bread came.I put some butter on it .Then it tasted great.Kelly hated bread.They also had a nice bathroom .I got some clam pizza.But plants were falling on my head. Kelly was texting Vesa To see if She was likening it because she was a new baby sitter.Then are our pizza came.Pizza and clams together don't taste that good.We were still Hungary so I got fancy mushrooms Scrambled eggs and grits.It tasted pretty good.then Me and Kelly talked about Nina for a little bit.Then we paid 300$.It was overall nice except the plant.
