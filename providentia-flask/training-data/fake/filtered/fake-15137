I visited this restaurant during my recent trip to NYC and I would definitley recommend it.  This is a Coeliac's dream!  I have never been able to have a Gluten free Pizza in a restaurant before and it was fab!  I also loved the breadsticks on the table.  Dessert is a must have, I had Lemon Cheesecake, a real delight! The restaurant is quite small, so you might have to wait a bit for a table. Any Coeliac's visiting or living in NYC should visit this place!
