I cannot believe that they served Â eggs on untoasted english muffins. When we asked the wait staff to toast the muffins, she said they dont have a toaster!! "But I can put them back in the oven id you want" Eggs benedict on raw muffins, yuck. I really want to like this neighborhood restaurant but everytime ive eaten here something is just a little off. Im going to stop trying after the raw english muffins
