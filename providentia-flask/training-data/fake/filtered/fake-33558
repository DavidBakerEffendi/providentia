My husband and I stopped into the New Socials last night.  Someplace new for us.   Liked the looks of the menu - different.   We thought, it's Wednesday, shouldn't be crowded, we can get in, split an app & a sandwich and get out.   We were heading off to go grocery shopping. Well, we were seated right away, took a high-top near the bar.   There were maybe 5 tables (1 large party) when we got there.    We ordered drinks .... then waited . . . . finally server returned with 1 drink, they were looking for a bottle of wine for me (I had ordered a Pino Grigio), waited more.  A nice woman (maybe bar manager?) came and told me they didn't have any Pino Grigio ... . OK, it took 15 minutes to figure that out?  Got a glass of Chardonnay.    While we were waiting for the drinks we had ordered 1 app and 1 sandwich to split.     Waited more . .. . . meanwhile several other tables were seated and served food!  People who had arrived after us!    After more than 1 hour, we asked for the check for our drinks and never mind the food.   The woman said our food was ready, did we want it boxed to go . . . on-the house.   She brought it to the table, we quickly ate, and left.   They did apologize, didn't charge us - said there were only two people in the kitchen . . but, I think they lost the order .. . . App was the Eggroll sampler .. . it was good.  Rueben was OK, soggy.   If we weren't rushed at the end, and irritated, we might have enjoyed it more.   Doubt we'll be back.
