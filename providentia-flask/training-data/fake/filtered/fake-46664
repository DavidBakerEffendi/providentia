Went here with some friends and they didn't want us sitting inside because we had a stroller.  It ended up getting very windy so we asked to be moved in and they made a big stink but finally let us in but made us sit in the corner.  About half way through the meal (which happened to be delicious) I went to use the ladies room... on my way back to the table I saw a lady at a table with a friend and a doggy stroller!!  Apparently, they allow DOGS in strollers in the middle of the restaurant, but not babies in strollers.  Even though the food was good, I wont go back there after that experience.
