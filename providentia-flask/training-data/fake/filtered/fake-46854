Went in to purchase a s'more treat and marshmallows for a vegan colleague, wound up buying even more for myself (and i'm not vegan OR a marshmallow lover..! they were just *so* good!!) Sara was super sweet *ba dum tisss* and explained all about the mission behind the marvelous marshmallows and invited me back anytime. (she even gave me an extra treat for colleague's going-away party... d'awww! wtg Sara!) 5,000 stars!!! ((heart))Sweet & Sara!
