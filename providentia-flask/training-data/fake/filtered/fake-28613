Fish market is a diamond in the rough. Amazing food, amazing drinks, and the most friendly staff in New York. Jeff is the best bartender in town and Mama knows her way around a kitchen. The scallion pancakes were perfect. Â The pork belly sandwich was cooked perfectly. The slaw that came with it was fantastic. Mama's clam, potato and flat noodle curry was the perfect fusion of Malaysia and New England. Name another restaurant that fuses Malaysia and New England... I dare you. You are missing out if you don't check this place out. Go there... Now!
