Loving both seafood & craft beers, this place called out to me. It's very small (plan for this when wanting a table on the weekends - we waited over an hour & 1/2 for one!). We sat at the bar and enjoyed an immense plate of oysters that were shucked right in front of us, ranging from East, West & Northern Coasts and offered a vast array of flavors. The main courses are small, which can be quite nice but take heed to this and order sides if you are starving to death! Though the dishes are small, they are well executed seafood plates that offer the freshest of locally caught fish & shellfish typically paired with a grain of pasta. The waitstaff is delightful, especially the people working the bar. If you strike up a conversation with them, you quickly realize how quirky and generous they are, which is handy when wanting to know more about a beer or to taste their freshest tapped keg. This is a great place to spend a calm yet satisfying Friday evening.
