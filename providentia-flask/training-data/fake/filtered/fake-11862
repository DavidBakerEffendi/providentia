This place is super busy so reservations are a must! Went there last Weds night with a group 14 colleagues. I picked the place so if it had bombed I was in trouble but it turned out to be a great! Tony's makes you feel welcomed and at home as soon as you walk through the door.  The several members of the staff including the manaGer welcomed us. The service was excellent.  Our waiter was a former actor, what else would you expect in NYC, whose memory could put any of us to shame. We kept betting that he would forget or miss something but he was spot on all night. All of the food comes in large quantities, overall it's all very good but some better than others.  The bake clams were a bit over done, the call air was a bit under fried but the stuff mushrooms, tomato & mozzarella, and sales superb.  The chicken parm and chicken Marsala were good but the marsala could have stood to have less mushrooms and more chicken. Otherwise the additional orders of steaks, lobsters, and pasta ordered was all very good. Dessert did not disappoint us as the canolli's and tiramisu was fresh and delicious. This is my second time there and I'm a born and raised New Yorker and i can't wait to go back this time with the family.
