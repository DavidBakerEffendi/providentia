This little cafe is perfect for breakfast and lunch. The baked good are excellent. The sandwiches terrific. The coffee is really good too. The service friendly and delightful. The Pope Francis sandwich in particular is really delicious. Jen, the owner has clearly worked very hard to give this little spot it's own character and she has really succeeded. Highly recommended.
