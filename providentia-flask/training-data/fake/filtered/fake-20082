I went in with a small group of people last night for dinner.  Let me start off by saying that the place is amazing.  Vivian H. isn't kidding when she says it's humongous.  Very comfortable to be in.   We actually sat outside last night and we started off with an order of the wings and two of the pizzas.  The wings at Tap House are, in my opinion, top 3 in the city.  They aren't hot wings, but are dry rubbed, and have better flavor than most hot wings I've ever had.  The two pizzas were outstanding.  We ordered the Margherita and the Tartufo (which had sliced truffles, mushrooms and a fried egg) and I am craving it again today.  We had sandwiches for dinner.  It was hard to pick the best one, between the chicken press (pulled chicken, melted cheese and roasted peppers) and the ham and cheese (grilled cheese on steroids).  The veggie burger was a little dry for my taste but 3 of my friends loved it. The beer selection is the best in the city.  The Hotochino (Japanese White Beer) and the Oskar Blues Dales Pale Ale were my two favorites.  I didn't have enough time to make a dent in the huge beer list. Easy choice - we will definitely be back again.
