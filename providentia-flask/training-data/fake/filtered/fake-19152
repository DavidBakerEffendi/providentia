My daughter made reservations over the phone requesting a hibachi table for a surprise birthday gift for her boyfriend. While on the phone, she was offered two different times to choose from. One at 2:30 and the other at 4:30 PM. She choose the 2:30, and asked if it was too early, but was told it would be fine. They arrived about a half hour early, but were told they couldn't get the hibachi because they were closing at 2:30. She was very disappointed because it was her first time trying this type of restaurant and not being able to get what she made reservations for. The trip was over an hour drive one way to get there. I called the manager, Heather, who hung up on me twice and told me "my daughter needed to work on her communication skills"! She was rude and if I owned the business, I would fire her immediately. My daughter was inducted into the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, and I believe Heather is the one that needs to work on her communications skills. I gave this rating a 1 star, because I couldn't rate it at a zero.
