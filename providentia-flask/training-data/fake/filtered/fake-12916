Come with an appetite and definitely a few extra stomachs. Everything is delicious and perfect to share with friends and family. There have only been 2 or 3 occasions (mainly Friday or Saturday) that there has been a long wait. The great thing is that there is a lot around you to kill some time- and build up more of an apetite!
