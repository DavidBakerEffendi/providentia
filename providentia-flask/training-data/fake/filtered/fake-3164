This place is a gem. I hadn't heard of it before my mother went with some of her girlfriends - it Â was a central location. She brought home some leftovers. I ate them a week later, and YUM. I figured if the leftovers were that great, the fresh food has got to be amazing. I was right. I went in with a friend on a Thursday night. We were greeted quickly and told to sit anywhere. There were 2 other tables occupied. The waitress came right over and took care of our drinks. Both of us ordered the Tilapia Francaise (sp) - one with potatoes and one with angel hair. We also both got a choice of soup or salad, and dinner rolls with their compounded roasted pepper butter. The rolls were heated, and crispy on the outside, warm and chewy on the inside. The butter was amazing. The french onion soup is among the best I've ever had, and the pasta fagiole was great (not as good as grandmom's of course). The dinner was fabulous. The fish tasted fresh, was freshly made with the coating, was flaky and flavorful. The spinach was cooked perfectly, not to crunchy, not too soggy, and the angel hair was standard. The potatoes, though good, seemed to be missing something, though we weren't able to pinpoint what it was. All in all, this was a great, filling, tasty meal in a friendly environment at a very reasonable price. I definitely recommend this diner.
