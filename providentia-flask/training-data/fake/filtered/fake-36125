The Pantry was pretty good. This place has the typical weekend lines out the door, which is always a good sign.  The day that I ate there they were a little under staffed because people were out sick so the service was a little slow. I had a fresh plate of strawberries which was delicious along with some scrambled eggs and some french toast. The home fries were pretty tastey...I would have to say a must try.  Aside from the food the place is small so if you don't like waiting in line get there early or have a late brunch. The service I would say was ok..I would have to go back when they have more staff there to see if there is a difference. The hospitality of the server could have used some work..not very friendly...if they expect to have a bigger tip I expect some common courtesy to their customers. The price was resonable coming to $23 for two people with about 3 plates of food.  Overall this is a good place to have some breakfast...give it a try.
