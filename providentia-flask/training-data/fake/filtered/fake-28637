We celebrated a friends birthday w/ lunch at the restaurant today.  The calamari is excellent as is the bruschette.  We all enjoyed our lunch entrees and the bean salad is so delicious and healthy!!  Our waitress, Theresa is delightful and very attentive to the party of five.  I hope to take my husband here soon!!
