After countless visits, I'm fairly certain that I've tried nearly everything on the menu and worked my way through at least half of the wine list.  Although it is best to go here with a large group so you can try more dishes in one visit, don't underestimate it's value for a glass of wine and a snack after work.  Favorites are the tortilla and the cocas, but I will never leave without having the stuffed lamb chops--best thing on the menu!
