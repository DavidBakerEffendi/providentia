Really cute, quaint Park Slope restaurant with about 15 tables in a small, square room. Some of the tables are too close together, and the service is a bit hit or miss (sometimes really quick and friendly, sometimes i  feel like my waiter has forgotten that we're there).   Really, really good organic food. Probably the best mid-priced food in Park Slope. Good for a lazy Friday or Saturday night with family or close friends.  I wouldn't advise going with big groups because it gets a little cramped and the service starts to slip the bigger the group. Right group size is probably 2 - 4 ppl.   Sometimes I feel like their menu is too short, and there aren't enough options from which to choose. There organic brick chicken is outstanding and there meze plate (3 dips and hot pita bread) used to be DELICIOUS, but they discontinued that dish. Not sure why.
