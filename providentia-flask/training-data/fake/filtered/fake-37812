Returned to Roberto's after a long while and was sorry I didn't come back sooner. This is a good as it gets in Philly for real Italian food. Our party shared smoked mozzarella with sauteed wild mushrooms and the special stuffed cabbage with risotto appetizers. Both were excellent specially the marinara sauce in the cabbage. For our main course one of my friends had the special lobster stuffed ravioli with pink sauce, another had the veal chop topped with arugula and I had the Dover sole. All were excellent but the ravioli and Dover sole were tops. Service here is always friendly and efficient. We won't let too much time go by before returning next time!
