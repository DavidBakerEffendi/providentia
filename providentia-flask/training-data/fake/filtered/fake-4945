I can't say much that hasn't already been said about the food...it was superb.  Garlic bread, appetizers, entree, dessert...all of it spectacular. What I walked away remembering was the kind service and the feeling that we were regulars even though it was our first trip to NYC.   Highly recommended to anyone wanting a tremendous dining experience.
