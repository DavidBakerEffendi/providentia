Tonight was our fifth or sixth time dining at San Sai and I must say that the earlier reviews concerning the problems with service were true but things have improved a lot. The wait staff that remain are knowledgeable about the food and can provide good recommendations. The ultimate bottom line for me though is the quality of the fish and it is definitely the highest you can get at any sushi restaurant in town. I very much enjoy getting the chirashi or the sushi sashimi dinner and am always satisfied, both in terms of the quality and quantity. Furthermore, when it was warm enough to sit outside, the sunset lake views from in front of the restaurant is incredible.
