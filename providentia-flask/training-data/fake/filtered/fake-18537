I went to Gramercy Tavern with very high expectations from all the hype I heard from friends and online. They lived up to almost everything I heard with the exception of the appetizers. The entree was great( I had the braised lamb) and cooked to perfection. The waiter was friendly and pretty good with checking in and not disappearing like many other restaurants. The desserts were very good and the pricing overall(higer end) was pretty much inline with most other restaurants of the same caliber. I would go back but not something I would go out of my way to do so or for a real special occasion.
