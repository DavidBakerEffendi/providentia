Disclaimer: Big Ramen fan - would rate most ramen places as great - but Ippudo is really really exceptional. The Pork Ramen original is sooo good - my mouth is watering just thinking about it. The staff is all Japanese and quiet attentive. If you finish your noodle and still have plenty of broth remaining - no worries - you can ask for more noodles (for a little bit more) - which I always do! Go there now and grab a bowl of the hot steamy stuff.
