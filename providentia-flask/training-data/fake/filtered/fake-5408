Cafe Matisse is relatively small and understated, with a small outside area that we couldn't take advantage of due to the weather, however the dining room was very comfortable and the lighting was just right. We had a quick wine tasting before we dined, though we had brought our own bottle of wine with us. The host and wait staff were extremely attentive but were otherwise inconspicuous. The food was outstanding; we had the beet salad, sea bass, chicken wings and tuna tartar. Each one was a work of art and each one engaged all of our senses. I can't say enough good things about the meal we had there. Cafe Matisse has become an instant favorite for me.
