First off great services Saturday morning greeted me as i walked in the door. now to the best part i had avocado sunrise omelet with hash browns and white toast with a side of bacon. best breakfast i ever had in a very long time. the waitress was very polite, she severed me coffee before i can ask also asked me if everything was fine, also didn't bother me while i was eating. two big thumbs up !!!
