Bouley is great. It's so underrated it's unbelievable. The food here is excellent and like some other reviewers have said up there with the greats in city, making it one of the best in the world. No, that's not hyperbole. Before I forget to mention it they bake their bread on site. Not a lot of restaurants do that, even the greats! This just goes to show the top quality of the input from the chefs. I am not going to recommend anything on the menu because as often as my girlfriend and I go we have never had a sub-par dish. The ambiance is cossetting, warm and embracing. Sorry I cannot find better words than that to describe it. The waitstaff are also some of the best you can find!
