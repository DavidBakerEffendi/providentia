Went here with a friend on a Tuesday night with a Gilt voucher.  We were treated like kings.  We got Buffalo and Salted Caramel fingers, carrot fries and cajun fries, and the Sticky's sauce, thai sweet chili, ranch, and wasabi aioli.  Oh also mexican cokes and a free shot of whiskey!!!  The Salted caramel, sticky's sauce and carrot fries were my favorites but everything was bangin!  They're open super late, which is great to know and we'll be back for post-drinking late night snacks (SO much better then yet another papaya dog).  Also TJ the cashier and delivery guy was awesome!!  Things on 8th Street seem to come and go, so give these good business so they'll stick around!
