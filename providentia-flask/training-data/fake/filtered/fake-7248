I've heard a lot of good things about this place and had been very curious to try it for a while.  I loved Zahav and enjoyed Marigold though I haven't been there for some time.  During our visit this past weekend, our server, I think his name was Evan, convinced us to try the chefs tasting menu as it would be a great way to explore the menu and get a good feel for the restaurant by trying a bunch of different things...boy was he right!  The food was outstanding.  We upgraded our guacamole upon Evan's suggestion to the black truffle guac which was divine.  Our appetizers and ceviches were simplisticly delicious.  I had the pork which was delish and my bf had the skirt steak which was surprisingly awesome.  It was such a basic dish but the combination of flavors and preparation paired so well together.  Desserts were a great way to end the meal because they were perfectly sized and not overwhelmingly rich and sweet.  Oh, can't forget the Margaritas...hands down, the best Margarita I have had in town.  Only complaint...I just wish that we could have taken advantage of their happy hour deal in the dining room. Overall, this was a great experience.  It totally changed my impression of what authentic Mexican food was.  El Vez who?  Our server was extremely attentive and professional, yet not overbearing, the ambience was nice and I loved the music selection (Manu Chao!) I will definitely return...next time probably in time to take advantage of the half priced margaritas at the bar!
