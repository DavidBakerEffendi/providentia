Definitely a must. I came ready to brave the cold and eat outside, but was pleasantly surprised to see that they recently renovated the inside! It's small, but just enough space to enjoy your food and also see them cooking/baking in their food fire hearth oven. The staff was friendly and helpful and man was the food good. We came twice in two days--the first we made would own sandwich, and the second day we got their daily special breakfast sandwiches. The eggs were poached perfectly, the toppings flavorful yet not overpowering the amazing bread. Stump town coffee on tap was a plus!
