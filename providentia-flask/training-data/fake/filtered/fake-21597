I went there the other night. The music was good. There was a young Jazz band who were doing there thing. The atmosphere was cool and there was a real nice mix of people. Yet, my meal wasn't Â anything to hoot about. The $16 rack of ribs were so small. I've never seen a portion so tiny. Seven baby back ribs, 2 inches long. Wow! Baby was definitely the right description. My Mac & Cheese dish was no better. It tasted as if it was right out of a Velveeta box. It was no Southern Comfort Mac & Cheese, that's for sure. Everything wasn't for naught though . . . the shrimp and grits appetizer was ok.
