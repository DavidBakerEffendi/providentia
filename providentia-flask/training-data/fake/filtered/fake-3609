Great place for dinner with friends!  A group of 7 of us had a late (10PM) reservation here, and it was worth the wait.  The ambience is warm and inviting, the service is friendly and knowledgeable, and the food was delicious.  I loved my burger and my vegetarian friends were thrilled with the cheddar waffles.  All the vegetable sides were great as well.  Definitely a place I would like to return to.
