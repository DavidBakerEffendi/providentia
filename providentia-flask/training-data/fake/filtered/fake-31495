Terrible! Just terrible! Pricey for what you get. For being Latin fusion the food is quite bland and boring, and took almost 45 minutes to arrive at our table...cold. The service is also lacking, slow and aloof. And don't even get me started on the parking situation. They valet your car right in the middle of Center Blvd! In traffic! The cops arrived the night we dined. What a disaster! I give this place 6 months.
