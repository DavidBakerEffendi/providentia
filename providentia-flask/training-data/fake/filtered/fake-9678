Excellent service with people that really talk to you as a person, not just a source of money.  It doesn't look like much from the front, but park around back and you will be surprised.  Our family tried this place on a whim, but will be back again and again.  The food is fresh and the place has an extensive menu.  Plenty of space in the restaurant so you don't feel like you are too close to others.  Highly recommended.
