Cashier named Megan was horribly rude. I first ordered food to eat in and she hesitantly allowed me to sit at "one of the small tables". Then my plans changed and I adjusted my order to a to-go one. I sat down at a table to wait for my ride to arrive and she came over and told me I could not have to-go food at a table. There was almost no one in the store, plenty of empty tables. I felt as if she then complained to the other cashiers about me and I felt so uncomfortable that I left. I will not be returning to Atticus and I am disappointed with the threshold of disrespect towards customers that is tolerated there.
