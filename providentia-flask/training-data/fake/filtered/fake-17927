I just want to say this is one of my favorite restaurants.  Yes, the staff is sometimes a little uptight, depending on your waiter/waitress, but I have NEVER had a bad meal here and have been a patron here for at least  4-5 times a year for the past 8 years. They just know they are busy and know their food is good.   It's true, it's a pain in the ass to get reservations, but make them well in advance and you will not be disappointed.
