The food was pretty good and the beer selection was good, just pricey.  The 2 stars are for the lousy service we got.  The hostess just stood around and did nothing while the 1 waitress was preoccupied with watching Tim Tebow all night.  Her loss since she just cost herself tip money, but her poor serving skillz took away from our night just a tad.
