Brunch this weekend was just perfect. This off the beaten path cozy restaurant - across the street from Union Transfer on Spring Garden - was not crowded per the usual NoLibs Brunch crowd. The service was very attentive. The food was divine - I had one of the Llamatatas - a mushroom, swiss, and arugula. Â Eggs cooked to perfection. Toast perfectly sliced, toasted, and not-too-much butter. Potatoes perfectly roasted and seasoned. A focused but diverse menu. The coffee was amazing. The chef knows what s/he is doing. The prices are very cheap. Brunch entrees range from $6-$12. One of the best Bloody Mary's in town. In the summer, the place boasts an awesome outdoor seating garden.
