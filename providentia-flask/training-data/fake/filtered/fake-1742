Well first off the restaurant received a C rating from the city for?  I will tell you for because of roaches in the bar areas and the kitchen.I don't know what happened to this Pio Pio but have they gone down hill so fast.The service is lousy food has gotten so bad the chicken very dry the salchipapa was the worst,hot dogs over cooked French fries under cooked seriously!!!!!!!   I am a steady customer that  well now used to go at least once a week sometimes twice and I always had a great experience,great food,great customer service.But my last visit was the worst the employees hanging around at the bar drinking hanging around with customers while I and other people had to wait so long for even something as simple as a  glass  of water. I guess the owner does not care about his business or the customers that make his business succeed.  This sounds like another greedy owner who just forgot about customer service that is why the restaurant received a C rating. Well. They have lost loyal customer I wil never ever eat in one of there restaurants ever again. I am so disappointed I warn people do not eat their the place has changed so drastically I couldn't believe it. Time to find a better Peruvian restaurant so Lin Pio Pio you are the worse and are representing Peruvian cuisine very bad.
