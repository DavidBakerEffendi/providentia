Cute little bar upstairs and downstairs. A lot of beers on tap to choose from. I ordered the pot of meat balls (more like tiny cock of 4 tiny store bought meatballs) but I guess that's not a cool app name. The garlic bread with it was stale. So that's $3 a meatball. The 8 re fried chicken wings for $12 were burnt and ehh. It's bar food not bad but not good.
