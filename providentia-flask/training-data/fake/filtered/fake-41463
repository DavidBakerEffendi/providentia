My friend celebrated her 29th birthday today at Rincon Criollo.  There was a total of 30 people in the party.  This restaurant was a perfect choice! It was a cozy environment, and the staff treating the whole party like if we were VIP.  And to handle 30 of us...trust me, the orders could have easily gone wrong, but it didn't! Now for reviews on the food...I ordered the breaded chicken cutlet, white rice and black beans.  I'm glad I ordered it! The chicken was cooked perfectly and the black beans was flavorful.  My girlfriend arrived late and I ordered her the same plate.  She didn't get to eat it until we got home.  When she did eat it,  she told me it was "really really good."  I overheard everyone at the table talking about how great their food was and even heard some of the say, "MMMMMM." My friends who sat to my sides and across from me ordered the Ox Tail, Shredded Beef w/Garlic, and Fish.  ALL OF THEM SAID THE DISH WAS GREAT! Not only was the staff on top of their game, but there was this one gentleman, who I believe was the manager or owner, any who he was there helping his staff and making sure each one of us were doing fine.  For birthday events they play the birthday song, but after the birthday song, the whole restaurant lights up in different colors and the manager dances for you to a song that just makes you want to smile and laugh.  It was great and you have to experience it in order to know what I am talking about.  The birthday person is definitely the center of attention for those few minutes, and that's in a good way.   Wait...and that's not it! Great service, great food, and great price!  Just make sure you bring cash or have American Express.  They also have an ATM machine inside the restaurant.  I hope my review helps. I will come here again. Enjoy!
