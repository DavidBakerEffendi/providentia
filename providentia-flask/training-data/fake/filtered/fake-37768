Good show guys !! Exactly what we have been waiting since long time , we visited the restaurant the day we came back  from vacation .i went with my wife and kids,The restaurant was fully packed , many people were  waiting outside the restaurant just to get seated ..we were very well greeted at the front ,They promised  to give us a table within 15 mins, which they very well fulfilled .. FOOD & SERVICE The food was fantastic ,perfect flavours , very well balanced, good heat level ..The menu itself has so many options ,From mildest to the spicy PHAAL  curry ,my wife & kids loved the chicken korma & assorted chicken kebabs, But my favourite was very well tendered lamb vindaloo ..10/10 The service is very attentive & friendly ,they explained us the menu very much in details inspite being very busy at that time . Overall a great great experience   Just noticed that they received few negative comments ..But I guess some people need to be knowledged about the difference between British Indian & Indian Food . THRILLING EXPERIENCE ..EVERYONE SHOULD GO & GET TASTE OF BRICKLANE .. ALL THE BEST GUYS :)
