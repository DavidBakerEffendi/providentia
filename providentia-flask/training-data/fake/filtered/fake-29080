This place is really good at what they do- meatballs and ice cream sandwiches. They have a lot of different sauces that you can put on the meatballs and they're all really good. My favorite is the spicy meat sauce! The prices are incredible and the portions are fair. All the servers are really nice and really love the restaurant they work at.
