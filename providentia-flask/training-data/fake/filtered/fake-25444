Went here a long time ago for my mom's birthday. We all got the corn due to yelpers' recommendations. I'm glad we listened. What a unique but great taste. I had a Ruben sammich. It was great. The ambiance great. It's just all great. I'm going back again. Also as a little tip... if you wanna do this for a date, I think it's perfect. Then after a nice meal here, go to the Angelika Theater on Houston and see a foreign film.
