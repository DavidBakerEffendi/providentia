Pompei Pizza is HORRIBLE! These others yelpers may be connected to the store somehow unless they dont have any tasebuds! Now typically taste is subjective according to the person, BUT how a pizza should be cooked is standard.The cheese and sauce IS NOT cooked into the crust. As for a crust there is NONE. The crust was like the skinniest piece of bland shoe leather, and I love thin crust, this is not a crust though because the dough isnt prepared properly. Thats why the crust is like chewing shoe leather it is not crispy at all. The sauce has NO flavor. If you like fresh garlic or basil you can forget about it there both missing from this watered down cheap canned sauce. As for the ingredients on this pie I cannot state enough how untasty, old, and unapettizing it was. The eggplant alone looks like its been dead and floating on top of the hudson river for years. They need to raise there oven temperature to actually Â cook the ingredients into the crust instead of the cheese, sauce, and ingredients sliding off the slice. Never again. You would think in 50 years they would have learned how to make a pizza. There lucky bayonne is full of hungry welfare savages who dont know pizza from a job and keep patronizing this place with our tax dollars. Wake up Pompei and make a decent slice.
