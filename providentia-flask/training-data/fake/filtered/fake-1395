Very creative!  Both the cocktail list and the mexican french mixed menu.  Half of the menu is french food and half of the menu is mexican, but the dishes aren't blended.  The hand made guac is awesome and is individually made to YOUR liking!  The french martini margarita was not my favorite, but the spicy pomegranite one was great.
