Best BBQ in Philly. I grew up in the south and was slightly apprehensive about BBQ north of the mason Dixon. I was pleasantly surprised with this place. The meat cuts were amazing and melted in my mouth. Baked beans are out of this world and the sauce was perfect. We walked in a half hour before close on Sunday and the staff was super nice. I also received better food than I expected to get at a half hour to close. Highly recommended. I will be back!!!!
