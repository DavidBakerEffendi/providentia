I absolutely love this place! I refer to it as the choo choo train because of the neon light train sign on the store front. I have tried various different dishes on the menu and I have never been dissatisfied. The prices are amazing and the portion sizes are appropriate. You will never leave Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai Restaurant hungry. I have treated many different picky eaters and food connoisseurs to a dinner here and they all leave happy. The service is excellent, with a wave of a hand your waiter will be there and they never leave you cups empty. It is clean and in a great location and you can never go wrong eating there.
