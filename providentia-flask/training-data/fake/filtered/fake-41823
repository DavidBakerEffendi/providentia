This is not your regular neighborhood Thai place.    The decor is tastefully done with a touch of Thai inspiration.  The food is actually flavorful and not like your usual tasteless same old same old all along East Village.  Service was a little slow but they can work that out.  It didn't stop me from enjoying the evening.  The menu is priced reasonably well and the portion is just right. I definitely would like to taste everything on their menu.
