What a pleasure ! This evening was my first time at this lovely gem of a restaurant. Food was delic- especially the bruscetta ( which by the way is not on the menu- but suggested by the owner). This lovely young woman has assembled curteous and friendly wait staff, terriffic food all in Â warm, comfortable and very pretty environs. In the center of town, but feels like miles away. A definate "go back again and again" neighborhood find ! Enjoy- We did.
