Joe took me to Aurora for our second date. I was so excited I stumbled when I saw him waiting for me at the bar. I was wearing my favorite Catherine Malandrino dress and we sat in the back corner table. He slid his hand up my leg and I almost lost it! The food was delicious, it really was, but what I remember most was Joe and I making our own little world, lost in the food and the wine and each other. We closed the restaurant down, just he and I and the soft din of Aurora closing for the night.
