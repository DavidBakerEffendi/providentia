I can not imagine a better way to wake up in the morning. Perfect cups of coffee (bottomless if you have the time), delicious vegan baked goods, and gluten free! The coffee is always strong, but not bitter, and service is sweet, and always quick. Whether just grabbing a quick cup to wake up, or meeting with friends for breakfast, solid choice.
