The food is pretty good, really, for what it is.  I respect them for keeping it old school in such a "foodie" town like Burlington.  Sometimes you just need a big, hot, cheap plate of carbs and this is the best place to get it.  I always leave satisfied.  However, I can't write a review without mentioning the controversy over their sauce; I'm sure what you get there in the restaurant is made in-house, but when you buy their sauce in the supermarket it is made out of state.  (Google it if you don't believe me; they paid a big fine a few years ago for misleading labeling).  The Bove's are nice people and have done a lot for the community, but if you are going to be a champion for all things Vermont, the least you could do is produce your sauce in the state that has helped provide you with your reputation in the first place.  I know that the Bove family will argue that it's too expensive to produce a consumer sauce in VT, but there are other companies making sauce here in  VT; you just might have to sacrifice a little profit to help create a few more jobs for Vermonters.  The next time you eat there,  (and you should eat there often), compliment the food, tip well, and ask them to move their sauce making operation back to VT.
