Roaches!!! fish was tough and after seeing 1 roach on the bar and 1 roach on the wall behind the bar, it is very difficult to enjoy your meal after seeing that.  I still left a 20% tip and the bartender with the big mustache counts the money in front of us and doesn't even say thank you with is truly unprofessional.  Never again.  Looks nice on the outisde and that's enough said
