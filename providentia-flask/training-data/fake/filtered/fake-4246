We went to hear the band Guy Smiley play here on April 13, 2013.  The band was amazing and the bar was packed.  Everyone was having a fun time dancing and partying.  The private party that was there stayed until 1am because of this awesome band, who even invited them on stage to sing with them.  However, despite such a great gig, they were not asked back.  When I asked the owner why, he was very arrogant.  Too bad because the only reason I went to his bar was to hear that band and now I won't be back for sure!  The food wasn't all that but it's the owner's attitude that really turned me off!
