I was here on a Sat. night bad choice. The wait like any good restaurant that doesn't take reservation was over 2hrs. So I put my name down and went to the bar around the area because the restaurant bar area was full too. Went back after they called to say my table was ready, had 2 serving of DELICIOUS ramen. Get the pork bun appetizer. Would wait all over again ..
