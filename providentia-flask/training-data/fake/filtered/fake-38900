I always order the same thing - naked (no bread) steak burrito with mushrooms and avocado. I come from a family of chefs and am extremely picky. All the ingredients are of gourmet quality. The steak is of the highest cut and thinly sliced with a slightly charbroiled flavor and seared at the edges. The mushrooms are definitely gourmet with a smoky flavor you know they just came off the grill. Avacodos are fresh and taste as if they were just cut. No advanced prep and microwaving here. This place is no joke and of a quality I would not expect to find in Maspeth.
