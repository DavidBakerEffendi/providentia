Okay, so you have to wait. It's a tiny place and there is a huge crowd outside at all times, waiting to cram in. But here's the reason: the food is great. So no belly-aching at the front door! Put your name on the list, then go have a drink at Lokal & wait. for your table. And the service is exactly what you'd expect because a) it's in Hispterville and b) it's crowded! The first time I went, I was with a French chef-friend, who had already been there about five times. He led me to the Truffle Fries, which are narcotic in their goodness. I had the shepherd's pie, which was an interesting twist on an old favorite. Traditional dishes, like moules frites, are awesome. The chicken breast is perfection. The cod with sherry & cockles also awesome. We wer disappointed with a special that included fava beans (the beans had begun to ferment, which, well, isn't too cool). Prices are decent. Thanks, guys. You do an awesome job keeping the fodies happy!
