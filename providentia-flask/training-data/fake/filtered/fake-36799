So I've been here a couple times before writing this review, and it's been a consistent 2 stars for me. I think that the food is worthy of 2.5-3 stars. It's decent, nothing special, nothing completely terrible, although mostly everything is overpriced for the simple food that it is. I did enjoy their potato pancakes, however. I would rate this dish at 4 stars. Unfortunately, I was unable to substitute the 3 buttermilk pancakes that come with an omelet for the potato pancakes, which annoyed me greatly, especially since there was an upgrade option for fruit or buckwheat pancakes. The cost of 3 buttermilk vs 3 potato pancakes on the menu also had a difference of 10 cents, so it seemed like a pretty easy swap. Their answer was "we just don't allow that." For the service, I'd give it a flat 1 star. The manager at the front has an attitude that annoys me - seems arrogant and doesn't care too much about the customers. The waiters are mixed - some are pretty nice and competent, and others are the exact opposite. I don't mind coming back here with friends if we're all in the mood for breakfast food, but then again, that's really because of the dearth of other breakfast places in the area. So it's not really saying too much.
