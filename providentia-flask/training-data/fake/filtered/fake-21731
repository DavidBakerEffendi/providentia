Great experience!  Brought my 7 yr. old Granddaughter for Brunch to celebrate her birthday before heading on to see Lion King.  Had made a reservation & requested they bring their most chocolate dessert w/a candle when we finished our meal.  We arrived almost an hour early - no traffic getting through the tunnel!!  They seated us immediately and everything was perfect!   My main concern was the service as I had read some reviews saying the servers were rude & not at all helpful.  This is so not true!!  Our waitress was a doll.  Everyone made a big fuss over my Granddaughter and the chocolate dessert w/the candle arrived exactly as I had requested when I called in the reservation.   The food was excellent and portion sizes were most generous so bring your appetite.  Menu was a bit limited but included all my favorites.  Eggs Benedict for me, Mushroom &  Cheddar Omelet for my Granddaughter, and great bread. By the time we were about half way through our meal every table was full but we never felt rushed.  They made us feel like welcome guests.  Not only was the staff warm & friendly, guests at tables around us were chatting with us and all wishing my Avery a Happy Birthday.  This is not a tourist trap, they made us feel like we were "regulars!! We'll be back!  This is my new "go to" restaurant!!
