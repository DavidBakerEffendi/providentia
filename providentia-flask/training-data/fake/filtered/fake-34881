This was the best restaurant experience that my fiance and I have ever had. We live in Seattle and were planning a trip to New York, primarily planned around eating. We had a list of places that we wanted to try, and while researching new restaurants, the Chef's Table came up. We decided this would be our "splurge" meal while on vacation. We only had 5 nights in New York, so on the Monday morning that reservations became available for the week we would be visiting, we both called from two phones. After about 10 minutes of calling, one of us got through, and we were able to get a reservation for the Friday night that we would be there. I'm not sure why everyone else is having such a hard time getting a reservation, or why they are so upset about it. The experience was incredible. Friday morning of our reservation, we called the restaurant and spoke to Chef Cesar himself. He told us an idea of what we would be served that night, and his suggestions for wine. We found a great wine shop and picked up a sparkling wine and two bottles of red. From the moment we walked in the door to when we left 3 hours later, we felt the money was well worth the experience. Our first course was served within 5 minutes of sitting down, and they didn't stop for 3 hours. Every single course was different than anything I have tasted or could have imagined. We drank all 3 bottles, shared wine with our fellow patrons, and chatted with the chef. Back in Seattle, we have recommended this restaurant far more times than I can remember, and hope to be back someday soon.
