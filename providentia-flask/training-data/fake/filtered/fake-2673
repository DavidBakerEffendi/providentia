I gave this restaurant 4.5 stars because it's simply delightful. I visited it last week just after watching Chef Jehangir Mehta on the Next Â Iron Chef. His preparations really are as mouthwateringly good as they appear on TV. The restaurant interiors are beautiful. I especially loved the delicate chandelier that overlooks the room. I'm a small person so I didn't find the space cramped but I understand that a six foot something person might have found it small. The size shouldn't be a big deal after a while (with enough $25 wine in your stomach you're bound to get comfortable. Even if you don't drink don't worry. The people there are so sweet you'll feel comfortable soon anyway). I love the Tapas style portions. This way I can try a lot more. I like to have small meals. Even their pork buns don't weigh heavily on your stomach. I definitely want to go back. I wonder if he'll make some of his recipes from the show... I wouldn't mind trying that lobster curry and rice preparation that won him the first test this week. Sounds delicious... PS- They have a very sweet contest of their own going on at Graffiti. You can design a unique Graffiti envelope (for them to deliver their bills in) and send it to Jehangir Mehta and if he likes it you could win a chance to have dinner with him at Graffiti. I read about it on his personal website. I think I'm gonna give it a stab.
