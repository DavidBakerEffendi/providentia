My husband and I went to NY for a quick vacation and ended up stumbling upon this place thru YELP. Im so glad yelp pulled it off this time. The wait time took a little over an hour, but it was def worth the wait. This was first time trying authentic ramen other than the stuff i buy at the grocery store for .25 cents and it was the bomb . com. Def worthy of a yelp review esp. since i am from CA. I ended up getting the Shiromaru Hakata Classi and my husband ended up getting the Akamaru Modern w/ extra pork. Both has great flavor, but i liked the shiromaru a tad better. This place should be on everyones bucket list :).
