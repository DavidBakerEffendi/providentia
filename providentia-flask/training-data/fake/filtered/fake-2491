Great Cheese Steak. Plenty of extras offered to customize it.  Burgers are the only other option. The Cheese Steaks  don't seem that big until you finish a half; and then you realize that 1/2 would have been enough. Unless you work construction or are a teenage boy I recommend splitting one, you can always order another as they are ready in three minutes after ordering.   At first I thought the place was priced a bit on the high side, but not after I got my  sandwich. There are 5 two tops and then three communal tables that seat about 8 each, and a couple other tables in the front.
