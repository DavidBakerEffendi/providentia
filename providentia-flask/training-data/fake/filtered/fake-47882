Ok, this is my local, so I'm a bit biased... But as a vegetarian I know my Thai food.  This place is great in many ways.  Those that do the take-out, which is huge here, know the food is great, consistent, inexpensive, and has awesome flavors.   For New Haven, it may not be the most awesome "cuisine", but for a quiet, easy and relaxed atmosphere, it's hard to beat.  The cocktails are damn good too. Very high quality food, good prices, quick service, open late-ish, drinks, friendly service..... very hard to beat.  Best place to eat in Amity. cheers
