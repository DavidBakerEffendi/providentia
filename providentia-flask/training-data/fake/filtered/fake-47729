FANTASTIC.  You'll love the taste, everything is so fresh.  You really shouldn't HAVE to wait if you get there 15 minutes before noon you'll be seated as soon as it opens at noon.   That, and going on a non-weekend day will help.  This is the place you bring your friends that want real pizza.  The ingredients are so fresh tasting you have to try it to understand just how much this is true.  Just remember, cash only, no reservations.  If you forget your cash they have an ATM machine.   You'll enjoy it, you really will.
