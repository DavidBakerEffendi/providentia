Ordered take out last night. I just feel like to try this brand new thai place. Turn out it was terrible. I got papaya salad was so bland not even sure what they made of dressing ? WATER???? Â No taste at all !!! So disappointed with the dish. The rest of my order were everage slightly to below. I will not wasted my money to order from this place ever again
