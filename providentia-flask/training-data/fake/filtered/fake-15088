I've had the baked empanadas and they were very good. The Greek empanada was my favorite. The shredded chicken is a bit dry but the sauces help. The beef is good but I've had better. The arepas are excellent. Only problem with the place is that it's small and always full. You need to get there before noon for lunch.
