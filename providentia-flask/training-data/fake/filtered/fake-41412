1st timer with hopes to visit again. We had a fabulous evening from meeting Nickie at the bar to ending the evening saying goodnight to Frank...i felt like i was home with family! The service, food, and ambiance were spot on. A special place that has found success right in their own backyard without the need to put themselves all over the map... thanks again for a great night.. My bucket list got a check last night with 2 thumbs up.
