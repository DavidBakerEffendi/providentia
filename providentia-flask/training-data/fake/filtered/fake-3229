Went there cuz my daughter was craving Lobster. 25 min wait - okay for 4th of July/Friday - not an issue. Waitress was not very ...let's say attentive. My wife had to repeat her drink order 3 times (water with lime). Drink prices are not listed on any menu - no idea what the Mai Tai (which the condescending waitress insisted on telling me 4 times, that it contained alcohol) costs. Drink was full of ice with about an 1/2ounce of liquid total. Ordered a 20oz. Yueng Ling...seems like the waitress did not even make an effort to wait for the keg head to settle - the glass was a full head empty by the time I got it. I ordered the Fish n Chips - the worst EVER! The Fish patty(?) seemed refried from the previous day - dry and tasteless. I usually don't care if one thing is off, a server could be having a bad day or one food item is a little off, but this was one thing after another. My daughter liked her "Lobster on Lobster" and the warm biscuits. That was the only saving grace. I will not go here again.
