Waited in line for an hour just to realize they forgot about us. When we approached the seating staff, she insisted that we didn't have our whole party with us when we actually did. No apologies either. Sat us down with some random strangers, waiter delivered food without telling us who it was for. When the food came, it was horribly mediocre. Screwed up service and run of the mill food. With the long queue to boot, this place hardly deserves half a star from me.
