Problem 1. The special fish of the day .... 3/4 of it was raw, and no one seemed to think too much that it was a problem... we actually asked them to take it back and cook it. We did get a 'sorry' but that was it...I guess it was actually 'sorry-worthy'.... we realized at that point what we were dealing with. Problem 2. That raw fish was served to a James Beard Award-winning celebrity chef and columnist. Problem 3. The chicken was rubber (very over-marinated) and the objects it was sitting were also rubber. In that way the dish was consistent. Problem 4. The chicken dish was served to me. We shared a serving of blueberry sorbet..... it was nice. In the end, it was quite an expensive meal ($175) Â and overall it left a bad taste in our mouths.
