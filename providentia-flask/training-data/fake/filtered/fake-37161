Went to The Blind Pig last week with a group of 4 people and the food was amazing.  We had the Thanksgiving Balls and Poutine for Appetizers - the Balls were out of this world and with all 4 of us sharing were gone within a few mintues!  I have never had Poutine before so we figured we'd try it and I would definitely order it again :)  For dinner we had: a Cheddar Cheeseburger, Herb Roasted Chicken, Alligator Sausage Sandwich (which was a daily special), Lamb sliders and Mac & Cheese.  Everyone enjoyed their main course and we barely had room left for dessert.  We decided to split an order of the butter cake (which is homemade locally) and it was delicious (my husband is a butter cake snob and even he raved about it!). Things we liked about this place:  the food of course, the atmosphere, the cool beer can handles, the indoor and outdoor seating, the daily specials menu (which had drink specials in addition to food items), the fact that the menu is constantly evolving day by day and season by season.  We are looking forward to trying new menu items (we heard that new 'Balls' are coming soon! in addition to the already popular Thankgiving ones). Would we eat here again?: YES! - We have already made plans to take friends of ours back so they too can experience the wonder that is Thanksgiving Balls :)
