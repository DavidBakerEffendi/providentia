Hawthorne's has its pluses and its minuses.  On the plus side, I love the beer selection.  Whether you are picking up single beers or filling up your growler, I think you'll be very happy with the changing selections.  Another plus is the brunch.  Its super good.  I wish I could say the same about their dinner.  The couple of times that I've had dinner here, the meals are always almost right.  The mistakes are small and could be rectified.  The salad has too much red onion or the cheese accompaniments are proportioned oddly or the burger is too salty.  Overall I give the place a thumbs up- check it out.
