Just go there to listen to music, don't Â plan to have diner there. Food is totally not edible. It's not something you would want eat on the weekend night out. I never asked for there wine selection but I had a bad red wine and got me feel so sick the next day, you should ask if you are a wine drinker. But, as I sad go there for listening to music. Read in to it, find out who's playing. 85% times they have pretty good music.
