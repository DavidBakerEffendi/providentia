My taste buds told me that I should stick to banh mi after having the pork belly num pang. It's not that tender pork belly sandwiched in a crunchy baguette wasn't good, it was their special mayo that threw my taste buds off! The tangy taste didn't go well with the sandwich. Blood orange lemonade was refreshing but could add a bit sugar! The cashier answered our questions as he was taking a cigarette break by the entrance.
