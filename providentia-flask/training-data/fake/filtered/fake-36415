This place is AWESOME. The food is so good that will put a big smile on your face. I order from Fabio at least twice a week and he never disappoints me. Â Tonight I had the 'special' dish of trofie pasta with pesto sauce made with arugula, cherry tomatoes and burrata and then lamb chops with broccoli rabe. THIS GUY IS A GENIUS!! I very seldom write reviews, but the food tonight was so good that pushed me to finally leave a feedback... Ordering from the regular menu is a good choice, ordering among the Specials' Fabio creates every day is a MUST! Cozy place, friendly service, casual atmosphere, reasonsble prices given the high quality of ingredients. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!! CHAPEAU!
