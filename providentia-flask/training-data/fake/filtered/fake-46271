AMAZING! I went her a few months back with my boyfriend. I heard there is always wait but when we got there they said 2 hours! Since we figured as much we put our name down and went to the pool hall around the corner. We came back a couple hours later grabbed a drink and the bar and waited for our name to be called. After all that i can say it was worth the wait, i had the ramen, and it was the best ramen ever! Not salty like most and so fresh. Will definitely go back if i have a few hours to kill before hand. 4 stars because of the wait, and the bar and waiting area are super small, for somewhere that has multiple hour wait times i would expect a more spacious area to hang out.
