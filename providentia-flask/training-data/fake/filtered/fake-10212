While having lunch break in their sister bar, The Gingerman in Southern Norwalk i got to talking with the bartender about the company's new bar in New Haven the Cask Republic. He said that it was the Gingerman of New Haven, and i def. should check it out. I had no idea there was any other beer bar in New Haven except for BAR. A couple of friends of mine decided to make a Saturday night of bar hopping Â throughout New Haven. I suggested we try The Cask Republic! They agreed once we saw the menu! (aka the beer menu!) We were welcomed to The Cask Republic by a bubbly blonde who quickly started making beer suggestions after my friend asked the cliche question of "whats good here" and to our surprise they were spot on. ( If you come here you have to try their selection of Stone Beer) Not only was our service great but the food was excellent! I am a big fan of Prime 16's burger and still believe it is the greatest in New Haven but i believe The Cask Republic is a close second. The burger was extremely tender and it was also at the right price, it even came with a soup! (I ordered the clam chowder, its not traditional but it is very good!) All in all we didn't end up bar hopping that night in New Haven, We ended up BEER hopping at The Cask Republic. It's a beer lovers dream
