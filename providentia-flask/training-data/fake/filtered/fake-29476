I had the ludris dinner which is fried chicken wings, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. The fried chicken wings were okay but it was missing some more seasoning, the mashed potatoes were not flavorful and the mac and cheese tasted watered down. Also, the last time I was there I had the chicken and waffle dinner. The fried chicken was a little better and the waffle was okay. If you want some real southern food do not go to Amy Ruth's. Go to Amy Ruth's if you want a quick meal not a decent meal.
