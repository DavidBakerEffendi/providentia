My husband and I discovered Caseus sometime in late April of this year, and we've been huge fans of this homey, unpretentious and friendly little bistro ever since (we were there on a near-weekly basis throughout the summer). This place is a much needed "breath of fresh air" on the New Haven restaurant scene: the prices are decidedly moderate (by comparison to most overpriced, pretentious, yet mediocre downtown New Haven spots); the atmosphere is not stuffy, appealing both to a young crowd, and to a middle-aged or older crowd; the food is consistently delicious and fresh (vegetables from the local farmers' market, free-range pork from New England producers, etc); the owner, Jason, is super-friendly, open to suggestions, and always making us feel like we're home every time we go there; last but not least, the waitstaff is attentive, knowledgeable and friendly. Reservations at least a day in advance are always a good idea, since it is a small place, and seemingly always packed. Last Friday we brought my sister-in-law there. She was equally impressed. We started with the cheeseboard (a nice, balanced selection), the tart du jour --always mouthwateringly flaky, green brazilian eggplants stuffed with cheese and herbs --delicious; I was particularly impressed with the pasta dish I ordered for main course -- a hearty bowl of spaghetti Amatriciana-style, with bits of Â apple-wood smoked pork belly (mouthwatering!). For dessert, the three of us shared a gigantic chocolate chip cookie (a special for that day) --baked to order, so all fresh out of the oven, and deliciously hot and gooey with melted chocolate chips (I felt I was a kid again!). The wine we had was excellent, as well --a new red, light -bodied Cotes du Rhone (I forget the name) which Jason had just introduced. All in all, a fantastic dining experience.
