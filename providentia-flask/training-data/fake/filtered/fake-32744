This past weekend my husband and I went to Room 55 after hearing about it from some friends. We're usually not too food enthusiastic, but that dinner was hit all the right notes. For starters, we ordered the Harvest Salad, which was fresh and tasty, with a generous amount of goat cheese. My entree was the Amish Chicken Breast. This type of dish can be a hit & miss, since chicken breast can be easily dried up, but the chef of Room 55 did a great job of keeping the meat juicy. My husband opted for the duck, and according to him it was divine! It's been a while since I've seen him enjoy food like that. Additionally, the service was very kind, and the prices were fair. We'll definitely be back for more!
