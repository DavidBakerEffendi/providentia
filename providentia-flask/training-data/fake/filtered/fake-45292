OUTSTANDING!!!  Chef's Corner food and experience was absolutely amazing!  Scott Sorrell and his team catered our wedding - the food was incredibly tasty and was presented beautifully.  Their experience and professionalism was outstanding.  And you must get their wedding cakes - Alyssa's cake was romantic, elegant, modern, and SO DELICIOUS!
