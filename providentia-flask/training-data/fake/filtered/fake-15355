THIS WAS THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD IN BROOKLYN! i have never experienced more miserable food or staff. Not only was all of our steak undercooked, and then overcooked, the bartender/part owner was probably the rudest woman i have ever come across in my life. She was rude to the point of making my cry and to make matter worse, she was a complete racist. When asked how our meal was, we responded with feedback only to have our waitress walk away. The meal was so expensive and absolutely a miserable experience. I wouldn't even wish a meal from here on Â my worst enemy.
