Went Friday with my daughter and husband. They would not substitute steamed vegetable for fries without charging for same. For a new place, you should accomodate your customers. My husband's hamburger roll came to the table top of it burned! How did the chef even let it leave the kitchen. We told the waiter and he just brought another roll instead of taking the hamburger back. The waiter was not nice at all! Never even asked if everything was okay, did we want coffee??? Won't go back.
