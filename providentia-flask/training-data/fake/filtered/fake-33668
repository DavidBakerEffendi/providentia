For starters, I've eaten many times at Jose Tejas and was always satisfied with the taste of their inexpensive food. This weekend , was no exception I and a group of others ordered several different appetizers including the corn and bean empenadas and the pop corn shrimp. Still satisfied and just barley taking a few bites of our entrees I began to assemble my beef fajita and it was just while I was mixing the beef strips and the onions that I came across 2 roaches. 1 dead and the other alive but so to speak hanging on a thread. I was horrified by this , like I said I haven't had such experience in the past but this surly was the last time I will be eating there. In my opinion roaches mixed in with prep food is unacceptable and even more so I did not approve of the way in which the matter was held . After having no complaints I would now have to take those prior opinions back and now rate Jose Tejas poorly for the presence of insects like the roaches and in addition for the poor service and management. The combination of the two poor qualities will not have me recommending the restaurant to not a single soul.
