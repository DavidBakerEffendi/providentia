More fake reviews such as the most recent one form Jessica H. Yelp has seriously lost its credibility, just take a look at the filtered reviews at the bottom of this page that are skewing the ratings for this restaurant. All new account with 0 previous reviews give this place 5* whereas all old yelpers are giving it less than 3*. Obviously something is wrong here. I at here last night and while the food is mediocre at best, I am giving this place a 1* because of horrible service. The staff acts like they don't even want to be there. I would give it 2* but all the fake review anger me even more!
