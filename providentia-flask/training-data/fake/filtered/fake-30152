The ambiance of the Royal Palace is very welcoming and calming, a good get-away spot for good food if your a local college student like me. I found the service to be very fast and friendly. As a vegetarian, I was pleased with the menu. There are tons of great vegetarian options on both the standard menu and traditional/authentic Chinese menu. I thought the vegetable dumplings were the best l have had.  It's difficult to make  veggie dumplings that are on par with meat dumplings, but the Royal Palace pulls it off.  The fried rice was also excellent, and well portioned (I didn't leave hungry). Nothing was greasy or over-fried. I'll definitely be coming back. Definitely check out the Royal Palace if you are looking for quality or more authentic Chinese food and a less chaotic and classy environment. For the price, the food is a great deal.
