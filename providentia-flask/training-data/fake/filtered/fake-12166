*SUMMARY* Although Miya's does offer a wide variety of innovative rolls that challenge the traditional definition of sushi, some rolls in its encyclopedic menu just don't live up to their lengthy and fanciful descriptions. And in the end, good food should speak for itself. *THE ROLL* I ordered the "Kiss the Smiling Piggie" roll, entranced by the accompanying illustration and the intriguing description --              "Designed to look and taste exactly like the inside of a live pig'snostril.                   Tastes better than a pork chop!" It was described as "a roll ofsweet potato,mango chutney, andpine nuts." I was greatly disappointed. Here's why: Quality of Rice: Poor. Although the rice did have a pleasingly nutty and hearty flavor, its texture was gummy and chewy, and contrasted strangely with the sweet potato. Presentation: Neat, but unremarkable. Quality of fish: N/A Proportions: Poor. I could barely taste the mango chutney, and there appeared to be only three tiny pine nuts per slice. The amount of sweet potato was simply overwhelming. Price: Poor. For the component ingredients, not worth it. *THE VERDICT* A fun, bustling environment, and a unique dining experience. Definitely go early and read through the menu -- but don't be surprised if the roll on your plate doesn't live up to your unnecessarily bolstered expectations.
