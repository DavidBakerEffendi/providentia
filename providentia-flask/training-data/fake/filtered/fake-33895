I took my wife here after reading a good review.  We had a bad experience. The food was edible but not exceptional and the service was poor.  The decor is okay but the restaurant was very noisy. I normally leave an 18-20% tip but left only a 15% tip given the poor service. My charge card bill was increased to 18%. I called the owner/chef who informed me that the reviews were good and that he trained his staff well. He said he would look into the increase. Can't decide what's worse his atitude or his restaurant.
