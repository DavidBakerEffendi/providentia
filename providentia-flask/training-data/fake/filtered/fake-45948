great food and cheap prices. The mushroom and duck soup as well as the mustard greens in oyster sauce have made both my belly and my wallet happy for the last 4 years. don't be too upset if they sit you with other people, its a cultural thing. they DO do it to other Asian people and they do it at other (real) Chinese restaurants. yeah on occasion you may get a slightly xenophobic waiter, but honestly, if you are in Chinatown paying $4 for a bowl of noodles don't expect great service. also, keep in mind that things get lost in translation, they aren't (usually) doing it on purpose.
