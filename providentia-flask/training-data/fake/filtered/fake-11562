The Bethwood's experience as an event venue makes them a very valuable resource and partner when planning an event. I had my wedding at the Bethwood and it was the most amazing and perfect experience. Everything was top notch. Jason Baldanza was a major contributor to the success of my wedding - I would not have changed a thing. I bombarded Jason with emails and calls and he answered every single question I had, gave me great advice and brought up important aspects I hadn't thought of and would have completely overlooked. Everything about the Bethwood is amazing and wonderful - each room is elegant, tastefully decorated and extremely well maintained - they only additional decoration I brought were my centerpieces, which was not only convenient but also economical; the rooms vary in size making the Bethwood perfect for ANY size and type of event; they have an abundance of private suites, each in a different style to accommodate anyone's and everyone's style preference; the staff are extremely helpful, responsive and friendly - the Bethwood really has cultivated an outstanding group of people - throughout my wedding they attended to every guest with such extreme promptness I received at least 10 comments on how great they were throughout the night; the food is DELICIOUS - any doubts or questions can be easily answered/resolved by attending one of their Sunday brunches that will blow you away. My sister-in-law had her wedding at the Bethwood and it was just as perfect - so their excellent is not a fluke but the standard. I have and will always recommend the Bethwood to anyone looking to host an event at a venue that does EVERYTHING well and exceeds even the highest expectations!
