This place is so so at best - if you are a uninitiated Indian food person - basically one who has no appreciation of Indian food - you might like this place. Otherwise the food at this place is mediocre at best. Both the south Indian Dosa, the gujarati place and the the Punjabi place are the pits ! This continues the tradition of mediocre NJ indian joints - mostlt run and managed by people who have no taste or understanding of Indian food. Avoid this place - it is over priced as well.
