My husband and I have been coming here for our Taylor ham, egg, and cheese sandwiches since they opened and they are the BEST. Consistently delicious food; clean restaurant; and friendly, efficient employees. We recently moved to Sussex Boro so we have been deprived, BUT we did stop in recently for our sandwiches and to grab some bagels for home. A real treat! :)
