first off, the Burnt Ends and this place are AMAZING! If theres any reason to come to this place is for that delicious "meat candy" as the our waitress seegan(i hope im spelling it right) called them. Not only is ALL the food amazing, the service is just as amazing. As soon as you walk in, you get a warm welcome and a nice smile from all the staff. Â Our waitress was very helpful and very attentive with our drink refills.( the root beer here is the bomb as well) I give the place 5 stars because the atmosphere was great, our waitress attentive to our needs, and the food was Great!
