I went in there the evening of Saturday 11/7/09 after being completly ignored by the lame bar staff the night before.  Anyway, I orderd two Franzikaner beers and the nasty short black haired bitch said 'it was around 13 dollars', okay, more than the listed price of 5.50 each on the menu, but no problem, gave her 15 dollars.  She never came back with the change, which in turn given the oppurtunity, I, being an excellent tipper, would have left for a tip.  The fact that she self-tipped herself and assumed the change was hers was bothering. I kindly inquired if the price goes up at night and this demonic thing of a woman snaps back ' well its plus 10% tax, so, what - you want the dollar back?!'  Wait a minute, 1st of all it's 4 dollars, the beers should have come to 11 dollars like usual, so after giving this potato butted troll 15, she basically kept the other 4 for herself and yet still accused me of only giving her a dollar. What a rude and nasty bitch!  I will never go to this lame bullshit place again!  What is happening to my South Philly!  Ugh these newcomer poser wanna be assholes just plain SUCK!
