Tried this place based on some of the reviews I saw here, but was completely disappointed. Pad Thai had a very strange and oily taste. Fried rice was OK but some of the other entrees that were ordered mild-medium spicy were so hot they were inedible. There are so many other good Thai places in the area to try I would pass on this.
