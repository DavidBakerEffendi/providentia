Horrible. First of all, I was asked the minimum order of $25 since we were 4 of us.  We were hungry at 7:30 on Tuesday after having house renovation, so we were ready to order quite a quantity and I expected to drop more than $100 considering four of us for sure.  I am from Japan and I want to eat what I can not normally buy from local store near by and expect to eat not so so but good or if not better sushi  and I happen to not tried prior, so I thought to give it a shot since I happen to remember that Ajihei on the way to go to another restaurant in Princeton thus I parked in the closest public parking, then walked over.  So there is no problem there.  Then, there are plenty of open tables on Tuesday night.  Then, apparently waitress showed us a dirty look.  Do we deserve it?  I am from Japan and I don't know what kind of discrimination that was from a waitress.  Then she told me that it will take at least 10 minutes waiting.  Though there are plenty of seating open.  And then two people came.  And she gave table immediately though we were waiting at the bench as she told us to do so.  Then, three people came in.  And they also got the seat immediately.  Two　waitress，they did not inform anyone but us only about the minimum order.  Did we look like we don't have money to her or something?  And the waitress still informed us to wait.  Though there is a four people seating I could even see from where I was sitting. I would give them 0 rating, if you let me.  I will never go to Ajihei.  And I will let my friends know for sure how they discriminated us because noone should gone though what we as a family had to go though.  Maybe I need to contact Better Business Bureau.  Yes, it was that bad.
