As a person who got addicted to tonkatsu while living in Japan, I was ecstatic when I'd found out there was a katsu restaurant in NY. I was just in NY for a 2 day trip and made it a point to stop by this place. The place was packed by I didn't have to wait long for a seat. It was a very cold day and was glad to get a free cup of green tea. The menu isn't that extensive (especially the lunch menu). I ordered the basic tonkatsu meal for lunch which came with soup, rice, tonkatsu, and shredded cabbage. That was probably the best tonkatsu I'd had since I'd left Japan! The meat had just a little fat, but was tender and the batter was nice and crisp. The tonkatsu sauce melted into the batter, which really gave it a kick. The rice was fresh as was the cabbage. The miso was okay. I think it had more onion than miso. The food wasn't as pricey as some other Japanese restaurants I'd been to. I wasn't too big on my waitress though as they didn't seem too friendly. I would definitely go back to this place and probably bring some friends too!
