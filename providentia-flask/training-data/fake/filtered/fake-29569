I've done take out and eaten there several times.  The chicken is still nice and crispy but has become tasteless.  Mac & cheese is good.  With that said, I think I ate my last meal there.  On my way home today my family and I spotted a RAT, yes I said a RAT hanging on the top ledge of the open doors that lead down to the basement on the side of the building. Looks like it was getting ready to die since it didn't seem to want to move away from there.  All the while the workers are downstairs making the Pies!! Oh Boy!  I proceeded to let a worker know who was preparing the tables on the side of the building and all he said was "Ah, they're all over the place.  Yes they are all over the place and I've lived in Willy B all my life and I know there are rats, but to act like it's not a big deal in such a nonchalant way shows he doesn't care what customers think and that our concerns don't matter.  Good Riddance Pies and Thighs!
