My favorite Mexican restaurant in the city! The food is delicious and affordable, and the portions are huge. The horchata is also really good, and the salsas are delicious! Can't wait to go back. Service might be a little slow but they are super accommodating. Place is small so call ahead. Points for being BYO as well.
