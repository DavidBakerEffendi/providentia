I came in with my husband and it was a bitter cold night. The moment we entered Thelma on Clinton we immediately warmed up. Not only is the decor, simple yet elegant, but there is a welcoming vibe from the patrons, staff and of course, Chef Melissa. She met us with a big smile and a welcoming response. The food was exquisite, the cauliflower soup was amazing, and I don't even like cauliflower. So creamy and tasty, without being heavy. The kippered salmon was tender and rich, and everything we had was terrific. I'm a dyed in wool New Yorker, and to me, what sets Thelma apart is that it's a friendly foodie's paradise. I want great food and a warm atmosphere, I don't need snobbery and elitism, to feel like I've had an extraordinary meal. Chef Melissa has created a very unusual combination of impeccably presented food, that has as much sizzle as it does steak, in an environment that's warm and inviting. Quite unusual for NYC. I say Thelma on Clinton, is The Urban "Cheers" for the foodie soul. I'll be sure to tell all my friends. Lois Barth
