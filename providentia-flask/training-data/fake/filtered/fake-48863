Service was incredibly slow, disorganized and not knowledgeable. Took forty five minutes for our order - the fried tomato salad (tomatoes weren't properly tried, the arugula was doused in dressing so heavy it looked like soup) and the French toast burger, which was bland, lacking seasoning and punch. Never got water, server was all over the place. Unfortunately we won't be coming back :(
