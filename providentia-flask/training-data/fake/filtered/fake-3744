I just purchased one tray of lasagna, half with meat and half with cheese.  It was absolutely delicious; amazing and the BEST anyone ever tasted.  GREAT JOB!  My guests were from Boston, Connecticut and Buffalo and RAVED RAVED RAVED about it........they just wished they had someone in area who could make great home cooked lasagna like this.  The price was unbelievably reasonable - the staff is so so so friendly and awesome.  Thank you for your hard work and great cooking.  LOVED LOVED LOVED IT!!!!! Great job!
