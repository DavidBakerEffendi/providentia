I'm not an expert on Thai food, but I thought theirs was pretty good.  I got the appetizer sampler (my usual way of trying out a new place), which was an okay amount of food but if I'd been hungrier I definitely would have needed an entree, too.  It wasn't wildly delicious, but not bad either (the satay dip was particularly disappointing - it wasn't that it tasted bad, but it definitely could have been spicier).  The ambiance inside the restaurant is pretty cool.  Mostly it loses a star for the slow service.  But still worth checking out.
