We were so excited to get a reservation here recently - the menu looked delicious, got great reviews and we love watching the kitchen team work. We have an online reservation account and so we booked for 8 pm on a recent Tuesday evening. Our profile notes that one in our party has a nut allergy and when the reservation person called to confirm she noted verbally about the nut allergy clarifying it was all nuts. We arrived 10 minute prior to reservation and we were seated promptly. The female hostess was less than friendly. When we ordered she seemed to struggle with our order which wasn't complicated and she was very stand off-ish. We also once again said, "we think we avoided all the nuts from the dishes we chose on the menu but would you mind double checking to make sure because we will select other things if so..."She did and returned saying we were fine on our orders. When one of our dishes arrived with Cashews - we had to obviously send it back, her response "oh I thought cashews would be ok". The chef did apologize but the server/hostess we rather rude. Overall the food was excellent (from the mushroom croquetas which were spectacular to the artic char Â with tater tots which was sooo flavorful) we were so happy with the food. Disappointing was the service which merits 2 not 3 stars (the bump is for the food). Wine that didn't come in a timely fashion no one checking on us, no one doing anything for the nut mistake and overall seemed not to care much about us or our dining experience. It was a shame because the intimate restaurant and DELICIOUS FOOD could have really hit it out of the park had it not been for POOR SERVICE. Someone needs to spend some time with Danny Meyer's team to know how people expect to be treated in a restaurant like Degustation.
