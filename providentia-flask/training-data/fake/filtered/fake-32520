I didn't think of posting this on YELP and wanted to let by gones be by gones untill I passed by this place last week and horrible memories were awakened!   We ordered our wedding cake from Pierre's based on  recomendations of the wedding hall next door as well as some of our friends in the area.  We did the right thing by setting the appointment, doing a taste testing and then placing a deposit with them.  ALL OF OUR INFORMATION WAS PROVIDED INCLUDING DATE OF THE WEDDING, TIME, PLACE OUR PHONE NUMBERS..NOTHING WAS LEFT TO CHANCE! So here's what happened..The day of our wedding (a saturday) they were supposed to have our cake at the wedding hall (right next door!!!) at 6pm..needless to say we were busy and figured that such a reputable place would take care of this with the wedding coordinator at the hall.  Leaving nothing to chance, we even called to confirm time and place that morning!  Around 6:15pm the coordintor comes and asks one of us when the cake is supposed to arrive..humm maybe there is a delay..no worries..let's call them..first call no answer..okay..second call..no answer..frustration mounts..third call..that's it!! Wife starts freakin out..coordinator is loss for ideas..what the hell do we do???   Two of our family come running to us and ask what's going on.  After hearing the situation, they decide to go over to the bakery and see what the F they are doing.  Upon arriving there, they were greated by a worker who seemed surprised to see them there are even more surprised to learn that they have a wedding cake to deliver..they have no idea!  IN OTHER WORDS THEY NEVER MADE OUR CAKE!!  At this point they just grab the first thing they see and bring it over..IT WASN'T OUR CAKE!! IT WASN'T EVEN WHAT THE HECK WE WANTED! Okay maybe mistakes happen..we all make them it happens..we were ready to accept an apology and our money back..but things get worse!!! My wife calls the bakery the next day and is understandably furious!  The high school girl that picked up the phone says that the owner..big fat Pierre himself would call back.  As we should have expected..no call back!  We go on our honeymoon and get back two weeks later.  There is no phone call from Pierre, no email NOTHING!!  At this point we still want an explanation and an apology from this place.  After many phone calls, Pierre finally answers the phone..wow HE IS AROGANT AND RUDE AND TELLS US THAT WE DID GET OUR CAKE AND THE PEOPLE THAT PICKED UP THE CAKE WERE RUDE AND INCONSIDERATE FOR TAKING ANOTHER CAKE WITHOUT PERMISSION.  HE THEN TELLS US THAT HE IS NOT GOING TO REFUND ANYTHING NOR DID HE APOLOGIZE!! At this point we went to the credit card to take up our fight.. IF YOU WANT TO RISK YOUR BIG DAY WITH THIS SHADY UNPROFESSIONAL IMMIGRANT CHARACTER, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!  I WOULDN'T RECOMEND PIERRE'S BAKERY TO ANYONE! NOT EVEN TO BUY A LOAF OF BREAD!!
