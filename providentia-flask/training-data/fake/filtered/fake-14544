Wow. This experience truly exceeded my expectations. Ambiance was great, service was wonderful, atmosphere was neat and food was delicious. The mood was very calm and everyone I met was extremely friendly and accommodating. What's neat is it's an extension of Sleep No More, and there are actors walking around and even interacting with you! At multiple occasions they even came up to someone sitting at my table and took them along for a short journey. I can't remember ever hearing of a restaurant that does that. The dishes are just as unique and portion size is perfect. The bone marrow dish is a must, as too is the oyster appetizer. Oh, and they even drew a lottery to win drinks! If you haven't tried this restaurant yet, book as soon as you can. Truly a unique experience!
