Cinnamon Roll pancakes, bacon and potatoes!!!!!!!  Super deeeeelllllllicious!!!!  My husband's omelet was pretty good too.  My son had the french toast, but that dish was subpar: very little flavor to the bread.  I'd give the place a 5 for my meal, but the disgusting restroom (that was shared by men and women because the men's room was out of order) and the old dingy utensils and glassware made me somewhat uncomfortable.  The place didn't feel clean at all.
