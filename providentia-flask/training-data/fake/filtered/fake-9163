Last night we had a splendid dinner to celebrate our daughter and friend's move to Bklyn. I have to say starting with the warm greeting from manager Brayon to the waitstaff service they did not disappoint. The food was consistently excellent, great variety of craft beers and delicious dessert. If you order the pork chop in mustard sauce you must go in the kitchen and hug the chef!! Â No doubt we will be back.
