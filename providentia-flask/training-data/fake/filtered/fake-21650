Just ate some panner sizzler and to tell you, it was great. Had great service too. The service was also great as always and the lights are great too. The garlic naan and krishna's special is very good. I will surely be back again will try more thing from the menu. Also the large space makes it comfortable to eat and enjoy the watching the tv.
