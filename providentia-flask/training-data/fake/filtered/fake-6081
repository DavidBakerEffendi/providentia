It seemed like a good deal so I ordered the $25 pre-theatre dinner which included the spare ribs sugar cane skewers appetizer, while my friend got the same thing from the regular menu list. When they arrived, his one was twice as big. I asked the waiter why this was the case, and was told that the price of the $25 menu was discounted so of course the dishes would be smaller. Â  If I saw that as a problem I should have asked the waiter before I ordered. How would I know to even ask?? If two things in the menu have the exact same description how could I even guess they would be different. It is like buying a discounted bus ticket and getting dropped off halfway. The waiter promptly refused to fill up the appetizer to normal size after a long discussion. Not the way to treat a repeat customer (never again). Apart from this terrible service, which kind of ruined the feeling, the food was quite nice and the drinks were good.
