This place has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced.  After ordering there for months I have had enough.  The girl that answers the phone is extremely rude.  Then when they make a mistake on your food, they yell at you hang up on you and pretty much say F you we don't need your business.  Well in that case you no longer have my business and I hope a lot of other people stop going there as well!  The only reason I gave it one star is because it wouldn't let me put my review through with 0!
