I've been to many pizzerias in my day, but I must say the one place where the taste of the food remains constant; no matter how many times you go is L&B's. It's a place where its cool to just come and chill out with your friends; over some amazing pizza. Of course, they only have a restaurant right next door to the pizzeria; but personally, I'd have to say they're known for that pies, and square pies at that. There's just something that sets it apart from other pizzerias; maybe its the sauce, maybe its something else, but whatever it is; I was extremely satisfied the first time I went and every-time thereafter.
