I went there today to meet up with a friend. The music was so loud we couldn't talk to each other without yelling across the table. That's fine for a Saturday night, but noon in the financial district- not so much. We both ordered beers and an order of cheese fries. The fries came before the beers, and we watched as the newly seated people next to us got their drinks before us. Finally our drinks came. I ordered a Buffalo Chicken Hoagie with Provolone- and I specified NO dressing. Our food came out promptly. We were so hungry we dug in. Halfway through my sandwich I realized that it either had mayonnaise or some kind of dressing, that I hadn't noticed because it was blending with the cheese. Throughout the meal one of the waitresses kept interrupting our conversation to try to refill our water glasses; we never got water glasses in the first place, so that was weird. Got the check and it was wrong. I've gotta say I wanted to love this place, but I was very unimpressed. Next time I'll just go get a pookie at Wogies...and pay less.
