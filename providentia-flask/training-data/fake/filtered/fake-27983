We have been to Cozy Spot 3 times now on a friend's reccomendation and we werent disappointed.  Cozy Spot offers authentic southern cooking, We have had a great breakfast and late lunch there.     Miss Agnes (who is the owner) is very nice.  Sorry to say that the area is rough and not in a good part of Hartford CT, but, it is worth the trip for us - and we are true "out of towners".  Cozy Spot closes at 6pm, but, open early for breakfast.  Go there when Miss Agnes is there - usually later in the morning and you will appreciate good cookin'.    We will be back there again,  and we are so glad we went there.   One time was a treat to a true southern breakfast with grits!    For those whimps and scaredy cats who diss the neighborhood-- grow up!  If you want a sanitized life experience, go to the shopping mall. If you want a dining experience in an real actual urban environment, go to the Cozy Spot.   The neighborhood is somewhat safe during the day and if you can get a parking spot close - unless you are someone involved in the street economy.   Almost forgot - if you have a party to Cater - call Agnes - she will help you and they deliver too!  Great catering business! You gotta go try it!  We did - and no guts no glory, that is our motto! Dont be a whimp!
