This place has the best Indian food I've ever had in my life, in any city or country. It is a bit expensive a la carte, I guess, but the buffet is more than reasonable for the quality and choice of food you get. It is more on the spicy side than not, but I consider that a plus. The service is excellent and the waiters are beyond nice and go out of their way. Great location, the best food ever, and fabulous service. It may be my favorite restaurant of all time - seriously. I used to work in Old City and went here every week for years - I really miss it now that I don't work there in the neighborhood anymore.
