Holy Lemon Pasta!!!!! Coming from an Italian mother and Spanish father, I know good food- let me tell ya! I've been coming to Supper for years, but had a particularly good meal there the other day and thought I would jump back into my yelping. This place has solid pastas all around- their "priest stranglers" are light and delicious, the bolognese's meat sauce is rich and flavorful, and the tomato and basil spaghetti is just as good as any you'd eat in Italy. However, the lemon pasta is the number one thing that keeps me coming back. I've tart so that you literally feel like you are eating a lemon, or not enough and it just tastes like you're eating pasta with cheese. Supper achieves the perfect balance and it's just right every time. Seems to be the case with most of their food, and that's why I gave them four stars. Not five stars because they are cash only, which is just annoying and SO East Village- and also because there is ALWAYS a wait. I guess other people share my sentiments about the food!
