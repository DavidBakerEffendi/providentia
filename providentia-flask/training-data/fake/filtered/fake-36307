Hope Garage was is GREAT. Â I've been there a couple times, I come from Manhattan and its worth the trip all the time. For Sunday brunch I love to have there chicken & waffle amazing it comes with cinnamon butter on the side as well and a yummy like buffalo chicken sauce sooo good!. For dinner It's a must to have there buffalo chicken wings as appetizers, there awesome the blue cheese it Comes with is delicious one of a kind.. Mac n cheese Good. Fried Wisconsin cheese curds are also good. roasted chicken is so moist with great flavor. The grilled skirt steak with the a chimichurri sauce and mash potatoes DELICIOUS. For dessert I have had the apple pie, comes warm with a side scoop of vanilla ice cream, cranberries that are soaked in liquor give it that extra goodness ;) Beside the food they have good drinks. you can choose from there many syrups to make a drink to ur liking. Must have there cucumber Margaritas, really good. Not a fan of beer but they do have a selection of them like sol, session.. The staff was friendly, food on time very clean place, clean restrooms. Prices are good for the good size of food they serve.And did I mention they serve food till 4AM!!!! A+ I have no complaints for this place highly recommend this place.
