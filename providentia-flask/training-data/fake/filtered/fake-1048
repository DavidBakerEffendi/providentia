EBA's has the best chicken sandwich around!! However, they need to work on several things.. Their childrens menu is extremely misleading, Spaghetti dinner w/ meatball & side of bread actually is stuck together ziti w/ marinara sauce garlic bread & no meatball... My kids wouldn't touch it.. Their take out packaging is less than impressive.. we traveled 5 mins Â down the road, opened our containers to see complete sog.. Called to complain the next day after work, ( I was a bit annoyed that we spent nearly $40 and got sog) & was basically told b/c I didn't bring it all back immediately I was S.O.L. The women also implied that b/c I was not satisfied w/ our entire meal, I was making it up.. Great customer service, lady.. wont be going back
