Had dinner here on tuesday night with my best friend! Overall I had to say the food was good. We started off with an appetizer (spinach and artichoke dip). It came on a wooden plate with thinly sliced baguettes. I thought it was good, the bread was a bit hard but I think it went well with the cheesy dip. My friend ordered the burger and I ordered the prosciutto and goat cheese sandwich. She really liked her burger and I thought her fries were good. I would definitely recommend trying the sandwich, sometimes prosciutto can be overpowering (because of the salt content) but I really liked how it tasted. In addition, typically the side salad isn't much to talk about but I loved the dressing and how the salad wasn't swimming in dressing. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive! Although we didn't drink, they have quite a selection of wine to choose from. Also they have a deal on wine on tuesdays so if you're looking to get a drink you should stop by. They also do have a bar on the other half of the restaurant.
