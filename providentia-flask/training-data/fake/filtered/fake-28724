A really good addition to BYOBs.  Different than traditional Indian cuisine in many ways.  Much more emphasis on healthy choices and innovation. Tried Chicken Chaat which was quite refreshing as an appetizer. Tandoori chicken was mixed up with a lot of good greens,  Chicken Chili was a fusion and tasted like spicy Orange Mandarin Chinese chicken. Overall service was perfect. Worthy of 2nd visit and more.
