First off my wife and I like to eat early.  Usually around 5:30.  The benefits:  Street parking, attentive waiters, chefs who are not cooking for a crowd.   This Saturday everything worked in our favor.  Metered street parking on the same block as the restaurant, passing the $16 valet and garage parking. We were greeted warmly upon arrival and promptly seated, beating the crowds. Although the outdoor courtyard has a lot of ambiance, we prefer indoor seating. The waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and spent extensive time explaining the menu.  We saw that many Yelpers recommended the Master Collection Cheese appetizer so we went with that.  Knowing that we were going to be sampling cheese we opted for wine rather than our regular martinis.  The cheese platter was great, ideal for two. I ordered the raw tuna/watermelon "beginning" as my main course, my wife the Tilefish.  We never had Tilefish but again saw that many Yelpers recommended it, they were right, it is great.  We also ordered a side of Heirloom Tomatoes to share and it complemented both dishes.   For desert we shared the Summer "Peaches and Cream" with a small French Pressed Coffee.  It capped off an excellent meal. Total cost of the meal w/drinks can be $$$$.  If you are a meat and potatoes or pub fare type of person, this is not a place for you.  We went in prepared and this place exceeded our expectations.  Totally enjoyed the whole dining experience.
