The ambiance and décor are nice - 4 stars. Food and service are ok - 3 stars. Price is very good; lunch special is a deal. I could give 3.5 stars, but I upgraded a little because this place is a to-go place among all these thai restaurants in 9th avenue, mainly due to décor and size. I would give 4 stars comfortably if there was a little bit more personal attention which is hard to find in Thai restaurants in this area.
