Ugly restaurant with poor acoustics. Although there were few people there, it was very loud. It was also chilly inside. Food was mediocre. Polenta fries were tasteless; salmon crudo was okay; pork belly pizza had no pork belly and was overwhelmed by the taste of raw red onion and sauce that was acrid and tasted as if it came from a jar; duck pizza was not very tasty; fritto misto average; no bread; bronzino was tiny and dry and ugly--overcooked fish over brown farro with brown olive mix on top; duck breast was tasty; desserts: pear tart was supposed to be made with puff pastry, it wasn't; the apple beignets were doughy--as in undercooked dough; the chocolate cake was okay; the wine list was very affordable; and the service was polite. Overall: try elsewhere.
