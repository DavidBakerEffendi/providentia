This is a wonderful small sushi establishment.  The food is very fresh. I routinely eat at some very highly rated sushi places in NYC, and this place is very comparable.  The rolls are not very large but the food is top notch.  The tuna pizza, seaweed with spicy tuna on top and the miso cod are very good dishes. The owner apparently was a sushi chef at sushi samba for 10 years and gets his fish from the same place.   It is also BYOB.
