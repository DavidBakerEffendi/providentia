Went here on NYE, and the service was absolutely horrible.  We waited 20 minutes to be seated (despite having a reservation), and then waited another 20 minutes to place our drink order.  Our drinks arrived ten minutes later, and we did not eat until another hour after that.  When I spoke with the manager, I was told to "please be patient".  At that point, our total wait time was nearly two hours.  Only four chefs were working that night, despite there being 16 tables filled.  The food was good once it finally arrived, but not amazing, and certainly not worth that long of a wait.
