This restaurant was opened by my husband earlier this year, so of course I am biased and love everything about it. I also had the opportunity to see how  the space morphed from a dark room into a bright restaurant with a big window at a corner in the Bushwick neighborhood where you might not expect to find a restaurant at all. The restaurant offers a combination of classic Vietnamese  dishes like pho and banh mi for lunch and lesser known takes on Vietnamese cuisine for dinner. Try the shrimp and okra (his own recipe). My favorite is Dad's shrimp roll.  It's a dish you eat at celebrations. His Dad made these rolls at our wedding, so I have fond memories of it, and Henry gave the recipe his own, more healthy spin, by including Jicama.  The catfish, a dish I got to love while visiting Vietnam, is served without bones. My other favorite is a tofu dish with sour cabbage. It is a variation of a dish he very often cooks at home with sour vegetables. We often joke its the ChaoZhou sauerkraut, as having grown up in Germany I like my Sauerkraut. My favorite dessert is Mango Panna Cotta and the Bitter Grapefruit ice cream that was recently added to the menu. The food is meant for sharing.  But if you don't want to share dishes, you can let the staff know so that dishes come out at the same time. The wine list has gotten longer since the launch. It includes now wines from different regions of the world that pair well with the different Vietnamese dishes. I agree that some of the lunch items would be great to have on the dinner menu.
