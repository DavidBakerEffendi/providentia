This place is off the chain!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! If you got a big apetite or an itybity one it don't make not matter folks! You just walk on in the door od Beau Monde and the friendly waiting staff'll take good care of ya! They got a full bar, and they got crepes! Big as texas they are! My advice would be to order the preset one's but you can also create your own. Give it a try and see what happens! (most likely magic)
