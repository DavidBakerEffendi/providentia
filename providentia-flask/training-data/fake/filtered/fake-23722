I arrived with my wife one summer afternoon. The place was packed. We did not have reservations and the hostess said it would be about an hour wait, so we left and had a drink at another bar. We came back to see if space was available at the bar and it was still full, but the hostess remembered us and said wait here a few minutes because she knew people were about to leave the bar. So we did and it was worth the wait.   We were then greeted by the Bartender who was very nice and knowledgable. He made some great recommendations for us for drinks and appetizers. We like the open kitchen aspect and the fact that the head chef was on top of things. We had a sampler  platter of oysters recommended by the bartender which was spot-on. My wife ordered the smoked salmon which she very much enjoyed,and she's a tough critic when it comes to seafood. I had the scallops which were also very good and the crab cake which was ok. Over all I was very satisfied with our experience here and will definitly be returning.
