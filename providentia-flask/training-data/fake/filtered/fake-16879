Extremely cool atmosphere.  Excellent wait staff.  Walked in without a reservation, on a busy night, and they were able to find us a table immediately. Sat down to excellent service and a knowledgeable server who suggested exactly what we needed.  The signature cheeseburger was outstanding as was the scallops and the sides.   Super cool place and with super good food.  A must visit when in NYC.
