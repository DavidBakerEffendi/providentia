Stopped by for the second time in a month, this time for Sunday brunch at about noon. Waited a bit for the menu(they were busy!), but from then on everything was smooth. My brunch partner cares alot about food quality and we both enjoyed our meals very much. Nice outdoor seating area. They were out of chocolate chip cookies, which was a disappointment, as I heard they are the best around. Read over some of the other reviews, and it appears to me some of the reviewers are too fussy. It is a cafe, not the Four Seasons.
