Not sure what the negative reviews were about. Went on Saturday night, called before, our Restaurant.com deal was accepted.  Service was great, is a BYOB place and immediately had our Dos (XX) Equis in a bucket of ice by the waiter (A+).  Food was nice, great mexican heat in the dishes.  Table behind us brought a bottle of Patron (A++) for drinks.  Would recommend and go again.
