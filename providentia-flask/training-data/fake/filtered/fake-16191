Came here with a friend on a busy loud friday night for dinner. I had a calamari salad which wasn't too pleasent because i thought the greens tasted a bit expired. the staff is nice and seem to have fun. we saw some waiters dancing and having fun. one of the hosts was parading around in a fancy white blouse and womens heels. we stopped him and told him he looked great, he said it was in honor of the royal wedding. after dinner he came back to our table and checked up on us and was very nice. i would come back on a slower night when its not so loud and not so packed
