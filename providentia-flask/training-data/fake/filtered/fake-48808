Have only eaten here, never been to the bar, but keep coming back for the seafood!  My wife loves the prime rib too, although its gotten smaller since the last time we were there.  I generally get the fried clams which are real clams (not the frozen variety) lightly breaded and yummy!  My mom got the scallops the other night and she got 9 or 10 HUGE scallops, the breading literally fell off and melted in your mouth, the scallops were juicy and wonderful, we enjoyed them for lunch the next day too.  Their Rhode Island Clam Chowder isnt my favorite.   Love the garlic butter though!!  Have never had to wait more than a moment for a table, we went there on a Friday night around 7pm, party of 6 and walked right in to a table!   Comprable to the shoreline restaurants, cheaper and more intimate
