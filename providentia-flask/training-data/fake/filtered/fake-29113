This place has to be my favorite lunch spot. I work in the capitol area so this is a quick walk from work and totally worth it. My favorite sandwich is the grown up grilled cheese. It was perfection. They recently changed it to the Miss Piggy and its just not the same. It is a tiny bit pricer than other lunch spots but so worth it for the best sandwiches Hartford's seen.
