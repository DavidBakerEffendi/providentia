If you want to taste the smoothest cappuccino this side of Italy, you have to come here.  The line is outside the door every weekend, and for very good reason.   They also make the best baguette sandwiches with the freshest ingredients, and my best friend and I joke that they must have a vegetable garden out back because the spinach is so crisp and filled with water that it squirts when you crunch down on it!  No kidding.  Try the salad with parmesan and artichokes.  It comes with the tastiest lemon vinaigrette imaginable. And get an extra cappuccino to go!
