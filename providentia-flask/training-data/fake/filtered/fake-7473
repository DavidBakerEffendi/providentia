I was pleasantly surprised over pretty much everything at Hudson Clearwater. Pretentious little entrance that tries to be anything but leads into a great little garden and a nice, laid-back restaurant with a great attitude and great food. The staff that looks like they were hired mostly because of their ridiculously  good looks caught me off guard by being knowledgeable, professional, and simply great. Amuse buche was delicious, a perfect little palate cleanser and absolutely unexpected. I had the skirt steak, which was cooked to perfection and while not being dressed up in a ton of stuff simply delicious. Sometimes the meat and produce should be allowed to do the talking, and the kitchen staff here are apparently good listeners. The only downside here were the cocktails, unfortunately, but a decent wine list and the surprisingly low prices in addition to everything else about Hudson Clearwater will ha  eme coming back for seconds and twentythirds.
