I'm new to New York...so I got on yelp hoping I could have some guidance to find a good restuarant to end my night.  Thank God for the internet because it led me to Ghandi's.  The food was spectactular!  I was originally going to go to an Applebees or Buffalo Wild Wings.  And am I glad I didn't.  Just like I read in the previous reviews, when I told the server I wasn't familiar with the menu...he directed me to what was good.  I had a curry dish...I asked to make it spicy and it was just right.  The garlic bread is the truth!  Will definitely be back.  Thanks again yelp!
