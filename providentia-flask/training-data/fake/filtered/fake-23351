Like others have said here, I'd rather have Pomme De Terre back but this place is good. It's nice to know we have a place to go for a reliably good burger. The other items that we've tried are good too but this is now our go-to burger place. Also love the Gaffel kolsch on tap and the chipotle ketchup. Don't like the TVs but I guess people demand them. I'd also like to see a burger with a brioche bun option...
