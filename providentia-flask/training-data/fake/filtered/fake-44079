I went for a dinner on a cold Thursday in January. It was cold inside but the food was delicious. We ordered an entree of roasted duck and a chicken panini with Caesar salad. It was all excellent. No complaints about the food or service. I just remember how cold it was inside. But then again we were having a deep freeze, so not sure it could be avoided.
