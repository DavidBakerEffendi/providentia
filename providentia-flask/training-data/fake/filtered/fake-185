First off I'm not from South Philly and I hate cheese wiz. I'm not in the demo and they did not have the quality of protein I look for in my cheesesteaks. I 99% of the time get a chicken cheese steak made with fresh breast meat and Swiss cheese and that was not an option. I'll never go back and you can include Pats.
