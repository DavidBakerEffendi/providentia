Usually we go to Pepe's, but it's not because we're ideologically opposed to Sally's. Often Sally's has been closed when we've wanted to try it. When the line at Pepe's was quite long the other night, we decided to try our luck at Sally's which was open. Bad idea. We waited outside for about an hour and a half before giving up. Our good spirits soured when, arriving just to the door and becoming first in line, two parties of four--apparently with reservations--were admitted before us. I asked the fella who was apparently the manager how long we'd still need to wait, and he said about fifteen minutes. Ok. Wish I'd known about the reservations, although apparently they've always taken them. But even the people who came in with reservations were waiting a little while. Wonder how that works. Anyway, 15 minutes might have been accurate, but we didn't wait to find out, because people inside--who had been admitted right when we got it into line the previous hour didn't have any pizza yet. (Oh, sorry, I meant "abizz" ...) Our solution? Takeout from Pepe's which was ready in 15-20 minutes.
