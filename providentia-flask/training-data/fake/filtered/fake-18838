Just went to High Street with my family for lunch. Although the food tasted good, my sister and I got terrible food poisoning from the broccoli salad. When we called the restaurant later to recommend that they stop serving the salad for the day, they said "I find that hard to believe" instead of apologizing or trying to help. The taste of the food was by no means worth the food poisoning, and High Street clearly does not value customers much. I will not be returning and I recommend no one else does either.
