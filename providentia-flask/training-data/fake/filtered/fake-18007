i was truly disappointed with the quality of food and price.  the pancakes were dry and we were charge an extra $0.60 per topping (banana, chips etc.) per pancake.  a bacon omlette cost $7.99 but if the bacon is on the side of the omlette, it's $5.99 for the omlette and $2.99 for the bacon.  they got their extra dollar out of me but i sure won't go back to be nickeled and dimed.
