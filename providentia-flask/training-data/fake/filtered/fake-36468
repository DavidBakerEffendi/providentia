This is definitely not the best tapas place i have been to. The price is extremely high for the portions of food that you receive. Also, the waiter tried to bully me into ordering the tapas all at the same time which i criticized politely, and continued drinking my wine. We ordered Jamon Serrano and we received a tiny plate which baby food portions of tiny sliced Jamon Serrano which takes away most of its prestige, that was for $25.00. We ordered Queso Manchego and we received 3 small pieces. The Baby squids are good. Croquetas de Bacalao was algo good, specially the cream that comes with them. One thing though, the desserts were phenomenal, good looking and tasty. I wouldn't recommend the place since it is too small ( you can barely move) and to pricey. This is not the real deal, its a trap.
