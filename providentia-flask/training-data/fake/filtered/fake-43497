My husband an I got a bacterial gastroenteritis infection from this restaurant.  We were horribly sick for a week. Finally got antibiotics when we realized in was not just a stomach virus.  I know for a fact that it was this restaurant because I know of  another couple who got sick here as well.  Don't go!!!!!
