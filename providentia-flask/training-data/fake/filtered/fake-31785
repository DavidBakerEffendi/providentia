I have been here 6 times now.  They have the best corn chowder anywhere.  To bad they don't serve it more often.  Bartenders and wait staff are excellent.  Great selection of beer on tap. The food has always been right on for us.  We aren't that picky, but when the service, food and atmosphere are good I will go back.
