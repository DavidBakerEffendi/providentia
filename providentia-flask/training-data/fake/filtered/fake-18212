FOH Staff = Excellent. Probably best in town. our water glasses were refilled many times. our server checked in on us appropriately. the hostesses did not forget about us while we were waiting and notified us as the status of our table a couple of times. First impressions - The salsa they give you is the smallest portion of salsa ever... my guess is its 1-2 tablesppons at most. I definitely don't mind a long wait if the food is worth it (like at Sushihana) however, the food at villalobos was lack luster at best.  I ordered 3 tacos - al pastor, tinga, and camarones.  the chicken in the tinga taco tasted like it was simmered in Campbell's tomato soup and was weirdly dry.  all of the tacos were dry. perhaps if they gave you a tiny bit more salsa we could have used that to. I wont be back. Casa Piquin blows this place out of the water (even with that strange smell).
