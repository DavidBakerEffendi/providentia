We did the Pat's and Geno's cheese steak challenge, since we saw mixed reviews on both.  We thought were both good and had characteristics unique to each.  Each had things we liked - Pat's had a lot more Cheese Whiz, the bread was soft and good, but did not hold together as well as Geno's.  Geno's was .50 more to add peppers, but had a lot more peppers then Pat's.  They did not have as much cheese on sandwich.  Their bread held together better, and seemed to have a butter drizzle on the outside which made it crispy.  Cherry peppers were great, but Hot!  PARKING was HORRIBLE!  Only street side, no lots that we saw.  No bathrooms that we saw, & outside seating.
