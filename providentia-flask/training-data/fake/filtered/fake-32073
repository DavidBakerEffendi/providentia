Kudos to my waiter; who never let me go thirsty, and was always ready to dive on to my table and pour me a cup refreshing, brisk, iced water.   More kudos to the immediate response SWAT team of the waiters who appeared on-sight and wiped away a fallen cup of water, and then immediately poured me another glass.   negs: tuna tartar dry. kamo namban soba (duck), contained high levels of fat. green tea crème brûlée was more liquified then gelatin like under the crust (not gelatin per se, but you get my point for the brulee appreciators) pros: never had an empty glass of water never allowed to go thirsty awesome maintenance team who straightened our uneven table great place to have water; refreshingly served continually
