Outstanding food, but be prepared to pay up. Get the hickory smoked pecans - they are unbelievably good.  Sometimes I dream about them and then wake up sad, because there are none in my apartment.  Other highlights were the cheese plate, bread service, shrimp and ribs. Ambiance is western, antique minimalist.  They are under an escalator (weird) but do a good job of carving out their own space. The prix fix menu is a heroic experience - if you can splurge, it is worth it. Cocktails are also very good.   Unfortunately it's expensive and won't be part of anyone's routine - but if you like a dinner experience you won't be disappointed.
