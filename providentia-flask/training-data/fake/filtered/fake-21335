When walking in we were greeted very warmly by staff, which in NYC seems to be somewhat rare these days. We ordered empanadas, arepas, and the flautas (sp?) for our apps. All of them hit the mark perfectly. For entrees, we ordered the bandeja paisa. The steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked. It's not a dish I would have normally gotten, but each component worked perfectly in tandem with the others, and it turned out to be an amazing dish. The jerk chicken was very flavorful and the chorizo rice that went along with it added a great touch to some of the best jerk chicken I've ever had. Â The entire staff was friendly, attentive, and very well informed of their menus. Everyone at our table was well taken care of, drinks refilled quickly, etc. We didn't feel rushed to leave, and we were able to really enjoy ourselves. In the end, what I think we all look for in a restaurant is genuinely pleasant service, a great environment that has a fresh and authentic vibe, and above all, great and fresh food that represents the concept that the restaurant is based on. Bogota gets top marks in all these categories.
