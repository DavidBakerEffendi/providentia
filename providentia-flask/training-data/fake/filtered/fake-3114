Omg I love love love love love this place, ive been there a few times well and just love it!!! I was even there lastnite. The wait was crazy but who cares, im even ordering dinner from there tonite!! Â Now can you say im a caban pete baby or wha. Love the staff and the vibes is just great!!! The servers are always friendly and nice unlike some restaurants that ive been to. After I pick up my dinner tonite I will be heading back there in two wks for my bridal shower.
