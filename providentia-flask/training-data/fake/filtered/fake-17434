We held a birthday party celebration here last week with 33 guests.  It went extremely well.  The pre planning could not have been easier as the staff was extremely accommodating and attentive to our needs.  Everything ran smoothly on the day of.  I highly recommend this restaurant for it's ambience, service, and quality of food.  Our guests loved it and so did we!!!
