This restaurant is simply amazing.  I LOVE the concept and have had the most incredible meals each time I have visited Feast.   First off, kudos to the ownership on the decor.  I wouldn't have done it different myself, and it's just a lovely place to sit and hangout for a few hours. The food...OMG.  If you order the "feast" the portions are small but mighty.  You'll be wondering if you're eating enough and then BAM, you walk out of there so contently stuffed you will wonder when and how it happened.  The food is just delicious.  They have already changed their menu once or twice since opening, which keeps me coming back for more to try their new inventions! Great beer and wine selection too!   I love, love, love this restaurant and am tickled pink that it's in my neighborhood.
