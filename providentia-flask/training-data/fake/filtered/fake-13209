Yumm! I live in town and love to go there. All the BBQ items on the menu are great. Â I love the Thai BBQ chicken. An entire half of chicken grill to perfection. I wish they would leave the chicken head on, lol!! :P After stuff yourself with this no head chicken, please.....please do yourself a favor, try the ginger napoleon. I can make it better because.......I can =P, however theirs is pretty damn good!!!!
