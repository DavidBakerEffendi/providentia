Some of these reviews are hysterical to read because some people clearly use this review section to bash a business solely cause of the look and "cleanliness". Lets be real here...the grimiest dives usually have the best food. To be honest, its not even a dive. Just saying. As far as this pizza goes...its about as authentic and NY style as youll get. The sicilian slice is hands down the best in the area. Solid flaky crust...nice sauce, not to salty and quality cheese. The place is overall the best pizza joint in town. Not to mention an italian actually cooks it. Dont listen to the clowns above. Top notch.
