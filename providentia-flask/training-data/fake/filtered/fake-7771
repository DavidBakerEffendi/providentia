My friends and I went to Geronimo's last night for dinner and were told that there was a 45 min to 1 hr wait for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar and wait.  In the meantime we had two drinks each and an appetizer.  After 1hr 15min, we checked with the hostess on the status of our table and she told us it would just be another 10-15 min tops.  We closed our bar tab and proceeded to wait.  We saw tables being cleared, and people that had arrived later than us being seated.  We checked once more with the hostess and she informed us that "something happened" and it would just be another minute.  Another 10 minutes later, our bartender noticed our irritation and we explained the situation...he immediately called the hostess and what seemed to be a manager over and we were seated at a table that was vacant for a good 20 minutes.  In addition to the fact that we waited nearly 2 hours for a table, our server was responsible for way too many tables, and our service suffered as a result. All in all a terrible experience, and I will never go back when in New Haven.  The food was even only so-so.  I got the Vegetarian Bounty Platter, and it was supposed to have a Three Sisters Tamale, and it had a Quinoa Chile Relleno.  While the Chile was good, I was disappointed about the lack of tamale.   On the bright side, the drinks were delicious.  I had the spicy passion fruit margarita.
