I must say I was thoroughly impressed with Dos Toros. Coming from SF I am always wary of places that claim they are "SF style" burrito places and then are just a glorified Chipotle. To start I loved the decor and feel inside with the background music and exposed walls. When I went, the place was packed and everyone seemed to stick around after their meal just chatting. That's my barometer of a cool spot or not. I ordered a carnitas burrito and a chicken soft taco. I was blown away by the quality of the meat and my ability to really taste all the elements in my burrito. The guac was ridiculously good and they definitely don't skimp on doling out a lot of it. The line can take a little long (which is a good sign of the quality) but I think as this place is open for a little while they will get faster. Foodie Boi XOXO
