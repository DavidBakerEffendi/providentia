The staff was incredibly nice, the lemonade tasty and the salads crunchy and flavorful. BUT The sauce was not flavorful at all and tasted like canned tomatoes.  The cheese was sparse and the pizza left us feeling unusually thirsty afterwards.  The crust was good, but had a bit of a burnt taste to it. I think with a few kinks ironed out and a stronger sauce recipe this place could be a contender.
