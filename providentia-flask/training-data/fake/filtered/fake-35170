I decided to stop by Rumbamba around 6:15 PM with the thought that since the Ay Arepa food cart on York Street was closing soon I would just stop by the restaurant and get the ingredients fresh. Big mistake! There was only one difference between my food cart fish arepa and the restaurant fish arepa - PRICE! While I can grab a fish arepa from the food cart for 6$, I was charged 13$ for a takeout fish arepa. The portion size was the same (good) and the flavors were the same (delicious!), however I now know that I should always choose the food cart above physical location. If you don't mind shelling out the extra money, the food is delicious. I can't speak to the dining conditions since my meal was takeout.
