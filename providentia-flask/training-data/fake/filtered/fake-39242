What a cute place this is! My friend has been craving avocado toast since the day we got to New York, and after seeing many, many instagrams of the avocado toast here at Cafe Gitane, we decided to come here for our last Sunday brunch together! The place looks very vintage with huge lantern like lights hanging from the ceiling, the seats and table very retro chic. The servers were wearing the cutest green dresses and were very attentive throughout. There are two locations of Cafe Gitane, one in Nolita, and the other at the Jane Hotel, which is the one we came too! Between the three of us we ordered the avocado toast ($7), the baked organic eggs in tomato cream sauce ($9), and the mozzarella panini with olive tapenade ($14). All three dishes were so different than the brunch I usually eat and absolutely amazing! The avocado toast was on sourdough bread with chili flakes and lime and was so creamy and delicious! It's also a super healthy way to start of your morning or good for a light snack, so if you are trying to diet or eat more healthy, try making this at home! The baked organic eggs were SO good, I've never had eggs in tomato sauce so that was something different. Note that the eggs were runny, so if you do not like runny eggs request them to cook it all the way through. The panini came with a side of greens and the olive tapenade was absolutely brilliant! There were alot more delicious items on the menu that I do want to come back and try but for now this was satisfying enough!
