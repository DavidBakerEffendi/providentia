I went here on a whim, not expecting much as I thought it was a typical fast-food style restaurant that I passed by several times on my way to nearby Shop Rite. Boy was I wrong!  The food here was absolutely delicious and so fresh! I had the chicken tikka wrap, hummus side dish, and Afghan lassi.  The prices were also very reasonable as they give you a good amount of food for your dollar. The hummus is so wonderful and authentic. They don't over-do it with garlic, like many other restaurants. The service is so pleasant as well. I'd definitely recommend checking this place out if you love Middle Eastern food.
