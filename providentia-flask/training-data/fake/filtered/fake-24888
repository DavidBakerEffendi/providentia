We had a party of 8, and decided to bring my own wine. I was not allowed to open, the restaurant had no corking fee as does nearly every restaurant in america. Mark up on the wine list was very significant and they could not match the wine I brought.  The service was slow and the meal was not outstanding.  I felt that restaurants should have corking fee as they do in every good restaurant group.
