Returning to NY where I grew up and hearing so many good things about BKLYN I asked my friend to take some somewhere that exemplifies the new brooklyn. We chose Buttermilk C and it did not dissappoint. Everything was spot on from the service to the cocktails to the menu. And, the staff is completely real. Would highly recommend this to anyone needing to entertain an out of town guest. Â I love a place where making a menu choice for yourself is a challenge because you don't want miss out on all the great items they offer.
