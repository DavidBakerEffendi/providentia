OMG .. i love this place!!!!!!!!!!!! I Visited my family in NJ- and I loved it ..!!  THE DRAGONFISH ROLL-- HEAVEN!!!!! and I LOOOOVE the Bar !!!!  Prices are cool.. and to take a date is Ideal--Whenever in town , I AM SOOOOOOO THERE !!!!  I come from California and know good Asian cuisine and My Exhusband was a Chef , so I am spoiled in that sense . So coming here I liked the atmosphere AND loved the awesome service that I got ! Look , in this Day and age , finding this kind of place is hard and rare .. IM GLAD I FOUND IT --!!
