I love this restaurant.   I am not a big pork person ... the taste has to be really subtle for me to be able to enjoy it.  The first time I had authentic ramen in Japan, the pork was so overpowering, I couldn't eat 2 bites.   But the ramen here was AMAZING.   I loved it.   The tastes were spot on and not overpowering.  And the buns?   To die for.
