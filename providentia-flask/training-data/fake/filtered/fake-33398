A few friends and I stopped here for sushi on our way back after a road trip to New York. It was truly a great experience. We were greated by a friendly and personable waitress who was very kind and helpful. After ordering our sushi, we were gifted soup and 6 pieces of sushi from the sushi chef, who even took time to say hello. All of the sushi was delicious, and very filling, for much less than we expected. I actually ended up picking up the tab, since it was only ~$20. Highly recommended, from someone who seldom reviews anything. I actually downloaded the yelp app just to review this restaurant.
