Bad service, raw food. First time and i will not go back. Bartender was the only positive thing. The server's were incredibly rude, and never came back to check on us. We ordered beef skewers and they were cold and raw! Since the server never came back, we asked for the bartenders assistance to alert the manager, who never came to say a word to us. Awful experience.
