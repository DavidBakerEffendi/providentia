Hudson Clearwater has gotten a lot of buzz over its "hidden" side door entrance, but it is so much more than that.  Walk into the stunning, oh so west village garden and up the stairs to the comfortable, candlelit restaurant where you are sure to have an unforgettable experience. Everything about the layout is so right.  They seem to get a lot of people in without making you feel crunched.  And though you feel the energy of the good looking crowd, it is definitely intimate and a great spot for a date. The food is perfect.  Portion size is right on and every ingredient fresh and well balanced.  We tried the lentil salad, Hake, Risotto, and the Chocolate-Banana desert and each bite toped the one before it.   Though I rarely repeat a restaurant, I would absolutely go here again!
