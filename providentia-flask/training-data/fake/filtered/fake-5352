We visited yesterday & the food did not disappoint. Not a smile to be found at the hostess stand...the greeter @ the door was very pleasant. Our waitress was efficient. We sat right down despite not having a reservation. The bread was fresh but tasteless. My kids were looking for warm bread! Lol We ordered calamari which was sizzling hot & tender...delicious. The drinks were good. We were too full to order an entree. Going back this weekend with my girlfriends.
