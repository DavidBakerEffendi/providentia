I am not a specialist of ramen but I am a big fun of ramen. I admit that I have tried the hundreds of ramens so far. For me, totto ramen was not acceptable. First of all, chicken ramen is very weird and I can't even imagine to try it. I tried spicy ramen and I just found they only added much chili oil. Spicy ramen was too oily and tasted awful though I love the chili oil. I assume the chili oil they use does not have a high quality. Besides, my friend tried Miso ramen and I also tasted it but I just found the noodle was overboiled. My friend and I have waited for 1 hour to enter this place at 10 p.m but I should say that it was simply not worth to do so.
