Okay, here It is. Went to Grimaldi's and the line was way too long. Yelped a few places and found reviews for Â Peppino's. Read a review about the place and decided to take my party of five to Park Slope. WOW. We started with bruschette and a mozzarella appetizer. Then we got some pizzas and pastas. Vodka and margerita pie were amazing. Fusilli were amazing and i really enjoyed the orecciette pasta dish. All the food was tasty and the service was great. I would highly reccomend this place, quality food at the rite price. Peppino's is my new spot.
