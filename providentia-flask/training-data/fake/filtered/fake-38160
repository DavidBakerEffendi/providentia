I love this place. Their breakfast is amazing. You get so much for your money. I love that when you walk in, even though the line is long, a staff member tells you not to worry, they will find your table for you. So you don't have to worry about getting a table waiting in line. Everyone is really friendly. This place seems like out a different city, like Boston or Baltimore, where value is still important and service is still a thing. Again, you get so much for your money. No tiny plates here.
