This place = major disappointment. I can't imagine how any place could take a delicious thing like a fry and turn it in to something gross. THEY ONLY SELL FRIES AND THEIR FRIES ARE TERRIBLE. Soggy, irregularly cut, black spotted fries. How anyone finds this to be acceptable blows my mind. Fast food fries are better than this.
