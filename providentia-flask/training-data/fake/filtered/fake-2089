I got here early on a Saturday morning, found it to be just how i wanted: no line, a table available, pleasant atmosphere ! The service was friendly and on point. The food is straight forward and good. No funny garnishes, nothing to mask or hide the main dishes. Great Kale Salad, Lovely and delicious Fuji Apple Mimosa, great Sausage Egg and Cheese sandwich. The coffee is delicious too! I live a few blocks away and this is going to be a go to spot every other week. There are small booths along the back but i think it is best to sit by the window.
