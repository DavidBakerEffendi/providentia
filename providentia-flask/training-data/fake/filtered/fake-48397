Ok... full disclosure.   I'm not a native Philadelphian but I have been known to chow some cheesesteaks.   Everyone tells me that I need to forget Gino's and goto Pat's.   I really, really wanted to be impressed but at the end of the day...  meh????    Not bad but definitely not a joint i would drive an hour to get to.
