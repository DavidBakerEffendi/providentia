I have only been there once and it definitely would be my last time in that restaurant.    Their sweet-and-sour soup tastes like a soy-sauce soup, vegetable looks like a gooey stuff and pork is whatever you name it.  Probably on that specific day, the chef was replaced by a first-day-at-work apprentice ; however, I am not going back to this restaurant any more.
