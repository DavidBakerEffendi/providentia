I love this place because it doesn't make me feel bad about eating fast food. Meals range from $5-10. They have vegetarian and vegan options, which makes me happy. Also, the cashier (who is always there) is classy and attractive. It's also good for moderately sized groups (10-15), because it's cheap and you can be loud.
