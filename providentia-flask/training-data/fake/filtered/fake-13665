Dinner here is really amazing. The decor and ambience is very nice. i recently went for happy hour on mondays, the mojitos were the best ive had in a while and the appetizers were delicious!! the bartender was really Â nice and friendly. of course you can't beat the $5 drink and app deal. great to get over the monday slump : )
