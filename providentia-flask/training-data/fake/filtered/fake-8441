Oldest bar in Philly - just an FYI. If you are visiting here it is worth the stop just to say you have been there. As a local it is just OK - it is an average dive bar. Cheap pitchers are a plus. The food is good. Solid place to grab some beers and lunch/early dinner with some friends. As for the nightlife Â - karaoke nights here are pretty damn fun. It draws a great crowd and every time I go I have a great time. Get there early if you want a table! If there is no karaoke I do not suggest this place - it can get packed, there is no dance floor and limited space to move. There is only a juke box on the 2nd floor so unless you are picking A+ songs all night you are screwed listening to some a-holes choice in music (it can be painful). If you are looking to stand in a group, not move, and drink some beers this is your spot. If you are looking to listen to good music, dance, and meet a hot guy/girl go somewhere else.
