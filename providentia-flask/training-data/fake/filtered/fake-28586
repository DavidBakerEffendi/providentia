I really don't get the hype.  Maybe my expectations were too high or maybe I should have ordered the calzone, but for a pie this pricey, I expected something spectacular.  Having said that, these are my overly critical, yet merited, problems with Giuseppina's: The pizza tasty, but lacking in flavor in spite of the $6 marinated artichokes atop the pie.  I anticipated the pie would be overpriced (let's be real, it's dough and sauce and a half dozen slices of cheese), but for a $6 topping I anticipated the pie would come with more than 2 thinly sliced, baby artichoke hearts.  With my eyes closed I wouldn't have know they were even there.   As far as the pizza basics - dough and sauce - I also found this pie to be a disappointment.  The crust was thin, which is fine, but even a thin crust should have *some* bite or chew to it.  This crust was so thin it crumbled when I picked it up.  Yes, I've had pizza in Italy with crust this thin and crispy, but I don't believe Giuseppina's is going for the cracker-style crust.  Maybe I'm wrong.   Sauce and cheese?  Fine but unmemorable.  I'd say more but I honestly can't recall specific qualities of either.  All in all, I didn't take one bite that  made me go "oh my god, that's great!," or even "mmmm."  Admittedly, had the pie been half the price, I would probably find fewer faults, but one has gotta justify a $25+ pie when Luigi's a block away makes a pie that's twice as large and half the price.  And yes, Luigi's uses the EXACT same ingredients.
