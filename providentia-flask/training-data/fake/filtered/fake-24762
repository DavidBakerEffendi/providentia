Can a restaurant really get 4... or even 5!!! stars due to a corn on the cob? Well, in my opinion no.  But - it would be 2 if it wasn't for the corn in my book, so it is as good as advertised.  Then again, put that much butter, lime, and spice on a nerf football and eat it and it's bound to taste nearly as good. This place is one of those "trendy" places where people like to say they've been... the food is neither Cuban or Mexican.  It's not bad, and it's not expensive, but it's not great food either. The corn is delicious.  If takeout didn't take 45 minutes, I would eat it more often. The cuban sandwiches are pretty good as well... and the plates not half bad.  But, I just can't get over how painfully popular this place is when the food just isn't all that.  There are places I am willing to wait to eat at... but this just isn't one of them. In any case, I'll give it a 3....and I'm going to take a nap now.
