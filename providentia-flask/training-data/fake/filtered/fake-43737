Probably one of the worst dining experiences in my life! I have dined all over the world in top restaurants,   The food here overall was fine, however management of this restaurant should be fired!  Several of our tapas orders were never delivered or came very late.  They have a wine flight on the paper menu that we were abruptly and curtly told was no longer available.   The worst was when we ordered dessert, the waitress took our order and then two minutes later the manager came and said we need the table for someone else, ignored our order completely and handed us the check!  We did arrive 20 minutes late due to traffic (and called!) but really!  When we complained about it, the managers were very rude, uninterested and totally unprofessional.   I have never experienced such poor customer service. We were a party of 9 with a $700 food bill in less than 2 hours and the managers showed no remorse whatsoever that we were dissatisfied.  In fact, they laughed and seemed to enjoy themselves.  We asked for the owner's name to let them know how their managers are treating folks, and we were told that they wouldn't share that.  I rarely write a negative review, but feel passionate that in this day and age where so many are out of work, this should not go unnoticed.
