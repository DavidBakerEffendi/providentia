Just ate at this wonderful Â new Argentinean-Italian Restaurant in West Chelsea. Most everything was really tasty. From the silky pea soup,to the divine Risoto served with a bone full of luscious marrow, to the thick and tender pork chop dressed with Malbec and Honey. The Wine was also very fine. They just opened,so it is a breeze to drop in without a res. The prices are so reasonable for such quality!
