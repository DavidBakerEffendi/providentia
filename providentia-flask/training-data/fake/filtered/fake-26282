My family were lucky!!!! We arrived as the door was being opened after their closing! This food is Thai Food which sets a standard for the entire area---including New York City. My son drives to Hamden from Manhattan to eat there. The Terrace has been rebuilt following an accident. Â (rammed by a car) The interior is exactly what the original needed! If you don't know Thai Food or have been to other "Bests" you must savor the food at the Terrace! Harold S
