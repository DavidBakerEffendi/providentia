had reservations @ 5 on Sunday which is a good time on wknd. Everything started out good but the waiter Â was quite annoying.The presentation wasn't too bad however after each food plate was delivered the waiter would come over and ask how the plate was? Well,give us time to get one piece in our mouth first! For some reason he felt our conversation would,nt survive without his little comments and questions. Personally, I like to dine and converse with family and friends without constantly being interrupted. I was enjoying the last morsel on my salad plate as the waiter stood Right next to me waiting for me to hurry so he could grab my plate.Anoying! We were finally finishing up our deserts and ,once again, he procedes to stand there and ask how is it. Mouth full, I just looked @him and he just stood there as though we were enjoying his annoying tactics. All said and done, wasn't that great of an Expensive meal! I understand service with a smile, but Really,there is that fine line of Good Service and simply being in our face! wont be back!
