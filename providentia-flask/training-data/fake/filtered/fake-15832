Juniors was a fantastic place to eat before attending the Mary Poppins Show. The pricing was very reasonable and the open-face roast beef sandwich became my all time favorite. Their dessert menu was impressive - I had the red velvet cake which I would highly recommend to others, and my boyfriend had the chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Overall, I would have given Juniors 5 - stars but the staff wasn't as friendly as expected and it seemed a little to crowded for my liking.
