Yeah they need to work on their menu, which is weird. I'm surprised that anyone really hated Emporio, tho, but not very surprised that people didn't really like it. I guess some are pickier than others. But I agree that the food is pretty "Meh. I've experienced better." I was there on a slow night so maybe that helped. But we got the fried squash blossoms and they were super, super oily. My friend said we should call the EPA and report the oil spill... lol. Okay, that's lame, but if there were any wildlife around, I would've been concerned. I'm just sayin. The rest of the meal was just totally forgettable. I would describe it as... just pasta. Meh, meh. meh.
