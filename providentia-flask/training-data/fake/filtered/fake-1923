AWFUL.I have never written a review before but my experience at this place was so bad i felt i had to.I Wish you could give minus stars. I understand a new place will have some kinks to work out but this place was beyond belief..Ordered our food at 4pm did not arrive till 5.15pm.Way over priced and not very good, $28 for 2 crab cakes which looked old, no side or garnish.You can buy a better Â at Fairway for $4.The steam pot was not what i expected for $48 dollars ,did not seem fresh and was just dropped on the table no waste basket or hand wipes...So many staff but no one seems to know what there doing.Even the beer was warm.I have watched this place be built and wished it a lot of success but i just left there feeling ripped off.
