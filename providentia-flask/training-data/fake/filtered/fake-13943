My husband and I had a very enjoyable meal at Barbuzzo, but we had to yell directly in one another's ear, seated right next to each other at the bar, to hear each other. Barbuzzo is *incredibly* loud, even on a Wednesday night being seated at 9pm. So despite the scrumptious octopus, wonderful fresh cheese, and lovely mushroom and pesto pasta, we won't be going back. The restaurant was packed (literally - the tables are inches apart), and some may find that "cozy" or "intimate." But intimate to us means that we are able to have a conversation without being distracted by diners at adjoining tables yelling at each other. It's such a shame we'll have to look elsewhere for that because the food at Barbuzzo is really good.
