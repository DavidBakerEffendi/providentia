I have nearly nothing bad to say about Applewood!!  My husband and I discovered it the second year we lived in the Slope, and took any special occasion to go there.  Eating locally and sustainably is very important to us, so it was great to find a nice restaurant that had it's values in check.  As other reviews have said, the menu changes with what is available and in season, but they always present something creative and delicious.  Both brunch and dinner were always amazing...serving great local and/or organic wines, and really fun mixed drinks or cocktails.   If it's important to you, the decor is really cute and can be described as a understated "country" or french country theme.  It's very subtle, but nice to be transported out of the city for a meal.  There's also a very small outdoor space with 3 or 4 two seater tables that are nice if you're lucky enough to snag one when the weather's good.   The only downside to Applewood is it's popularity.  For brunch on Saturdays and especially Sundays, lines and crowds form around the entrance of people waiting for tables.  Kinda kills the ambiance for those seated outside, but everyone there knows they're waiting for good food.
