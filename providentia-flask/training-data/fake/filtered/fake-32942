My friends and I have been here a couple times for lunch. First things first, LOVE the calamari and The Margarita pizza (even tough I couldn't finish it.) The staff are always friendly and helpful. Decor was good and the serving sizes were generous.it seems pricey but it is very worth it. I can't wait to go back! Maybe this time I'll actually have room for dessert.
