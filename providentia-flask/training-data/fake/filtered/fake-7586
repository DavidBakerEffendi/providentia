My girlfriend and I went here for lunch today. WOW! The food was amazing! We shared a small salad (which by the way we could not finish) that had apples, dried cranberries and fig dressing. It was delicious. Then we each got a panini (which we could have easily split, they are huge). We didn't even have to split a salad because the sandwiches come with a very small side salad but the dressing on it is so good. They are huge sandwiches. For a dessert we got a large Iced Cappuccino. So GOOD! They put the foam and cinnamon on top. Another great part is it was beautiful outside so we sat outside which was great because I had my one year old with me. She could laugh and scream as loud as she wanted and no one could say anything. :)
