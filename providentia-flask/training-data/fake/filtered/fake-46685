I ordered the Tavuk Izgara special (char-grilled breast of free-range chicken, served with rice pilaf) the other day as a take-out lunch. Everything was very good and perfectly seasoned, including the rice which I'm still craving two days later. I'm sure I'll be back to try something new off their (not to mention, reasonably-priced) menu.
