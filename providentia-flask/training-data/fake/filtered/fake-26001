McGov's is one of my favorite places in the world. Mo, Katie, and Mike are awesome. The food is exceedingly high quality and cheap, always hot, always good. And McGov's is where I met the love of my life, Yeungling. The burgers are memorable, but the lava fries, the chili fries, the chicken fingers, and pretty much everything is good, too. The lava fries are signature to my mind. For some reason, even the motz sticks seem better at McGovern's. Of course, lots of people from Rutgers in the bar at all times, many law students drinking away the pain of their ambitious life decisions. It gets lively at times, but in my experience there is no way to predict when. You can walk into the place in the middle of the day and it's packed. You can show up on Friday night and its empty. The juke is usually playing, but they turn the sound up for some games (a modest projection big screen). It's a friendly, cozy place that has been a great comfort to me.
