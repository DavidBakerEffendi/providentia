wow!  as a born and raised argentinian, i'm always looking for places that are going to give me a taste of home.  getting the beef empanada, a staple, right is the way to measure the quality of an empanada maker...  stella scored a maradonian goal with her!  amazing taste!  the price is right and you get a free drink if you buy 3 and eat in; i ended up taking 6 to go.  for speed, i had them fried but, if you have the time (or you order ahead), get them baked.  more authentic that way.  i'll be going back as often as i can for the also very authentic milanesas.   i've been looking for a place like this for a long time.
