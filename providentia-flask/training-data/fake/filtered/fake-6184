I recently had my baby shower there and it was a beautiful day and I have no regrets except for the fact that I had to deal with the manager/owner's wife.  Not only did she double book our room but when my mother arrived early to the party to make sure everything was set up to her dismay it was not.  The request was for 8 tables and only 5 were set up.  Luckily the staff was very helpful and fixed the problem, but after the party dealing with the manager was a nightmare.  Not only did she not apologize for double booking but she proceeded to tell us our party went fine and was NOT ruined.  I don't remember asking for her opinion but we sure did get it.  My main issue here is we spent a good amount of money that day to have a nice party and were treated like crap.  Because of her I will never step foot in Nicola's again and hopefully this review also helps other who are thinking of planning a party.  I did feel very strong about the poor service from her that I had to just write this as I don't think I ever took time out to review anything before.  Hopefully she reads this and learns a lesson that customer satisfaction is very important and not to treat people like they are beneath you!
