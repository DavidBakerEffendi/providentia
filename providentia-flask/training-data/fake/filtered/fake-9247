They don't really know how to cook. This is the only Chinese restaurant I have ever visited that changes their chefs every couple days. So don't expect great food because the chefs are always different. Food quality changes all the time due to it. Sometimes alright, sometimes nah. Delivery is alright, the drivers are friendly but sometimes slow as hell, but seriously the food is bad and the cashiers don't speak much English. A couple days ago, I ordered some fried rice and cheese wantons but I found a fly in my large chicken fried rice. I wanted to go back, but I thought it would be better to give them a call first, but they were rude telling me that it might be my problem, I mean, what the X? They sell bad food but I was ok with that because I live near them, but seriously, I am somehow their old customer, and they treated me this way, well. They deserve this bad rating.
