Kimchi is great, Sushi is the best I can find between NY and Cape May NJ, Beef bulgolgi is perfect. The do give a small dish of rice but if you want more, just ask and you shall receive. Not strictly a Korean restaurant, so you will not get all the little side dishes in the beginning. Had them make a whole platter of sushi for my son's birthday. It was a huge hit. Definitely the best in the Princeton area,,, by far. Pricier than you average, but in this case you get what you pay for and the taste is consistent.
