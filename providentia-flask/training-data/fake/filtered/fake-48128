We went to Osteria Morini for an early dinner, Birthday celebration, and although we did not have a reservation we were seated quickly. The staff was very attentive, we ordered the Battilardo di Affettati which was excellent, plentiful the meatballs (excellent) and the Insalta Mare which was good along with a Red Gutturnio wine which complemented the meats dish selected. We took our time eating and no one rushed us during our stay. We then ordered from the main menu the Branzino (very good) along with two pasta dishes which were very small for the price (how expensive is pasta) and a bit salty. The pasta was very good in taste but the small size plates and the extra salt was a distraction in a restaurant that is known for pasta ( the kitchen should always taste the food to insure that the sauce is not salty). For desert we had the MERINGA ALLA SPUMONE meringue, cherry-lambrusco sorbetto, pistachio gelato, chocolate crema, amarena cherries (Excellent!!!) and complemented with very good espresso coffee. Overall a very nice dinning experience although a bit expensive when you factor in the small pasta portions.
