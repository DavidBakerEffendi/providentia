We don't normally go back to the same restaurant twice because there are so many good restaurants in the city. But, Morini is exceptional. Our first visit a few months back was wonderful.  We were there today for our anniversary celebration.  Who needs bread  when you have the best handmade pasta in the city!? And yeah, it was a bit noisy but that's the pulse of this great city. Our server, Heather, ws extremely accomodating, efficient and knowledgable.  But the food was -to die for. My husband had tagliatelle bolognese and the porchetta. Both were excellent, the porchetta was so flavorful and melted in your mouth. I had cappelletti with buttter, truffle and prosciutto-just like my Nonna's! Yes, I am Romagnola and understand and appreciate their dishes! We also shared a stracci pasta with porchini sauce-yum!!!  The Battilardo was an excellent start with an outstanding prosciutto and lardo.  The portions, by the way , were very generous.  The chef also surprised us with tortellini in Brodo-delicious!  And that's not all! We were further surprised with a yummy dessert of vanilla ice cream layered with chocolate pudding  and meringe cookies with a lit candle!!!!! It was a very enjoyable celebration and we will be back for more!!!!   Maddi B. C.
