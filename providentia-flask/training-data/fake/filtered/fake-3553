Taking the time out of my Birthday- will not go back I have never given a bad review for a restaurant, specially on my Birthday. We decided on going to Buttermilk because of all of the reviews. Pros: My gin cocktail was good. Cons Food: Over priced Chicken! We order the Chicken & Waffles $25 a plate, and of course cornbread along with two drinks. We got our plates, which had three big pieces of chicken HALF a waffle, coleslaw and a little cup with maple syrup. The corn bread was dry ad had no flavor. The Chicken was flavorless as well and RAW, yes raw. I waived down what appeared to be the manager and informed her that my chicken was raw. She didn't apologize at all and just said ok. She went and showed it to our server who took it back to the kitchen. I've had this happen to me before in other restaurants no biggie, they usually bring back an entire new plate or piece of meat. Well not Buttermilk, they just put my bitten chicken into the fryer again and brought it back to me, without the curtesy of an apology. By the way the rest of my chicken was pink as well. Service: On top of not being apologetic, they didn't even Comp a portion of my plate at all. I Pretty much didn't eat after they brought me back my half bitten chicken. That was pretty nasty. Our server came by to see if I wanted my food to go and I said no just the check. Which came out to $78.39 she didn't even give us time or asked how was the food before she immediately took the check. Terrible service, it was almost like we should be honored to eat at their restaurant. Which was kind of empty, so I don't know why they rushed our food. I will never go back to this place. I would much rather take a trip to Pies and Thighs.
