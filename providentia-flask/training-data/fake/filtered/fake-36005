Really excited about having a new joint in the neighborhood that does pizza and mussels, two of my favorites! Â And does them well. The space is really pretty. I just wish they had booze. I heard they have a backyard. Didn't see it the night I was there, but my waiter said they'd only been open two days, so maybe they're still working on it. All and all, a really nice addition to the neighborhood.
