I'm giving three stars only for the fact that our first experience was during Valentine's Day dinner and, overall, it was a positive experience. The space is cool without pretension and the staff were very friendly and helpful despite the rush. My date had the lobster prepared three ways and was happy; however, my cassoulet was salty to the point that I could only comfortably finish half the dish. The chocolate desert hit the spot. Â  We're definitely looking forward to visiting again when it's not so busy.
