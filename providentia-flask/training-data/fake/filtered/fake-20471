My terrible experience at Zahav I spent a little over $200 hundred dollars on my  my anniversary dinner.  It was a spare of the moment plan so we did not have reservations.  We were seated at the bar.  The food was great and the bartender was nice until his friends got there.  Then the dark haired hipster  and his friends started to drink and take shots while he continued to ignore us.  Then he goes on to talk about detailed sexual encounters and joke about sticking his penis in between his legs and go trolling for guys.  Thanks my girlfriend and I love to spend money to hear scum talk about this stuff. It was so close to being a great night for us too. I called the manager the next day to complain.  He was a little taken back when I described happened and told me he would get back to me that night.  I told him I am not trying to get anyone fired but I was so mad I didn't know what else to do.  Of course I never heard anything. I just want to say thanks allot for embarrassing yourselves and I am really glad I spent money hang out with rude people who talk about disgusting stuff.  Oh Also thank you to the excellent management for such great customer service and follow-up. Please forgive my grammar I never wrote a review before but I am so disgusted with this place.
