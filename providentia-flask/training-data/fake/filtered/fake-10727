We have frequented Saray for about 18 months.  We ALWAYS get the mixed appetizer.  It is phenomenal--fresh and tasty.   Just a note that although the dining area is very comfortable and perfect for couples and families--they also serve take-out so you can dine in the comfort of your own home.  If you have not tried Saray--go today--you will not be disappointed!
