I sat at the bar and had an appetizer (grilled sardines) and a main course (a vegetable tagine or stew) that were served piping hot and were eye-opening delicious. The spacious restaurant's decor is particularly handsome and was a welcome relief from the hot, crowded street. The only phoned-in thing was the bartenders, who seemed efficient enough, but lacked any apparent interest in engaging with the customers over the drinks or food.
