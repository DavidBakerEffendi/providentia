Love this place! My girl friends and I come to the city two sometime three times a year for quality girls time and we frequent the Saigon Shack each and every time since we discovered it four years ago! We love it so much we plan where we stay around this place and come back for at least two of our meals if not more! Â Can't say enough good things about it. love their fresh drinks, vietnamese coffee, spring rolls, vietnamese sandwiches, pho...the list goes on and on..
