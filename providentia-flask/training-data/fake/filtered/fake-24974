I first discovered Vanessa's up the block from my place and fell in love with their low prices and great eats. I've been going for nearly 7 years, but lately their quality has diminished. The foods just not as good, and the people behind the counter have lost their touch. Food used to be so delicious you couldn't stop eating and the people behind the counter were swift while catering to large crowds. No more. Waits are not unusual at Vanessa's but while on my lunch break today, i ordered and waited patiently... until i looked over the counter and realized my order was complete and just sitting there almost 30 minutes getting soggy. Only when I said something about all the other numbers being called, did one woman look at the receipt, and say "112". I'm sorry but I cant afford to be late back to work and have my food be shit. Today was the last straw of many. Â I considered myself a loyal customer over the years and always left a good tip. Oh well, win some, lose some. I'll have to walk a little further, but plenty of other dumpling houses in Chinatown that appreciate their locals.
