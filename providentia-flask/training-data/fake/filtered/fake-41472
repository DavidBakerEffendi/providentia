This was amazing cuban food! We were a party of six and we had the following selections of the menu... As appetizers we had the ham croquettes, tamales, and codfish fritters. As entrees we had the breaded pork steak, cuban sandwiches, ropa vieja, and the ox tails. For dessert we had the spanish coffee that was to die for, and the flan and bunuelos. All of the dishes were spectacular and the server was very gracious and attentive, even throwing in a few corny jokes which made us feel right at home. The check came out to about $113 for the six of us and we all left the place waddling out with unbuttoned pants. I have to say that  I found Nothing, Nothing, Nothing wrong with this restaurant. From the food to the atmosphere to the service, I give it FIVE STARS and wish I could give it more.   M.M.
