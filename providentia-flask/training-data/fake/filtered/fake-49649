We celebrated a friend's bridal shower here and the staff was so accomodating and attentive to our needs.  They let us stay there for hours, even after the place emptied out.  They were never pushy, took lots of group pictures for us, and gave excellent service.  And the food- well it speaks for itself- so worth every cent!  Will go back again and recommend to friends.
