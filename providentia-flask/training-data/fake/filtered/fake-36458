If you want to be treated like crap go to Casa Mono.  I went last Friday night at 6:00 pm (in the summer!).  There were very few tables taken and the bar was completely empty.  I was told by the rude hostess that you had to eat a full dinner in order to sit at the bar.  I was intending to eat dinner so that was not a problem.  I went to sit down and she informed me that I could only sit if my full party was here.  I was waiting for one friend that would be there in 10 minutes.  I was not allowed to sit at the bar and have a glass of wine until she arrived.  The bar was completely empty!  As I was walking out I heard the hostess telling another party of 2 that they would have to leave their table by 7:30 because they had another reservation.  Appalling service.  No food is worth being treated like this.  I had similar treatment at babbo so sadly, I guest this is how Mario runs his restaurants.  Fortunately the night was saved...I walked just a few yards down Irving to The House and met my friend for a lovely dinning experience.
