Horrid!  Called told 35-40mins was an hr before food was delivered. .. they forgot 2 slices of pizza. The girl who answered phone, Janice, was very nasty and rude...no manners!   We ordered an Italian hot dog no ketchup ....guess what they put ketchup so we called back. We were met with same rude person. .... waited another hour for forgotten and corrected food! Should fire the teenagers and Janice. .. won't be ordering from here again!
