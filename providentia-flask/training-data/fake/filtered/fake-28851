As the weather cools down and the nights get longer the body and the soul craves some comfort food. Yet as someone who spends hours at the gym, I don't want to walk out of a restaurant with that sense of guilt that so many of us experience after a sinful meal. The restaurant is small but its an ideal place to run into to have a quick meal while enjoying the trendy design. As I looked out into the diverse crowd that can so often be mesmerizing to watch out of the window of the restaurant, I dug into my steamy hot potatoes on a chilly afternoon just as Halloween was setting in. Potatopia is a perfect combination of a comfort/health food that can still leave a girl feeling like she looks good and feels good, even with a belly full of potatoes (yes its possible, just order the right stuff!). I got the baked potato with oil instead of butter and loaded with plenty of veggies and grilled chicken, don't forget the garlic which pairs great with the potatoes. The red roasted pepper sauce was to die for and the perfect "cherry on top" to my yummy meal. The ingredients have strong flavors paired with a hot potato and a crispy skin seems just like the prefect combination of texture and flavor.
