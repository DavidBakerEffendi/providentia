Saw this place on TV, so I decided to visit while in Philadelphia.  The food was horrible!  They give you very little meat, which turned out to be a good thing because it was awful.  All these travel shows showcasing this place could not have actually ate there, because they would not be advertising it as one of the best.  If you want a real cheese steak, or even a tasty one, go elsewhere.
