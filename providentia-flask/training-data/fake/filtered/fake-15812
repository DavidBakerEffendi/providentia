I came here with my boyfriend on a Tuesday night. We had tickets to a show at 7 and we got to Juniors at around 6:15, so we were in a hurry. We only waited for a little while before being seated. The waitress was really nice and was able to help me find a item on the menu that accommodated my wheat allergy. She was also understanding about us being in a hurry and gave us our check right when our dinner came. Â Overall our experience was great and the food was good.
