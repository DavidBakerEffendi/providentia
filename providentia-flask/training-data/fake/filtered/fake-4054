I was a regular at the restaurant as soon as it opened. lunch or dinner became a routine. my favorite thing on the menu has to be the shawafel. great customer service, and the food was the best mediterranean food I have had in new haven. I have yet to try their personal pizza, but from what I see I think It'll be my new addiction. a great atmosphere and a convenient place to get food. being a college student in downtown and only a limited time between classes stops you from going to any other place because of the crowds. But at pitaziki even with the crowds you'll be in an out of there faster than you can say tzatziki.
