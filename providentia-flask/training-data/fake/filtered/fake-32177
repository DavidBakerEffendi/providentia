absolutely loved it pasta was delicious and not pricey at all had chicken rigatoni in pink sauce and it was amazing pouched salmon with broccoli looked great Â as well you have to serve yourself (pour water, get olive oil and bread) but it's definitely worth it the only downside is the seating, only 8 seats are available
