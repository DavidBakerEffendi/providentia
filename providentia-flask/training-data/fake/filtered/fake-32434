Best sandwich I have ever had in my life. Â Mostly due to the toasted bread but the other ingredients like the meats such as prociutto and the mozzarella cheese are amazingly fresh and tasty. Place is small, not that comfortable and the service is OK but the sandwiches outweigh all of that enough to still give it five starts.
