Great pizza!  It's amazing how all the pizza here in NJ / NY just so rarely fails. Not to take it for granted!. If this place were in the middle of Kansas, i would give it a 5 star. But becuase every other place in NJ / NY is about the same, I give it a 4.  But I especially like their large selection. They had some good vegetable Pizzas. And one that my friend liked a lot, the 4 sausages pizza.  And their all types of mushroom pizza is to die for for mushroom lovers. :-)
