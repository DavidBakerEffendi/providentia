4.5 stars.Sri(pronounced "si-pa-phai", R's are silent) is undoubtedly the best Thai restaurant in a 2-mile radius, with serious competition from Zabb(if you're more into Esam specialties). I used to pass by this place all the time during middle school and high school, and only after reading excellent reviews online ( after my backwaters-of-Asia farmer family decided to get internet, thus ending the household Dark Ages) Â did I venture into Sri. My regular dishes are the shrimp paste fried rice, papaya salad (don't skimp on the spiciness, it's all flavorful heat), duck curry, pad thai, ground meat+basil combo, catfish salad, coconut ice cream (in a coconut shell with umbrella!fancy) with palm seeds and peanuts...err, pretty much every dish is a hit. Check out the display cases in the front for lot of great to-go Thai desserts and pastes/meat products(they smell like a week-old corpse but are soo good) for just $2-$4. I'm taking off half a star only because Sri doesn't deliver :( and doesn't accept cards (still?!!!). Most items on the menu run from $5-$20, but I've never had to spend more than $10-$12 here per person, and portions are pretty generous (and I'm a big eater). I'm pretty cash-strapped nowadays so I generally visit for special occasions, but Sri has a formal-casual atmosphere that is great for dates, family meals, holidays, even solos. They're closed on Wednesdays, so plan reservations accordingly. Absolutely worth the trek to (the highly underrated and actually kind of charming) Woodside. Check it out!!
