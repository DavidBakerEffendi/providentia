Honestly this place keeps me coming back for more! I love the egg sandwich (been addicted ever since the first time) lol they have in the mornings and almost all the plates during dinner. Why I say almost and not all is because I haven't tried them all but I am going to. So far i haven't been disappointed. Great place!
