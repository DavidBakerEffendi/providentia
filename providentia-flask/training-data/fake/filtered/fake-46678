Adequate nothing mindblowing.  It is not that expensive though and its always reliable and you can sit outside on a nice summer night which of course is key.  Its always packed and sometimes you have to wait but my GF loves this place for whatever reason and I am not going to argue.  Get there early if you want something like the grilled fish or chicken because yeah they do run out, its that busy here.  Me I for for the bread and hummus which they always have of course.  They pour a decent glass of wine and the service is pretty good so its a regular place for us but mostly out of habit.  Id woudl try other places but the GF think otherwise.
