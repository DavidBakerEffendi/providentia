A couple of years ago on a cold February evening , I was to meet some friends of mine at Amy Ruth's.  I got there before my friends did.  I asked if I could get the table,and wait for my friends because they were in route.  I was told by the Manager, "no" I could not be seated.  I asked if I could wait inside for them because it was very cold and windy at least 20 degrees or so.  I was terribly cold..  I was told I could not wait inside.  I could not believe that.  I was forced to wait in the cold and wind for my friends, who came one by one between 15 and 20 minutes later.  In the meantime, I was sooooo cold and sooooo angry!  I told them, that they knew how cold it was an how inhumane it was to make someone stand outside in that whether, and because I was with the media I was going to lodge a complaint.  The next day, I was sick as a dog with a terrible cold.  I had come in from out of town and had to delay my trip back home.  I told them their customer service is terrible to say the least and that I woul never return.  I couldn't even enjoy the food because I still shivered when I finally got in doors.
