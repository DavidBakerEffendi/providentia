This is the as real as it gets. The Pizza oven goes thru a hole in the wall into the back yard to keep the kitchen cool in the summer. The first thing about a great Pizza is the sauce, next the cheese and then the pie crust. In this case all are over the top delicious.and first quality. The FRESH Mozzarella, was thick and gooey, the sauce was evenly spread over a air bubble popping semolina crust that was both crisp and chewy. Then a few piece of basil topped it off. Oh my mouth is watering just thinking about it. I Â wish there was one in my neighborhood on the corner.
