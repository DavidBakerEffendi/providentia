This place is too cool for school. The service was slow and unfriendly, which I could almost deal with if the food was awesome. I had some kind of cold meat panini that I think was just a cold cut sandwich purchased from Costco and served with a poorly dressed, wet and oily, watercress salad. Â I can only imagine that people come here because the architecture has some old-world charm. If you eat with your eyes only, this place is for you.
