Waste of time and money...completely ruined my Sunday night...got there around 9pm and the place was empty... asked if they were still serving and yes was the answer... asked for a simple Margarita, tasted like old water with little tequila...waiter told me he added simple syrup for flavor... are you kidding me... for 9.00 also... any MARGARITA IS JUST 3 SIMPLE INGREDIENTS,  tequila, triple sec and lime juice!! We were told about the special (20 was what was told and 28 was what I was charged) Spicy was what I asked for not food that was unable to eat... we left our drinks, left our food and left a 20% tip... why... because I AM A WAITER... and its not his fault but I tell you... I work in this business and I speak to HUNDREDS of people a week, and when they ask if i could recommend a good Mexican place, the first place I will tell them NOT TO GO  is XOCHITL... I was not looking for a free meal, just when I told the waiter about my drink, he explained it was a blond tequila... no kidding, but lime juice is a little green and my drink was completely CLEAR WITH NO TASTE!
