I love this place so much, I eat here 3 times a week and bring my lunch the other 2 days. I am obsessed with their Veggie Pho with vegetable broth! I have never found a place that offers vegetable broth with Pho! The girl behind the counter makes the Pho to order so I can customize which veggies I want to add and how spicy I like it. She is super sweet and friendly. My coworkers now eat the Pho too and love it. It is usually very crowded in there, but the workers are so fast! Even if the cashier line looks long, it is no more than 1 minute wait time.  My boyfriend met me for lunch one day, and he got a sandwhich which he  claimed was very delicous. This place makes me so happy!!
