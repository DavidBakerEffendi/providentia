This is a very, very special place. My wife and I came here the day after they opened --  incidentally -- and Jeremy and Damien were so welcoming.  I've eaten here for dinner several times since they opened and have stopped in for a few afternoon beers. Every time we are welcomed back as friends. The atmosphere is romantic at night, and fun during the day. When you go, I highly recommend the la Chèvre (Tarte Flambee). They also offer cocktails that are made with Sake that I thought were going to be weird (not a sake fan) but they were really good. My favorite part of the restaurant is the owners, but the atmosphere and the food really live up to expectations as well. It's become a go-to spot for our family and our friends too!
