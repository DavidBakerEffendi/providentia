Love this place!  I was first introduced to Hot Table in Springfield a few years ago and fell in love.  I stopped by their new Glastonbury location last week and ordered one of my favorite paninis, Buffalo Chicken.  They have an extension selection of panini, salads, and soups.  A little pricey but worth it!
