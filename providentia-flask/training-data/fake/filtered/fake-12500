Really fresh, really tasty, pretty healthy, and really cheap. What else can you ask for. Haven't ever ordered something that wasn't good. Minus one star since they don't take credit cards, and that has put me in a bind before. But I guess that is part of the way they stay so cheap. And also, I wish they offered a few fried treats (nothing on the menu is fried). Sometimes you just want something fried, ya know? It's a tiny place, just so you know.
