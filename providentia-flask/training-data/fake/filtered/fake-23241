Always loved this place. With such a great ambiance, a sexy scene and great music. The food here is absolutely amazing, they just reinvented the menu and I didn't think it was possible to be better but its the best food I've had ever!!! The people are all so nice and treat you like family, the owner is so hospitable and his infectious laughter makes everyone in your party have a great night every time. Â I've been there 3x this week and will continue to bring all my friends here for any occasion.. even just going there for the amazing margaritas is always fun. Super satisfied : )
