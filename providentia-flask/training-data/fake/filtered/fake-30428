Not very impressed. Got the roast pork sandwich and chicken parm. I would first like to say that the chicken parm was burnt. They obviously fried it too long. The roast pork was a bit dry for me and the sharp provolone didn't have that strong smell. What really turned me off was how rude the cashier was. I rather take my business elsewhere (Dinics).
