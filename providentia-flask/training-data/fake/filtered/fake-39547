If you've ever had real thai food, you will know the food here is very overrated. None of the orders came out hot, but were lukewarm. Needless to say this did not stay for any longer either. Pad thai was very bland, sauted chicken was way too sweet, and why warn me about plates being hot if they aren't? This place definitely isn't "the best," let alone it's below average. Food was bad, and service is on par with how bad the food tasted.
