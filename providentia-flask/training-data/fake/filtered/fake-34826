Be Careful - 1 or 5 stars depending - Don't go when there is a big event at the reception hall.  We love the Pond House Cafe and their menu, but we went last evening while there was a wedding and we were treated like a second class customer.  The food was definitely not as good as usual (the Kale Salad was great, but the fish was done poorly (still ice cold in the middle - when sent back, it was done more but the $30 fillet had 4 bones in the first 4 bites and the side was cold because they didn't keep it warm while they were redoing the fish)).  Go during the week or when the hall does not have an event.  The difference is between 1 and 5 stars.
