OMG! I must say that this is 2 thumbs up by far the greatest AUTHENTIC THAI RESTAURANT I have ever been to in all 5 boroughs that I have ever tried. The restaurant is very exquisite, The food is superb very well seasoned and marinated down to the bone. I have to say I brought my best friend in who does not care for Asian cuisine and she was licking the sauce on the plate from the chicken wings which btw way you must try because it is out of this world. The customer service is awesome and food prices are very reasonable you must go to kitchen 79 to fill your belly with good yum yum. :)
