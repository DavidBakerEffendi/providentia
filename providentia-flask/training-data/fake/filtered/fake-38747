The food was good but my group had the WORST service of any restaurant I have ever been to. We had a reservation at 9 and weren't seated until 9:45. Every group that night waited at least 45 minutes to an hour after their reservation. We had water spilled on a member of our group more than once with no apology. The staff dropped dirty knives on a member of our group AGAIN without acknowledgement. They actually handed a ticket to a member of our group on her way to the bathroom and asked her to take it into the kitchen. When she said "are you kidding me" they responded by saying "no it's right through there, just say 'order up' ". Not worth the food for the experience. Go somewhere else!!!!
