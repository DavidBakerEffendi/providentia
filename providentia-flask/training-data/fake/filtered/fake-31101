Went to this place because I heard that it was a good place with good food......SO WRONG!!!!! The food was just so,so. The pork belly was over cooked and the burger was OK. Now lets get to the service.....lol This server only seemed to have four tables and could not handle it at all. Â Now maybe he was having an off day but four tables and nothing else with a food runner. You need to get better servers and better customer service. Also, the seats are very uncomfortable and if you have back problem sitting there for 15 mins starts to hurt. I WILL NEVER RETURN and make sure to pass this information on to others.
