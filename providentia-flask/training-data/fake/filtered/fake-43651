I live in the area-ish and have been to Five Leaves more than 10 times now. I always leave with the feeling of really wanting to be able to like it more than I do. The food is consistently delicious and creative. The decor is well thought out, well designed. However, the prices are almost absurd, the wait staff is typically aloof, and the space is commonly overstuffed. I will still go and indulge, I just wish the place was a little more reasonable.
