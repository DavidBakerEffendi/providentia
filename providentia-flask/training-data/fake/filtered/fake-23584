Impolite and unprepared hostess, we were disrespected I went to Spotted Pig on May 15th and had the most terrible experience with an employee of the restaurant. The hostess was very impolite, spoke very loud, and had no patience in answering doubts. We had to wait in line for almost 2 hours because she was unprepared on managing the list, and also because she noticed that my wife was upset so I believe she did it on purpose as well, because she was sarcastic all the time, calling my wife a delightful person, and after a almost 2 hour wait said that would buy drinks for us given the wait which never happened, she was really being sarcastic and making fun of us... Off course it is a famous place and the lines are big (but we were early and had no one waiting outside, just some couples inside), but we were a party of 4 and instead of putting 2 tables together every couple that came in got a table (when we finally got a table, we saw many empty tables in the second floor, because the hostess is not a good manager). Also, we saw at least 2 parties of 4 arriving after us and she gave them a table before us. We complained and she spoke loud saying that they arrived before us, but we had been there for almost 2 hours so we saw the face of everyone in line, and it is not like they have phone msgs to alert you on the table... We were tremendously disrespected in this place by the hostess, I sincerely wish that management do something about it. In order for them to know which person I am talking about, I am giving her physical characteristics since I never got her name: she was African american and overweight. I believe I only got a table because the hostess overheard me talking about a web review. I am glad tools like this exist so persons like this don't get away with mistreating employees and management can know what is really going on in their restaurants. After this bad experience, even a Michelin restaurant food would taste bad. Many thanks
