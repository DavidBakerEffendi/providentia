We went to Zahov by chance on a sunday night after a movie, not knowing anything about it ahead of time. It turned out to be a great experience. The menu items were unusual to us, but the waiter was most accommodating. He explained any item we had a question about and offered recommendations. Our selections were delicious! The humus with their baked laffa bread is incredible. We especially enjoyed  the crispy haloumi which was brought complimentary after they had run out of the Bronzino we had selected.  The customer service was extraordinary.  The attention we received was unmatched. The night ended with a dessert Tehina semifreddo, which was out of this world!  We can't wait to go back!
