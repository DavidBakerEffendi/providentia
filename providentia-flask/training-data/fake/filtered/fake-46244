Let me first say this is a review of respect more than personal preference. I can UNDERSTAND why people would love it. The hot sauce is OUT OF THIS WORLD, the portions are MASSIVE, and the price CANT BE BEAT. I give it to these guys, they know what people want. Now my side, the rice is this OMG bright orange radioactive color and it passes through like acorns while on the toilet. The hot sauce was so freaking hot when I put a little bit (i think korean spicy is a joke) it just heat and little flavor and again passes through you like a pissed off godzilla. I gave it 5 tries and 5 terrible experiences and the lines are long but its expected for something so popular so no penalty. I just know I won't be trying it again. So again I can respect why people love this and they do what they do very well and you'll have lunch and dinner in one portion. Just be prepared to use the bathroom with some painkillers.
