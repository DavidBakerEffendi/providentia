Went on a food fest in Philly, Pat's and Genos, steak sandwich with provolone, both very good, tie in my book, John's blew them both away, pork sandwich with provolone and spinach was a killer, I would give it a 10 stars if possible. Also tried their steak sandwich with provolone, I thought it was better then the other two mentioned above, more meat for the same price. In the future when I'm in the area John's will be my first and only choice.
