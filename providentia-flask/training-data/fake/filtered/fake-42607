my husband and i are addicts. this little tucked away treasure is our new favorite take out place. we order from there once a week if possible, the haved chickens are perfection as is the house rice. i always enjoy the scallops. the calamari app comes with delicious fried yucca and a tomato salad. everything tastes better wood grilled.
