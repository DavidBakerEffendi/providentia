We went there for dinner. Lovely decor, the service was great but the food was not. I ordered the Bento Box, and the Chicken Teriyaki was inedible, like rubber. The Salmon Teriyaki was fine, as were the other items. My friend ordered the Hibachi steak, which was dry. If it was not so expensive I would not have been so critical, but I did not like the combo of it being more expensive than average, and the quality being below average.
