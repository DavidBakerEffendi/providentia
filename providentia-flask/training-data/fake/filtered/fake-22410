I've never written a review on Yelp before, but I've also never been to as horrible a restaurant as Queens Comfort before.  Here are their crimes: 1 - SO EFFING LOUD!!!!  The music is turned up to 11 - and it was good music, too - but it was so earblasting that you had to scream to hear anything.  And the place was about 3/4ths empty. 2 - Creepy weird dudes everywhere.  I couldn't tell who was working and who was a friend of the waitstaff.  At one point I counted six people in the kitchen - one of them was eating something - none of them were wearing gloves.  All of them were hairy.  One busboy kept dancing (to the loud music, see above) and air-drumming behind my wife's head.  Our waiter seemed like he had just left a methadone clinic and when I asked a question about an item on the menu, he told me to just "trust the chef." 3 - Undercooked food.  Chicken shouldn't be red on the inside. 4 - Insanely overpriced.  $14 for a burger?  At Shake Shack, fine, but this was just a burger with some weird stuff on it (in this case, an Italian street fair sausage.) I hate this place like poison.  I will never go back and I intend to post similar reviews everywhere on the web in an effort to deter business so it will close and something else will open in its place.  (What was wrong with the Blue Restaurant?)
