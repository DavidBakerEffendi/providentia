The food here is excellent and the service is wonderful, so I wish I could give Cornerstone more stars. I came here last night for a family dinner and when our very sweet waitress tried to correct a kitchen error in one of our dishes, she was terrorized by some man who could have been a manager but was also bussing tables.  It's a small place so when the incident occurred it was visible and audible to our nearby table and likely others as well. It was very upsetting to see this poor girl getting yelled at for seemingly nothing. And very unprofessional. However our meals were outstanding (with decadent and delicious deserts!) and the customer service by our waitress like I said was impeccable (so attentive!). It's too bad that the management allows such nonsense to go on--- especially right in front of customers! To see a hardworking woman disrespected and threatened (the young man seemed to be saying she should quit or he was firing her or something) was upsetting.  That said, our dishes were outstanding... the penne ala vodka special is a steal and the sweet potato fries are delicious! And I highly recommend the guacamole and chips!
