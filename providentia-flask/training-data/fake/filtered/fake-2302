worth the wait, YES.  but the amount of people outside makes the experience slightly less pleasant.  you are not rushed by the staff, but there is nothing leisurely about 50 people staring in the window drooling at your most delicious plate.  is there a time without the wait?  please, do not list this gem in any other tour books, PLEASE.
