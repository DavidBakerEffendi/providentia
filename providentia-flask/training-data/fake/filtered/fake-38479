I will never forget this place, or the people who worked there. Let me pause for a sec to point out I've never done a Yelp review. In fact, my boyfriend had to help me create an account. But we really had an unbelievable experience, and I felt obligated to spread the word. The food was fantastic. I got some chickpea, sweet potato mash type stuff - hell I don't really know what it was but it was awesome. So was the quiche. My boyfriend had quinoa (I don't know what that is either). The point is, yum! And the staff were all extremely courteous and helpful. So far, a great find. But it gets better. First of all, we didn't even realize at the time that we'd come in just as they were closing (yeah, I know, dumb out-of-towners). They didn't rush us out. Just the opposite. As we were getting up to leave, it started pouring. The owner Genevieve (hope I'm spelling that right) stopped us and said she didn't want us to get wet. INSTEAD, SHE OPENED UP SOME WINE AND SAT DOWN WITH US FOR A DRINK. FOR LIKE 45 MINUTES. Of course we didn't pay for the wine. 'Cause these people are class acts. She talked to us about our trip to NYC and our lives in general. We heard about her kids, the schools, the neighborhood. It was so nice. Oh, and before we left, she gave us drinks and scones for breakfast the next day. Look, there's service, and then there's service. And the coolest part was that it was my boyfriend's first time visiting NYC, and now I know he'll never forget just how cool/nice New Yorkers can be. Thanks, Genevieve!
