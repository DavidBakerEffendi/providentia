this place is fantastic.  upscale and delicious indian food. right amount of spice level, not too hot or mild and you can really taste that they use quality ingredients.  I catered my wedding food from here and they were nothing short of wonderful to work with, including offering food tastings and working with me on pricing. In addition, they worked the special arrangements I needed.  My guests raved about the food for weeks after the wedding.  I would recommend this restautrant to anyone looking for a quality indian meal in an upscale setting.   Their dum aloo, malai kofta, panch ratni daal and daal tadka are very very good. for dessert, their ras malai is fantastic.
