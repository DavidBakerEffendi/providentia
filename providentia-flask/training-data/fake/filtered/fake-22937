The manager has the biggest attitude EVER!!  We called because attached to our order that the delivery guy brought to our house was our credit card number written in full on a taped receipt that could of blown off anywhere.   After calling the manger who gave me attitude the whole time we got no where!!  he said he has been in business for over 30 yrs and he has to write the credit card numbers down some where!!! and has never had any ones credit card number stolen!! this guys an idiot! I said after 30 years you should know that we have a lot of identity theft and putting my entire credit card number in a car with a stranger upon delivery is probably a bad idea.  Needless to say this guy has a stick in his a** and we will NEVER order from him again!!
