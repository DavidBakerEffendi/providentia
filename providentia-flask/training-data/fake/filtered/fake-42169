This place panders well to the lowest common denominator: bacon and pork fat. Unfortunately, it does not do a very good job. I love stoner food as much as the next gal, but I was pretty underwhelmed with Traif. Nothing was above average. It was pretty expensive though because everything comes on small plates and you need to order a bunch of them to make a full dinner out of it.
