We have been going to their restaurant for years.  They make the best miso soup and salad on the planet.  The salmon and yellow tail are fresh and tasty also I love the eel as well.  Never had a bad piece of sushi as some say on this site.  Staff is friendly and are constantly refilling the tea, etc. I would recommend this place to anyone that loves sushi.  They serve sushi to love.
