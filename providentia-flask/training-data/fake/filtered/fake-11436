Ate at Eataly (Pasta Section) on 9/2/2010. Not only does one find a different Italian food at each station, but eateies are offered at some of the starions.  I ate the Fusili Pasta with meat sauce.  I would have liked just a little more tomato sauce mixed in it.  The staff was swamped, but all so courteous and helpful.  Because it was so busy (had been opened only 2 days) I did not buy any product. (the bread I wanted was gone)!   Will certainly return to buy some cheese, bread, etc., at another time. Bravo!
