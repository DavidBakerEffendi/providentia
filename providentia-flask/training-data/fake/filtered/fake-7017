I have eaten here several times as I choose to stay at the Hampton whenever I can. My meals have always been rich in flavor and the servers have always been attentive.  I recently stayed over visiting family for Easter. Instead of everyone cooking this year we decided to do the Easter Buffet (8 people).  I will have to say nicely done!!!! Keep in mind you have to make reservations ahead of time because they are swamped. They have different seating times, that way you are assured the buffet is always fresh. The manager who I have conversed with in my past stays (I believe his name is Tom) welcomed me back and even remembered my name (the reservations weren't under my name). The food was amazing, however I accidentally took the octopus. I am not a fan of tentacles as one of the other reviewers is. (yes it had tentacles). They had Turkey and Roast Beef carving stations, along with chicken dishes, leg of lamb, and  many other numerous selections. The prices are reasonable and the service is good. Quite honestly anyone that writes that the food is cheap in a restaurant only encourages the establishment to raise them.  I highly recommend this restaurant!
