What joy to eat here. The staff is perfectly trained, helpful, just the right amount of friendly, without being overly familiar. The sommelier approached at the just the right moment, after I had spent too much flipping back and forth in the wine list, and recommended a delightful Barbera that went perfectly with our meal. Our fist course was the octopus. Cooked to perfection, not chewy. The short rib and bone marrow angliotte will be on both our lists for our last meal on earth, it was that good! The duck breast was excellent.  The frozen chocolate cake, devine. The food, the service, the ambience were all top notch. One of our  best dinning experiences of our 10 day vacation in the big apple.
