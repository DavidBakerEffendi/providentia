I ordered #26 Kale with dry bean curd to go While the dish I got was OK, it was made with Gai Lan.(Chinese broccoli). I love Gai Lan, but I expect to get what I order. Furthermore, you cannot tell me it was a mistake - what kind of a cook does not know Gai Lan from Kale? They are nothing alike. This is a case of someone banking that the client is too ignorant to know which green the are eating. Sorry Charlie - I know my produce - You lose!!
