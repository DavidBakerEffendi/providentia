Yelp recommended this little Deli/Restaurant, I'm over on holiday for Thanksgiving from London England, and it couldn't of been better! We shared a cheese plate with fig and honey drizzled walnuts to start, it was divine... This place is great for carnivores and vegetarians. The Bacon Lattice Cheese Mac Pie was out of this world, couldn't finish it all so took the rest home. The mushroom, sprout gnocchi was delightful also.. The service was great, we brought a selection of cheeses to take home, aswell as chocolate cake and pumpkin cheese bar. This is a little gem of a place and will be returning again this week!....
