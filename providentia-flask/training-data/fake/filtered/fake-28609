I think all the negative reviews of this place are misleading. This is an honest nyc dive-ish bar in an area of town that is dominated by overpriced tourist traps and pretentious establishments catering to the after work wall street crowd. Anyone expecting a fine dining establishment is a fool. It is obvious from the second you walk in that this is a cheap bar, with cheap bar food... That being said, our experience was great. The place was empty, and the bartender was more than attentive, picking up a couple rounds throughout the night. We had n enjoyable and relaxing evening and would encourage anyone looking to escape the high prices and congestion of the seaport to check this place out. Not a great place to go for dinner, but great spot for drinks with friends.
