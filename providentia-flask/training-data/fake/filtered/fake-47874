If you are looking for real authentic Hungarian cuisine, this is the place to go.  The chicken soup is just like Grandma used to make.  Delicious.  The Nokodli (dumplings) are absolutely delicious.  I wish I could make them myself.  My mother loved them so much, she got an order of the Nokodli to go.  I ordered the Beef Gulyas.  It was a little spicy for my taste, but the meat was oh so tender. yumyumyum.  My father ordered the Pea soup and was very excited to see it was just like what he had back in Hungary.  It was not green like what we are used to in this country.  It was more like a vegetable soup with peas in it.  If you have ever had Chicken Paprikash, the sauce usually has sour cream in it. Here they serve the sour cream on the side.  My mother ordered it and just mixed the sour cream into the sauce and she loved it.  When we asked for Palachintas for dessert and they told us they had none, we were disappointed.  We told them we were looking forward to the Palachintas so they whipped up a batch.  They went out of their way to make them just for us.  They were so good, my mother got 3 more to go.  This is a small place with very good food and very good service.  If you have never tried Hungarian food, I suggest you go once and try it.  You will not be dissappointed.  My mother and father were so impressed with the place, that they are going to tell some of their cousins about this place.  We will definately return.
