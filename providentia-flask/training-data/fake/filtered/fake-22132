HEAVEN ON EARTH FOR FOODIES, COOKS, VISITORS & PEOPLE WATCHERS: No matter how many times we visit Philadelphia, Reading Terminal Market is a MUST for us. On this visit, we employed a new strategy...head straight to the restaurant vendors and eat! (Beck's Cajun Caf√© can go head-to-head with New Orleans eateries any day). With our bellies full of exceptionally good food, we could then wander among the multi-sensory seduction of meats, seafood, candy, coffee, pastries, breads, cheeses, olive oils, and more without buying everything within our reach. It's not a fool-proof strategy but it did reduce the urge to splurge. When our feet got tired, sitting down with a cup of Old City Coffee rejuvenated us for more browsing. Once we declared our visit complete, we were delighted to relax with a glass of wine and draft beer right in the heart of the action at Molly Malloy's. By-the-way, don't miss The Tubby Olive with 30 olive oils and balsamic vinegars "on tap" for tasting and take home. The next morning we ditched our free hotel breakfast buffet and headed back to the Market for breakfast and a few more goodies!
