When I moved to the neighborhood last year, the first thing that I did was search for amazing food in the vicinity. I came across Jose's the first week and since then I constantly have to fight the urge to order their tacos or enchiladas...or the tamales or the burritos... or the whole entire menu. I'm obsessed. Thankfully for my bank account, the prices aren't bad at all. The staff is really friendly too!
