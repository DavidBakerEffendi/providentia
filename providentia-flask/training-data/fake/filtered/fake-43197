All the time when the family wanted pizza, we'd get Genc's $6 pie. We've always loved it so much and still love it as much today. Crisp Crust and fresh marinara topped with cheese is what you'll get every time you order their $6 pizza pie. If you like homemade sauce go to Genc's, because they make sauce for the customers to purchase if they want to. This place is awesome.
