I had a great dinner with my friend at the bar here.  I love small spots with a relaxed vibe and this one fits the bill.  I'd been to the old Life Cafe here and it was a little dumpy-- it's much more clean now. I had a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Bacon and it was banging, and a really spicy ginger whisky cocktail. We also shared some nachos, the summer squash side and the house salad .  It's pretty chill here, although I can tell they have a couple of kinks to work out--like the menus-- they were printed on cheap, thin scrap paper. I saw a couple of really pissy reviews online, but I decided to try it anyway, and I'm glad I stopped in.  The owners must have made some enemies along the way, otherwise I can't explain the vehement, scathing comments.  I'm pretty critical of restaurants and bars and have a lot of friends who work in the industry. I'm especially wary of the slew of haughty "yuppie" establishments that have popped up in Brooklyn and the East Village in the last decade. But this place is an exception. Keep up the good work.
