I love here, the manager is really funny and generous. Each time he will teach me some Portuguese.:) The people here are friendly and willing to introduce you the most tasty food. Menus might be different everyday. Food here is wonderful. My boyfriend's favorite is chicken masala( mashroom soup with chicken and rice). Really interesting place.:)
