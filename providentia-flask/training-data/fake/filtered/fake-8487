We made the half-hour drive from Lubbock this Saturday for lunch because a number of people told us how good the food was.  However, unless you're local, I recommend calling first.  When we arrived, there was a hand scrawled note in the window saying they were sorry for the inconvenience, but they were closed Saturday for a private party.  So, call first just to make sure they're actually going to be there for business.
