I at lunch there today after looking at reviews on YELP, and I have to say that it was very good. I sat in the bar since it was just myself. My server, (Koren) was the most pleasant and attentive. She has a great attitude and bubbly personality. The chowder was rich and creamy, my whole lunch was sensational. I'll bring my family with me next time. I'd recommend this restaurant to anyone, the restaurant looks relaxing and the bar looks as if it can have a great night life. As the weather gets more moderate, there is plenty of seating outdoors too!! Go and try it, I'm sure you'll like it too
