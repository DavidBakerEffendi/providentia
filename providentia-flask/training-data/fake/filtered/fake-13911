DELICIOUS FANTASTIC MOUTHWATERING & HOMEMADE- that pretty much sums up food from Punjabi Rasoi. We have been catering ALL of our party needs from them for the past 2 years and each time, the food is unbelievably yummy! Ramneet (the owner) pays personal attention to the cooking and it shows in the results. This is one place that is focused on good Indian home made food vs 'sho-sha' - absolutely love it! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
