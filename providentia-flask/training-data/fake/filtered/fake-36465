EVERYTHING was salty : the pan con tomate, mussels, monkfish, patatas bravas, cod crouqettes.... they may use the freshest ingredients; however,  the salt overwhelmed everything.  It wasn't really enjoyable because all we (my group) can taste was salt. The cod croquettes were mushy.  i was salivating reading the description of the foie gras, but this was disappointing also - the lobe I was served was not entirely deveined - no big deal except I like my foie gras to be silky, melt-in-the-mouth texture. I wasn't expecting to be pulling a vein mid-bite. I just learned my lesson : Boqueria still has the best tapas in Manhattan.
