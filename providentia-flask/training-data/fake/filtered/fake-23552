I have nothing bad to say about this place, other than it's not closer to where I live.(Long Island City) Coming from San Diego, I usually stay away from Mexican restaurants because they just can't seem to get it right in NYC, but this place went beyond my expectations. I had the guacamole and elote for appetizer, and then a chicken torta. But I got the feeling that whatever I ordered would have been fantastic. Great atmosphere, very friendly service, and good cocktails. My friend had a tequila based cocktail that was served in a small terracotta cup which was really good. If you like tequila, and the recession hasn't bit you, treat yourself to the Don Julio 1942. Best tequila I've had, and Carino carries it. I will definitely go back to this place when I'm in Williamsburg again. Â Great spot!!
