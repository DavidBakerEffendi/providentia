We arrived for our 12 noon reservation on Memorial Day and were promptly seated. We chose the meatball sliders, because they had been highly recommended by previous guests. The waitperson was very cordial and accommodating. Cafe leche was excellent. The strawberry lemonade was deliciously tangy. The sliders were good, tasty and made a pleasant Â presentation.
