This is the third time I've been to this place, and it's just not for me.  I don't disparage those who dig it (some of my friends love the spot), but the food doesnt have the wow factor that the hype suggests, the place is obnoxiously crowded (which, for me, does not make for a good dining experience), and it's not that cheap for what you get.  Oh well, guess I'll just to eat at one of the other couple hundred awesome eateries on the lower east side.
