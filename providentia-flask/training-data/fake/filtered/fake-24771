Bianca is one of my favorite restaurants! We've tried almost everything on the menu--you can't go wrong with the mussels, gramigna, or lasagna. Portions are huge and prices are extremely reasonable. It's unpretentious and the service has always been spot on for me. In a city where there are a million and one options to choose from, Bianca is a great neighborhood joint.
