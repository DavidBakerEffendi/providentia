This place is a tourist trap.  No self respecting Philadelphian would eat here unless completely intoxicated.  So many better cheese steak to be had in South Philly!  And get over yourself- I am a Philly native and refuse to use your asinine slang.  If I order a sandwich from you I fully intent to use proper English to describe what I would like despite your eye-rolling.
