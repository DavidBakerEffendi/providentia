This hidden Italian/Mediterranean Jewel was a great find for me and my guests. We had a party of 6 and upon arrival was treated to fresh foccacia bread with EVOO. Everything from the appetizers to our main course to the dessert presentation was delicious. The servers were courteous and professional and the food came out in a timely manner. I was told they had a new management team as well as a new culinary team. It really showed. I will be back and bring others with me.
