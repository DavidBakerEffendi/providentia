The building is very small and doesn't have enough seating and space to accommodate all the customers and since the burgers are still cooked in the old fashioned way it can be a little bit of a wait for your food so if you don't have the time or patience to wait then don't eat here. I had the cheeseburger w/ tomato and my only problem with it was they don't allow ketchup so next time I will either take it to go or sneak in a ketchup packet. I like their selection of Foxon Park soda and the staff was friendly. Also remember it's cash only.
