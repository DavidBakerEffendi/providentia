This is a small and relatively plain restaurant with great service in Chinatown that needs to work on its food quality. My group ordered chicken and broccoli, shrimp fried rice, white rice, baked duck, and beef and vegetable dish that the kids loved but did not impress the adults. The shrimp fried rice and white rice were good. The beef and chicken were chewy, vegetables bland, and the duck cut up in a way that made it hard to eat, although it tasted okay.
