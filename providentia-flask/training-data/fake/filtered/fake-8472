A friend in Philly recommended this place for a casual quick dinner.  What good advice!  Anytime I'm in town for a visit and I need a quick bite this place is great.  Not only does the whole staff check on you constantly to make sure you are happy, the food is really good.  And what value!  Turkey Dinner you can't go wrong!  Can't wait to go back, what a discovery!
