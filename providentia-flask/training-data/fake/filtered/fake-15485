Eaten here about 5-6 times because I work close by.  The food is really good and tastes fresh.   I met the owner Mike, very friendly, who told me it is indeed all fresh, homemade food, and it makes all the difference.  The food is simple.  How many places can you go and get a turkey sandwich, or an omelette, especially in this neighborhood?  Quite a few, and I have probably eaten at most of them.  The difference is that freshness, the quality.  The fact it wasn't frozen.  The slightly thicker bacon, the clean ripe avocado, the homemade sauces, the slightly better cheeses, the homefries that were cut that morning, the falafel cake - house made garbanzo cake deep fried at that moment.  As I said, all simple foods, but the fact that it's fresh and prepared in a way that respects the food, is worth the extra dollar or two.   To sum up:  the omelettes are great.  Avocado BLT is messy but so tasty.  The cheeseburger is big and juicy.  The falafel burger is light and crispy.  If you want pizza, Kennett Square is the way to go.   I almost forgot...fresh squeezed orange and grapefruit juice?  Theres got to be like 4 oranges in that one bottle...
