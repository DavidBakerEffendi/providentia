I visited City Tap House for the second time on Wednesday night with my better half and another couple.  The food was above average for a bar, but unfortunately our the wait for our order to be taken and for our check  knocked this down from 4 to 3 stars. I and the other gentleman at the table had the Ten Spice Wings which are grilled with, I think, ten different spices.  They are almost sweet when you eat them and provide a very different flavor than your average bar wing.  The dipping sauce is also unique, and really enhances the wings.  I wish they gave more vegetables, but the overall amount of food for $10 or $11 is fine. My wife ordered the Margherita pizza, which I thought was only average.  I had been spoiled with Humble Pie in Phoenix, and Tacconelis in Philadelphia, as the two most recent pies I've had, so it probably wasn't a fair fight.  The crust was good, with a small amount of char, but the bottom of the pie seemed a little flimsy.  Also, for a Margherita, I feel the sauce was quite heavy compared to others I've had.  Still, not bad at all and perfectly fine for a bar pie. The other dish ordered was the gnocchi with pesto sauce, which I didn't try.  They said it was good and that they'd order it again if they came, so I guess that's good enough for me. The only problem we had was waiting quite a while to get asked what we wanted to drink (nothing we all drank water) and then waited a similarly long stretch before our waitress came back to take our orders.  Once she came back we made our selections, and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time, but the check seemed to take forever.  I'm usually not one to complain about service, but this wait was frustrating.  The waitress was actually very nice and may have had a giant party or a similar issue we weren't aware of, so I'm inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt.  Just know that sometimes it may be a while before you get helped.
