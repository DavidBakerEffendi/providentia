I tried their Heaven Ramen ($8.50), White Noodles with Peanut Butter and Soy Sauce ($3.50), and various Wonton and Noodles dishes ($5.50-$8.00) and they are all pretty good. I'm not sure if their "no MSG" policy is followed though. Good prices, nice environment, and friendly staff. I wish I tried the Congee. Good for a casual lunch or dinner.
