No reservations and very popular place = wait.  That's just a fact of life.  But, this burger is well worth waiting for.  Unlike some places that will only serve well-done shoe leather, here they have confidence in the quality of their burger, so my favorite charred rare was no problem.  Hmmmmmmm.  Juicy heaven, with blue cheese.  It doesn't get better than this.  Shoestring fries are also good.
