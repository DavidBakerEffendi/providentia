Had a great time at The Eddy. Intimate restaurant with a mixologist on hand serving bright and inventive cocktails that fittingly kicked the off the evening for our group. The refreshing bourbon daisy drink arrived in a lovely antique tea cup and my wife's parlor friar beverage was likewise delicious. Executive Chef Brendan's eclectic dishes were skillfully executed with the pillowy gnocci, pickled ramps and char rillette particularly tasty. Overall, a wonderful relaxed evening and we will certainly return soon.
