Regrettably, Lombardi's has lost much as it has expanded and earned a tourist "must see" moniker. While the pizza is still superior to any that the tourists have tasted ,and to most "by the slice" pizza in the city, its not nearly as good as the artfully spiced pizza it once was. Good, but not worth standing in line with a bunch of Eurotrash to get a table.
