Had a fabulous meal at Trading Post Monday Night. Started off with an Octopus salad that was great and my partner had scallops that melted in your mouth. We both had steak for the main course which was as good as any of the top steak houses I've visited in the past. We finished it off with a delicious choclate cake with a scoop of chocolate ice cream and I had a hot crumb cake with vanilla ice cream. Great meal from start to finish. Will definitely go back again.
