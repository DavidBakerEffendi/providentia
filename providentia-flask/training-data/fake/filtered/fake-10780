I like this place for its choices and their affordable prices of a custom made burger. The seating area is cafeteria style with no privacy. It is very loud here with the students. I wish they had combo meals to choose from. Overall, I cannot recommend this place because of the long wait times for "FAST" food and limited awkward seating.
