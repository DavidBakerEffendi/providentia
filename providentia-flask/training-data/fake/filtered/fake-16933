I have been dining at Cafe Gitane since 1999. This was honestly one of my favorite restaurants. Food was decent, price was just right, and the place was low key. However, it is rather sad to see what the place has become. The service is honestly deplorable. The stress on trendy wait staff has severely compromised customer service. The place is staffed with waitresses who don't realize that they are in the customer service industry. While it is perfectly okay to bend backwards to serve a clientele that fits your rather narrow view of what's "cool", it is not okay to treat your average paying customer like they are a burden. There are plenty of other places around the neighborhood with great service and consistently good food (e.g. Epistrophy, Public, Cafe Lucky Day, Barbossa, Kelley & Ping), that I will happily not be entertaining your unprofessional establishment again.
