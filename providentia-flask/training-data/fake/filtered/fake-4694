WOW! We had a bad r time at this place on Sunday! Bartender was soooooooo sssssllllllooooowwwwwwwwwwwwww! Food came out before our drinks, and we ordered the drinks 10min before the food! Every drink after that took 20 min.........and I am not over estimating! Wings were very good.....all other food was below average bar food. Clearly they do not have a real restaurant manager working anywhere near that building! But the kids love it, so we go. But may never actually buy drinks or food there again. And we spent $200!
