Torn between 3 and 4 stars. Gave it a 3 because the side dish (lemon potatoes) tasted better than my main dish chicken kebab. Portion size: good Service: good Food:The chicken kebab flavor was good, but the chicken was so so dry, overcooked. Lemon potatoes are a must-try! Price: Great. Atmosphere: Great
