We were in the city for business and randomly ended up at Woodrow's. The bar has a great atmosphere and a fantastic staff. My group mingled with the regulars who were very fun and welcoming. I had the spicy shrimp which was killer. The owner came over to us and greeted us. She has an incredible warmth and sincerity. It was a really great night for my group. We've been back since and it was another fun time. It makes me wish I had a Woodrow's down the street from my place. Thank you Erin - you make us feel at home. Sean
