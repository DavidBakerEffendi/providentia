Nikko's Sushi this place is funny.  the staff always looks like they would rather be somewhere else & its always empty idk how they stay in business.   But despite that this place has a charm that i cant put my finger on.   Im not the kinda guy that needs fancy pantcy dining.  Just some good food at a reasonable price. Nikko's sushi is pretty good. . I would say everything is good except the crab meat.   If I had to relate it to a bar it would be a dive bar.   If your looking for fine dining for you and your girl this place is not for you.  But if you like dive bars, trying to communicate with the staff, they are attentive but its funny.  and good sushi that youll get addicted too try it out.   This place needs some business so i can keep going!
