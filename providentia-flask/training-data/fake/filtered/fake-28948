Heard the food was great, and it was. However the service and experience lacked. The entire restaurant seemed under staffed. Our server had very little knowledge of the menu, I ordered a bloody mary directly off the drink menu and was told that they do not do bloody marys. The server refused to do separate checks or even process more then one credit card and hand wrote in a 18 % gratuity.....seemed very presumptuous considering the awful service we got. Â We were served half full waters ,some with no ice. It was chaos and the manager seemed very overwhelmed and useless. Like I said the food was good, but we had an awful experience. I certainly would not recommend going there with a group of people, they just can't handle it.
