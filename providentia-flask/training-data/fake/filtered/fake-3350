What a great healthy option in this part of town!  The food is terrific!  The restaurant is fresh and bright!  Loved everything we got (Basque shrimp; lemon chicken; steak and fig salad).  Looking forward to returning and trying other dishes (had a bite of the "eggplant provie" sandwich and was happily surprised at how flavorful it was - I'm not a big fan of eggplant)!
