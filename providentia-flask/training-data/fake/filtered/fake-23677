Just ate at Pellegrino's, service was incredible as was the food. Had Zuni d pesce and chicken w sausage I'm a brown savory sauce, was delicious. Stuffed shrimp appetizer was very good, as was fresh mozzarella appetizer. Excellent wine selection. Pistachio cannoli was awesome. Definitely must go here. Friendly staff and ma√Ætre d. Go here every Year in December.
