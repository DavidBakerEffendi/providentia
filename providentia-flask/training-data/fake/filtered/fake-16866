This Aussie place is rather small comparing to a normal restaurant. There are only 4 picnic style tables available. I feel the authenticity for the foreign food because the server carries an Australian accent. For the food, I ordered the Bronte Burger with fried egg. Basically they put together premium ground beef, tomato, lettuce, sweet chili, mayo and cheese. It is simply delicious. The beef was cooked and seasoned perfectly. We also got the pasta dishes and they are also very flavorful. I would probably come back here if I was in the area. I was very satisfied with my meal.
