The wife and I came here March of '14, just a few months after having visited Thomas Keller's French Laundry.  We were in town to visit friends in Brooklyn but ran into my wife's colleagues as well ; to dinner we went. Honestly, having visited Ink in L.A. + TFL that same year the bar had been raised for me somewhat (...although we don't eat out that much and tend to cook most days of the week, and are by no means connoisseurs of dining out or anything like that...) WOW... What more can I add to these reviews really? impeccable service, on-point cocktails, unpretentious high-end dining at it's very finest.  Been to many alike but this place takes the cake in terms of staffing / service. Guess these city folks know what they're doing. Hats off to the pastry chef. Outstanding.
