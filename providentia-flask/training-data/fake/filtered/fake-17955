Maybe we ordered the wrong thing. My girlfriend ordered lemon chicken. The sauce was excellent but the chicken was very chewy. Too tough to eat. We both tried but gave up toward the end. I got King Pal Chicken which I get everywhere. I understand they use salt in these dishes but this was overkill. Again, maybe we just ordered the wrong thing because most of the reviews are very positive and several of the parties in the restaurant were regulars. Unfortunately, I don't think we'll return. All the servers were nice though which is what's making this a 2 star instead of 1.
