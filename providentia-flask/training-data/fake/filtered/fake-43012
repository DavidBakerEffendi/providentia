Traditional northern Italian fare that is about as good as it gets. The will customize any plate to your specific taste and it will be amazing. Must try the pizza as well. It has a great taste that is not like the greasy greek pizza, but not like a thin new york style either. But I must say, it is really really good.. We eat here all the time.
