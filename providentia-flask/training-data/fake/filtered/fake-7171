someone teach me how to make katsu at home like this! the meat is awesomely tender unlike many breaded and fried meats and everything on the side complements the meats so well. the restaurant is smallish but the times i have been it hasn't been too packed, so no worries about waiting in a huge line to get a table. also, the prices are pretty reasonable for new york so that's always a plus! great place to check out if you're in the midtown area.
