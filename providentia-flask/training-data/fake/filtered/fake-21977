Reading Terminal is a great place to visit and shop. Tourists and locals enjoy the variety of shops and eateries. We buy our best fruits and vegetables there. The butcher shops offer the finest cuts of meat and will pack it on ice if you need to keep it cool. This is a must stop in the City of Brotherly Love, don't miss it. Even try the Gator Gumbo
