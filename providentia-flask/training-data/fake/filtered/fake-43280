Been twice so far... Patatas Bravas.  Garlic Aioli was one of the best I've had. Crispy Cauliflower.  Amazed the first time around. Florets were bigger the second time I got them and not as good.  Need a little more surface area for breading and flavor. Chicken Liver Mousse App was yummmmers.  It came with a grape tomato confiture that added just the right amount of sweetness to the dish. Chicken Entree was Delicious!  Crispy skin, moist meat Lamb with the Persian Lime Sauce was sublime! Service was warm and on point.  I will definitely be frequenting this place!
