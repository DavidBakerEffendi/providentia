I loooove the meatball shop! Only tried the vegetarian meatball sandwich so far, but it was a really good meal for the price, a tasty and very filling sandwich with a nice salad on the side which complimented it perfectly. Good lemonade too. I don't exactly have any complaints but the service was a little mediocre (then again it was very crowded so I guess that's understandable), so that's why this is a 4 for me. But could probably work its way up to 5 with more visits.
