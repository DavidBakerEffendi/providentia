The Terrace is the best Thai restaurant in the New Haven area that I have been to.  And I've been to quite a few of them.  The food is excellent, fresh and prepared with skill.  The spices are right-on, and the flavors meld well.   One of my personal favorites is the Pad Prik King: intense flavors and the green beans are nice and crisp, not over cooked, which is tough to find.  The Massaman curry is excellent, as well.  The decor is simple, and much nicer than the usual kitchy Thai place.   The one downside is that the service could be a little better.  On a weekend evening, there are usually a few too many customers for the two waiters to handle effectively.  But the food is well worth it.
