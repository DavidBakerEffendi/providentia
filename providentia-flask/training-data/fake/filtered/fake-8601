I work just around the corner from Le Bus and find myself eating from their menu at least once a week. The sandwiches are made fresh every morning, along with everything else in the bakery including salads, bread loaves, soups, muffins, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, oatmeal and cookies. Its all so good and moderately priced.   Other Pros: 1. Sandwich Card- every 10 sandwiches buys you a free sandwich. Salad, coffee and bread cards available, too. 2. Day Old Bread- day old bread is displayed at the register and advertises 1/2 off prices.  Includes loaves, rolls, bagels, and muffins. 3.Friendly Staff- quick service an super helpful My advise: go here
