First let me say that the food is delicious. However, the wait is ridiculous!!!my husband and I waited for 2 hours in the freezing cold after we had been told the wait would be an hour. After sitting down and enjoying the delicious food, I left to go to the restroom and while waiting I noticed the waitress speaking to my husband. I then saw my husband get up from our table, looking a bit troubled, and walk outside. I finished in the restroom I followed my husband outside and he told me the waitress asked him to do her a favor and wait outside for me because she needed to seat people. I thought this was highly inappropriate and unnecessary especially after we had waited so long to be seated. We will not be going back here.
