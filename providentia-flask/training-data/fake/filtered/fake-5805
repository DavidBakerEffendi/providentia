Really loved this place for lunch yesterday. I stopped in for the crab cake sandwich. It was pretty amazing. I should have asked for a little more of the sauce that they put on it. However there seafood is always really fresh and delicious looking. The market is tight at time but I love the city feel and the friendly staff. Can't wait to stop back and try something new.
