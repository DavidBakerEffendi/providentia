The food is old and obviously re-heated many times..  I cannot fathom the idea that buffet, to them, must be serving the food they prepared on Monday must be served and re-served  till it is consumed  Wow! These are what we ate that day. tMy family were there last night, August 21, 2011 and were surprised that they call this a buffet restaurant.   The food were slimy to look at. The seafoods - shirimp, crabs and fish were disgusting. I tried touching the shells of the shrimps, they were slimy and stinky.  Newly prepared food are not supposed to be this way.  Even the easy to cook and easy to prepare "lomein" (chinese noodles) looked unsafe.  I was unsure at first but when I sampled it, I regretted i did not trust my visual suspicion. I am not here to destroy the reputation of the restaurant but ... I am here to PROTECT  unsuspecting people that they are served low-quality, dangerously unhygienic and spoiled food on the buffet counters. Calling the Health and Sanitary Department !!!! You should inspect food temperature and freshness of the food.   NO STAR AT ALL FOR THIS UNLEAN, UNSAFE AND DECEITFUL DEN IN GUISE OF A RESTAURANT. GOD FORBID THERE WILL BE PEOPLE HURT AFTER EATING IN THIS DEPOT OF UNSAFE AND UNCLEAN PRACTICES. i SINCERELY HOPE PEOPLE WILL COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS RESTAURANT. IT IS GIVING WHOLESOME  CLIFTON A BAD REPUTATION. WHY DID THEY EVER LET THIS PLACE PASS INSPECTION. GOD HELP US ALL
