Whether you're mexican or not, this is one of the best bars around. The bar staff is the best around and food is excellent. I recommend any of their specialty drinks, especially the sangria. And for food, I would have anything on the menu. The plantain rellano is and excellent combination of sweet and savory. Give it a try. you wont be disappointed.
