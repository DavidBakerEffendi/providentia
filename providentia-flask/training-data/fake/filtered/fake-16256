I was introduced to Cafeteria in 2010, and since then I always try to make at least one trip (more if possible :)) to 'Cafeteria' when I visit New York. The food is really terrific (Mac n Cheese seems to be the favorite), the servers are very friendly, and the hosts are not only friendly - but always so very fashionable - definately a big draw for customers ! See you again soon Cafeteria !
