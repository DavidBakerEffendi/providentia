Considering the Henry Street Renaissance, with the three greats: Noodle Pudding, Henry's End, and the more recent Bevacco, JTH is an also-ran culinary establishment.  The drinks are excellent and the bar is fine, the service excellent, but the food tends to be of mediocre quality, alas, served up pretentiously but mediocre nonetheless..  It seems to be hugely popular with the well-off youth of the neighborhood who often drag their suburban parents along so the atmosphere is quite collegiate, if not jejune.  I guess they think it's a "grown-up" restaurant.  If you like your brunch served with plenty of noise (I don't), there's lots of screaming laughter emanating from JTH on Sunday morning and afternoon. Try Bevacco's for brunch--or for that matter dinner.  There's true culinary sophistication at the Henry Street venue.
