My wife and I go to eat often. Maybe too often - a couple of nights a week at least. We were introduced to this place about 3 weeks ago and have been there 4 times already! A week after our last visit, I am still thinking about the Skirt Steak - which was 'shut the front door' delicious. We are even booking a party here and I just decided to go tomorrow for brunch - because the brunch menu looks way too good to pass up! Also, in today's world finding a restaurant this good that also has reasonable pricing? Almost impossible!
