The Canoe Club is my place of choice for a romantic evening or business lunch. I have consistently been impressed with the service, atmosphere, and flavors. The last time I was there, my wife and I enjoyed one delicious course after another with a pianist delicately playing tunes in the background. Our waiter was so wonderful at anticipating our needs that we were able to just relax and enjoy an evening of conversation together.
