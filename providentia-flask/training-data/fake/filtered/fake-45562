Don Pepe is hands down the best in the city. eat the baked clams and you've done your piece on earth .. the liguine , the veal "best in the city" best of all you can write a book about the joint and there are some great stories in the 40 years I've gone there. Along with the great food you cant help it but come back. I was even warned that if I didnt bring Don Pepe back to Fla DONT COME HOME. My friend at the door yells out" Tell her I got yuz covered"
