Wonderful place. One of the few bars that kept the pre-gentrification, non-posh atmosphere of Northern Liberties. Unpretentious, but colorful. Food that easily matches restaurants of higher price ranges. A great deck to sit outside. A choice of vibrant/loud bar space, or more quiet restaurant atmosphere. Inspiring people, always very good service: standard tap is a gem.
