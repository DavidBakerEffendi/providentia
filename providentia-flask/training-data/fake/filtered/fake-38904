Will never eat at tacobell again! The smoked pork is divine! It's more like real spanish food rather than american-mexican. quite affordable too. We've ordered from here twice now. Roomie loves the tacos, I love the huarache. We always get the #1 combo; taco, tostada and huarache for $8.25. Just wish they were open later. They close at 9:30pm, and I get out of work at 9pm. :(
