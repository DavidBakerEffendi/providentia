I've been here a few times and when friends come to visit in NY, I always have to take them here because this is seriously a NY staple. # 1 Ramen if you ask me. You can tell it's good because you'll be waiting 2 hours just to eat here. Yes it gets very very crowded! So expect to wait. Find a nearby bar to sit it out while you're waiting for your name to be called 2 hours later. Here's a tip: you can put your name down for the dinner list if you come during the day. You'll be thanking me later. Come during lunch as well. Not much of a wait so you'll be seated faster and you're just that much closer to ordering your Akamaru Modern. I come here strictly for their ramen, but their pork buns are really good too. It's a tie between here and David Chang. Both are equally good to me.
