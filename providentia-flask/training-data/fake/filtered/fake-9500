Hey Yelp World! I recently visited the Green Line Cafe in Powelton Village, yet again, and as always, I had a wonderful experience! I swear that every time I visit this cute cafe it gets somehow lovelier! This time I was greeted by single vases of beautiful carnations at each table, and a very nice, varied collection of 'employee art' on display, that I made sure to make time for checking out more closely while I was there. As usual, I got a mocha latte, made just perfectly by the same handsome man that I often receive service from there.  He is always kind, attentive, and gives a smile that I feel like I should pay for. :)  Honestly, I'd like to think it's only me who gets such great treatment, but, as I sit and work away, I can see the same bright service given to each person that stops in.   I really feel like this place is a secret something special.  The energy inside is so often alive and bright, and the folks that work there are so often friendly and accommodating. They get great food from several great local establishments, including 'LeBus Bakery' and 'Four Worlds' bakery too! - Currently, I am hooked on the 'goat cheese croissant', it is very very good. I'm excited for the Spring time!  - The cafe has outdoor seating in the front of the cafe, as well as a quaint, cozy and green backyard too! - Though the backyard wasn't up and running on this visit, I am looking forward to spending some time back there once it's grown back! So yes, I love this place.  Great vibes.  Good people.  And green, green, green! Note: I have been to all three Green Line locations on several occasions each at least, and I have to say, this one is my favorite.  I do enjoy them all, and they each have certain qualities about them that make them unique, but when it's all said and done, I'll have my mocha latte with a smile at the Green Line in Powelton Village! :) Penny
