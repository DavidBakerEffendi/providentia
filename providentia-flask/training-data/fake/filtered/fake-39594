My friend and I stopped there before going to see a broadway show, it's just a few blocks away. We waited for about 15 mins. Â We ordered steamed vegetable dumpligs, shrimp&calamari herb salad, Sukothai pork noodle soup, Nakorn-Patom duck noodle soup. Everything was delicious. The place is kind of small, but the decoration is cool. I like the way, they use wood table, and antique stuffs.
