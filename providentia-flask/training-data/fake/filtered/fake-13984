This place is for the cool grown-ups. In other words, it attracts a stylish and sophisticated crowd, mostly 30- to 50-somethings. Loud, with lively bar/eating area in addition to traditional tables (which are placed very close together...this is not the place for you if you don't appreciate intimate and cozy settings). The food was FANTASTIC. We had a lovely cheese plate, a delicious and fresh pasta, and an order of house made meatballs. Excellent. For dessert, you simply must have the budino...ranks among my very favorite dessert. Bread pudding is excellent as well, but was eclipsed by the budino. Make a reservation...this place is very popular.
