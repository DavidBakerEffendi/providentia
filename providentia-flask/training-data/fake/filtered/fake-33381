I tried Edo Sushi for the first time a couple of weeks ago, and now I can't wait for another occasion to go back. The restaurant had a good combination of both Chinese food and fresh sushi--which was visually as well as tastily appetizing. Â The hostess was friendly and would walk by from time to time to make sure everything was okay. I would definitely recommend this place.
