I had a great lunch with a friend. She had a bass filet with saffron foam and grapefruit. and I had the classic flatiron steak with frittes, microgreens, haricot verte, and bernnaise (spell??)sauce. Both dishes were amazing! and I love that the coffee is served with a french press and left at your table for more as needed. I had my wedding reception there, and the quality of the food didn't decrease due to volume. One of my top 5!
