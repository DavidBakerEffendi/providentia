A great place to eat Mexican and take the family. I have been going to this place for a long time now but just recently had one of the best times of my life. It was my daughters 5th birthday and she wanted to go to beana's (she has been going since she was in her moms bell.) They have a little kids area which gives her and her little brother a place to play  and color while my wife and I could enjoy our wonderful meal. I just found out that they changed owners which only made things better. We had a mango cerviche and chipotle mussels for the App. and 2 huge dinners. It was about 2 days worth of food. The kids had chicken fingers, rice and beans. At the end of our meal the lights dimmed and to our surprise the owners and some of the staff came out singing happy birthday as the entire placer seemed to stop eating and joined  together  a lit candle on a fried ice cream (no charge) was placed in front of my daughters glimmering eyes and then she made her wish. Later she told me that she wished that me and mommy would take her back to Beana's Para Siempre. Can you put a price on that???
