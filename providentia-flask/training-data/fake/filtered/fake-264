This place is foul. Not only is their food god-awful, the people who work there suck too. Go to Tony Luke's if you want real food, and a great cheesesteak. If you are in that area, go to Pat's instead. It's not top-notch but it's a thousand times better than that terrible excuse for a food place Geno's. I feel disgusting just writing about it.
