Don't be fooled by the other "Nick's Roast Beef!" Go to the one in the hood!! it is the BEST! I was fresh off a plane from California, so hungry and ready to eat some hearty South Philly food, so when my lil sis said we were going to Nick's, I was stoked!!! Best Ever Roast Beef!!! (excluding my uncle's deli, c'mon it's family!)
