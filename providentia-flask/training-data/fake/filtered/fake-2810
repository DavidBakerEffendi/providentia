I am so disappointed! I was really looking forward to this because have spoken to a lot of people who said the food and atmosphere here was good...I wouldn't know I never actually got any food.  The decor is cool, but don't care where I am if you are going to treat your customers like crap. When my friend and I arrived Friday around 6:30 p.m. after standing for an hour in traffic to get here we were told we could be seated outside or wait to be seated inside.  We agreed outside was fine, until it started to rain.  The hostess was very sweet and tried to help us (thus the one star for her), by telling us we could take a table that was half inside half outside, but when we had gone to sit there people had taken it upon themselves to relocate themselves to that table.  She asked us to follow her and agreed she would help us.  When we went inside I'm assuming the manager or owner asked her what she was doing and got snippy with her in spanish...yeah buddy I understood. Then he turned to us and told us we had to go wait our turn in line...the wait was at that point over an hour.  When I explained the situation he brushed it off and said he didn't care.  Really nice of him considering I drove an hour from another state to eat at your restaurant, to celebrate a special occasion...Needless to say I will not be eating here again...Although the food smelled good I refuse to put money in anyone's pocket that doesn't treat their customers like they give a crap about them because there are others! Shame on you.
