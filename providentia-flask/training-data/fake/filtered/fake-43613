Our closest friends(from out of state) were visiting the Princeton area Â for the first time and they are steak lovers. Having been there before and having never been let down, we took them to the Witherspoon Grill. The steaks were comparable to or better than some of the best steak houses in NYC. All of the sides were cooked to perfection as well. Our server, Amanda, was everything a server should be: charming, efficient,and attentive without being intrusive. Needless to say the WG was a hit with our friends. We are certainly looking forward to a return visit.
