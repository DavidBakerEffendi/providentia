I'm responsible for corporate events, and I tried to choose a pizzeria with interesting propositions. I have chosen Scott's Pizza. I was impressed by their customer approach. They offered me several variants of menu (salads, pizzas, deserts, beverages). The mode of payment is very convenient (via Internet). Everything is well organized. I appreciate their professionalism. Choose them, and they will never let you down.
