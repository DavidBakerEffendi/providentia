Any spot open during the dark days post hurricane around alpha city Â was nothing short of a miracle. I stopped by Fonda one of those apocalyptic days and I'm glad I did. I tried not to think how they were keeping meat and food refrigerated, since they had no generator and operated on some candles and flashlights...but was told they have another place in BK and that's where food came from....Food was great and staff was super attentive. And I'm a sucker for a good caipiroska which is really hard to find....and the uber nice bartender made it for me and it was great. If Fonda was above good on a crazy day, it can only get better.
