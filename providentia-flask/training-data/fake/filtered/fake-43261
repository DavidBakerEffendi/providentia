Just came here yesterday for the very first time. I did not even realize this place existed but I am glad I found it from yelp. I love their fried chicken sandwich. It was amazing. Ok so yeah when you bite into it the biscuit starts to crumble and break apart but who cares because it was so frigging delicious. I should have gotten like 6 of them to bring home with me lol. The staff was welcoming and sweet If you do come here try the fried chicken sandwich
