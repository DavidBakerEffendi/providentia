It's tough to find a mexican spot that offers vegetarians new things to fill in a bowl for lunch but this place gave it a shot. I had a bowl and the combo of squash, corn, black eyed peas mixed with black beans, salsa and guac over greens and it was surprisingly pretty good. They definitely are working on the variety factor, as there are at least more options than chipoltle offers. My boyfriend had the BBQ pulled pork burrito... I am strictly vegetarian but this thing smelled and looked delicious! But then there is the vegetarian factor... I'm really hoping that they are able to incorporate more vegetarian dishes in the future... Maybe a veggie chili? Living in an area where there are so many options for food, it's tough to find a spot that you really enjoy. I think we will definitely be back, if it was this decent after just opening then I am looking forward to when they get in to the routine of things...
