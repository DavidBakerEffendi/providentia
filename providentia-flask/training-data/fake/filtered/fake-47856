Ordered the Chi Town Sampler for starters. Showed up as an uneven plate with 4 chicken nuggets, 3 mozzerella sticks, 3 buffalo wings, an avacado eggroll split in half, and a hand full regular french fries. The wings were decent. I ordered the chicken parm which was a mistake. the 2 chicken cutlets were soggy breaded and had clearly deli sliced mozzerella cheese semi melted on top. the penne pasta was covered in tasteless, dry marinara sauce. the breadstick that came with it however was delicious. service sucked. maybe i should have tried the pizza but i didnt. the food was awful and a waste of money and i will never eat there again.
