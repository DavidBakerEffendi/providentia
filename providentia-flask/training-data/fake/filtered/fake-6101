Obao is one of my favorite place in Hell's kitchen area. The atmosphere is very romantic. it is perfect for a date or just a casual meal with friends. my favorite item is Spareribs on sugarcane, Pho Bo , and Beef Luclak things to note- 1 The Portion of Pho Bo is very big. 2 spareribs on sugarcane is actually a thin slice of spareribs wrapped around sugarcane.3 you will need to make a reservation during the dinner time. It is always packed!
