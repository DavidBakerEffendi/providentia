If all I were basing my review on was the food, this would have been four stars, however, this review is based primarily on the service, which leaves A LOT to be desired. I went to lunch with a friend on Thursday 4/15/10. We were promptly seated. The food came out, we ate slowly and talked. We then ordered coffee and continued to talk. We kept receiving glaring glances from the multitude of wait staff. I would have understood the race to get us out, if the place were packed, or if it is customary for them to close between lunch & dinner, but neither is true. They literally spoke Spanish around us complaining that we wouldnt leave. However, we had already paid our bill and left a 30% tip!!! They really shouldnt assume people dont understand them based on looks. I heard every word and Im contacting the owner. POOR POOR POOR. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY IF YOU WANT AN ENJOYABLE MEAL.
