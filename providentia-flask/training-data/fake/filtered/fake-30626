we came here last night a =s a pre-concert meal. location is right across from the barclays center. i must say we were a little taken aback by the size of the restaurant, but all worries dispelled with the great attention by the owner, andrea and his staff. the food was fantastic and very affordable. i would highly recommend this restauraunt to anyone looking for a great italian meal!
