I cannot believe this is the only Ippudo in the United States. I came here all the way from California just to get a taste because I had tried it once in Japan and loved it. The red bowled ramen was so fattening, but so delicious. I will go back to New York for their ramen...and potstickers...Pretty much I will go back to New York for their food.
