We enjoyed a lovely meal at Mes Reves recently. A very warm Â and friendly staff coupled with a very talented chef. We had salmon and skate as our entrees. Both dishes were beautifully prepared with unique and delicately executed sauces. We shared the bread pudding and were very pleased with our meal. The room itself is very 'chic'; acoustics, very good. Mes Reves also has a 'pre fixe' menu during the week which we are looking forward to try.
