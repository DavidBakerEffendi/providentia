I have dined at Panevino twice a week for 10+ years.  Why do I do this?  Because the food is delicious, the ambiance is relaxing (check out the outdoor garden!), and the service is outstanding!  Snaps to Consuelo and Jasmine, two of my favorite servers - though all the servers do a great job.  I often go to Panevino for business lunches and I have to say that the turnaround time in getting our dishes is excellent.  As others have noted, you must try the citrus iced tea - it's the BEST!  I have lived in many places and have eaten at many restaurants... Panevino is by far my favorite!
