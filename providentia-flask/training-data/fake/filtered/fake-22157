Oh wow, were to start. I had a gig in Philadelphia, stayed at a friends home, and with a few hours to kill before returning to New York, I decided to visit the market. As a foodie, I found it a temple, a place of worship. So many stands with so much, great breads, produce, meats, a temptation of candies and cakes... I had a wonderful pastrami sandwich at Hershels East Side Delli, and a wonderful conversation with three very interesting guys at the food court. I fell in love with the chops and fish stores. A market is telling about a city, a comunity. I grew up visiting the great markets in Mexico City, and live very close to Essex Â street market in New York- small but good-. The Reading Terminal market is one of my favorites, and I have been to a few, including the "Boqueta" market in Barcelona. Two hours away on the "China Town" bus, a few hours there, to shop and eat, well worth it. I am looking foward to try as many things as I can... I will not wait until my next Philadelphia gig... I will just take the bus, explore eat... and walk back home to the East Village. Yep... great...
