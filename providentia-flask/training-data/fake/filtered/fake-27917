My favorite Italian restaurant in the city, and my favorite BYOB in the city. I have been to Eatalia numerous times, and the food has never been less than phenomenal. The menu always has it's staples, but the seasonal additions are always incredible. The service is great, the staff is great..... I have, will, and do recommend this place!
