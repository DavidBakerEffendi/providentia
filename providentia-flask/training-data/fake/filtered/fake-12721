I went there on a recent business trip and sat in the front section (where the bar is), and as I understand it there is a separate menu for the main dining area. Anyway, it was pretty delicious and the prices were very reasonable. Two dishes that stood out on that particular night were the beet salad and some sort of calamari salad. I thought the latter was pretty brilliant. Good vibe. It was not as stodgy as I thought it would be.
