This review is based entirely on service.  We took 8 people to dinner the other night and the place was packed as usual.  Our client got us the reservation as they have connections.  They had never been there and we had bragged about the place so she said fine let's go.  Our client needed ice for her drink, nobody came to our table.  I finally had to go ask our waitress who was at another table could we please have some ice for one of our guests.  It took another 5-10 minutes and we finally got some ice.  We never got any food for over an hour.  When food finally arrived nobody came to check if we needed anything.  We needed some lemon for the fish and chips but it came when we were ready to order dessert as I had to leave the table to find someone to get it for us.  I think the server may have been new but maybe the restaurant should have more servers so that people can have a little better service.  It was just very embarrassing in front of this client as it was our suggestion and she was highly disappointed.
