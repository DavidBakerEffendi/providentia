"C'est Magnifique!"  We must thank the Chef at 'Mes Reves' for a delectable one-of-a-kind dining experience as our palates journeyed from the fine appetizers of Mussels and Crispy Sweetbreads to the scrumptious Crispy Calamari Salad followed by the mouth-watering Pan Seared Duck and Sauteed Skate and ending with their famous Bread Pudding!  Need we say more?  The service and price was also good.  We highly recommend 'Mes Reves' and hope you have the opportunity to experience all this for yourself!
