The owners of this joint need to get off their high horse!!!! This place is just too damn expensive.  Don't bother. The view is spectacular, but that's it.  Go for a drink, check out the view and leave.   In this economy they better lower their prices and get a new chef, $140.00 for three people, two lousy beers and no desert. Get your own water, that's right get up and get your own water. No coffee either!!   The server said we have a coffee maker, they just haven't hooked it up yet. Give me a break, it doesn't take two months to hook up a machine.The owners know the view is going suck the masses in, so they don't give a crap. I had just as good a lobster dinner at the Red Lobster chain.  By the way, the mussels appetizer was disgusting.  My wife had a mediocre sword fish for $28.00, they don't even give you a potato with it.  If you want to throw your money away, this is the place.
