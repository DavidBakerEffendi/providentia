Rude and Disrespectful Owner.   My daughter made a reservation for our party of 8 on 12/7 - the Friday night before the Army Navy game.  When we arrived on time the owner told us that they had lost the reservation but he would take care of it.  We waited outside for 20 minutes and when I had the gall to politely ask the owner about the status of our reservation he was rude and dismissed me.  We went elsewhere. If you want a place that is unreliable about reservations and treates you rudely you will love this place. John from Austin, TX
