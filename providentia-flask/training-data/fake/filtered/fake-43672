Excellent food, friendly service, a very pleasant hang.   I want to say something about the snooty reviews I read about this place: If you are going out for brunch on a weekend day, expect to wait in any restaurant that has quality food such as this one...  And if it's one thing I can't stand it's self righteous "Brooklynites" who lucked into an illegal sublet of a rent controlled apartment, claim they own the neighborhood and then complain about perfectly reasonable prices.   Have you ever thought about what it takes to run a restaurant in these overpriced neighborhoods??
