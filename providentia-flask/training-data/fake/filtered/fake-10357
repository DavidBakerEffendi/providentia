The food and the beers are pretty darn good classic Austrian fare, but service really overshadows everything in a bad way. I spent a couple days in the neighborhood and stopped here three times. It was always a wait for beer, for food, for the check. I sat down at the bar on a recent Saturday night and the bartender counted out his entire tip jar in front of me, about 5 minutes, then asked me what I'd like. That being said, I'd go back and wait some more. The schitzel sandwich served lighty breaded on chewy country bread hit the spot. If only mgmt. could find better help.
