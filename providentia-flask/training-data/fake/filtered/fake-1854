This place has been around since the days of the American Revolution, which makes it somewhat interesting. The food, however, tastes like the menu hasn't been updated since 1977. The pints of beer taste like the taps haven't ever been cleaned. Gross. We had one waitress was nice and one who was distracted and cranky. Also, this place is kind of expensive. I really wanted to like the food and beer, but each bite and each sip just convinced me that this is one restaurant I do not ever need to visit again.
