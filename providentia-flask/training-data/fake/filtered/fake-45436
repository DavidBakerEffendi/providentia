I ate here for the first time today and it was so wonderful! I had a crisp arugula, beet and goat cheese salad with a lovely herb dressing, and a fresh carrot spinach juice. Also the owner gave me a sampling of tangy but delicately sweet homemade frozen yogurt that perfectly topped off the meal. Pure Fare fills a void in that it serves simple, fresh, straight forward food that reminds me of things I might prepare in my own kitchen, but that are difficult to find at a restaurant. I absolutely LOVE the decorative elements too...a blend of rustic, industrial, farmhouse. Very cool! Way to go, Pure Fare! I'll be back, and I'll bring my sisters, friends, mom, and husband!
