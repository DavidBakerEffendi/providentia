We were somewhere around Ewing on the edge of the suburbs when the hunger began to take hold. I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive...." And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with the top down to Trenton. And a voice was screaming "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?" Then it was quiet again. My attorney had taken his shirt off and was pouring Red Cream Soda on his chest, to facilitate the tanning process. "What the hell are you yelling about?" he muttered, staring up at the sun with his eyes closed and covered with wraparound Spanish sunglasses. "Never mind," I said. "It's time for a delicious sub or an 8oz burger made to order from fresh ground beef." I hit the brakes and aimed the Great Red Shark toward the shoulder of the 1980 North Olden Avenue highway. No point mentioning those bats, I thought. The poor bastard will see them soon enough. It was time to eat.
