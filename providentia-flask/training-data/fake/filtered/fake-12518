I have come to eat here a few times since my first experience I keep going back I asked my waitress Nicole what she would recommend so I tried one of the items Â she recommended Tuscan chicken it was great I really enjoyed it.she was an excellent server always making sure i was enjoying my time/meal. I've tried many different items now and have enjoyed everything. I also tried dessert which is rare the cheesecake is to die for I was informed its made fresh there. I will be returning for sure
