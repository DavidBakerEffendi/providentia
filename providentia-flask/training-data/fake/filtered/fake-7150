Enjoyed a delicious brunch with my daughter this past Saturday. The mushroom, cheese and scallion omelet was delicious, and the grits and homemade gravy were especially good. And mimosas are available along with the many brunch options. Everything on the menu looked great. The place has a great vibe, Wi-Fi access, reasonable prices, and a delightful owner/cook. It will be a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to my next visit.
