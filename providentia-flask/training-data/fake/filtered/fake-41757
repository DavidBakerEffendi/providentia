sandwich: A sandwich is a food item consisting of two or more slices of bread with one or more fillings between them If is not a sandwich don't list it under the sandwich menu!!! Had lunch today. Ordered a salmon sandwich from the "Sandwich" menu. It seemed a bit expensive at $19, but thinking of the delicious salmon sandwich at Bonsignour, I decided to splurge. An HOUR later, a salmon filet with side salad was brought to our table. No bread. In my mind, no bread makes it not a sandwich. Told the waitress I had expected a sandwich, since it was listed under the heading "Sandwiches". We looked at the menu together and she agreed that one would expect, but didn't do anything more. If we had not waited an HOUR for our food to be served, I would have made a bigger fuss. Guess I was lucky get any food at all. They really don't have it together, which is too bad because they space is nice and the food was good.
