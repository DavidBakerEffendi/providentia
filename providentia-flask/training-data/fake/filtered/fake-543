Most locals call Genos and Pats "tourist traps" but quite frankly folks, its all part of the experience. If you want some fine dining, hipster experience then go uptown. If you want the turn of the century, greasy South Philly experience, then that's what you get at Genos. Know what to expect, you are eating a piece of history, that's why the price is the way it is (not to mention the rising cost of running a business).
