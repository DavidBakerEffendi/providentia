My coworkers order here all the time and have always said good things about this place.  I decided to try it out, and I ordered my breakfast sandwich over the phone for pick up.  When I got back to work part of the order I placed was wrong. I called to see if they can change it since they messed up my order, and the girl said that it was my FAULT that the order was wrong after I was very specific over the phone with the order. She said there was nothing they could do. Now they have lost numerous customers for good, since they could't correct their mistake.
