I wanted to love them, as Montclair needs good Indian options, and I love the NYC outpost.  But we've ordered twice, and they are batting zero for two.  The first time, I ordered samosas, and very very mild paneer korma.  The samosas were inedible--so spicy that they brought tears to my eyes and made me nauseous. Even my husband who has a huge tolerance for spicy food said they were overly spicy. The korma was great though.   Tonight, we ordered again, and again I ordered mild paneer korma for me and my small son, as well as mild aloo gobi.  Neither the paneer korma nor the aloo gobi were mild, though at least the korma was edible. Both were specifically requested very mild, and still the aloo gobi was painful.  I called the restaurant, and the person who answered asked me "what do you want me to do about it" and either put me on hold and disconnected the call or hung up on me.  I called again, someone picked up the phone and either put it down on the counter, or otherwise refused to answer.  Finally, my husband called and got someone on the line, and after a very roundabout conversation was able to get a replacement aloo gobi (for an hour later--though I understand they're busy, so that was not great, but ok). I have never had an Indian place not  be able to accommodate different levels of spiciness, especially with kormas and samosas (seriously, what Indian place has a SPICY samosa?), so it is extremely frustrating to me to have had these experiences.  I would love to be able to give them more business, as my whole family is an enormous fan of indian food, and the brick lane NYC restaurant, but I am disappointed and sad to say that after our experience tonight and previously, I doubt they'll be getting a third shot. And it's a real shame.
