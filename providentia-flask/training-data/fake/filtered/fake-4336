We just had a great meal at Little Fish last night, but in this horrible heat it's good to know that the staff stays on point and continues to produce delicious meals. If you like seafood done right, this is the place for you. It is very small (as in South Philly rowhouse), so reservations are a must. Menus vary nightly, and are somewhat limited. But this affords the chef-owner to prepare the items impeccably. Service was as good as the food. Last night we had seabass and sockeye salmon entrees, and for starters, a unique and very tasty beet salad as well as a sauteed octopus salad with arugula. Deserts were homemade and terrific.
