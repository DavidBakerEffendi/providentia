I generally go for the noodle soup here - some of the most authentic Asian food in the University City area. That comes with a couple caveats: the shou lamian (hand-drawn noodles) don't have the texture you generally expect, and the broth is a little generic. It doesn't feel like there's a huge difference between the shave noodles and shou lamian. I'd also stick with the 'Chinese' noodles options versus the 'Japanese' noodles (i.e. udon, teriyaki noodle soup). Overall, still very good - a great option when you're craving something of substance. I'm not too familiar with the bubble tea or sushi, but I do think the bubble tea is good for its price point - also some of the best in University City. Convenient and with a large selection. The sushi selection looks good and my friends enjoy it, but that's all I've got. The restaurant interior is new and feels comfortable; the ambience works. Service is above average. They also have a (somewhat expensive) selection of Chinese/Japanese beers.
