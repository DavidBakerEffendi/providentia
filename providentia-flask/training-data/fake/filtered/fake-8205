I've been here a couple of times and I must say that I enjoy this place so much, I at least try to make it twice a week. I really enjoy talking to Julia the waitress. She is super sweet. The food is amazing and the kindness of the staff is amazing. First I talk with Kelvin, the manager, whom by the way is the coolest manager I've ever met, making us feel at home. He sat us down and girls let me just say, look at his butt, lol, Hugh, nice to look at :p then Julia, ask for her. She gives the best service, helps with the pitcher of sangria, which are heavy and recommends the specials of the day. The only downside is the homeless asking for change as you eat outside, but Kelvin steps right up to them. He sees this and kindly walks them away from the restaurant. Good move gorgeous man. Don't look at him too much ladies, he's mine lol.
