My boyfriend and I decided to celebrate our 7-year anniversary at Sugar Freak and it was perfect. We've been to New Orleans and this restaurant was a nice reminder of everything we loved there. The decor is really cute and we enjoyed the little surprises like the spiced peanuts the waiter gave us while we waited for our food. The Boudain balls are tasty -- my favorite are the crawfish balls. We both ordered the beef-n-gravy po'boys, which were yummy but the fried chicken on other people's plates looked even better and I'll probably order that next time. Don't skip dessert! If you like peanut butter as Â much as I do, definitely get the Chess pie. I'm sad that the dump cake was taken off the menu but looking forward to trying the beignets.
