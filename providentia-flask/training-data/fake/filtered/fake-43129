The place seems appealing from the outside, but after eating there I can agree with the other reviews this place will not be receiving my business again. The staff working were unfriendly and one woman was particulary rude. We ordered our food, I had high hopes but was extremely disappointed. Ordered Tom ka gai and the Thai beef salad, both were bland, way too salty and underwhelming. My dad ordered the Tom yum and the Thai salad, his soup was good, but the Thai salad was a joke. A pile of lettuce, with batter encrusted soggy tofu with a few slices of tomato, it was very unappealing. Â I've been eating Thai food for most of my life and this is by far some of the worst I've had. Take the risk if you want to, but don't set you hopes too high!
