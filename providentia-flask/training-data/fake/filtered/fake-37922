Food is always great. They will have things you cannot find anywhere else. Phenomenal sandwiches. Moving out of northern NJ and away from all the great food was painful, but Dolce definitely fills a lot of that void for good Italian sandwiches. This place makes amazing Italian hotdogs too, you just have to order them ahead of time. Very worth it. Prices can be a little high on certain things and they have one or two employees that can be a bit much sometimes, but overall very very good place.
