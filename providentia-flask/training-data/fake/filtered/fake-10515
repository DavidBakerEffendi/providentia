Just like Baja Fresh, but a lot different. The food isn't as styled-up as Baja but it packs a more authentic punch. You feel like you're in Guadalajara when you eat in this place and that's a good thing. Big, spacious eating area and great staff, the Taqueria is the area's best bet for a feel-good meal.
