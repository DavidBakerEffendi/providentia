I wish I could have at least had a dining experience but when we walked up to the door and was asked how many, we were told "no big parties"! It was my girlfriends birthday and we had a party of 6 and was told that we could split up into a party of 4 and 2 but we wouldn't be seated next to each other. When we inquired why, they told us the manager said no large parties because they were under staffed. So we left to go eat somewhere else and never ate and probably won't ever try to eat there again.
