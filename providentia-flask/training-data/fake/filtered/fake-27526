This place is definitely a landmark. I might have been there over 100 times and for the most part, it has been wonderful. The staff were helpful and served pizza that was worth the wait. However, I did run into some small issues that bothered me over the years and thought I should jot it down below. 1. Sometimes the square slices in the center were saugy when we order a box 2. people like to stare at you real hard while waiting for pizza and with the 15 min wait, it gets uncomfortable sometimes 3. parkin is difficult so dont try unless u are willing to double park 4. tables are often sticky But even with all the complains, I still love their pizza so I will keep these 4 stars!
