My favorite restaurant in NYC was Bolo...I was very excited when I heard that Bobby Flay would open a similar restaurant. I ate there a few nights ago and was not disappointed. Loved the veggie dishes (layered potato and roasted carrots stood out)...my very favorite was the chorizo with an apricot mustard sauce (or something like that)...AMAZING.  I definitely will go back.  Loved the deco and service was pretty good too...
