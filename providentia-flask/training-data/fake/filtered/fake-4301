Came here for a baby date on a Wednesday afternoon. The staff was super friendly and energetic. The food was great (we just had sandwiches) and came out fast. When it came time to pack up and leave, our waitress really went out of her way to help us get out. For a pair of first time moms, that was a big plus!
