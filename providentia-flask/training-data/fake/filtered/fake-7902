First, let me say that I love Govinda's...or at least I used to. But it seems that over the last year or so it has really gotten bad. Let me tell you about my last couple of experiences there. I went there one day after work and on the way there, I called to order my food before I get there. I called 6 times and no one answered. I get there and there is only a cook there making food for the people waiting, but no one knew where the cashier went. After 10 minutes, the guy comes back, an older white gentleman, with a bag of something for a customer. He slowly took orders for everyone waiting and I patiently waited my turn. Between ringing people up, he would answer the phone to take delivery orders. He did not know the system and would ask the cook about the menu or how to find things on the computer. He even asked once if they had polenta fries! It's finally my turn and he answers the phone AGAIN! He senses my irritation and says to me "don't worry, there are a bunch of orders ahead of you anyway" Which, most of them were call in orders that he took between other orders. I'm waiting for my food and notice that the cook puts the wrong cheese on my sandwich. I get his attention to explain the error and he tells the cashier that he wrote down the wrong cheese for me (I think this was intentional) I come in two weeks later, hoping for a better experience and the same old guy was there...or should I say was not there...AGAIN! I walk in and the place is full of customers, but no one behind the register. And the cook did not know where he went. The guy was still slow and had a rude attitude toward everyone there because they were upset that he disappeared. I love the food here and it's probably why I keep coming back, but the service here used to be really awesome. They change cooks and cashiers often, which effects the continuity of the business. You're going to lose business if you guys don't get that old rude guy from behind the register.
