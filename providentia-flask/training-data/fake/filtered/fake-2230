i came here on a sunday so maybe thats why it was packed and i waited almost 2 hours to get a table in the COLD, never waited that long to get a table.. i wonder why it was worth the wait and hype. the food was mediocre, quite disappointed that the eggs were the best part, just regular over-medium eggs that i can make myself at home. the hosts were rude she didn't let me wait inside, but i came back an hour later and there were a bunch of people standing around waiting inside. would not be going back.
