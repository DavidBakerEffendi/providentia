Another ship in Danny Meyer's fleet, another journey for food lovers! They run a tight ship, so I'll write a tight review. Professional, knowledgeable staff, great food, wonderful location (the beautiful Gramercy Park Hotel), extensive selection of superb Italian wines. A little hard to get a table w/o reservation during peak dinner hours. Bring your platinum charge card (or a rich friend) and perhaps visit the Rose Bar across the lobby for a nightcap...if you dare feel cool enough. (# of visits: over 20, including for desserts or bar-fare)
