Prior to my most recent experience, I would've given Jose Tejas at least 3 stars. I went there this past Monday for my friend's birthdaythey. They refused to seat us (and all the manager kept saying was "You're entire party needs to be here, it's our policy"). Fine. So we sat at a bar top for a while waiting for our last friend to arrive. The table had just been occupied by another party so I asked the hostess if she may clean it or have someone clean it. Her reply: "Ask the bartender." The poor bartenders were getting slammed with tickets so I felt bad for asking. I asked the manager. His reply: "you need to wait". Yeah. We left. Rude.
