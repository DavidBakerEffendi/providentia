The pizza here is-- in two words-- artistic and exceptional. This is artisan pizza in it's simplest and highest form. It's obvious that here, pizza is absolutely their passion. It's the kind of pizza that demands a bottle of wine or a cocktail because it's food, not a snack or something you mindlessly consume to feel full. The menu is quite short and it's on the pricier side, but the ingredients are so masterfully assembled that what would be a negative somewhere else, is understandable here. Our group ordered 4 different pizzas-- all were fantastic. My goat cheese, fig, and prosciutto pizza was probably the best pizza I've ever had. The place is super tiny, making seating a bit tight. Had there been a wait at all, it would've been a bit awkward. Also, the wait was a bit long. Definitely bring a bottle of wine or two and good conversation! Overall, a fantastic find. We will certainly be back!
