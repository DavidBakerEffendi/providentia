We used Zinna's Bistro for our rehearsal dinner and we could not be happier with our choice! Dawn and her staff were so accommodating and wonderful each step of the way. The food was really amazing. I was wishing I didn't have a wedding dress to fit into the next day so I could've had more to eat! The place is very beautifully decorated. We loved the BYOB aspect because it allowed us to hand pick a few favorites for our guests. We dropped off the boxes in the afternoon and when we showed up it was all beautifully arranged on its own table with all the wine glasses set out. Dawn even saved a copy of the menu for me to keep in my scrapbook. We really loved everything about the dinner, service and planning. Thank you!!
