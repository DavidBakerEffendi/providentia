We found the Hartness House Inn in May and decided to have our wedding there in September. It was perfect every aspect of our stay, our familys visit and our Honeymoon there was amazing. Alla was very pleasant easy to work with and extremely thorough with all the planning. If you are looking for peace and quiet along with a romantic setting look no further. The staff, rooms, food, experience definitely top notch in my opinion. Love this place. The photographs of the wedding were spectacular, and the package deals are very reasonably priced along with the room rates. Their spa is the icing on the cake it truly puts you into a dreamland. I would recommend this Inn to anyone looking to just get away from it all, or a romantic trip for two or bring the whole family this place is good for any occassion.Thank you Alla, Alex and the Hartness staff for making our Big Day the perfect day. Much Love the Lears.
