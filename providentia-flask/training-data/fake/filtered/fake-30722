If you like wild mice running around your table while you're eating, then this is the perfect place for you! Last night, we were sitting in a back corner table when a mouse decided to join us and was scurrying around on the floor next to us. When we brought this to one of the waitresses attention, she informed us that the mice "always come in from the outside of the back room" ....meaning mice visit the storage room and kitchen daily. They kept it very hush hush and continued to let the mouse scurry around the dining area. Luckily, we didn't get our meals yet so we proceeded to leave. This place had violations for live and dead mice found in the kitchen area last year and mouse droppings found in food prep areas. Clearly they have not fixed this problem. None of the staff was shocked by the mouse, so they must see them on a regular basis.
