Wow, I can't believe this place would have any reviews below a four!  I love Tiny Thai and wish they had a location in San Francisco.  I miss and crave the Garlic Chicken dish.  I just can't seem to reproduce the flavors at home.  I always felt that the dishes had great fresh veggies and wonderful taste.  Love it, and miss it. The place is a little crowded, but they were always aware of my little tot.
