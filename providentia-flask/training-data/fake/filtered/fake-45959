I went to tops many of times before but this last time was bad to start my friend received a spoiled steak which he took 2 bites of and sent it back but was still forced to pay for it because the manager (pedro) called the cop. Soon as the cop walked in i knew they was gonna take his side cause the cop walked in and called the manager by name. Pedro the manager have a terrible attitude and no customer service skills. We also found out that we wasn't Â the first people to have this problem with him as stated from our waiter I will never eat at tops never again.
