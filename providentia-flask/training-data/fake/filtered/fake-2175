I have been to countless pizzeria's and this is among the top 3 I have ever been too. I am only talking about the food. I have tried the pizza, veal parm, grilled chicken sandwich, beef patties, mozzarella sticks, and various pasta dishes. The food is fresh and delicious. They chef really knows how to cook. You will be regular once you try it.
