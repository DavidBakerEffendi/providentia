Had early lunch there yesterday, what a great spot.  All open air with the giant garage doors open, so much good people watching it's wonderful.   Now the food, that's worth going for alone.  I had a wonderful fritatta, my wife had the skirt steak salad and we got the "not on the menu" kids pizza and pasta for the, well kids.  I hadn't been there for about 7 years and it was even better than I remembered.
