this place is overrated, it's SO PRICEY and the food isn't even that good, my chicken tasted like lean cuisine microwave food. great drinks though. the hostess will literally bump you on the list if someone comes in and offers them money to move them ahead, a guy came up to me and my friends and said "how long have you ladies been waiting?" "we replied with 45 minutes" he then said "well i just walked in and gave the hostess a $50, would you like to come sit at my table?" we declined because 1. he was an arrogant jerk and 2. he had a nice WEDDING RING on his finger. anyway, we already ordered at the bar or i would have left after that. i personally won't be going back, the food was NOT worth the wait or "hospitality"..it's one of those places you're just paying for the name to say "i went to el vez!" ...not worth it.
