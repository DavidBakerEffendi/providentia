A special occasion treat for our NY vacation, it did not disappoint. The tavern dining room has a great atmosphere, sufficiently formal for an enjoyable dining experience but without being too stuffy. We had the autumn tasting menu. Delicious from start to finish. A succession of beautifully prepared and presented dishes, accompanied by attentive service from Amy, we couldn't fault it. Only one in our party was drinking alcohol, and on asking for advice for buying just a single glass of wine, 2 types were brought out for sampling. One in the party couldn't manage dessert, and unprompted, a boxed assortment of cookies to take home was presented. The prices, as you would imagine, are as impressive as the food, but totally worth it for this sort of one-off special occasion treat.
