My friend and I went here for lunch thinking that we will get decent food. We ordered sheesh kabob rolls and samosas. The food in my opinion wasn't even decent. As a Pakistani, I felt that the food was too bland and didn't have the right touch of spices. The kabab rolls weren't put together properly and most importantly it took a while to make. I don't think I'll be going there again
