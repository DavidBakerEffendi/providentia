The food in this place is so delicious. Over the years, I've gotten everything off their menu- it was all good. Their margaritas are delicious too ;) The only con is their wait. I've gone every day of the week, at all hours (even a Tuesday at 3pm), and I've always had to wait for a table (usually an hour). But when I get a craving for Jose's, I must go! Highly recommend.
