Don't waste your time or your money.  First of all, I can't comprehend how anyone thinks this restaurant is good.  If it's because it's been around forever, is it just that people like lemings keep going there because they've always gone there and don't know any better?  I went last night with a group of 3 and called ahead for seating.  I called at 5:45 for a 6:30 arrival and still had to wait an hour for our table. Granted it was packed and people kept coming in the door but we felt assured that we would get a table because we had called ahead.  WRONG.  After watching the very rude and inefficient hostess, who by the way should take a class in restaurant hosting, continued to call bigger parties ahead of us when she had told us we were the next to be seated.  We sat there while a table of 5, 6 and 16! were called ahead of us. We even witnessed her seat a couple who had walked in and clearly were regulars get seated ahead of people who had been there waiting for a table like the rest of us.  How ignorant can you be to the concept of etiquette and treating all customers the same??   Way to go lady.  You'll definitely draw new customers in that way - not!  After trying to give the place the benefit of the doubt and waiting an additional 15 minutes, we gave up and left to go elsewhere.  I agree with some of the other reviewers on here - there are much better places in the area for pizza like Anthony Franco's (no wait and the staff are extremely friendly), Delizia's in Boonton (again the staff is very friendly, the food is fantastic and the table service is always quick) and for home delivery I would recommend Pasquale's on Main Street in Boonton - excellent pizza and not burned around the edges with disgusting watery, salty marinara sauce like RT's.  I will never go back there and will never recommend anyone return there either.  I'm sure we'll see this place go belly-up once all their loyal patrons dwindle down.
