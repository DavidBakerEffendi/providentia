For $40 two people can get highly salted scrambled eggs (why? maybe because there was no salt and pepper on the table), cold bacon, grits that arrive with a skin on top (microwaved first, with the bacon... and left sitting) and, for some reason, a sad little pile of lettuce and a dish of ketchup (for the lettuce?). If you pay $60 maybe someone will offer a second cup of coffee.
