I am 100% Italian and both parents are from Italy.  I thought I was in heaven when I entered this store.  Right before the Super Bowl, I went in and bought eggplant parm. crespe, artichoke salad, tuna salad, ravioli salad, pignoli cookies, sflogliatelle and calzone.  Everything was outstanding!!!   Next time, I will try some of their soups.  Oh, I forgot - the bread is homemade and awesome also1
