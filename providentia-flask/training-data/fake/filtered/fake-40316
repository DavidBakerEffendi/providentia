I love Cheryl's.  I live just a block away and have been coming here since she opened.  Cheryl and all her staff are real lovers of food, and it shows in the menu and the experience.  its a comfortable, casual place, with great art on the walls, a cool decor, and a nice seating area with outdoor and bar seating as well as several indoor tables.   Come by in the morning, for great strong coffee, their changing selection of homemade scones, muffins and cookies.  Lunchtime salads and entrees are all good sized, flavorful and more-ish (as in, I want more!).  At dinner, I can't stop ordering the steak, rich asian flavor, crispy homemade fries, and nice fresh sauteed spinach make a perfect meal.  You can have it with the mashed if you are so inclined, but Cheryl's chips are really good.   Brunch here is becoming a neighborhood tradition, a great alternative to Tom's or Shane or Washington, and a fuller menu than Milk Bar.  Get there early if you don't want to wait, it is cold and windswept block to stand out on in the fall and winter.
