I have to agree 110% with the Anonymous review.  The women taking orders on the phone are rude and they are rude in person too.  I am allergic to onions and I always tell them "hold the onions" but they never do.  The last sandwich I tried had onions on it and I got sick.  I will never go back to Woodbridge Deli!  I will be taking my lunch orders to Touch of Italy.
