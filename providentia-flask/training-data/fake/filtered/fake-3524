I've given a two star rating because of my last visit to AR. It seemed like they were purposely sending out the most horrible and cold food they possibly could. Sad part is that I have had a delivery from this place and it was pretty good. I took 3 friends to eat here and I looked like a moron for picking this place. Even the tater tots and soup was cold. How is that possible?
