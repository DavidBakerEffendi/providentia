Almost cancelled res because of one-star negative NY Magazine review.  Glad I didn't.  I had the most delish scallops ever, rivaled only by the succulent lemon merengue pie.  Service was personal and excellent.  Black and white decor was warm and well lighted, and we loved the sophisticated artwork.  A great experience!  The NY Mag reviewer was way off base!
