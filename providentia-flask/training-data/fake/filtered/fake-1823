Pio Pio 8 Bacony with a view Meet a friend at Pio Pio last night for dinner. At first glance this place has a weird set-up a lounge in the front, with connect to the bar. Avoid these areas and head to the back of the resturaunt. The decor is very beatiful and calming at bite tight on the bacony but very secuded and a great view of the dinner hall below. Engouh about the spae. The food was great ! So wear the drink my favorite being the Matador Combo and Pisco Â Sour drink.
