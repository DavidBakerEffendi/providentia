let me just say that I really wanted to love this place, I really did. I went here to go to lunch with my mom and when we finally found it we were a little disappointed by how small it was inside. This place has miss-matched chairs and wobbly tables. the space between the tables was so small that in order to get to the wall benches one has to move the entire table. I know it sounds trivial but a restaurant needs to remember that their guests need to be comfortable, moving the whole table makes you the exact opposite. When we went in the place was relatively empty, which made us really glad because, it made us think that we would have relatively quick service... we were wrong, The wait for our food was extremely long. When the food got to us it was luke warm and when I took a bite of the famous fried chicken I was sad to say that it wasn't all that good. It wasn't bad but from the reviews I expected to be blown away especially after the all the great reviews on Yelp. I got chicken, mac and cheese, a biscuit, and a slice of pecan pie. The pecan pie also left much to be desired. All in all, taking everything in to account I would have rather gone to Popeye's, which is really sad considering that the prices were also astronomical. I do have one positive thing to say though, I have never in my entire life had a strawberry preserves that were so good. I would go back to this place only to buy mass amounts of the jam. The jam is the only reason that I gave this place two stars
