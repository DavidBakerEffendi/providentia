Terribly over rated... Awful waitress who took another table of 5's order before my table (party of 2) even though we sat down first.  She also took about 10 minutes to explain the specials to us, sorry to tell you lady; you do not need to tell me every step by step detail as how the specials are made. Needless to say her delay in taking our order (we waited about 20 minutes for her to take our order) caused our food to come about 1 hr after we sat down. Our grilled octopus was cold and the bed of potatoes it was on was also cold.... My squid ink pasta had a squid ink sauce (gross, do not use squid ink in your sauce) and was under cooked.  this dish was over salted, under cooked and all in all it looked like a black plate with black pieces of doodie on it. My gf's pasta was better, but still missing the mark as it was incredibly salty. For a restaurant that boasts a $35 lobster spaghetti this place is underwhelming and really needs to be knocked down from its 4 start status on yelp. Do the right thing and go to shake shack instead, at least there the food does not take 1 hr to hit your table. NEVER COMING BACK
