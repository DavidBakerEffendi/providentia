After having lunch here today I can say we won't be back.  The service was very slow and our waitress very  un attentive to our needs.  my children ordered diet soda that had a funky aftertaste, and had to be taken off our bill.  However, the brisket sandwiches we all had were good, not the best and certainly not worth the money. I guess you're paying for the "neighborhood".  We were disappointed that the brisket sandwich we had only contained one slice per sandwich cut into two pieces..no fries or chips on the side so to me one slice of brisket wasn't worth  $12.  Maybe if the menu was different we may have enjoyed it.  Oh, not to mention the saltines and cheese spread they gave us to munch on prior to lunch.  We were five people and got 6 crackers.   They shouldn't have served something so ridiculous to paying customers.  Overall,  the place was OVERPRICED.
