This place was awesome from start to finish. It was slammed busy and we were able to get a seat in 15 minutes. We got drinks and apps right away. Service was top notch. For apps we selected the cheese plate and brucetta. Then we did a split specialty pizza that was some of the best pizza I've had out to eat in a long time. I recommend going here during the week for good beers and specialty pizzas! This place is so well put together. I will be returning soon, hungry for more!
