Sushi was very good but dining experience was not.  We were there on Thursday 11-14 and were seated on time for a 7 30 reservation and were told at 8 25 it was our last call to order food so we ordered three more items.  At 8 30 we tried to order one more hot sake and were initially told yes then no as we already had availed ourselves of our last chance to order.  When I protested and said we would easily finish it while eating and paying the check they relented and served the sake but it was awkward and my wife was uncomfortable which was unfortunate as we were looking forward to the experience.  The people at the table next to us had a similar experience and we both agreed it was disappointing and we would not be back.  It is not how I expected to be treated when spending over $220 on dinner for two.  They are clearly more focused on "turning the tables" as opposed to a good sushi experience.  The individual confirming the reservation was very abrupt as well which should have been a warning on how we would be treated.
