This is my first Yelp review, so here goes: Met up with a friend around Union Square, and she suggested we try Ootoya. Had never heard of it but apparently everyone else has because the hostess told us 45 - 60 minutes for 8:30 Thursday night! We gave them our number anyway, not expecting anything, but sure enough the hostess called after 45 min and even left a courteous voicemail. Happy to have waited because the food was damn good. Never had Japanese food sets, and seriously one of the best katsu and mackerel dishes I've ever tried. And don't forget about the yakitori. Try: -Chawanmushi (who knew egg custard could be so good?) -Tsukune (just do it, trust me on this) -Buta Aspara (can't go wrong with pork belly) -Saba set (mackerel) Server was polite, friendly, and helpful. Mostly Japanese staff, although the white tall guy and short Asian girl (typical NYC odd couple) at the host/ess stand didn't seem to speak any Japanese. They still managed to keep their cool despite all the hungry people rushing their little host table. Overall great service as to be expected, especially at Japanese restaurants. Our hostess even apologized and thanked us for waiting, not like she could control the popularity of this place. Popularity and long wait time well justified
