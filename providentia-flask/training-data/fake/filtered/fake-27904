I love this place like my mother but what's up with the $4 corkage fee? I understand corkage fees when beer/wine are offered and you choose to byob, but having no drink on offer and then paying $4 to have them unscrew--yes, ahem, unscrew--a wine cap is just plain wrong. I'll keep going, and I'll keep paying, and I'll love every single bite, but this is my (silent) protest.
