Like brunch at authentic brunch places? Penelope is for you. Good food, not too over priced and good service. Also great if you like to wait for 30 minutes to be seated! Hey, it's a popular place and it's in Manhattan...what do you expect? Enjoy a complimentary cup of coffee or tea while you wait. Don't like waiting, come early. I recommend the Spinach Pie (more like an egg Spanakopita). Poached eggs with smoked salmon is also a winner. Add fresh squeezed OJ, a coffee and some good friends and you've got the ingredients for a great morning.
