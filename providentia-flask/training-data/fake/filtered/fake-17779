Pretty good, cozy small place... Really good brick oven pizza. I tried the "Fig" variety with gorgonzola, prosciutto, and obviously figs. Good selection of beer on tap...mostly lighter brews. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. Definitely would come back again... Bonus tip: Get Bam's beef jerky! I tried the spicy "Kill me" variety and it was the best jerky I've had in my life...peppery grass fed beef - delicious and pairs well with beer. Incidentally, the bar man (cool laid back dude) is actually the guy that makes the jerky! It does not get any more local and personal than that! I gave away most of my jerky to my friends(8 of them), all of whom loved it. Wish I got more! :) bamsbeefjerky.com
