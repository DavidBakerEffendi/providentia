To all the Bourdain wannabes who have no problems snipping the tentacles off an octopus and eating them while it looks at you - those things are aware of what's going on. The reason the tentacles keep moving is that they don't just have more nerve endings than a human sex organ, they also function as taste buds and contain neurons - parts of the octopus's brain. The head of the octopus is aware that you are maiming and eating it. How would you like it if some bored food tourist cut off your arms, legs and dick / clit and ate them in front of you while you were dying and trying to escape? Kill the damn octopus first. It will taste the same, and you won't be torturing an intelligent creature just for the novelty of it.
