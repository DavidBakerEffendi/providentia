As soon as I knew I would be in Philly for business I made reservations for my boss and I to have dinner at Amada. I had never dined here before, but I will pat myself on the back because this was a genius move! Not only because my boss loved it, but because he also paid the bill ; ) We ordered the $65 chef's selection of tapas which I recommend. Every. Single. Plate. Was. Awesome ! The food just kept coming and coming. This is my favorite way to dine- tasting and sharing many different things. I especially enjoyed the grilled octopus which I have not found here in Metro Denver. The service was impressive and impeccable without being stiff. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the wine list. Our flatware was replaced after every course and then mid-meal, right when I was wishing I had a clean towel to freshen our table, lo and behold someone appeared Â and cleaned it. I have no idea how the kitchen and wait staff manage which table has gotten which plates but they have this down to a science. Our waiter was even good humored when I asked him ( only half joking) "where is my room? because I am moving in" I simply cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. It is not the cheapest restaurant you can eat at but there is nothing cheap about this restaurant. Everything is top notch and you definitely get your money's worth. It is a great value. By the way... still waiting to find out where my room is so I can move in my stuff ! XO Amada
