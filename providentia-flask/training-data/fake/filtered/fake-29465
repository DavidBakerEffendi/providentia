I was part of the group in Kevin's story below about last night (12/29/12). He pretty much shared what was on my mind, but I'd like to add more. My meal was skimpy to say the least. I ordered the fried Ruby Dee. The fish was fried too hard, the grits were soupy with cheese clumped at the bottom, and the cabbage should've been more than a tablespoon.  My husband & I drove in from NJ, spent $18 on tolls, to enjoy an evening with good people at an establishment we've never been to, only to leave in a sour mood & feeling blatantly disrespected!  We were not loud, but the music blaring directly over our heads was, and the manager (Adrian Stewart) should be terminated immediately.
