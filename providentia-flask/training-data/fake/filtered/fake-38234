What a great idea, owner.  Very south beach, comfortable, lighting was nice as the sun went down. Because you just opened to the public I can understand the slow service, so we'll let that slide this one time.   There is no excuse for the bland food.  The salmon dish was so boring and tasteless, I had to load it with salt and pepper.  The kobe burger, awful!!!!  No taste, no toppings, not even a slight seasoning to the meat.  It's so obvious that it was frozen meat.  We all actually had to go downstairs to Plan b for some "real" food.  We left hungry and dissatisfied.  Also, if your burger is going to be so lame, don't make your own ketchup, have heinz available for your customers. Again, love the front gate style furniture and atmosphere outside, but I would have a serious sit down with your head chef.  Take some pointers from your tenants!! P.S. Don't leave your red wine bottles out in the heat so when they're served it's hot bath water temp!
