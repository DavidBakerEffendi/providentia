The question needs to be asked: why would you go to a place that you qualify as 'quiet' and bring 10 of your friends? It's people like this who ruin atmospheres at places that used to be wonderful, where you could hear yourself think and your interlocutor speak, where you weren't drowned out by riotous laughing and incessant toasts from the big table. If the place is small, intimate and quiet, please please bring your parties elsewhere (if you think you are quiet when there are 11 of you celebrating something, you are sorely mistaken.)
