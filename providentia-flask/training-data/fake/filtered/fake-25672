The cupcakes were good, but not good enough to deal with the service. The first time I went, I had to wait thirty minutes for the ONE girl who was working there to come back from a delivery; the second time I went, three girls were behind the counter, one of which didn't work there, and all three were looking at the one girl's phone. I had to ask to be waited on. And the other two girls just continued to giggle about what was going on on the phone. It was ridiculous. I suggest they higher more mature people to work there, not just ones who can drive.
