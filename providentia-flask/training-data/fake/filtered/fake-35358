I went there today on whim. I had been craving some BBQ these last couple days and decided to give this place a try. Normally I go to Dinosaur (Harlem) or Hill Country (Flat Iron) for BBQ. I am so glad I tried a new place the staff was very pleasant and patient at my request to sample items before I made my selection (sample before purchase is always a plus in my book). Pro- Brisket was AMAZINGLY FLAVORFUL, TENDER and MOIST (exactly what the carver had promised it would :-) ). Brisket had GREAT texture (was not overly chewy). This is a FAVORITE. It outshines everything. Ribs- I enjoyed the ribs that are prepared at Mighty Quinn's. Ribs have a nice crust, GREAT texture, not chewy or rubbery at all. The ribs are not drenched in sauce (I hate when ribs are served in bathed in sauce, especially a sweet sauce). I want to be able to taste my BBQ Rib and control the amount of sauce I put on it (if I need the sauce). Move over Dinosaur, Â I found a new BBQ home in Mighty Quinn's. Hill Country, Its the end of the road for us. Take Out- I live in Queens and ordered my brisket, spare ribs and sides to go. I was extremely happy to see the food MAINTAIN its INTEGRITY as I traveled with it via MTA and had to reheat it in my oven 2 hours later (another plus in imho). Cons- Vinegar Coleslaw/Sweet Potato Casserole - It was not bad, but it wasn't memorable. But I prefer the coleslaw to the sweet potato casserole. Really folks it's the brisket that is the star of the show. I am glad this place doesn't offer mac and cheese I feel that has become to predictable as a side.
