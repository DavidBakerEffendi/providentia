Went to Cheesecake tonight to pick up take out for the wife and me.  Ordered the crusted chicken romano which is my usual and the wife got the four cheese pasta.  When I got home and had eaten about half of my dish I realized there was something unusual with a piece of pasta in my mouth.  I thought it was an overcooked piece but upon closer inspection, I discovered it was a piece of plastic wrap. I immediately stopped eating and got on the phone. After calling three times and being put on hold twice for eight minutes total, I finally was able to speak with a female manager, Janice, who was quite apologetic.  She expressed her concern for my safety and offered to mail out gift cards or refund my money.  Since my food had plastic in it, free food from this location didn't exactly sit well with me.  So I opted for the refund.  Unfortunately, I paid with cash and had to drive back to the location to get the money.  I was refunded the total amount of our meals but nothing extra to compensate me for the time, gas, mental anguish.  All in all, I'm not upset, just disappointed.
