Best dumplings. Make sure to eat the dumplings with a spoon, the 'soup' inside is the secret. The beef noodle soup is also good. Reasonable price, though the wait line can be very long (but relatively fast) during lunch/dinner hour - basically you eat and go. You may have to share table with other diners.
