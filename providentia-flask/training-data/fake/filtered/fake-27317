this place is great. the owner was there when we went and he is very nice and friendly. the food was delicious. the bar is spacious and comfortable. my oooonnnllllyy complaint is that i wish the basement (with the pour-your-own taps) had more, better located TV's for football viewing. other than that, this place rocks.
