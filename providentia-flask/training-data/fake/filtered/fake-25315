I have been coming here for years--used to be a Blimpie's franchise, but the owners decided to do their own thing. Owners Shelly and Ron are incredibly friendly and welcoming, and I have been consistently impressed by their staff over the years as well.  I'm ashamed to say I've never tried the fish and chips or any of the traditional "UK Fare," but their sandwiches are awesome.  The meat, bread and veggies are all very fresh, and everything is prepared to order right in front of your eyes.   Prices are very good--you can get a 6" sandwich, soda, and chips for under $8, and the sandwich is ACTUALLY 6 inches, unlike some sandwich shops.  I never leave hungry, and I'm always happy with my meal. If you're looking for a great lunch spot where the price is right, check this place out.
