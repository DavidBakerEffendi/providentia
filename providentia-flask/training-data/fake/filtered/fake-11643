I work in Skillman and they are a local restaurant that I was told to try. Worst mistake ever! A friend and myself ordered chicken fingers and french fries and asked to have them delivered. Well, when I called, the guy who answered the phone was very rude and he sounded annoyed that he was being bothered to take my order. Well I ordered my food and he told me 45 minutes for a 2 mile delivery! I thought it was ridiculous but OK maybe they were busy seeing as it was lunch time so fine. Well when my food arrived it was cold. Again, I am less than 2 miles away, but fine not a big deal. What the real kicker was, was the fact that they charged $20 bucks and all we get were 3 chicken fingers a piece and it looked like a handful of fries. It was the worst take out experience I have ever had and I will not be ordering from them again. I'll take the drive to Hopewell to go to Franco's Pizza and get good food and good service. Â  tl;dr save yourself the trouble and never order from here. Crappy food that is way overpriced. I would give zero stars if I could because they don't even deserve one.
