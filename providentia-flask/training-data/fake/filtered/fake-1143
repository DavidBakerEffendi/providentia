Fabulous cheese steak egg rolls, and and french onion soup dumplings. In fact everything we ordered at my table of 6 was amazing. The waitress was on top of us, making sure we had enough tapas at all times, while not being too needy or overbearing. Don't forget to order a cocktail, I ordered a sourpuss and it was completely worth the $10. This is coming from someone who typically doesn't order cocktails, especially at restaurants because they always seem overpriced. Great trendy place for a group of friends who like sharing their food and sampling others plates.
