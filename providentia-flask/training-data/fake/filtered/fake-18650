I recently ate at Gramercy Tavern with my family and both the food and the service were outstanding.  We ordered the tasting menu and they were able to accommodate all of our food preferences.  Personally, I don't love duck so they substituted that dish with fish instead.  We absolutely loved our waiter (I feel terrible that I cannot think of his name!). While a little pricey, I definitely think it was worth it.  Great for a special occasion.
