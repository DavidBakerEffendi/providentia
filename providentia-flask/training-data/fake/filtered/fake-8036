After 15 years, still never disappoints.  Fresh ingredients; efficient service; warm friendly propietors; phenomenal pasta selection; delicious pizzas; tasty entree specials; fesh salad; great appetizers; yummy desserts; sensible/reasonable wine prices .... Get the picture? It's a home run for good food, good vino, good service at a super reasonable price.   Now I have a hankering for some Farfalle de Spiaggia, Fettucine Buttera, Black Taglierini, Taglierini Sorrento, Cappelini Limone, Papperdelle Funghi, Tortellini Boscaiola, Minestrone, Pureed Carrot Soup, Pizza Esotica, Tartufo, Tiramisu ... that's the biggest "problem" there, making a choice!
