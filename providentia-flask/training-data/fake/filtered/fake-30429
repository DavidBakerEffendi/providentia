Food - I honestly liked Geno's Steaks over Pat's because it wasn't as dry and the bread was somewhat crispy. However, I can still see some same problems I had with Pat's at Geno's. The meat was somewhat dry, like it has been sitting on the grill for too long and they had to sell it, unfortunately. They definitely had the better fries compared to Pat's but it was honestly like choosing the better between 2 poisons. Price - A little less expensive than Pat's but I would not come back and pay for that. Service - Slightly better than Pat's but it was definitely not superb. I would not return. So overrated. I was upset at the end.
