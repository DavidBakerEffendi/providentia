What used to be a great restaurant has declined catastrophically.  The food used to be tangy and well prepared, the drinks generous and the service was prompt and friendly.  Now the food is just edible, the drinks meager and poorly prepared and the service peremptory at best.  I mourn the loss of what used to be a great place. Regretfully, Pat O"C.
