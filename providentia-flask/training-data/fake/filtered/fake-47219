I had my rehearsal dinner before my wedding at Luca's Ristorante.  I had been there many times with work and enjoyed the food and thought the ambiance was cute, so I thought it would be a good place to host my special night.  What a DISASTER.   1- We show up for the rehearsal dinner and instead of seats being arranged along one long table they had my guests separated at many small tables of two or four.  Now, it's true, I never specified that I wanted my guests to sit together.  I guess I thought that was obvious.  I literally sat at a table alone with my husband.  What? 2 - After they took our orders, we literally waited TWO HOURS for the food.  We actually sat in a chair and looked at each other for two hours.  It was the sort of service I would have expected if I had just shown up unannounced with a party of 24... not the service I expected after planning with the owner exactly how many entrees to put on my menu to ensure prompt service for a large party.  It got so ridiculously late that half of my friends literally had to leave before we could cut our cake : ( 3- When I called the owner the next day to share my disappointment over a dinner that I really had been looking forward to, he actually blamed me.  Though we had discussed in advance how many entrees would work on my menu and I followed his suggestions to the tee, he had the nerve to say I "insisted" on adding too many entrees.  This didn't even make any sense.  I thought maybe after ruining my rehearsal dinner he could have just apologized.
