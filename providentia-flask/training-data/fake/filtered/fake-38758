We were there recently with a large crowd in the back room and everything was great.  The staff was super pleasant and helpful.  The food was very good and served hot.  It is a small place but the location near the Kimmel Center makes it worth the any problems with the coziness of the location.  Great food, service, and location - all winners in my book.
