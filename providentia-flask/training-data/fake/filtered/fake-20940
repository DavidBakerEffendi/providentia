This is the new location and when you walk in it's a spacious place with a little jewelery counter on the left and along the walls little counter seats and a few 2 seater benches by the open fridge of specialty drinks, rolls and salads. Two registers with women taking your order and passing right behind to the make shift kitchen of 3 to 4 women "chefs" who prepare your sammy. I went around 3:30pm so there were no lines just a few moms with their children having a snack and hanging out. Ordered the chicken and buddhist banh mi and the kaya puff to go since I heard so much about the banh mi and damn the Food Network and their Food Truck Wars with the Nom Nom truck winning almost every challenge! My friend like the chicken but he Frenched it up with ketchup? The buddhist banh mi was perfect with the buddhist delight "meats" and the overflow of pickled veggies! I really don't like the big sprig of cilantro but just dealt with it and ate it anyway. I know it's a buddhist delight entree in bread. I saw the "frog egg" basil drink but decided I was not brave enough to try this time. The kaya puff which is a coconut jam pastry was more an air pocket kinda fried empanada with about 2 tablespoons of a carmel colored coconut jam-it was not really sweet and was just ok. Overall the banh mi was really good and better than Paris Sandwich Bakery Cafe. Don't forget it's cash only!
