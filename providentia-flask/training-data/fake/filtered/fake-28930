I stop by a lot for the doughnuts (which are wonderful) but don't usually sit in for a meal. My aunt and uncle were visiting from Michigan so we decided to get lunch here. Both the servers, Allyssa and Demetri were very friendly and greeted us as soon as we walked in. We were told to sit wherever and were brought menus immediately. The service was great and Allyssa came over to check on us and make sure we were all set multiple times. I would definitely recommend it. The Samoa doughnut is my favorite and if you're looking for an actual meal the Juicy Lucy burger is delicious and it was cooked exactly to my liking.
