Went to Lombardi's after seeing it on Food Network and been the oldest Pizzeria in the U.S. I lived in Italy and this pizza is not even close with the low end Pizzeria in Perugia, Rome, Naples, Venice and other places. Poor service, extremely expensive and the staff was ok. They were not rude but not friendly. The wanted 40 bucks for a t-shirt. I can get a NY Yankees cheaper than Lombardi's. Save your money, go some where else and do not fall for the tourist trap.
