I've been here before, and I was very disappointed with our last experience here. The food which we ordered was generally very good.  The chips and salsa were good, and the salsa has a great level of heat to it.  We had terrific mojitos to start.  My wife ordered the squash soup, which was very tasty, and she ate the camerons al chipotle, which was delicious.  I ordered the chiles rellenos, which were fantastic (very hard to find good ones in this part of the country).  However, I ordered two chicken tacos as an appetizer, and they were very under salted.  The rice and beans also tasted like they had no salt. That said, I have to give this restaurant a low mark because of the service, which was really poor.  The bartender was serving our table, and the bar was packed, so we didn't get any attention.  We had to ask for chips and salsa.  My tacos did not arrive with my wife's soup, but instead arrived with our main courses.  When I asked about them earlier, someone just glibly said, "Don't worry, they're coming."  No one checked in on us while my wife was having the soup.  The staff forgot my side order of rice and beans, and I had to ask two people before they arrived.  We needed napkins and water, and again we had to grab someone's attention.  Finally, our waiter checked in on us as we were finishing our entrees.  If someone saw us earlier, would have ordered a second round of drinks, but at that point we were done. If you come here, I would recommend eating at the bar.  The food is great, but at these prices, I really expect good service.
