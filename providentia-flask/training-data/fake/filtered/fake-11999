This is my and my wife's favorite spot to dine.  The tapas are the bestbwe have tried in NYC.  Here's my favorite: Gambas San martin Alubias con chorizo Mussels and lots of bread for dipping! They make a fresh sangria by the glass, go for the pommegrante.  This spot is sexy, chic, and romantic.  Its tight and small but worth it! The staff is young, friendly, and authentic Spanish!
