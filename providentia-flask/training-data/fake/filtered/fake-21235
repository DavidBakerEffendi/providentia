I just moved from MI, and this place is only a 5 minute walk. I ate here for the second time today, and it's awesome. Their breakfast menu is a little small, but the food is really good. They're pretty vegetarian Â friendly, and they have an authentic drink selection (soda with real sugar, both coke and pepsi, I'm a sucker for it). It's a little pricey, but overall, awesome. I'll be back for sure.
