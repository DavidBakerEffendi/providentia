I've been to Papa Frank's a few times before. I was never blown away, but they do have reasonable prices and I did remember the food being all right. However, my last visit was very disappointing. I am a full time waitress and not one to complain, but the food was simply terrible. My boyfriend ordered a large pepperoni pizza and I ordered the eggplant parm. It was as if they had cooked his pizza on a wet tray. The entire bottom was dripping with what looked like a combination of grease and water. My eggplant was mush and just bland. I couldn't even cut into it to make bite-sized pieces. I had to drag my fork around it. My boyfriend is a big eater and wanted to eat half the pizza and take the rest home. He managed to get through one piece and had trouble attempting to eat the next one. We really didn't want to complain, but it just wasn't edible. The waiter came over and my boyfriend showed him the bottom of the pizza. The waiter even agreed that it was soggy and grease-laden. He offered to get my boyfriend something else, but he declined. The waiter brought it back to the kitchen and showed either the manager or the owner. We heard him say loudly "It's pepperoni pizza!" Kind of saying "What do they expect?" We both agreed it's 110% possible to make pepperoni pizza without the bottom being covered in grease. I've done it hundreds of times when I was a line cook. I didn't say anything about my eggplant parm, but I didn't eat much of it. They gave us half price and we tipped the waiter over 20% on what the bill would have been. We were both very disappointed with the food and how the situation was handled with the manager. That is why we will not be returning to this business.
