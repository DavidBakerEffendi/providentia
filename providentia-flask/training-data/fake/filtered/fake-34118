We've eaten here at least ten times. Every time, food, service & ambience are great. I get chicken rostivados (sp); my partner, steak or salmon. Always great. The staff are always attentive but not on top of you. We love the place! Best restaurant on this side of the Q. And one of the best on both sides.
