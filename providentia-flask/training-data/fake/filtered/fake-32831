I just received delivery of an order of a chicken parmesan pizza, and chicken fingers.  I thought I was ordering the "gourmet pizza" version, but I guess I got the plain pizza with fried chicken pieces as a topping.  The pizza was lukewarm upon arrival.  The crust was thick and tough, like it was premade and the toppings were just baked on top of it.  The crust was hard to chew.  It didn't have a lot of flavor.  The chicken fingers were so-so and the French fries that came with it were not up to par.  This is the first time I ordered from this establishment and I won't order again.
