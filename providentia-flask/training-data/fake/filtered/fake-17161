We went here on the fly. We look our 4 month old daughter to walk on the boardwalk and needed good food on the cheap and a kid friendly atmosphere.. We searched Yelp and the reviews made Texas Roadhouse seem like a pretty good place to eat. We both left happy, full and with our wallet only slightly lighter than it was when we walked in. Atmosphere: As soon as you walk in they give you a quick First-Timer's "schpeel" about the bread, world famous margaritas and "Fall off the bone ribs." A very informal, loud (even on a Sunday night!) place where they give you a bucket of peanuts and they encourage you to throw the shells on the ground and make a mess! The only thing I did not like about it was that the red lights cast a red glow on everything. Food: Fresh bread baked rolls every 5 minutes that get brought to your table warm, with a side of honey cinnamon butter. I don't like bread, and I ate a basket to myself. It's was...phenomenal. Our main courses (he got a burger, I got the starter buffalo wings & we shared a "baby blossom" - smaller version of a Bloomin' Onion) were also really good. Neither of us got the cut-on-sight steak. They also offer a pretty cool option to request your favorite cut of beef if you can't find it on the menu. Price/Service: Our service left something to be desired, but our server was very sweet and friendly. Overall I'd say mediocre. But, really, the prices can't be beat. For our meal, plus a drink, it was not even 25 dollars total. And bonus: Kid's eat for UNDER $5!!
