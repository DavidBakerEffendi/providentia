This has by far the best sushi i've had in Philadelphia. The staff is friendly enough and the service is good. They also are not annoyingly friendly or present which is refreshing. The booths are cute and they have a great drink selection (sapporo, asahi and so on) Great place, well kept and amazing sushi.
