I decided to take my girlfriend to a nice restaurant around Gramercy Park - Union Square, since we got tired already from the Bobby's Mesa Grill we were looking for something new, even thought its not a new restaurant it was new to us, especially the price range this range restaurant is in... We had a Great time, service was excellent and food was amazing ! We will definitely go back ....
