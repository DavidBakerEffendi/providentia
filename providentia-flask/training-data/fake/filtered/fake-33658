we have frequented jose tejas since it's opening and always loved the food and service.  however, as of yesterday i think we're truly finished with them.  while the food is always 100%, the service over the years has been going downhill.  yesterday it hit the dirt.  i ordered a poured drink (not from mix) and for the first time ever was told no, they don't do that.  fine, we're seated and place our order, gumbo, appetizer and entree.   we wait, and wait, and wait.  out comes all three at once.  i told the waitress that i really was feeling rushed, scramble thru our gumbo and appetizer to get to our dinner while still hot.  i sent my dinner back because it was wrong as well.  out comes the manager 2 minutes later with what was supposed to be my new entree.  obviously the same one minus the incorrect ingredients scooped off.  i asked about it and he seriously got in my face about how they're too busy to make poured drinks or serve dinners in courses.  he would not let up, and i had to interupt him and ask if it would be okay to speak.  it's truly upsetting that they are too busy to treat there guests properly.  it's unfortunate that i'll not be dining at jose's again, because the food is very good.  the manager, however, needs a new line of work, and a lessen in managing a restaurant properly and customer service..
