The service was fantastic and the setting ambient, warm and inviting. The atmosphere was cozy and romantic but not too overwhelming. The space is lovely with lots of windows and since we had a nice day a few were opened to let the breeze in. That was a nice touch. The apple pie had a good crust, which is obviously the most important thing about a pie and this was no doubt due in part to the pound of butter in the dough.
