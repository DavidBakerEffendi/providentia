I ate here Friday night - table for 2 by the door. I had a reservation for 9:15 the seating was not so great because you couldnt see much of the restaurant. However, the food is great. I ordered the duck - perfectly cooked. The plate was presented beautifully and the taste was wonderful. I had an Argentinian Malbec that was also excellent. I then tried one of their signature drinks that was very tasty as well. For appetizers we shared the Octopus. Good! My wife had the Cod - she liked not loved, but she loves Salmon... The dessert was OOTW! (out of this world) Frozen Hazelnut Parfait! Great experience. Its in the Ink Hotel. I want to try their breakfast next!
