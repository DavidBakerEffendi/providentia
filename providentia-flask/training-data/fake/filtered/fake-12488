Mooncakes was the worst food I had while in NYC.  I ordered the sliced steak with cilantro/ginger sauce and the quality of the meat was barely edible...it was chewy and had no flavor which they tried to hide by drenching it in sauce. My friend  and brother ordered the miso glazed salmon and wasn't impressed although it probably was the best thing I tasted. My sister ordered the steak and pepper sandwhich and had one bite...Lets just say we will not be returning here.
