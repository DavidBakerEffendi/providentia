We were in NYC on a long weekend, and ran across the truck while out for a walk.  My said she remembered reading something about it.  The line must have been 20 deep, and that was at 1:30pm!  I can tell you that it was WELL worth the wait, which wasn't bad at all.  The head guy at the window was making it happen -- taking orders, giving updates and serving plates!  The food was fantastic!!!  My wife, kids and I absolutely loved the gyro, souvlaki and burgers - 5 stars!!!
