My husband and I went for the brunch, which was Delicious!! To start the large cup of coffee hits the spot... then I ordered the pulled pork and grits and my husband ordered their well known maple chicken and biscuit sandwich, which he is still talking about! Oh and how can I forget about the chessy disco tots which are amazing! I wanted to try everything so I had to take an order of the mac n cheese to go, which was perfectly cheesy and creamy with a prefect crusted top. Cant wait to go back!
