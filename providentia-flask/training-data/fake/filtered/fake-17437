WARNING: UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF AND AWFUL SERVICE...the bartender tried to tell us that we left her a cheap tip, and went on to lecture us about how she deserved more, we gave her an 18% tip on two drinks and two appetizers, it is not our fault that a barback swiped half of the tip when she was taking her time serving other customers. I called back to speak with a manager and received the same unprofessional standoffish attitude, presumably from the same ignorant woman who also claimed to be the owner. Completely disgusted, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE, THEIR FOOD NOTHING SPECIAL.
