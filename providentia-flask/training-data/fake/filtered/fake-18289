The Holy Grail.  Any reviewer that gives it less than 4 stars is a vegetarian, a snob, or just plain doesn't get it and should not be trusted. My dad first took me here when I was four.  His dad took him here in the 50's and used to go here for lunch when he worked as a machinist in Clifton in the 40's. I once had 7 rippers and an onion rings as a younger man..... This is the place that dreams are made of.  Nothing beats going to game at the meadowlands and hitting Rutt's on the way home.
