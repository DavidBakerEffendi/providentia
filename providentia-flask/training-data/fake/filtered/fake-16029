They have a HUGE menu I've tried just few things and can say that they have the best Olivier and Vinegret salads in the city. I tried them in almost every Soviet Union related establishment in NYC. Horseradish vodka is the strongest one I ever had as well that is definitely plus for me. Also they have interesting cocktail list I'll definitely try later. Prices are reasonably low but here my complains start. The portions are significantly smaller than should be. I'd rather pay few more bucks for good dish cause right now if feels like half-portion. Bartender wanted to sell few cocktails that we didn't want to have this time so that guy looked little bit obtrusive. Overall 4 for awesome taste and regarding this is new establishment. Next time it will be 3 if nothing changes.
