Walking into Arepa's Cafe is like walking into the set of Cheers "Where Everybody Knows Your Name" :-) Riccardo the owner and I have become great friends. He has a welcoming personality and his staff just compliments his friendliness. I've been eating their yummy food for a year now and have never been disappointed. My favorite is their chicken soup, the cheese sticks (tequenos) and the arepa pavellon :-)...it has also become a great spot for me to meet my clients for party planning. HIGHLY recommend AREPAS CAFE to all you foodies.
