Move over Sichuan style wannabes, there is a new sheriff in town. This establishment pays homage to the true nature of Sichuan cooking. While most imitators pour exuberant amounts of chili oil and spices in to their dishes, and often to disastrous results. This place embraces the multi-flavor style of food that is truly sichuan, and still burns out other places. If the Dan Dan noodles got up and fought up against other Dan Dan noodles, it would be a blood bath of chili oil and hua jiao guts. With the victor undoubtedly being that of E Mei... Even the famous XY restaurants of SF does not even stack up against this beauty n the heart of Chinatown. The wait staff is unconventionally polite for a Chinese restaurant, and the decor has the feel of modern Chinese restaurants in China. Now... if only we could get the owner to put up a better looking sign.
