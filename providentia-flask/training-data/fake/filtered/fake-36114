I recently had a surgery and cannot stand for long periods of time. When I was next for table at the pantry I told the waiter about my condition and sat at an empty table because I was becoming tired. I stood to let the waiter clear the table and he then gave it to the people behind us because as he said "you didn't wait in line". Â He acknowledged that we had been there first but was adamant we didn't follow the rules. I will not eat there again and would urge anyone with a disability to avoid the place.
