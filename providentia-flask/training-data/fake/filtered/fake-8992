Some of my former colleagues and I had dinner and cocktails here last night.  Now, I know what the hype is all about!  There was a large group of us and so we ordered many different cocktails with the help of our very lovely waitress, Liz.  She was very helpful and attentive and guided us through our selections.  She was wearing this cool gold head piece and with her blonde curls looked like a Greek goddess!  Dinner was actually surprisingly good, too, and the restaurant was very busy.  I had their steak tartar which was the best I've had!  My favorite cocktail was a toss up between a cocktail called the Billionaire (it has bourbon in it) or the Lazy Lover (this one's made with cachaca and some jalapeño infusion).  Got to love the names of those cocktails, too!  Oh, and to cap off our night, Liz (our Greek goddess waitress who claims to be of Portuguese decent), suggested we order the butterscotch cheesecake with sea salt.  It was heaven sent!  I suggest asking to sit in Liz's section if you go in for dinner.  She'll make your experience all the better and worthwhile!
