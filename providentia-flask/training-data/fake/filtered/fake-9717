My honey and I went last night and I was thrilled we got a table right away on a busy Saturday night. We knew what we wanted as we are frequent patrons. We ordered a brisket sandwich on whole wheat bread for him and shared a full pork rib dinner with potato salad and mac and cheese. We also ordered the chicken wings. Everything was tasty and the meat had just come off the smoker. This is Carolina BBQ at it's finest. And this includes me just coming back from North Carolina last week! The pork ribs fell off of the bone and were exceedingly tender. May I suggest the HOT sauce to accompnany them? This sauce is just right. If you want spicier go for the EXTRA HOT sauce and up. Dinner was so tasty that when I smelled the peach bread pudding as I walked to their ladies room in the rear that I quickly decided to order a piece to go fresh from the oven. Never mind that we were told it would be fifteen minutes before it was ready... He and I gladly waited for my slice (and I got to pick a corner slice too) to go with his gooey Red Velvet Cake.
