To begin the very long list of why not to waste your money at this terrible restaurant the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. We waited for over 15 minutes to order a drink and then had to hail the hostess to help us because we had no idea who our waiter was. This was particularly infuriating because there were at least 10 uniformed servers and busboys swarming the dinning room area, yet no one approached our table. The hostess also took our order because again our waiter was no where to be found. When the entrees were served one was the wrong dish and instead of apologizing the busboy argued with my mother about what she had ordered. My father and I had finished our meal by the time my mother's correct dish came out. At this point we had already asked for the check multiple times, and my father had to get up and physically locate the manager to get the bill since no one would bring it to us. The food that we were able to eat was mediocre at best and certainty no where near worth the cost. Additionally the menu was very limited and unappealing. After we waited another 20 minutes for the check we paid and spoke to a couple sitting next to us who had to send their pork tenderloin back because it was so rare it looked like tuna tartare. I had overheard the waiter arguing with them about how it should be cooked. Â When we finally were able to leave the man who apparently was our waiter barely whispered an apology as we walked out which was the first acknowledgement of our dissatisfaction with our meal and overall experience. This is clearly another trendy meatpacking restaurant which is overhyped and overpriced. Don't waste your money or time.
