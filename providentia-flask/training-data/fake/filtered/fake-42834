The best Malaysian Restaurant in NYC. Other places have closed down around it including Singapore Cafe, Panang. Â Best dishes is Lansi Lamak, Beef Rendang over rice and the the most famous dish known for its increase in sex drive....ROTI CANAIII.. Out of all the Asian food places in Chiantown, I recommend this place.
