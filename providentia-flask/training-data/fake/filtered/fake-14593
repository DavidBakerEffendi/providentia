Beer choices are amazing- usually something on tap is phenomenal (just ask your server!) or anyone of their bottled/canned beers is great. They have everything from lagers to stouts to IPAs to barleywines to just about anything under the sun! Not a big bourbon guy but my server introduced me to a reasonably priced 'starter' bourbon. Not too spicy, easy on the taste buds, and gave me that 'bourbon warmth'! He even wrote it down for me in case I wanted to buy some! Coming from a food industry/culinary background a sign of a delicious well made burger is one that falls apart as you eat it and melts in your mouth. Two things Plan B gets right. My favorite is the 3 shroom burger, pink! The specials are also out of this world. People are too used to the traditional 'red line' in burger meat that seeing anything different scares them... If you love food, love beer, and looking for a great atmosphere come to Plan B. If not, McDonalds is right down the road... have fun with that!
