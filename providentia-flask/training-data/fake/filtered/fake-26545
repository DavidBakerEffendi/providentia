I went here with my girlfriends and had a great time. It was our first Ethiopian experience, and we all ended up enjoying the food very much. HOWEVER, the following morning they called one of my girlfriends accusing our table of underpaying..which we DID NOT DO. We paid all of the bill+tip, which is why we are NEVER GOING HERE AGAIN. There was obviously a mix up of checks. This place is VERY UNORGANIZED and the whole place REEKS of cloves. yuck. DONT GO HERE.
