Without a doubt the best hamburger I've ever had. At Louis' Lunch, when you order a hamburger, you get a great hamburger which is 100% high quality meat and grilled to perfection. The taste is so good that you don't need any spices beyond the regular garnishes served: sliced tomato, onions, and cheese (if you order a cheeseburger) or if you order: "one, two, three, or whatever quantities of hamburgers or cheeseburgers just say, "your way" that's medium rare with above garnishes included on slightly toasted white bread (the original bread)  Give your first name after you order to be called when order is ready. Original grill ovens date back to the late 1800s and the atmosphere is reminiscent of the long gone turn-of-the-last-century era. Now, for a few inconveniences; the place is small and very crowded, tables are few and at a premium (you are lucky to get a  table) Tips: Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights the place is packed from noontime (opening) until closing time around 2:00 AM, go after lunch around 3:00 PM or around 5:00 PM for an early hamburger dinner. The place should be less crowded. Monday and Tuesday it opens at 11:00 until 3:45 PM. It's a great experience and great for a tour of Yale University Campus before or after..
