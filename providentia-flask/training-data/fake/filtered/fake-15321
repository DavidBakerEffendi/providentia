This place is so great.  I think it's owned by the same people who own Wyckoff/Starr, which is my favorite coffee shop in the neighborhood, but Ghia is a whole restaurant and bar.  The servers and bartenders are always super nice and helpful, and the food is great, especially the grilled cheese with apples and mustard.  They're not open super late but it's also a nice place for an after work cocktail.  Oh, and also they have brunch every day!  Yay!
