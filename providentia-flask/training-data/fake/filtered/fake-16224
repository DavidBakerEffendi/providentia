I've been to many restaurants in nyc but this is my favorite I've been coming here weekly for well over a year.I am always greeted by one of the managers and they make you feel welcome Gadi,my waiter, always makes you feel good even if you had a not so good day..The food is excellent with the tuna crudo appetizer as my favorite..The burger is always cooked to perfection and the branzino(sea bass) is always one of my favorites..Usually skip dessert but when my guests have dessert they really enjoy the oreo milkshake Great food,fun place,welcoming staff that always remembers the regulars and treated well I always look forward to my next visit
