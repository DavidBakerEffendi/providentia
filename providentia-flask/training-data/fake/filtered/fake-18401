We went for my husband's birthday and we have the worst experience ever. He ordered ceviche. Right after the first bite, he pulled out hairs of his mouth. The staff and the manager did not handle the situation at all. We waited 10 min before someone get back to us after he showed his plate. Then the manager make us wait again ( I do not really why). We finally decided to leave no matter what. I asked for the check. We waited again... 10 minutes later the waitress came back and told us we do not have to pay the cocktails and the appetizers... So disappointing! What about all the good reviews and the prizes Seriously?!
