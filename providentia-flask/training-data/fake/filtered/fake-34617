My brother took my husband and I and another friend for dinner last night. The food was EXCELLENT! My shrimp scampi had a side of Linguine cooked al dente and seasoned sooooo good!! The shrimp excellent! The appetizer of artichoke hearts franchaise was another tasty surprise. My friend had the swordfish and was really pleased. I think the food was outstanding, plus it was a busy Saturday night and our service was top notch, kudos to Carlos for great service. I look forward to another evening dining out, Good Job Anthony!!
