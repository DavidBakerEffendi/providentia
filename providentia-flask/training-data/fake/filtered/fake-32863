Just had lunch at the beautiful, new Wedge & Fig in Old City, Philadelphia. The new chef makes beautiful, delicious food that is creative & perfect for lunch. The cool borsht (fresh beet soup with the perfect addition of cucumbers) was not only tasty and refreshing but visually perfect. The sandwiches and salads are unique, not the same old, same old. There are some interesting twists on comfort favorites like grilled cheese & mac & cheese. There is a wonderful selection of teas and coffees and the desserts are unbelievably delicious. The attractive, friendly owners and staff complete this very satisfying experience.
