I had dinner there last night. It was my first time. The d√©cor is very nice, so I was expecting a good meal. I was sorely disappointed. Our server was great, very pleasant. We all ordered appetizers, and they seemed t take forever. I opened with the vegetable spring roll, which was cooked well, but needed more filling. My main course was the Drunken Noodles (Shrimp), and it was horrible. Every item (noodles, shrimp, veggies) was severely over-cooked. The noodles to the point where they were almost mush. The sauce was overpowering, and completely drowned the noodles, etc. I'm ot sure if I'll return.
