Best Romantic Winter Getaway! Just got back from a wonderful weekend at the Inn. Atmosphere was peaceful and charming. Service was exceptionally good and well above any place we have been to before. The innkeepers and the staff did an amazing job in taking care of any of our needs. Breakfast was 10 out of 10, and started every morning perfectly. We were also lucky to be there when it snowed - BEAUTIFUL ! The location is was only 20 min from Okemo mountain, in which we skied (ski conditions were great!) We will definitely come back to this lovely place. Yoav & Hadar
