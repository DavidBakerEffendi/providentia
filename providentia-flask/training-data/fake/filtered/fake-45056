Best pizza in town. Grew up in Hamilton so I know all the places around town for pizza, and Mario's is by far my favorite. While the atmosphere isn't the greatest because they always have loud Italian soccer games on the TV, the owners are extremely friendly and make sure that you enjoy your meal. Even gotten free zepoles a few times for being a regular customer. Their crust is amazing and they never skimp in cheese. Their mushrooms are also my favorite. Best pizza in Hamilton.
