I ordered Spaghetti with Pesto Sauce and grated cheese, meatballs in marinara sauce, and cheese garlic bread. I got penne with dry pesto sauce and no grated cheese, heated up frozen meatballs in marinara sauce, and a hoagie roll barely toasted with a gross amount of minced garlic and barely any cheese. I thought it would be a good idea to order from here because it was a little cheaper than surrounding italian restaurants, but now I can see why. Hey, at least I got a free slice of pizza the delivery guy accidentally gave me with my food? Definitely will not be returning.
