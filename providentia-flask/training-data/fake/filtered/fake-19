Nice setup and atmosphere for a chain and the service is very good. The food is decent but the portions are tiny.   My eight year old had to order a double mac and cheese for $8 because the single portion is sooooooo tiny.  My wife's shimp and pasta have tiny shrimp and the chicken and pasta I ordered really skimped on both the chicken and the pasta.  I dont expect miracles but for the prices they charge they could give you more than a tiny portion.  Years ago they had larger portions but in the past year we have really noticed how small the portion is.  The waiter apologized and told us that management premeasures the portions and he agrees that they have gotten very small.  Unfortunately he cant change management directives.  They get a 2 only because the little bit of food you do get is actually pretty good.
