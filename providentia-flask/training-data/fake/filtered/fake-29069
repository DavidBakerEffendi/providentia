I live a block away and have been here dozens of times. The sandwiches are consistently very tasty - no complaint regarding the food. However, each experience is marred by the scowl and nasty attitude of the woman (asian) who is at the front taking orders. She seems to be there about half the time - all of the other cashiers are friendly, warm, and professional. If you are the owner, please be aware!! Treating your customers with basic respect which includes a smile & saying 'thank you', rather than a scowl and NO verbal response, should be MANDATORY at any restaurant which cares about it's reputation.
