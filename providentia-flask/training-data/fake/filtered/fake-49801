This place is probably the best shabu shabu i had in NYC. (My favorite one is in LA japanese town). I usually go for lunch since the line is a lot shorter than going in for dinner. On top of the shabu shabu, i always also get BI BIM BAP, the hot ones, with eel or bulgogi depending on my mood that day. MUST TRY!!!
