There is a reason why this place is always packed.  Sushi is very fresh and never had a bad meal.  I usually do take-out and it's just as good.  I eat in the best restaurants in New York City and I was so surprised to find this GEM in my town.  Not a place for a romantic date because it's so small, but definitely great food...food is priced well also!  Enjoy!
