LOVE this place and got everyone in my office to love it, too.   They make the BEST Taro bubble tea, hands down.   I'm a big fan of their Mushroom / Pork noodles, but those who like a bit of spice should try their Singapore noodles (that's an office favorite).   We order a lot for lunch and they're always really fast for us.  However, it seems their busiest time is about 12:30-1:30 (which makes perfect sense), so we always try to order by 11:45.   Order from here!  You won't be disappointed!  I've never actually been to the restaurant, though, so I can't speak for the facility, but their food (and service) is top-notch!
