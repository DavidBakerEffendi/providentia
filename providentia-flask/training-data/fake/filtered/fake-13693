Taste just like my grandmama used to make from cuba.My fiance took me for a suprise birthday.I was soo happy to find out this little placed existed .The food so devine Vaca frita with black beans and white rice is just the food we grew up with.The flan was tasty. I don't drink but my fiance said the mojitos were perfect. All of my friends have been here at some time so we couldn't stop feeling nostalgic about the place. We will be back.Too bad you can't really dance but the live music was great .I tried to convince the management to give me the beautiful painting but they said they can't so I understood...
