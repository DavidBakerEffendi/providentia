Blue Ribbon never disappoints! The vibe is super chill and the staff friendly. A trip to Blue Ribbon wouldn't be complete without the east-coast oysters and the bone marrow. Delicious!! All of the different mains we've tried have yet to disappoint either. Shrimp with cheese ravioli, flounder, hamburger..just to name a few. Very tasty. Drink menu is good, and if you fancy an "Old Fashioned"...this is the place to get it!! :)
