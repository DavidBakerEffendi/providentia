Come here for lunch buffet for sure, but maybe skip on the dinner.  Their dinner menu is waaaay overpriced.  I don't really get why a lentil dish should ever be $12, even if it is amazing, and their food isn't amazing.  It's pretty good, however, and their samosas are delicious.  On the other hand, the lunch buffet is very worth the money, with a great variety of dishes, many of which are vegetarian and even vegan. With that being said, the service is great.  I ordered a black lentil dish assuming that it was dairy free because other dishes with cream in them mentioned the cream on the menu.  When it arrived I could tell there was cream in it, and I planned on asking to have it boxed up so my fiance could eat it later as it was my mistake to not have asked prior to ordering.  However, all I had to say was, "Do you know if there is dairy in this?" and immediately the waiter offered me a dairy-free lentil option and traded it out for no charge.  It's rare to find that kind of customer service these days, so it made my evening. I will continue to come here for the lunch buffet, but probably skip dinner next time because of the prices.
