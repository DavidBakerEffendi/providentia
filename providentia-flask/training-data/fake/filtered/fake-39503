What an amazing coffee shop! Just got back to the UK from a holiday in NYC and visited Manny's most days as I was staying in Bed-Stuy. If you want great coffee, a choice of fresh, tasty pastries and service with great humour, then pop in and see Michael - he's the tall guy with the big beard! But Manny's is so much more than a coffee shop as the hot food is excellent too. My burger was simply superb - clearly made from fresh ground meat and cooked to perfection. We even bought a couple of their chicken broth dog biscuits for my Labrador and he loved them. This place is getting busier by the day and satisfied customers are happy customers! Thanks for the great food and service Michael. :-)
