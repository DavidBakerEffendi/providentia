A good place to have a sandwich, but avoid getting any catering from Katz's. I recently ordered a deli platter for 25 people...it was not ready at the time we agreed to pick it up, so I asked for it to be delivered. I then got a phone call from the owner YELLING at me for being such an unreasonable customer. When I said I was going to hang up the phone, he said "Oh no you're not....you're going to listen to me!" Can you believe the nerve of this guy to treat his customers like that? Especially after placing a $300 order? When I told my friends about this they laughed...apparently the owner has a rich history of treating his customers like dirt. Beware...because this is one person that is now an EX-customer.
