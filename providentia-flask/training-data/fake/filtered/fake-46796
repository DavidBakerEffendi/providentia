I'm very disappointed in Ten Stone.  It should be a great neighborhood joint, but it instead offers nothing that makes me want to come back anymore.  I had some fish tacos that were pretty gross.  The fish was totally flavorless and almost slimy; it must have been frozen product.  Even the tortillas were a bit stale.  What bothered me most, though, was the beer.  I ordered an Evolution No. 6 double IPA, which has a 93 score on BA.  It was undrinkable.  I don't know if this was due to dirty draft lines or some other issue, but that's unacceptable, particularly in this neighborhood. Add slow service and an overly-loud atmosphere, and I'm done.
