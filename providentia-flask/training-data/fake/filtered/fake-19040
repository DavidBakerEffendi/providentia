Soooooo gooey, warm, and delicious.  Definitely try the signature Artichoke pizza, but be sure to grab a Margherita slice. Mmm... my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  By far my favourite pizza in NYC - It's a must-stop any time I'm in the city. It's a really small place - definitely grab and go.  I've heard there's a sit down version in Chelsea, but haven't had a chance to visit just yet.  Even with a line here, I've never had to wait too long.
