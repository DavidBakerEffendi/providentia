I like this place itself, and even better after its renovation. The bathroom fix is probably the best thing they did. The food is good for a casual hangout place. The main problem for this place is the rude staff, especially the front desk. I mean it's the face of the restaurant and they should really train their people to be nice and polite to the customers. No no!!!! Another problem is the long wait, especially in the evening, so try brunch instead. The outdoor table is too small and barely fits a glass and one plate. Music tends to be VERY loud, especially in the evening, so if you are not in the mood for yelling at each other, then pick Â somewhere else.
