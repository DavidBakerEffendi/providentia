It's kind of hard to describe the feeling of pure satisfaction one feels when dining at Miya's. But I can try. For one, I think feeling like you're really pushing your own personal culinary boundaries is rewarding. But after dining with the folks at Miya's over and over again, you start to realize that it isn't a gimmick or "unusual cuisine" for the sale of being different. It's all very real and really and truly motivated by love. I've gotten the chance to speak with lots of the staff at Miya's over my many visits, and I've realized that everyone has such an immense passion for creating dishes that are not only pleasing, but also take into consideration sustainability and environmental impact. In addition, I feel like it's one of the only places I've ever eaten where I feel like I have done something truly good myself when I leave. I feel like I have explored new things, tasted flavors I didn't know existed, and increased my understanding for what the environment just around me is able to provide. If you go to Miya's expecting "sushi" in the traditional sense, I must admit that you will be not necessarily disappointed, but extremely surprised. I would invite you to visit Miya's with as open a mind as you are able to muster. I think you will be moved. And I think you will be back. Miya's is an establishment that aims to please as well as educate; you will be impressed and amazed by what such simple and commonly found ingredients can become. It will make you completely reexamine what you have come to understand about locally harvested foods. Miya's isn't some sort of weird "fusion" cuisine. It is just simply good ideas that are not afraid to take risks and act on passions. It's perhaps the purest of soul foods around.
