I can't understand why people don't like this Place. This is honestly the best Tex Mex I've eaten. Great Food with fresh homemade tortillas, cheap prices, fast friendly service.. Seriously? What is to complain about. Yeah, its a quick service restaurant, with no waiters and no table cloths, but who cares? I go here at least once a week. I used to go 3 to 5 times when I worked closer. Annie and her gang are the sweetest people around.
