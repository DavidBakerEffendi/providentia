This place is absolutely the worst place on Staten Island. Not just that we found bugs in our meal, not that the waiting staff are rude but the security staff on Sunday night threatened me and my colleagues from work with physical violence because we were discussing moving our work function from there location to another because of the disgusting conditions and treatment. I will ever go there again. I suggest no one go there. The staff and manager do not know how to treat there patrons. If I could give zero stars I would!!!!!!
