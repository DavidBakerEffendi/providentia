I really like this place! Its very cute and posh and the service is great. A nice spot if you want to watch any game. Its also fun at night, because the music is good! I had the bison burger and it was very tasty. Looking forward to going again to try the other food. Bartender that night was awesome. She really knows her drinks. I had an old fashioned and it was just perfect
