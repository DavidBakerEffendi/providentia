My girlfriend and I tried this restaurant for the first time on our 3 year anniversary. The atmosphere was amazing and the food was delicious. We were delighted that Bertuccis had a multigrain dough option, which turned out to be both healthy and tasty! Andy, our server, did an excellent job accommodating us and the manager was very friendly. The manager even showed us a cool math trick! The cookie dessert melted in your mouth and was, quite possibly, the most delicious dessert I've ever had. Would highly recommend this establishment to anyone who loves authentic Italian food and delicious oven fired pizza. PS: Get the Mozzarella Fritta as an appetizer, you wont regret it!
