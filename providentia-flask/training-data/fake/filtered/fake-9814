My girlfriend and I absutely love coming here. We always have an extremely long wait but we don't care. We just post up in the back bar area and have a thousand drinks until our name is called. What a fun atmosphere. You can also order food while you wait so if your girlfriend gets cranky when she's hungry you won't have a problem. Great drink selection, great charcuterie, cool vibe, great tunes. Now the food. Absolutely best pizza on the planet. I think all the reviews must say that. Something about their bread and toppings. Gotta stand in the front and just watch the cooks making the pizza in the oven. It's mesmerizing. Now a word to the wise: THE PASTA IS AMAZING!!! Ask which pastas are homemade and order all of them. Do not sleep. Also the ribs are shadily unreal. I hear the burger is amazing at lunch but I won't really have an opportunity to come at lunch ever unfortunately. Anyway, to the folks at Roberta's, we love you!
