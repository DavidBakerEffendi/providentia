This is the most beautifully decorated, most delicious tasting, melt in your mouth mithai ever, period. One can simply never go wrong with choosing from the wide assortment of mithai Quality Sweets offers. Also, they have a great variety of snacks and appetizers to choose from such as samosa chaat, papri chaat, dosa, etc. The papri chaat here is amazing! The lady behind the counter is rude and obnoxious at times. It is okay to set her straight if needed.
