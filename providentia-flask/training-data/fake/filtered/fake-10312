I was really excited to try the new Junior's restaurant after the long delayed opening. I have been a long time fan of the Colchester and Burlington restaurants and eagerly awaited their grand opening. After having dinner their I must say that I am a bit disappointed. The menu is limited, and the portions are small, but the prices are high compared to the other Juniors locations. I would recommend making the drive to the Colchester location before Â coming back here.
