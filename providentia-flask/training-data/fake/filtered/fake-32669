Pub46 is def a good time..with $2 mug night on tuesday you can't go wrong. The $3 to $5 shot specials all night is pretty awesome. The shot specials aren't cheap shots either, they change it up all night going from Cuervo to Jager bombs and Soco and lime shots. Also if u get there before 11 on Tuesday you are entered into the raffle (for free) to win a trip to Las Vegas! The food is awesome and the kitchen is open all night. There is an outdoor patio that you can smoke in and bring your drinks w you!
