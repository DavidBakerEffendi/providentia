An adorable restaurant on the corner of a busy avenue in the greatest city in the world. Upon a friend's enthusiasm to try this restaurant, several of us met despite my apprehensions about a food rather exotic to my palate, Turkish. The service was friendly, patient and accommodating. We began our meal with some excellent bread, a puffy moist on the inside, crispy on the outside, pita like. The menu is rather brief but I found something to satisfy my picky taste buds, roasted free range chicken or something of that sort with rice pilaf for $12.50, fairly reasonable for this pricey city. As my food arrived I was excited to see the extensive amount of chicken that was provided for me, 3 sizable pieces- positively fantastic, excellently flavored and spiced to perfection arranged daintily with delicious rice pilaf and some shredded carrots (with a strange dressing). For those slightly more adventurous then I, this particular restaurant has an extensive appetizer menu (mezze), similar to tapas. Overall, an excellent dining experience, even though it was fairly busy for a weekday lunch, we were not rushed at all and the restaurant itself is very quaint.
