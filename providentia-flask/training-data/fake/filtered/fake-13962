Two of us went to El Vez at the recommendation of our hotel front desk clerk. The restaurant was vibrant and full on a Monday night. They were very accommodating and our wait, without reservations, was quick. We shared the guacamole - which is a house specialty and should not be missed. It was creamy and a bit spicy -- just right. We shared the seabass tacos but after taking one bite, I really did not want to share them anymore. They are on the smaller side and just right for lighter appetites or people who've just ate their body weight in chips & guac. we also shared the mixed enchiladas which were 3 - one shrimp, one chicken and one black bean. All were terrific and this was way more than enough food for two. margaritas were great and service was attentive but not smothering. I would definitely go back to El Vez when I am in Philly again.
