Was there few time's as we miss food from home but the food was just ok, small portion..roti chanai was tasteless, 5 medium size prawn which they call jumbo for  $23.95..slightly expensive, rendang beef was good as the meat are quite tender,  chicken rice was ok. The last time was quite dissapointed  and embarrass by one of the waiteress (older one with short hair)  as mum pay for the bill and she got the tips wrong. The waiteress was like almost yelling at us telling us she got paid peanut and depend on tipping which was couple of dollars short  :(. Will not go back again.
