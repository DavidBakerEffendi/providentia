In my opinion one of the top-5 pizza in NYC. Just to be clear: this is NOT the kind of place where you'll find the typical old-fashioned, gas oven, domestic mozzarella, cheap slice. Sottocasa's pizza is a distinct Neapolitan experience: smaller, puffier, tastier ingredients in a no nonsense environment that constantly delivers what I expect. I just wish they were open a bit later but given the level of artisanship we find there I'll forgive them :)
