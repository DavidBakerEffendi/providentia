MICE!!! We saw a mouse here and all they did were take two drinks off our bill. The wait staff also treated us like cattle. HORRIBLE experience. Especially for a high priced bill. There are rodents all over NYC but this is a case where how one handles the situation tells you a lot about the restaurant. We were told the following regarding the mouse: "i've never seen mice in THIS area of the restaurant", "at least it wasn't a rat, right?" "the exterminator is coming in 45 minutes, it's funny you saw the mouse because I just called an exterminator earlier". Totally crazy. Will never go back here. DO NOT EAT AT THIS RESTAURANT.
