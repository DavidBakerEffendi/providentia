The food was mediocre at best. But the service is why this place gets one star. They took almost an hour AFTER we ordered to bring us our food and when I mentioned something to our waiter about this, the owner came out and proceeded to berate our entire table. Not only was he screaming in a restaurant that had other patrons, but he was swearing and even made a comment about my mother. I have NEVER seen such unprofessionalism in the restaurant business. The restaurant also smells strongly of maple syrup tinged with urine. Go here and pay the price.
