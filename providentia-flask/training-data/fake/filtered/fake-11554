My boyfriend and I went today. I didn't like the soda. It was flat. I had ordered nacos an it was good but not great. Then he ordered a steak burger and I order the lobster and seafood pasta. First I didn't like my pasta because it felt like it wasn't cooked all the way. My boyfriend ordered the onion soup but it was all watery and discussing. He didn't like his steak burger because he said it smelled like "poop" and they put mushrooms on it, that he didn't ordered it. So we sent it back so I heard the chef got mad. At the end of our meal we talked about not coming back.
