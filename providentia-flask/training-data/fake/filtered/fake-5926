One of my favorite NYC places to eat! We walked in through the stone side entrance , feeling like we were in someone's home rather than a restaurant. This place is small and packed but with delicious, fresh local food. The menu changes often but last time loved the Atlantic sea bass and the Quinua dish ( actually my friends, but I had a few bites of her's).
