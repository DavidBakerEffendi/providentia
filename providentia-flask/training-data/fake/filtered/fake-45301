The Bhel Puri here is below average. The Dahi puri is below average. It should have at least 50% more curd/yogurt in it to feel full. The Taste should have been much better. The Lunch special tasted good with the kofta side. The puris were freshly made. Â The sugar cane juices can be better. The staff were friendly. A suggestion to the management would be to have a person to greet the patrons when they arrive especially when you have a sign which says 'please wait to be seated'. At vist once more only to check if there I anything better - else that would be the last time.
