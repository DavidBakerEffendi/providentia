We have just had a wonderful dinner at the Arena Patio Restaurant. Could not have been better! Service...excellent, waitstaff...excellent food...excellent. Perhaps other reviewers were there too earlier. I always wait 6 months before trying a restaurant. Some don't make it that long and others need to get the procedures coordinated. This restaurant certainly was great!
