Maybe it was because it was a friday night and they were packed out (had to wait for about an hour for a table for 6, but we didn't mind because we were at the bar) but everything tasted subpar. The grilled steak was swimming in a broth that wasn't too good. The mussels had a fishy aftertaste, and overall, it was not an impressive experience. Nothing made any of us say "Wow this tastes good." The only marginally good tasting things were the pineapple fried rice and the pad see yue. This place fell off, used to be much better. But the atmosphere overall was not that great either. Super loud, like a cafeteria lol.
