The reviews by John, Allison and Janelle are enough to give me indigestion.  Fortunately, the food does not. John should stick with pizza places.  He doesn't seem to appreciate good Italian cooking. Allison's review is unbalanced.  What makes a homey Italian cuisine with three venues "weird?"  It sounds like she just had a bad day. I don't even know what to make of Janelle's review that goes back 22 months.  She probably had her own beef!   I've had the pleasure of eating at Marzullo's for three years, at least once a week and usually more often.  The staff is always pleasant, the service has never been a problem, and the food is always delicious.  I've eaten everything from the pizza, wraps, paninnis and salads to the pastas, main entrees and house specialties, and have enjoyed them all., If you want to feel like one of the family, no problem.  It's like eating at home.  And Rafaelle always makes you feel like family. tmc710
