Just getting home from my 6th dinner here in the short time this restaurant has been open.....just love everything about it...... Tonight was my 3rd and final birthday celebration, all which have been here Â at Stone Hearth... Every time we have dined here, we all loved our meals.....from apps like pizza, to salads to entrees and desserts....all really really good.....and you know you can also dine relatively healthy with paleo foods, foods under 500 calories etc.... Bread made on premises....creative salads...entrees include fish, chicken, steak, pasta....I love the bucatini with fresh tomatoes and mozzarella, and the meatballs with spaghetti squash....desserts awesome...... Good price point... Manager Howie is very personable and attentive. ...really cares!!! Love our server Jessica.... Warm , comfortable and inviting atmosphere... Child friendly as well......on one visit came with our granddaughter!! Can't say enough positive.....do go yourself to see what I m talking about and enjoy!!!! Jeanie H
