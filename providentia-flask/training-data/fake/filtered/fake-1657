Vivo is a local favorite of mine because of three key reasons:  price, variety, and location.  Not only can I walk here from my apartment, it is within walking distance to Penn Station for tourists and its free parking lot is recommended as ferry street can be hectic.  Whether you are health conscious, or a carnivore, the menu offers plenty of variety.  Recommended are the tapas and paella, along with 10 or so other items I have tried in the past without any flaws  Even if you just order sangria, they will bring the bread and garlic dipping sauce with it!  Prices are on point and are very reasonable for the area, given the density of Spanish/Portuguese at its disposal.  Plus, why not use a coupon?  Vivo offers you to buy them and I truely believe this strategy stimulates their business.   ALL PROS, No cons!  Except, I would like to warn anyone eating past 9pm will begin to notice chairs and tables being moved by staff.  Please acknowledge that this is a lounge late night with all due respect.
