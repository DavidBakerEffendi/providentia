If you are a burrito lover then I recommend you try this place! Unlike the chain places where the burritos are loaded with cheese sour cream and guacamole in which those 3 ingredients can make a shoe taste good this place has the perfect amount of those ingredients to compliment the delicious seasoning of the chicken and steak. It's not greasy and has the perfect amount of everything that makes up a burrito where you don't feel like you clogged every artery in your body. My husband and I get the chicken burrito with avocado and the cheese empanadas at least once a week for dinner.If you want authentic,fresh,non greasy mexican food then you gotta try this place!
