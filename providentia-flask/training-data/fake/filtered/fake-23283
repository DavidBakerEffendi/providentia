The food was well prepared, but one course was lacking some flavor. I had the mushroom ravioli as an entree, and my boyfriend had the duck, which he loved. We both agreed that the ravioli was weak. Other than that, I've had excellent meals there in the past, and I wouldn't let that one dish sway my opinion that this is a truly wonderful restaurant. All our other courses were splendid, and it's a beautiful atmosphere.
