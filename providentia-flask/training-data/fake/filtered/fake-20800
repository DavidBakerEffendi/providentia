This bistro is phenomenal. One of the best french restaurants in the city, up there with Jean-Georges ( - the gastro). The mussels, escargot, and monk fish are my favorite dishes. I am also especially fond of the much disputed dark chocolate profiteroles. The entire staff at this restaurant is gracious and very assertive with keeping the liquids and dishes. If i am not in the the central park region and crave french food I will go to Sirene without so much as a thought. This restaurant is FRANCE! Cons: interesting bathroom, cash only, tight quarters. This place would do outrageous business in a larger spot with a liquor license.
