My fiance wanted to have dinner at El Almacen for her 31st birthday. Our two good friends got an hourly baby sitter and the four of us showed up on a Saturday night at 7:30pm for dinner. We knew they didn't accept reservations, so we showed up early to get on the list for a 4 top, and expected to wait at least 20 minutes. The hosted put our name on the list, took our number, and gave us an estimate of around 30 mins. No problem, we went to have a drink at a bar near by. I made multiple trips back and forth between El Almacen and the outside bar we were at bar for 2.5 hours. Every time I went to check on our table I was told by the hostess "I'm not sure how much longer, maybe 10 more mins?" We finally gave up and went to dinner somewhere else. We had dinner at this other place around 10pm. Our friends had to pay two extra hours for the babysitter than they expected, and my fiance did not have the dinner she was hoping for on her birthday. This disappointing experience could have been avoided with better communication from the hostess, who clearly had no interest in what impact her mis-information had on our evening. I was a waiter for years and know that table's can be managed with a decent amount of accuracy to set guests expectations. El Almacen does not know how to do this and should start accepting reservations. If they do choose to start accepting them, we will never know as this place has been removed from our list of dining options.
