I live in the neighborhood and finally stopped by a couple of weeks ago. The hours are somewhat limited (8am-6pm daily), but the sandwiches are amazing. The Shrimp Po Boy is quite good, but my favorite is the Beef (Braised short-ribs with wild arugula, cherry tomatoes, & horseradish sauce on challa bread)... amazing! The staff is also very friendly, which is an added bonus.
