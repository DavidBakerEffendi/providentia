Just went here for the second time for brunch/lunch. It was pretty busy the last time we went but today there was plenty of open tables around lunch time. Great beer list that constantly changes. Food was excellent. I have tried both the chicken cutlet and steak sandwich. They allowed me to substitute a side salad that was very good size with tasty dressing for no extra charge. Overall a great spot to relax, have brunch/lunch, and throw down a few. Look forward to heading back soon.
