This place is very pretty inside. Most of the food is delicious as well. However, the owner of the place is super money hungry. I know people who have had parties in there and people who visit for a drink, and each time they complain because something that the owner promised Â or stated during conversation never went through. Even when not fulfilling customers' wishes during parties or a simple dinner or drink, he charges as if he provided them with the service and when confronted denies the incidence. So customers beware.
