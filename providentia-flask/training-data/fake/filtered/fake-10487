I was driving home from my sons soccer game and we decided to stop in and grab a bite to eat. Not thinking they had such an assortment of food, I decided to try the lobster bisque. This is my first ever review, and I must say that the meal I had that night, was one of the best I have ever had. The lobster pieces to bisque ratio was on point!!! My son had a grilled chicken sandwich, with provolone and avocado. He enjoyed it so much, that he wanted to get another. The food was just as great as the service. Definitely making the trip down from upstate New York to go there again.
