The White Dog used to be one of my favorate watering holes, but the new management has ruined its ambiance.  The prices have doubled, the informality has dropped away, and it now has little distinction from any of a number of overpriced restaurants in Philadelphia.   The story below broke the camel's back, leading me to no longer frequent the establisment, and to cease all departmental luncheons or dinners at the dog. An important editor had come to visit me and we decided to go for lunch at the White Dog.  We appeared five minutes before lunch opening time and were told we could not come in the building.  We then asked if we could sit at one of the outside iron tables until they opened, but were told we could not even do this.  The rudeness was embarrassing, so the editor and I went elsewhere for lunch.  I have told friends about this incident and a number have commented on the unwelcome change in atmosphere and attitude that has overtaken the White Dog.  I will no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone.
