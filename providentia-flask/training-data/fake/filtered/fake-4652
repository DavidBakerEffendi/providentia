When I have gone to VI, I usually have a great time.  The food is good and service is pretty reasonable when you sit at the bar.  DO NOT sit outside and think you are going to enjoy yourself.  I had a friend in from California and we sat outside in the courtyard area. Most of the 9 customers seated outside looked like they had food and the rest of the restaurant wasn't crowded at all except for the bar.   We ordered the chicken kabobs and a burger.  While we waited for our order, we asked for water.  About ten minutes go by and one glass of water is empty and we ask for a pitcher of water because the waitress was pretty scarce.  She came back a few minutes later and sat it next to my empty glass and left.   FIFTY MINUTES LATER, we had drank the entire pitcher of water.  We never received food and she told us that the food would be out shortly about 30 minutes before.  We left just after another table left too, hungry and angry. NOT going back to VI or recommending it for a VERY LONG TIME Major Disappointment
