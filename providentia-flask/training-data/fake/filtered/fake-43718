My Husband and I have been here numerous times since they've opened. We find the food to be consistently amazing and have always had friendly service.Our favorites include the Fried Oysters, BLAT (bacon, lettuce, avocado & tomato) Sandwich & the Ricotta Pancakes are unbeatable. Have also tried a few of the nightly specials which have always been great. The bartenders know how to make drinks which is a nice change for a brooklyn restaurant and they have great barristas on during the day. The room itself is small but super beautiful and all the people that work there seem to care which is a nice feeling. It has become one of our favorite stops in NY.
