I know this place is very popular but I have to say, after eating here for the past 5 or 6 years, I have NEVER had a bad meal here! Not only is the food really fresh and authentic but it's unbelievably reasonable. Plus you can bring your own wine ( which I love).. Make a reservation ( at least 2 weeks in advance for a weekend) you won't be dissapointed!
