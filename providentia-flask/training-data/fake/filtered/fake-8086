Recently visited this place last week. Heard it was under new ownership so figured id check it out. They recently renovated and it's not as nice as it could be. And could use some cleaning up back entrance looks like you're walking into a warehouse. Well to get started we waited about 10 mins before our server came and took our drink order. I went with the Red Sea and it was bland and way to sweet. And my wife ordered the pad Thai and it was soggy and sour as if they made it 15 mins prior to serving. The fresh spring rolls were alright though. But I won't be returning to this restaurant. Used to take out at least twice a week when it was formally pukett but this place needs some improvements!
