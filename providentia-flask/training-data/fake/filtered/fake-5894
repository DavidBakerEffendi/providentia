Ok, in the past I've been a devoted fan of Cookshop brunch. This past weekend I went for the off-hour lunch. What a fiasco. I ordered the deviled eggs. Not only were they very boring (and only 4 halves as opposed to the 5-6 my sweet but dimwitted waitress promoted), but the plating was a mess. Now I am not ordinarily fussy about plating, but these looked like I had done the job. The eggs were misshapen (mushed, missing chunks of egg white, semi-upright) with some yolk smears on the plate. For God's sake. Have some pride. Then the potato soup was more viscous and unappealing than I thought it should be until I discovered the dollop of creme fraiche cunningly (or mistakenly? I thought you were supposed to give it pride of place) hidden in the bottom center. Creme fraiche can cover a wealth of mediocrity, and it did. My girlfriend, expert trencherwoman that she is, had the butcher's board which was a lot better. And my napkin was a frayed mess, looked like my dog had a go at it. And the back booth was dusty as my gran's drawing room. Still, I heartily recommend you avoid the post 3pm "lunch" menu. Normally I would have given this 4 stars for the brunch.
