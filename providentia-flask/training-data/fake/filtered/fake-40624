Ok, the pizza is not that good. And im not just bitter, it really isnt that good. Nick's pizza in Forest Hills is very similar in style, but much better, and nowhere near as pricey. It does not look authentic inside, and the staff is completely average. Most importantly, its way overpriced, because of all the random hype and tourists.
