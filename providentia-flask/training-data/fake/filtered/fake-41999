One of our favorite restaurants in Montclair!  The foods is always great and the owner is super friendly.  Reasonably priced, cozy environment, excellent service- I love everything about this cute place and totally recommend others give it a try! We usually order curry, pad see ew, drunken noodles and veggie puff apps.  Have never been anything but pleased with the food every time!
