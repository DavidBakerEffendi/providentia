Lombardi's pizza is probably one of those places you've heard about. Its probably a place you've heard two things about. It takes hours to get in and its the best pizza in New York!!! Well yes and no...  Pizza is excellent but not the best in NY but its pretty good!  The wait hmmm...  well its NY and pizza ok.  Yes you will have to queue, but it really is "pick your moment". We turned up and by chance there was no queue at all. Five minutes after we arrived we were the head of a queue of fifteen. If you arrive any time between 5pm and 8pm you can expect a delay getting in. But the staff will try their best. Often going in smaller groups is better. As a group of two we were seated in five minutes (As we didn't mind sitting at the bar). The portions are what you'd expect from any eatery and it is well made. My criticisms would be, there is a limited number of options for toppings and to be honest, there are better pizzerias. I had a fantastic time here and for tourists this place is easy to find and easy to love. But i can't help shake the feeling that every resident in the area just shakes their head as they travel up the road to what they this is the best kept secret . Can't fault them at their craft but that nagging suspicion keeps them from obtaining the elusive fifth star.
