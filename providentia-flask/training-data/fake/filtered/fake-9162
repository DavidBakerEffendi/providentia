Alice's Arbor = fresh, wholesome tasty food!  Visited twice and will be back for more.  Portion size is smaller than average BUT was sufficient to satisfy my appetite.  Great one-of-a-kind decor was a "vacation away from new york city" in itself -- you'd quickly forget that you're in Brooklyn once you step inside.  A mini store where you can purchase some of the products that they use in their edible creations!  Very friendly wait staff, great ambience, famiy-friendly, great variety of music... very reasonable prices!  Highly recommended!
