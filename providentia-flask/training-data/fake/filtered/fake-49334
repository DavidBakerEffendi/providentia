I love really good Indian food, and some of the dishes here are really good. Full flavored and tasty, reasonable prices and decent service. I always love good Indian breads and they have them here, also I have been back a couple more times since my original review, and the food remains at a consistently good level. Full of flavor. Great selection on the menu
