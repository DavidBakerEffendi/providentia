I LOVE THIS PLACE SO SO SO MUCH!!! We came in from out of town and the Waldorf recommended this place. Me and my boyfriend went to check it out and it was a super long wait but the handsome and charming doorman (who is the uncle of the owner) made us feel like we were the most important people in there. He made jokes and made sure we found a comfortable place to wait. He even bought us a bit of champagne while we waited. The meal was exceptional. The spinach dip and meatballs may be the BEST we ever had and the wine list was incredible. I can't wait to come back here but until then I will be telling all my good friends to come and ask for Uncle Mike. hahahaha.
