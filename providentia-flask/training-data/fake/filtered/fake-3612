The only reason this place doesn't get six stars (or more) outta me is because it is damn near IMPOSSIBLE to get a table lately.  I say lately implying that I go all the time.  Because I do.  Because the food and booze is that good.  Like I can't believe everything I put in my mought makes me say oh my god.  I just wish they would buy out the place next to them and expand so I can take people there and show off my local eats knowledge.  Buttermilk smacks around alotta big name snooty spots with an affordable menu and well priced drinks.  Love.
