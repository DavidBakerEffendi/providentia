I was really looking forward to my birthday trip to Char no4. Bourbon and BBQ sounds like such a wonderful way to spend a pre-memorial Saturday . Bringing along a large amount of people seemed a no-brainer, just to get to try as much food as possible. The reservation process was brief and painless (thanks to memorial day), and the staff was remarkably friendly. The restaurant itself is beautiful, if cramped, and the smell emanating from the kitchen is the best aperitif one can ask for. But the room is ridiculously hot, and claustrophobic because of the low ceilings. Cocktails were amazing, and I really appreciate their dedication in having nothing behind the bar other than bourbon and whisky. I would come back here just for drinks. Food though, at least in my opinion left a lot to be desired. In no particular order, here are some of the the issues that we had. Ribs were terrible, barely grilled, they were tough, and just had a spoonful of sauce on top, baked beans were actually tastier than the ribs; shrimp and grits were drowned under the cilantro microgreens, and there wasn't a touch of salt in the entire dish, shrimp was dry and boring; bacon with mushrooms was very blah, with bacon being almost tough as if again, it didn't spend enough time in the smoker, the mushrooms greasy to the point of grossness, a little jus would have gone a long way. But, the sausage was phenomenal as was the steak. Pork nuggets were pretty good, as well as the lamb pastrami, but neither was anything out of this world. Resto makes better pork nuggets IMO. All in all, the best part of Char was the service and drinks. I'll definetely come back for drinks and maybe a few snacks, but doubt that a full meal is going to be worth it here.
