Amazing food! After reading the great Yelp reviews I knew I had to try this place out. My husband and I came here last night for dinner and the food was delicious. The salad was fresh and crisp and filled us right up with all it's ingredients. The service was great as well as the atmosphere. can't wait to return as my husband and I have been talking about our visit non stop :)
