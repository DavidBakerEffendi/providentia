Banana leaf is a great place if you're looking for asian cuisine or more to malaysian. The martabak telur is one of my fav appetizers....with the curry on the side yummmmm..... They also have sushi, but the sushi is not that great.... I'm sushi lover but their sushi just not on my list.....I tried the tuna tataki apptz but don't like it because it's over extremely beyond peppery.....maybe their style is diff but I can't even taste the tuna. But forget about the sushi.....Their kitchen dishes are delicious...... Again, I love pad thai and their pad thai qualified for my taste....better than the original thai restaurant in philly..... Do not miss their Salted Pepper Squid and Indian Mee Goreng..... It's a great place to hang out with friends at night.....I've been going to this place for 4 years now, was dissapointed once because that day the squid was extremely salty..... Overall, best food and great service....a great place to hang out with friends....
