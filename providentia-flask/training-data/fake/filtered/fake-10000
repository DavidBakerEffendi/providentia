I'm going to second whoever said this place has average food with an average atmosphere. I did not go on a night when live music was playing and I'm also not much of a beer drinker. It was pretty busy and I felt like our waitress was just trying to move us in and out. I might go back to check out the upstairs area but will probably not be eating here again.
