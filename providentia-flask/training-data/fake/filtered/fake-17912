Very good food-service was not great. We had to pour and ask for our wine the entire time. waiter did ask if anything was fine. They seemed to be concerned about a party of 20. The waiter mentioned that he will be handling a party of 20. This restaurant could be 5 stars if they could grasp what customer service is all about.
