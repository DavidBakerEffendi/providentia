I chose to dine at Rizzuto`s on January 19 for my birthday with my fiance and her parents. Our arrival was at 7: 30 pm and we did not feel welcome by their host what so ever. We seat down and we waited 10 minutes before our waiter came over to say hello and that he would be over in just 5 minutes. We were poured tap water without being offered a choice for bottled. The waiter was minimally knowledgeable about the food and drink menu and unable   to create a warm and welcoming  atmosphere for our party. I had the "Organic Salmon" for my diner and really there was no combination of flavors on that dish. Even though my fiance`s parents were somehow happy there,  I personally would say that Rizzuto is just  like a to go pizza store in your neighborhood, with the difference of being more expensive. I suggest to them to train their staff properly and get a chef that really understands Italian cuisine.
