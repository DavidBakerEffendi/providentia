On the basis of a recent review in the New York Times of Roia, my husband and I went there last night. We are "foodies" and love to eat out, especially in New Haven. Alas! even though we found the decor of Roia interesting, the noise level was such that it affected almost everything else of the experience. It was excruciatingly loud. Even though we were sitting less than 24 inches from each other, we couldn't hear each other, and we couldn't hear the servers. Speaking of servers, and service, we waited about 20 minutes for our drink orders to be taken, and then another 15- 20 minutes to be served them. There were bread and butter dishes on the table, but after all that time, I had to request a piece of bread - we were getting really hungry! We each received one slice of bread, which was very good. We shared the beet salad appetizer and it was delicious. My husband had a lamb dish, which he enjoyed. I had the steak frites. It was billed as a shell steak. It was less than 1/2 inch thick and gristly. The frites were good, but not superlative. We encountered 2 servers, a hostess and a host, who were polite, but compared to other restaurants of this purported caliber (receiving an "excellent" rating from the NYTimes), clearly not trained enough. The service was interminably slow and erratic. There was a private party on the 2nd level of the restaurant and we were told this was probably the reason for the extreme noise, but excuses, excuses: the bottom line was this experience was a distressing disappointment.
