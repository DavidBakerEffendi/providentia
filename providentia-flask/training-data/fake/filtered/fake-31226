A waiter made racist comments repeatedly to one of us. I found some other reviewers who had similar racism experiences at Adrienne's Pizza Bar. I guess it's common there? The food was bland, tomato sauce was not clean taste, lukewarm, not hot, mushy, oily, not crispy, very salty, undercooked. It is inedible. waiters and waitress were more than just rude. offensive. It was the worst dinning experience ever in my life. We all agreed that it was THE WORST restaurant experience ever. The combination of RACISM, BAD FOODS, ANGRY WAIT STAFF is unheard of.
