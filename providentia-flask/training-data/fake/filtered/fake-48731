In town for a conference, I was feeling mopey and decided to take a walk down to the Old City.  I found this place on Yelp, and based on the menu decided to give it a go.  Very good decision. I ordered the Beneluxx Napoleon Burger with Smoked Gouda and carmelized onions which comes with belgian-style fries and had two St. Bernardus' to wash it down with.  The burger was perfectly cooked and the gouda and onions complemented it perfectly.  As for the beer, I was lost at first in the sheer volume of the choices, over 300(!) bottled drafts are available.  So my server chooses the St. Bernardus for me based on how it works with the Gouda on the burger, and he hit...it...out...of...the...park.  It was delicious.  And the fries.  Oh lord, the fries.  Twice fried, perfectly crispy (but a smidge too salty for me), and absolutely delicious. The atmosphere is a bit dark, but a perfect tavern feel, especially with the Phillies game on the tube and all the Friday-nighters out on the town. Next time I'm in Philly, I'm definitely making this a stop.
