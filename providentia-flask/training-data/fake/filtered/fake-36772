We've been hearing how wonderful this place is for years, but only just managed to get here. Wish we'd come earlier! This is no Americanized Chinese takeout joint, rather genuinely Chinese style cuisine tweaked to suit the American tastes and varied dietary needs. Started with a comforting pot of loose-leaf green tea and indulged in some handmade veggie pot-stickers. Enjoyed the "family style" sharing of menu items, which included plenty of selections for vegetarians, pescitarians, and omnivores alike. We opted for the spicy swordfish special and some mushi veggies and tofu. Sauces are not overly salty or sweet, nor do they overpower the flavor of fresh ingredients. Servers were on-the-spot with menu information and service, and eager to please without hovering. Delightful to end the meal with sweet orange wedges rather than a hokey fortune cookie. Plenty of leftovers went home for a second meal, so stick with the "Small Dishes" if you're looking for a lighter meal.
