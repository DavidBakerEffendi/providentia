I've been there 4-5 times in last year and wings are excellent.  However, the bartenders aka waitstaff are not very good.  If I go to a restaurant or bar and the bartender or waitstaff are slow or unprofessional I always give them a one time pass and say maybe they are having a bad day, understaffed, etc but when I've been to an establishment 4-5 times for the excellent wings and cheap drinks AND the same issues with the waitstaff and bartenders show up just about every time than I want to call attention to it.  I've been there on Saturdays early and late when crowded. I've been there on Friday for happy hour and Wednesday for happy hour.  These are the issues I see.  2 bartenders for bar and they both sometimes disappear for 5-10 minutes at a time.  Unacceptable when it happens over and over.  Orders will come out at different times meaning the wings come out first than maybe the fries or clams come out 10 minutes later.  Unless requested as an appetizer than main meal this is unacceptable yet it happens all the time.  Attitude of a few bartenders leaves a lot to be desired.  They will be snappy, surly and full of excuses when order or drinks are incorrect.  I am not argumentative or confrontational by nature but if an establishment wants my hard earned cash than they have to have more than good food.  I do not like leaving a bar or restaurant feeling like the workers couldn't be bothered by my requests for professional service.
