I can only speak for the Tandoori that I've tried here.. It was delicious! Moist, juicy white meat chicken with a tandoori "rub" that was remarkable. It has tiny traces of fresh cut cilantro in it.. with a beautiful after-spice. The Saag Paneer is creamy, rich and delicious!  Fluffy basmati rice. And  generous cups of Raita its great job.
