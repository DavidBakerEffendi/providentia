Service: Rude and dizzily fast. Eat to run. No chatting. No resting. Food: I ordered a plain pho and half a chicken. The pale meat was thrown together on a plastic plate. It looked unappetizing. Edible quality of meat but you would expect that in any restaurant. The accompanied sauce was a mixture of salt, lime, and pepper. Yup, it did taste like that: Salty, sour, and spicy. Nothing to write home.The broth is plain. No flavor. p.s. the young waiter demanded that you speak English but he got so flustered when you speak to him in long sentences. BTW, I am a V-FOB (Vietnamese Fresh-of-the Boat, so I know what I am talking about. Trust me!)
