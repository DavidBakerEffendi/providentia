Visited its new Branch in Iselin...Worst Experience. This is a brand new restaurant came in Green Street opposite to another bad restaurant Abiruchi. As Abiruchi serves bad food, I always have to drive a mile to Oak Tree road for Karaikudi Chettinad or Dakshin Express to eat good South Indian Non-veg food, so I was badly looking for this new restaurant to open. But I was too disappointed with my experience today with this Anjappar Express. For this takeout place, the prices are way higher. My husband went inside and ordered few stuff, and wanted to dine in. The owner type guy with Spectacle said that though we have tables here we prefer our customers to takeout, very rude. The chicken masala, was not at all anything to do Chettinad, the $12.99 expensive briyani had no taste, $13.95 Mutton Sukka was bland and they did not even bother to heat the stuff. Forget the food, Service is very bad. The person at the front is not friendly. There is no value for the money with the food as well as service. Good Chettinad/South Food, go to Karaikudi Chettinad or Dakshin Express. Dakin Express is fresh and tasty food. Bottom-line is Better to Stay away fro this Franchise Anjappar Express Junk
