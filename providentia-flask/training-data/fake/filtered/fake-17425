We ordered Taiwanese beef noodle soup, pork dumplings, and green tea milkshake. We loved everything, especially the side dish "chopped fermented sour vegetable" that comes with beef noodle soup. I really want to try their famous coffee next time because it smelled so good when the owner was making it for some other guests.
