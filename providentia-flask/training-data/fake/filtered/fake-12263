I was a fan of the old Merchant House, but it doesn't compare to the newly renovated Tierney's Copperhouse. We have been there a few times since they have reopened and it has yet to disappoint. The style of food has changed. while you can get standard pub food (including a great burger), it has so much more to offer. People will soon realize that this place can compare with some of the well known steakhouses in the area at much more affordable price points. The new chef has brought a creative touch to the menu with a unique version of fried calamari and the tasty pot roast nachos. The food is excellent, but that is not the only draw. They now have one of the nicest bars in the area. You can tell that there was some real original thought behind the new design and decor including the stylish copper bar blended with brick background. It's a real cool place!! Looking forward to our next visit!!
