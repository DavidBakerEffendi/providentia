I was pretty disappointed with my first experience at this reknowned restaurant. First off, after how many lists I've seen Minetta on, proclaiming that it has one of the best burgers in the city, I can say, it just tasted like an ordinary burger to me. The preparation of the meat was spot-on, but the taste was nothing special. Now onto the service. The waiter literally dropped the ball and forgot about me and my friend. It took us literally an hour to get our burgers, meanwhile the 2 tables to the left and right, both of whom were seated about 30 mins after us, got theirs within 15 mins after they placed their order. When we finally got our burgers, no explanation or apology was offered. And to "top it off", no puns intended here, the waiter asked if I wanted to refill my glass of wine. I normally don't do so (even if I intend to get another glass) until I finish what I have in my glass, but since she poured for my friend and was right there, I agreed. I still had about 1/3 of a glass of wine left. The waiter finished pouring what was left in that bottle and my glass of wine was as the same level as my friend who just got a fresh pour. She walked behind our table, about10 feet away, to open a new bottle, looked at me, but did not top me off. The waitress even looked at me while she was opening the new bottle, she knew what she did, but she just walked to another table. Overall, my dining experience was very disappointing, especially the service.
