We went right at the end of happy hour and our waitress was nice enough to rush over to our table to make sure we could get a drink order in before the prices went up. That said, the happy hour prices are nothing to get excited over. The mac and cheese w/ crab and onions was really tasty, but don't rely on the menu on their website for accurate prices because they've definitely gone up.  Still, the dish was big enough that I was full after eating 1/2, so if you're into leftovers it's a good deal. We sat outside, so I can't comment on the atmosphere at the bar.  They did have a big tv (showing sports) outside, balanced on a small table.  I spent the whole time waiting for someone rushing by to knock it over.  I would go back if a strong craving for the mac&cheese hit, but definitely wouldn't pick this place to just hang out and drink.
