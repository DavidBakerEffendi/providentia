Sorry people, but Eulogy beats the pants off stupid Monk's.  Their beer selection is phenomenal (try the Stille Nacht, please, or the Gulden Draak), their menu is delicious yet totally unpretentious (the polar opposite of Monk's), and the staff and bartenders, while not all-up-in-your-face cheery, are real people who know their food and beer.  I haven't been there in a while, but there used to be (and maybe still is) an Irish bartender there who can recommend a great beer for whatever you're into at the moment. I just love Eulogy and am so sick of everyone raving about Monk's because that's what they've heard their friends do.  And mussels are disgusting anyway.
