I am thrilled to finally be able to write a stellar review of Tinto.   I live in LA now, but when I used to live in Center City Philly I would take my girlfriend at the time every few months.  It was and still is her favorite restaurant, so when I found out years ago that Tinto had a private dining room upstairs, I kept it to myself and decided that someday it might be a good place to propose.  Sure enough, last month I did just that during our visit to Philly, and the Garces Events staff spent the prior 6 months helping me to plan the perfect proposal and celebration there.  The food was delicious, the wine was wonderful, and it was truly a night to remember.  Special thanks to Stephanie at Garces Events and the whole Tinto staff for helping me pull it off as a complete surprise to my fiancee!  They even through in a free round of bubbly for all 22 of us in the room.   Tinto is unquestionably one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia, but most people don't know about their ability to host events/parties upstairs.  No matter the occasion, Tinto is the right place to go.
