My wife, a native of Sao Paulo, and I were not really impressed. Everything was overpriced, and really the food we had wasn't that good. I had shrimp moqueca and neither I nor her thought it was acceptable. The caipirinhas weren't right, and overpriced ($8). The music was American pop music instead of Brazilian mpb, funk, axe, samba, bossa nova... anything but Britney Spears. Another thing that struck me as strange was that working the grill were two Central American gentleman. Not problematic for any reason, but surprising. Wasn't a very Brazilian experience for us overall. I recommend Brazil grill in midtown. Caipirinhas are $4 usually, and mixed perfect, especially by Samuel. Food is outstanding, too. The service was fine, and nothing stood out as terribly negative, but it wasn't enjoyable overall. Apparently this place is pretty well loved for some reason unbeknownst to me; I'm assuming because it's an "ethnic" enclave in an otherwise bland white yuppie area, but I will not be returning.
