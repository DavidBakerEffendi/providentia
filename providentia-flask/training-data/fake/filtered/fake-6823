Tried the foie gras doughnut at GoogaMooga. For $11. Bad. Two bites of ho-hum doughnut before anything resembling foie gras. Then, when the foie gras made an appearance, it was in a plasma of "jelly" that was closer to that hot pink sweet-and-sour sauce at cheap Chinese restaurants. Bad. Disappointing. And, honestly, bordering on criminal. Who charges $11 for that crap? Why not just hit me over the head and take my money?
