This past Sunday - as I shamefully went green-less for St. Patrick's Day brunch - was my third weekend-dining experience at Champs. What can I say? I like to be thorough. Conclusion: despite the fact that Champs offers one of the neighborhood's largest vegan menus (an impressive feat for ultra-hip Williamsburg), the diner itself leaves much to be desired. I've yet to experience a wait at Champs under 35 minutes, which is not unreasonable for New York, but the waitstaff consistently struggles to properly seat parties in orderly fashion, often skipping party names forced to wait outside in the cold. Table service is one of the most brutal jobs a person can undertake, so I'm willing to let this slide (on the last visit, the server did provide some free desserts). But this isn't Champs biggest deterrent. It's reasonably busy because the neighborhood hosts a large community of vegans, and here they can eat worry-free. Problem is the food is not that good. It's not horrible, but persistently begs the question, "could I have made this at home?" And the answer is yes. Virtually all the ingredients are easily purchased at KeyFood not four blocks away. So while nothing at Champs is singularly horrendous, a combination of excessive waiting, mediocre service, bland ingredients, and rushed dishes makes the whole experience unpalatable. There are a lot of vegan options in The 'Burg; search elsewhere. -N.
