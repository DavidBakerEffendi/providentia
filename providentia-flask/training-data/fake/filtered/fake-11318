Ok, 'yes' Eataly is so crowded sometimes that it makes it difficult to enjoy, and yes, there are often throngs of tourists which I find entertaining because often I hear them speaking Italian and wonder what they are thinking of our interpretation of their culture- however, the quality of food, the unlimited variety and transition from restaurant to piazza to shopping market are incredible.  Though I wouldn't do weekly shopping here, I love picking up imported cheeses, fresh baked breads and good quality pastas for cooking at home.  Totally worth the throngs of people in order to get some amazing food.  I highly recommend the cafe as well, and love that everyone stands at the "bar" to drink their coffee-- for anyone who has gone to Europe, that is pretty authentic.  So give credit where credit is due and eat up :)
