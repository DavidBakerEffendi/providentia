If you gave this place anything more than one star, then you didn't have the awful meal that I just vomited into the garbage, or you don't know anything about sushi.  I usually don't trust sushi places that are in the middle of nowhere, or not surrounded by other quality restaurants (in this case some Chinese dive and a laundromat), but there were so many positive reviews I felt compelled to try it, as it was on my way home. I ordered takeout and the very sight of the sushi when I got home had me worried.  The tuna sushi looked like it had to fight for its life to get on a pad of lifeless rice.  The two cooked rolls I had, Dragon and some other mess I literally spit directly into the garbage.  Last I checked, soft shell crab didn't have bones in it.  The white fish wrapped around the spicy tuna roll was discolored, and was translucent in certain areas.  The salmon sushi looked like it had been poached, and was actually warm.  It was only after this disaster dinner that I read it was open 7 days a week (not sure how I missed that when researching the place).  Even mediocre sushi places are at least closed Monday, and try to sell their remaining weekend nastiness for half price on Sunday.  No respectable establishment would serve 4 day old sushi.  This place is garbage, and that's exactly where my meal ended up.
