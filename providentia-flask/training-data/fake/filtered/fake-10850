I Don't even know where to start on how good this place is... After 10 years in NYC I had given up all hope of finding a solid seafood spot that perfectly nails southern cooking with a new yorkers foodie twist. Food: -The crawfish are to die for, regardless of the season. The owners must have the best hookup in the states, always fresh, perfectly sized, juicy, and cooked to perfection. -The Sauce: You cant go wrong, but I do have a favorite. Old bay dry... with a side of the boil special in medium. The boil special adds this perfect sweet,salty, but spiced to perfection addition that is a perfect dunk to crab, lobster, shrimp or of course crawfish. However, many of my friends like the boil special in their bags. To each their own, the beauty of this place is that you can try many different combinations till you find your favorite. (And trust me, its impossible to only go to the boil once... it will quickly become your favorite spot) -The food: (Outside of the perfect seafood that has yet to ever be even remotely off). The chicken wings are hands down the best I have ever had. Skin is perfectly crispy, meet is juicy and falls off the bone, spice (While I dont know what their special recipe is, is UNREAL). Ambiance: Its the only seafood place that can somehow make a cold winter night feel cozy. The music is perfect. TV's are always playing sports... nothing beat Sunday football snacking on bags of crawfish and beer. However, it also manages to be romantic if on a date.. or fun if in a group. Again, the owners nailed the landing here. I rarely yelp.. but this place deserve the 5 stars... and more.
