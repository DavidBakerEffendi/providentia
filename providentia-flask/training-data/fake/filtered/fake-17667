Was there 8/2/14. Real good beer selection. Service was good. Decor was blah, but not a major factor in my rating. Pizza was very mediocre. Had half pepperoni, half sausage. Pepperoni was OK, but sausage was totally bland. Overall, not well seasoned. Go to Flatbread or better yet Verita in Burlington instead.
