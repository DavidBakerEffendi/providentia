Worst experience ever... I ordered food about 6 weeks before thanksgiving, very expensive but was willing to try it since SUPPOSEDLY the food is good..yea right.. called 3 weeks before to change the order to lesser order.. to make a long story short.. after several calls of ..oh you have to talk to jack the manager to get a discount from the lesser order and the manager never calling me back.. to also an extra visit to change the original order.. to finally the day of thanksgiving.. go get the food.. it was not ready.. they never really changed the order.. had to take the copy I got 2 weeks before from my hands and go and cook the food...oh yea.. the manager is physically there "Jack" go ask him for the discount.. oh.. cannot give you the discount.. the office is close today.. it was unbelievable to me this type of service for a $500 plus dollar order... I do not know their restaurant service nor do I want to try it... the food, it was ok at best... what a waste of money and time..there are plenty of good portuguese restaurants in the newark area...this one is not one of them..
