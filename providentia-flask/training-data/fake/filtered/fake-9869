Went there first for brunch...woaw! Some of the best eggs and possible the best hamburger I have ever had Everything was so tasty, delicate yet rich, I decided to go back for dinner Prices were way higher...a bit too high to my taste but the food was phenomenal it is worth a 1 star Michelin Guide, but I love the 'chic-laid back' vide of that restaurant, very "Tribeca" I highly recommend that restaurant! You won't be disapointed
