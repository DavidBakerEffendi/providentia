I do not care what negative reviews you might read or might have read, this place is legit and it could not get any better than the $29 it cost for dinner. 2 glasses of wine, 2 desserts which we selected tiramisu and ice cream.  Dinner could not have been better. Atlantic salmon covered in a lemon garlic sauce with zucchini and mashed potatoes, and chicken cutlet parmigiana was to die for. For a small local restaurant & café on Avenue B I give it 10s across the board.
