Sorry...but i and my daughter had breakfast yesterday and i was disappointed. The waffles i ordered look very good but when i cut into them they were not even cook.  Mine, and my daughter's french toast with the bananas, and were so hot it destroyed the taste.  ( i know how could you complain about hot food but we're talking waffles not soup) We had to wait for it too cool off to enjoy. I did not advise the waiter because we were in a hurry.   I will go back since i grew up in the neighborhood but it needs to be better.   Fred doylestown
