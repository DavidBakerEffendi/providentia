I've been to Habana Outpost a maybe 6 or 7 times.  Its a nice place to go to in the summers if you cannot find anything else to do.  Its situated on the Corner of Lafayette Ave in Downtown BK.  Usually in the summer you can find some celebrities walking around around.  Has a college and post graduate crowd.  Lots of women and people having a good time.  I prefer to only go in the summer around 4pm on Saturdays thats more of my type of crowd.  They have a great shrimp and black beans dish as well as good corn.   Frozen margaritas with Mango is a must.
