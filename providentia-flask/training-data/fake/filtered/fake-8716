The speed of seating us, the service and the food.  Philly restaurant owners, take a lesson from this great experience. From the snails, octopus, veal cheek, pork loin, you name it. OUTSTANDING!!!!  Then we were told the menu changes every few weeks. I inquired about sweet breads (thymus glands), our waiter told us to call and make a reservation about 2 weeks in advance and tell them I would like the sweetbreads and they will have it for me.  We will definitely be returning frequently. Oh by the way a four course meal (lots of selections) $34.00 per person. A family spends more than that at McDonalds. Don't forget to bring you wine (huge wine and spirits store directly across the street).  Finish off the night with music and drink at Johnny Brendas
