i had the avocado salad and a side of 5 pieces of falafel. it was absolutely delicious. the falafel was perfectly crunchy/fried on the outside and soft but not soggy on the inside. the seasonings/spices were wonderful. the salad was a lot bigger than i expected and the meal could have definitely been split between 2 people. i will definitely be going back - it is light and fresh and the price is on point! looking forward to trying other options on the menu.
