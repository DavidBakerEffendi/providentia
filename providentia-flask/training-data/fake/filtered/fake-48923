It was a nice and quiet place to escape the craziness outside. The service was exceptional. The wait staff was friendly, quick, and efficient. The prefix lunch ($25) was perfect. I started with a yummy spinach salad with a bacon vinegarette- sooo good! Then moved onto the hanger steak and fries! The steak was cooked to perfection Â I would recommend this place to anyone who is in NYC!
