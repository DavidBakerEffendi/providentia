I'm sorry for the late review, work has had me very busy in the last month.  My fiance and I was in Philly for the Jill Scott concert and stayed overnight.  We had brunch at A Kitchen the next day and I will say it was amazing.  I ordered the asparagus omelet and she ordered the pancake breakfast.  I will begin with my meal first since I rated it higher.  I would have never thought asparagus was work in an omelet, I usually order and cook my omelets with spinach.  Not only was the omelet good, the potatoes was a great compliment.  My fiance was not disappointed with her meal but she her opinion was that the pancake meal was not too different from Bob Evans (something we both love).  I guess you cannot expect too much for pancakes and eggs.  We both ordered mimosas, and the amount of champagne used was well worth the $10/glass.  The waiter was very attentive.  One thing I will say is if you are looking for a brunch will make you loosen your belt, this is not the place.  I am not saying that you will leave hungry, I am saying they give you just enough food.  We will be returning.
