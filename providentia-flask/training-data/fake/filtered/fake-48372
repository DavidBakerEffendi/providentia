I have lived in the Philadelphia suburbs for over 50 years.  I have had an opportunity to sample hundreds of cheese steaks and without a doubt in my mind I can say that neither Pat's or Geno's would even rank in my top 50 places.  When I was in college after a party (and a lot of beer) we used to roll over to Passyunk Ave to grab a steak at 2 AM.  To be honest, that would be the only time we'd go there because there wasn't any other steak places open at this hour. So.... Pat,  Geno.... you can keep your "wit" and your "wiz".  Your reputation far exceeds your quality!
