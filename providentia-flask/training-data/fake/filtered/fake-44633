Great Italian place in NYC. The Ricotta and Crostini are really good. Everything I've ate here has been great though. No complaints at all. They have a really great wine selection. Â As far as the price, they can be kind of expensive I guess but this is NYC, all restaurants are expensive here and the food is worth the price. If your in NYC check them out!!
