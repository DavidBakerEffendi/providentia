Went to a party in the downstairs room - LOVE. Food was delish and the bartenders were awesome and very attentive..never waited for a drink. I am totally going to have my birthday party there and my boyfriend dubbed it his new favorite place to watch games. They had great specials (not just the boring Bud everyone else seems to have). Going back this Friday!
