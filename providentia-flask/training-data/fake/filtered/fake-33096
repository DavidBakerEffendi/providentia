Dissapointed. Yesterday we placed an order for the usually very good wings for the superbowl. We went to pick them up at the agreed time 6pm. There they were. Along with another 20 or 30 orders in bags. Just like I suspected, when we got home, 5 minutes later (we live on Canner St) the wings were cold, dry, and had very little sauce. The worst part was this metallic taste they had. That told me the wings have been sitting inside the aluminum tray for hours. Horrible. Eat their wings there, never order them during super bowl rush. Nasty!
