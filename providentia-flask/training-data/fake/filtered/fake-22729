Incredible place.  Great food, great service; decent prices - it is worth going.  Make a reservation though.  Crowded and noisy so if you want a nice intimate dinner this is not for you.  We were upstairs in a small area with only 3 tables.  We became friends with both tables.  We were there a long time and were not rushed out of there (it was a Wednesday night) but they were packed and probably wanted us to move on.  Great place.  There are so many choices so it is sometimes nice to have an idea of where to go for good food and good service.
