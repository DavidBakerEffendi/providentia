Totally cool place. The sangria was great and the waiters were pretty good. They did take some time to bring us water but it was extremely busy. Wait on a Saturday for 3 was about 40 minutes but we sat in 30 mainly because it seemed people who previously put names down had left. Verdict: Reasonably priced food, you get a huge portion (everyone takes stuff to go), and the tapas are great. Try it!
