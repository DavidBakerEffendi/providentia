We recently went to Miami Mikes for the Friday night bands.  This was our second time, the last time we saw Asbury Fever ( a Bruce Springsten tribute band), they were great, although the band didn't start until almost 10 and the sign says 9 pm. This time we went to see a Bon Jovi tribute band ( I think the name was slippery nipple).  They didn't start playing until almost 10:30. When we complained we were told to go tell the band that we wanted them to play. I know they do this so you will spend more money on booze and food. When they finally started playing they were horrible. The music was so load you couldn't even hear the person next to you. I think they did this because they were not very good. Maybe if the music was turned down a bit they would have been better. We couldn't wait to get out of there (after spending $150 on food and booze and $14 cover charge.) It's a shame too because the food is pretty good there and it would be a good place to hang out with friends but it is definitely too loud for that, even when the bands aren't playing. Sorry to say we won't be back. I would like to save what little hearing I have left.
