We have been going to Jose Tejas for years. My husband has always ordered 2 meals, sometimes 3. He picks at them and brings home what he doesn't eat. The waitress had an attitude from the start. After my husband ordered 2 appetizers then came time to order our entrees. He went to order 2 entrees and said - ahh wahtever I don't finish I will bring home and the waitress said no. She would not take his order. He could not do that! We know from being a customer for a long time that take home orders are not allowed BUT never have been told he could not order 2 entrees because he might not finish and take it home! She said she was getting a manager. We were in shock. One manager Steve came over and was very understanding saying it was a misunderstanding. We then requested a new wait staff. The waitress came over with my daughters drink and slamed it on the table and left. Minutes later the night manager Jason came over and basically said they did not have to take my husband 2 entree orders if he was going take it home. In addition he backed his waitress up and said she did the right thing! The first manager Steve came by again afterwards and apoligized for Jason's behavior - it was crazy. We decided to leave right there and then. While we waited for another staff member to bring the check that waitress kept walking behind my husband and said "Oh My God!" I would like to know who else has ever been turned down from ordering 2 meals. What restaurant would do that!
