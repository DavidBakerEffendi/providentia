This place is great! There is always lots to choose from- we like getting the fresh punjabi samosas (probably best in the market!). Try their sweets too- they are famous for it. I've been to a few weddings where they've catered as well and it's always been delicious and extravagant! overall, great place- we go there on a weekly basis.
