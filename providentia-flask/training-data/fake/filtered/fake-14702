This is one of those restaurants that while you are there you forget that you live in New York. The drinks are off the charts. Make sure you try the "take me home" it is the best, and the wine is super tasty as well. The bartenders know their stuff, and I had lots of fun trying different drinks that they were testing out. The food..... just make sure you go with an empty stomach. The dishes are decadent beauties. On a side note. To miss Jess P. who gave 1 star. There is nothing uncleanly about this place. I work at a bar, and saw they were cleaning constantly the glassware. Check this place out, it's crazy amongst the 99 cent stores. I can't wait for the backyard to open in the summer
