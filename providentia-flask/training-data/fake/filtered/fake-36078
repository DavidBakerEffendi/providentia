My Husband and I are making our way to La Fourno tonight. We come here very often, its our favorite date spot. Especially On tuesdays and fridays, which are BYOB nights! Everything is always so amazing and the service is perfect. Ive had so much food all over this city, and La Fourno is always my first recommendation.
