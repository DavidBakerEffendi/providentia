Worst customer service experience ever- and this was for a to-go order! As the phone wasn't even on the hook to place an order, we took the time to drive there to place an order in person. When we spoke to the woman at the counter, she continued to roll her eyes at us, visibly showed annoyance and made me us feel like we were waisting her time. We asked what size a medium pizza was- to which her response was "I don't know." Umm- you work here for x amount of years and you don't know? When we then gave a cc to pay foe the order, she rudely stated "didn't you see the large sign on the window? No credit card". I'm sorry- but no, we didn't but we were more than willing to find an ATM. By that time, we were pretty much affronted by how we were being treated and left the joint. From now on, we will be taking our business elsewhere. The pizza is definitely not worth it.
