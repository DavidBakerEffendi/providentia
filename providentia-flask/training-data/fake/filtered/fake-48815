YOU SHOULD PROBABLY READ THIS IF YOU ARE CONSIDERING THIS "EATERY" Pacifico's menu is lovely. Everything sounds delicious.  It comes very highly rated.  Someone has even said it is the most underrated restaurant in New Haven, which makes me question whether this supposed food critic has been eating out of a trough. Then you eat at Pacifico.  And your tastebuds, then toilets, weep. The food is obscenely salty and oily.  Subtlety is certainly not Pacifico's strong suit.  Their signature appetizer of guacamole comes with long-expired Tostitos (and Ruffles?), which you will have the pleasure of dipping into a viscous sea of brine that will make your arteries shudder -- which is a shame, because it looks delicious with all that bright-colored avocado.  A big disappointment that nicely set the tone for the rest of the meal. We also ordered a salad with the dressing on the side.  It wasn't anything special, but it was certainly the highlight of the meal.  It should also be noted that the service is good, which unfortunately inclined us to tip well.  We hope no one thinks it reflects our gratitude for the cuisine. The fish (we got salmon and tilapia) was moist because it is drowning in melted fat.  Also, seawater.  When it came to the table it looked delicious, in keeping with the pattern that looks can be deceiving.  At least Pacifico is consistent.  We did not dare try the dessert.  We left with an almost-hundred-dollar bill, and starving.  Our appetites subsided, however, as we emptied the meal from our system for many hours on end.  Our stomachs, a week into detox, have yet to recover. If only we had read such a review before we went.  You're welcome in advance.
