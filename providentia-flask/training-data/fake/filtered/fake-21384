I'm not a fan of gaudy restaurants. Sometimes a tight spaced restaurant is where you will find the best food.  Heidi's House is such a place and is definitely a unique find for the UES.   I've been here about 4 times since I've lived in the neighborhood and have been satisfied every time.  I strongly recommend the bruschetta or the shrimp Taco's as a starter. Macaroni and Cheese is not high on my list of favorite comfort foods but I would go back solely to have Heidi's Mac and Cheese any day of the week. It has a divine smokey taste to it when you order it with bacon and will leave you wanting more. I've found that although very tight, Heidi's House staff is very accommodating and do a great job of seating you in an orderly and timely fashion especially considering how limited the space is.  There have been times when I've come from work without reservations and they have found me a seat in no time.  I can't say enough good things about the place.
