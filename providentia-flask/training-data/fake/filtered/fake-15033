I had made a 9:00 PM reservation on New Years Eve for four adults. We arrived at 8:55 PM and got seated by 9:10 PM. It was not overcrowded but they were about 75% full. I believe it is family owned as a Mom and her daughter were working there. Anyway, we were seated and given drinks/opened our bottle of wine immediately. We ordered food and everything was delicious. The stuffed pork chops were amazing as well as the veal. Everything looked/smelled delicious. The prices are reasonable, especially for the amount of food you get.. An entree ranges from $15-$25. Overall, we will be back, especially since the restaurant is within walking distance from our home.
