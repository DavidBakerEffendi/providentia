Great food.  Great hours.  Fun atmosphere.  Eclectic, interesting menu.  And it's a great deal--a rarity in NYC.  Not that you get stuffed--but tasty, substantive food for not much dinero.  BTW--I usu. don't care--but the staff has been great in 3-4 visits--going out of their way to accommodate. If I lived on the West Side, I would eat here at least twice a week.
