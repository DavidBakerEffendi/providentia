Went on 4/15/2010. Tonight, we were interested in getting some pizza and looked to Yelp for some good suggestions. We are big Montclairites and figured we should look in the area. We recently went to a pizza place in Nutley that was on the "Top 25 Pizza Places in NJ" list in NJ Monthly and were a little disappointed so we were pleasantly surprised when we went to this well-done pizza joint not well known and relatively empty. Apparently this place just opened about six or seven months ago. I really liked the setup of the place with all the bricks and the cool brick oven behind the chefs. The service is really great there. The waiters are very courteous/nice and seem to genuinely care about you, which is surprisingly refreshing. We ordered an Arugula house salad with feta cheese and a balsamic vinaigrette. I am not a big fan of this type of salad so discount my opinion because I felt that it was good but nothing amazing. My companion Â really likes the salad and did enjoy it. So consensus is overall good salads. Now to the "meat" of it. The pizza. Very good and very simple, which is exactly what we wanted. My companion got a margherita pizza and I got one with sausage. WE BOTH LOVED IT! Once you let it cool down it did the trick. No need to go into more detail for a pizza place but just go and try for yourself. Selfishly, I am glad this place is not on Bloomfield Ave, but on a side street so it doesn't see the full patronage, but I do hope the business picks up for these guys because they are very nice and they do a great job with their pizza. Make sure you get yourself over there too! PS - We plan to go back and that's saying a lot!
