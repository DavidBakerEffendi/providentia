The wait is atrocious (Took us over an hour on both occasions), but if you are a fan of good, thin-crust pizza, then this place is for you.   A little on the pricey side if you like your pizza covered in toppings, but if you're getting one or two it won't break the bank.  The pizza we got the last time had sun-dried tomatoes on it, and that was enough for us.  Very tasty.
