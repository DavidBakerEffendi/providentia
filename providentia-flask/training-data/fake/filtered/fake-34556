We were looking for somewhere quiet and intimate to elope.  Hartness House was perfect!  All we had to do was show up and the rest was taken care of.  Our every need and request was met and the staff was caring and courteous.  Everything was absolutely perfect and just what we wanted- a romantic day all about us!  Can't wait to celebrate many anniversaries there!
