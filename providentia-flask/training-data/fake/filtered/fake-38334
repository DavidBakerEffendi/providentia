Had the pizza here for the first time.  They were very busy when we got there to pick up so it took longer then expected, but it was worth the wait.  My wife even broke her own 'one slice' rule.  Of course she said it was to save me from eating the whole pie!  Would definitely recommend.  Will be back.
