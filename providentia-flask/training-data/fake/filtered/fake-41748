Great food from one of the best sushi chefs I know- Nelson Yip.  Sushi melts in your mouth as Nelson uses only the highest quality fish and ingredients.  He is so dedicated to his craft and his passion can be seen with every dish he presents- the layout of the food on the plate is like picture perfection that flows right into your mouth.  The prices he charges for the quality is unbelievably low.  Great place to catch dinner if you are going to a Prudential Arena event.  A few blocks away into the Ironbound neighborhood.
