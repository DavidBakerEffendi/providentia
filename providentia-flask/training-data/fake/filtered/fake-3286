Stopped in on 11/5 to try the burgers with 2 of my business buddies as I had seen a review in a local restaurant blog earlier that day. The review was spot on.  We ordered the Bacon Jam Burger, Montclair Blue Cheese and Bacon Cheeseburger.  All were freshly prepared and served with fries.  I suggest you kick it up and go for an order of the bacon jam fries as they are outstanding!  While dining we had the opportunity to chat with the owners for a while.  Some really great people with a passion for creating and serving delicious "stuffed" burgers!
