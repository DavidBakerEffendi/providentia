Excellent place. I would have made the trip from Manhattan (yay!) to Astoria (uch) sooner had my fianc√© explained this restaurant better. She called it a "diner." Yes- it's 24 hours. Yes- it's fairly inexpensive. Yes- it's owned by Greeks. But that's really it. The menu should probably be categorized as "diner inspired fare." The menu is also far more streamlined and condensed than the average diner. It doesn't even look much like a diner. I recommend ordering the way we did last night- order a bunch of appetizers to share. Everything was a winner with the Fried Ravioli and Crunchy Ranch (Chicken) Quesadilla standing out a bit. Pretty good service, too. We'll return, for sure.
