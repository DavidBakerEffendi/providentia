The food here was tasty. I'm not paid to be a food critic like everyone else apparently is so I'll spare the minor details. I had a beef burger with the basics and some roasted garlic sauce on the side which my server recommended I try. It was great and I loved the chili fries ordered in the 50/50. Servers were friendly and they have sports on.
