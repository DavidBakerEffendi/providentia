Went to Pinto for a birthday dinner with 5 people.  The food was fabulous.  If you're looking for fresh, local, organic foods this was a great option.  The service was so-so, but it was Saturday night and we didn't have to wait more than half an hour for our table.  Also, they were responsive to a member of our group with specific food allergies.  It was very small.  If you're clostrophobic or are looking for a private, intimate dinner, this isn't the place for you.
