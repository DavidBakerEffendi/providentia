STOP DELETING ME REVIEW Maialino! Maialino... what can I say about this establishment besides them deleting my 1 star review twice.  I bet they will pay Yelp to delete this one too. On to the restaurant.  First of all, they are incredibly rude and ridiculous overrated.  The restaurant was rather empty.  Me and my girlfriend had a reservation for 2 at 6pm and they ended up sitting us all the way in the back corner of the restaurant when there were plenty of seats available closer to the main dining room. This bring me to my point that these people seem to treat minorities terrible.  There are only Caucasian people that dine here,  and the one Asian table seemed to be having a worse time than my table. Firstly, me and my girlfriend got sat in the corner, no big deal.  We don't see the waitress about 10 minutes later.  We order our drinks when we see her.  The drinks take about 5-10 minutes to arrive (quite long just for wine).  During the wait, there was a white family of 5 that sat near us.  The waiter proceeds to get their drinks, but before taking our food order, she goes over to that table and takes their food order before us! when we have been waiting to order for about 15-20 minutes. After we ordered the appetizers came out rather quickly withing 10 minutes, which isn't too slow.  But then there was a 45 minute wait after that for our entrees.  During the 45 minute wait, the waitress ignores us completely, not refilling our drinks, or scraping bread crumbs off our table.  Nothing you would expect from a restaurant that costs this much. Anyway, our food finally arrives, cold....  Terrible, tasteless.  I make better pasta than these guys, seriously.  Pasta isn't fresh made,  it is dry premade pastas. DO NOT EAT HERE. Final Verdict: - Over prices - Terrible Service - rude to minorities (no minorities were eating there - White supremacy to the max - Food is terrible - Go to shakeshack...
