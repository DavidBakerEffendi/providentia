Dear Walters, When you first opened we had such high hopes.  Now, after a year I'm afraid your settling into a bland mediocrity that seems to take hold in so many Fort Greene restaurants.  Your menu has barely changed since you opened.  It was a fine starter menu but its time to step it up.  Our most recent brunch included store bought oj, drippy and flavorless huevos rancheros and old arugula in the side salad. Recombining the same ingredients you have in every other egg dish to make a breakfast burrito 'special' is not so special.  The two stars are because your location is great and the vibe is nice.  You need to put more quality and care into the food if you want to remain a go-to spot for locals.
