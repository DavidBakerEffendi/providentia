Chili: From best to worst in a week.  Last week my wife and I stopped in and I had a hankering for some chili.  I ordered and was pleasantly surprised to find that the chili was some of the best I had ever had - not too spicy, nice and thick and they even put a piece of pot roast in the middle with sour cream to top it off.  I told my wife that I would come back anytime just to get the chili.  So back we came this past Sunday only to be sorely disappointed.  I was so looking forward to the same chili but when I took my first spoon it was so hot I could not even eat it.  My wife, who likes spicy food, tasted it and said it was way too hot for her too.  Plus, no chunk of pot roast in the middle either!  You have got to be kidding me!  My advice to Plan B - learn how to be consistent with your recipes.  Had your chili remained like it was the first time I tried it I would have kept coming back for more.  Now I am hesitant to even go back to Plan B for anything much less the chili.
