I don't usually write reviews, but I had to drop some nice words after our experience here. My wife and I are from Atlanta, and were recently visiting some friends in the area. We stumbled upon this place one night, and had an absolutely fantastic time. The food was wonderful, and the service was even better. Our every need was taken care of and attended to. The manager, Brian, was incredible. He had a dynamic personality, and immediately made us feel at home. Also, bonus points for the music mix. I usually find it easy to ignore music being played in a restaurant. But the mix was so eclectic and fun; the whole table really enjoyed it. We will definitely be back when we are again in to town, and our friends will no doubt be regulars. Thanks so much for the great evening!
