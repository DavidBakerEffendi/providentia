Raymond's is one of my favorite restaurants...on earth. yeah, yeah it can get a little noisy and sometimes the 10-15 minute wait is really more like 25-30, but the service and the food are both impeccable. this is a true montclair staple, everything on the menu is delicious (i have eaten most items) (not at the same time) (occasionally at the same time) the mushroom risotto balls cannot be duplicated, even the hummus and delicious, and the shrimp and grits brings tears to my eyes. i am never let down- brunch/lunch/dinner/dessert whatever. byob as well, and amanti vino next door provides some excellent wine for the occasion. service is always nice and very relaxing. go here. now. right now.
