Cafe Renata is an amazing addition to West Philadelphia, filling the void left by Cafe Clave that continues to cater to loyal customers while welcoming in new faces. The all day Breakfast menu is a treat, and the blend of Cuban and Mediterranean food options are delicious and make you want to come back for more. I would recommend the Shok Shuka for any first time visitor. Their coffee (la Colombe) is amazing, as is their variety of espresso products. Try the coffee brewed Chemex and you won't regret it. Â I have yet to try the new dinner menu, but if it is anything like the rest of the food than I expect nothing but the best. Currently, the cafe is able to beautifully blend a sit-down experience with a traditional coffee shop vibe. There is plenty of space and a number of tables that allow you to come and send emails or bring your family for post-graduation brunch. There is a healthy amount of chatter that breaths life into the cafe but doesn't take away from the dining experience. Even more amazing is that the cafe's small staff is able to keep up with the growing business. The owner is extremely friendly and hustles to make sure everything is done quickly and all demands are met. She isn't afraid to come out and chat with you either, and her knowledge of coffee and the coffee scene in Philadelphia is great. I give Cafe Renata 4 stars not because they aren't deserving of 5, but because I am extremely excited to see this gem grow. With increased advertising, greater awareness of their new dinner options, and maybe one extra waitress, Cafe Renata could be poised for perfection.
