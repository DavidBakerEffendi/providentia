Was recently in Noir with a group of 12. We had a great server that was very attentive & helpful. Not only was the our server great but the entire staff was attentive. All of Â my friends really loved the new black and white theme & really felt at ease to see that establishment was very clean. The food was extremely delicious! I really enjoyed the freshly made nachos & freshly made fried calamari & zucchini. For my entree I chose the pork which was phenomenal as well. For dessert we were given a complimentary sample dessert dish, which was devoured in seconds. My favorite dessert was the peanut butter cup! I cannot explain how delicious it was. Overall I was completely impressed with everything & cannot wait to go back soon! Keep up the good work Noir! You got my vote!
