"Fantastic breakfast at the Northern Liberties location. Initially we planned to go to a different place in the neighborhood, but the wait was too long. We decided to try Green Eggs Cafe and were delighted that we found parking and could get seated immediately. The experience was great. The decor is large, clean and bright. We had outstanding, patient service. And, the food was oh so good. My pancakes were the best I have ever had in the Phila metro area - light, flavorful and served while still hot. The portion was huge and the berry compote was out of this world. I had to get a to go container. My husband had the salmon benedict which was fresh,, flavorful, perfectly prepared. As a result, not a morsel was left. We can't wait to go back!"
