This was by the far the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had. So much so that I signed up for Yelp just to write this review. The service was slow, the manager was rude, and the food was subpar. To top it off, the gift card that I had won in charity tricky tray, which was donated by the actual restaurant, was not worth the amount of money that it said it was worth. When I brought this up with the manager, she was rude and did absolutely nothing to solve the problem. I will never again go to this restaurant and I will be sure to tell everyone that I know that they should not waste their money. There are so many better restaurants in North Jersey that do not rip off their customers.
