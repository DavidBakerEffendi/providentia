I tried out this place because of the rating on Yelp and everybody review about how wonderful this place is. It did not meet up to my expectation. The food was tasteless. Â Nothing really "wowed" me. the Lamb and chicken was not seasoned to perfection..I expected the meats to be roasted/grilled or something and seasoned well. The only thing that was seasoned was the eggplant. You are charged about 35 dollar per person even though the meal is shared amongst your group of friends. I could have went to another place and purchase good food half the price of what i paid at the Marrakesh. On the flip side staff was attentive and kind, belly dancer was really entertaining.
