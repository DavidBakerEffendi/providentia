A great place for a casual meal. I went on a Friday evening, and we had the entire upstairs seating area to ourselves. Despite being the only people upstairs, the service was excellent. We had the vegetarian sampler and the lamb special. The lamb was delicious. We ate all the vegetarian items, but the greens were a bit strong for my taste. I've had similarly sharp greens at other Ethiopian restaurants, so I think that's how they're supposed to taste. Other reviews commented on the bread being too sour, but I really enjoyed it with the meat and lentils. BYOB
