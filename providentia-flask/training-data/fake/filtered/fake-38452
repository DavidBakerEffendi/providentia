As a frequent business traveler, I am often disappointed by restaurants. Happy to say Zinc does New Haven proud. The beef lettuce wraps, and the grilled tuna are done to perfection. I recently had a business meeting at zinc, and ther service was right on, not too intrusive, but there when you needed them. I highly recommend this restaurant.
