My friend and I spend our Saturday mornings touring West Philadelphia in search of brunch spots that lovingly combine great food & great service. When we find a place (be it a food truck or quaint little restaurants), we like to make long-term commitments so we can explore menus & really feel the love. Farmacy is the latest restaurant to which we've decided to make a commitment, and she has been fantastic to us. An assortment of creative benedict dishes (Florentine made with the ever trendy kale or Philly Benny with a wonderfully tender teres major cut of steak), massive chicken and biscuits with a perfectly fried egg, covered in a rich gravy, and sweet ameretto french toast, perfectly crunchy with its almond-coating are some favorites (although the menu will be changing in the coming week). But it is the details that make this place so lovely: amazingly filtered water brought to the table, perfectly crispy home fries cooked in duck fat, and a rich coffee served in a bottomless cup...all brought to you by a lovely & brilliant staff, including the likes of Jill (who goes above and beyond, learning the details of the farm-to-table process & sharing with patrons). It's a cozy little spot, definitely worthy of a visit...and if you come around 9, 9:30 on a Saturday morning, come say hi to Rita & Andr√©s. We'll be sitting at a table, savoring/devouring a meal together while we make our way through reading beautifully written essays.
