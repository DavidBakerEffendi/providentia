Food carts are awesome and this one is truly special... I have yet to write a yelp review but i felt that I owed this spot one. Went down on a first friday and there was a small outdoor event going in the patio area where the dapper dog sits. there are picnic tables, so u get sort of a outdoor restaurant feel which was awesome, it felt like it was a community meeting area. I got the special which was a vietnamese sandwich inspired dog with fresh green jalapenos amazing... flavor explosion, truly original. DD is a must do if ur visiting Philly or if u live there and have never been.
