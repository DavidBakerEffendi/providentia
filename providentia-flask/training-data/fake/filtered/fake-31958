Posto changed my life! There is no better thin-crust pizza in the neighborhood (Gramercy). Everyone I have brought there has continued to go back on their own.  It is a small relaxing place that attracts a nice mix of people - singles, families, couples, old, young and definitely not up tight - except for the people who perhaps find the nice vibe unsettling!  The entire staff, including the delivery guy & the phone  person, are professional, courteous and friendly-always! I have gotten to know Carol and Ron and always feel welcome - they even know my name!  .
