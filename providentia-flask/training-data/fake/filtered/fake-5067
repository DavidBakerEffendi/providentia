Stay away from this place if you are expecting a decent dining place with polite service. I happened to go there yesterday after calling up and reserving a table. But the lady at the restaurant allowed someone else to go and we were asked to wait for 5 min. We waited for about 10 min and still we didn't get a table. I could see people still eating and was wondering how we cud get table sooner. I said "excuse me" to her and she was like "WHAT". Then I told her am leaving and she said "Ok GO". The most impolite service I have ever seen. Saravana bhavan at Edison is a lot lot better.
