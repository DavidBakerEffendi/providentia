My sister and I were excited to try this place tonight. The hostesses were very nice and said it should only be a 15 minute wait...we waited as crowds flooded in and whoever was managing this place was an absolute asshole. We, along with other waiting guests, waited as this guy pulled random friends of his as they walked in to open tables. We watched this go on a few times until one woman KINDLY asked how much longer the wait is and if there was anywhere else to stand (there was no where to wait as food was rushing by us - after I saw how many people were hovered around this food trying to get it out to the customer I wouldn't have eaten it). The "manager" proceeded to tell at this woman along the lines of "you're out of line, don't tell me what to do, this isn't your restaurant" etc. at that point my sister and I were fed up. This guy made a scene fighting one of his customers over a simple suggestion she made. At this point my sister and I asked to be removed from the list, told the hostesses thank you for being professional and that we were disappointed with the management - which he overheard and yelled "good, take them off" along with a shoo-ing motion. I've never been treated so disrespectfully as a customer. Everyone waiting in that place was shocked and many left after that scene. I hope this is one of many terrible reviews this place gets. I will never go back. If that isn't enough to change your mind about this place, consider the number of people standing in that tiny "waiting area" hovering and breathing over your food as the waitstaff tries to get through.
