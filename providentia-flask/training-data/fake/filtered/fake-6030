This place is brilliant.  Sourdough bread is the best I have ever had (tangy, nice crust, and great texture). Their stoop brunch is genius, Different every weekend, and everything I have tried has been off-the-chain.  Today's "Greens and Eggs" (black quinoa, greens and perfectly poached egg) was totally amazing.  Their pizza is awesome, crisp bottom, nice toppings (with cheese or non-cheese option).  I am convinced that they can do no wrong..  Truly over the top, and as I am very particular about my baked things as I am slightly wheat intolerant -- cant eat too much of it.
