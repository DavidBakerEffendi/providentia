I love this restaurant.  The food, above all else, is excellent.  Carefully selected flavors that really stand out but don't overwhelm, beautifully cooked fish, weird and yet wonderful marriages of ingredients that surprise and delight... ... I'm going to keep raving.... fabulous presentation, understanding staff and a lovely, relaxing place to sit and talk. The whisky selection was very impressive, the wine was well selected, the staff were happy to make informed suggestions.... loved it. A great place to go with a loved one or take the parents to food heaven.  Highly recommend.
