Blend on the water is one of my favorite restaurants in Queens , I've been here several times and I'm never disappointed.  The environment the food and the drinks are amazing and our server Priscilla is always very informative and attentive .  she always recommends the best dishes and drinks every time we go.   my GF loves this place . its perfect for any occasion.
