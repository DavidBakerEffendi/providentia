They can be pretty busy around lunchtime, but just call in your order to avoid the wait.  My favorites are the Chicken Supreme and the Gobbler.  I pack lunch most days, as I work in the area, but I treat myself to St. Cloud at least once a week.  These are some damn good sandwiches imo. There aren't that many food options around, the only other one I know of is McDonalds. I'd much rather spend $7-$8 for a fresh sandwich than a McWhatever meal.  Ask the employees what's popular!  They have a lot of options, so I always ask, and their suggestions have never let me down.  Sometimes they can be really busy, but hey, at least you know that mean's it's good and the ingredients are fresh!
