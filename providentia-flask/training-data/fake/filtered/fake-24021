was looking for a place to relax after a busy day.saw a sign outside this place which looked inviting.but....there was a bowl with water in it outside placed there so your dog could have a cool drink! even though i did not have my precious beagle with me at the time,i was elated to know that at least one person was kind and thoughtful .i decided to enter and get myself a cool drink.well i must say that with the great food and friendly staff, especially our waitress debbie,or deborah as she corrected me,i felt like i was at home.i ll be returning to this place every time im in the area,and most likely will go out of my way to go there.
