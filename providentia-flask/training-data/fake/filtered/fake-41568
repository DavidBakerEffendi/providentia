I've worked in this area for four years and only have just discovered Fish. So many oysters and PBR that could have been. Great place. Owner greeted us as we walked in. Sat us right at the bar and went to town. Great oyster and drink special. Great atmosphere. Perfect way to bring the Summer to a close.
