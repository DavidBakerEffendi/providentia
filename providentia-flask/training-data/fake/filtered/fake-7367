Went to Balthazar for the first time recently for Sunday brunch. It was packed, I got shoved around a few times because it was so crowded inside. The bright side is the food was absolutely amazing, I had the eggs benedict and I also tried a few other dishes my friends had gotten, all great! The reason for the 4 stars is the service, it was extremely poor. My waitress was awful, she was rude, and pushy. My friend asked for toast on the side and she almost bit his head off saying we don't serve toast on the side. Nevertheless I can judge too poorly on Balthazar for one waitress. I shall return again soon.
