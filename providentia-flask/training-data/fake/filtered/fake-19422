Nice selection of cajun food ) ect. From the Char-B Q oysters, The Green Onion Potato Salad and The New Orleans style BBQ shrimp which came with this unbelievable sauce.. You don't have to leave the kiddies home, my son enjoyed a hamburger and fruit juice. If your looking for great food and a friendly atmosphere at a resonable price, spend your sunday afternoons at the Tchoup Shop. I can't think of a thing I would have improved. I highly recommend this restaurant.
