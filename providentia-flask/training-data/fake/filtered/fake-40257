I went there for the first time for an early Friday night dinner. The restaurant itself is very unassuming from the outside and the location is hidden - it's tucked away on Hicks St right next to the BQE. I passed it by chance when I walking to Red Hook from Cobble Hill, and I would've never noticed it except I decided to walk on Hicks Street. We got there at 7PM and if was already getting crowded. Had delicious whole Branzino with fried oysters. I can honestly say it's probably one of my best dining experiences I've had in Brooklyn (food and service.) Compliments to the chef! Very nice waiter - attentive and friendly and the seafood was excellent. Decor added to the experience - it was very eclectic and rustic - lots of different decorations of fish. I will definitely come back! At LEAST once a month!
