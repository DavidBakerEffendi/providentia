Went in for a snack and drink after a nice long walk with a freind through town. Service was ok. We had two drinks mixed with a top shelf vodka. To no avail, there was no fuzzy warm feeling at all from our coctails. Had two more and were not happy. The bartender didn't even give us a freebie! If you go there, just drink bottled beer.
