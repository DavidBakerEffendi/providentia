Love this spot. I'm new to the hood and there's not much here in terms of food. There are few 3-meal places, and so this is a comfort, with a wide variety of fare. Helpful servers. It seems laid-back like the cafes I'd been to in Israel, and some of the team is from there. I'm thankful to have this place around.
