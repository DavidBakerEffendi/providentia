The food here is fantastic, from the traditional pizza to the full course italian dinner. I grew up with this place, my family always spent holidays in Dusals. It likes they are our family now. :) Food is fresh and well prepared. Portions are large and prices are super affordable for the quality of the food. . If you live in the area, you will not be disappointed if you give this place a try! Highly recommended.
