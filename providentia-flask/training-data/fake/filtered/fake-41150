Passed by this place so many times and it's always crowded so I finally decided to try it out.  First of all, why are white people cooking my food?  Ok, before you say I'm racist, imagine going to a high-end Italian restaurant and instead of Chef Goombah, you have Chef Wong cooking your pasta.  Or better yet, you make reservations for a 450+ dollars dinner at Masa and behind the sushi counter is Chef Enrique.  Ok, maybe last example is not a good one but food is very nasty.  This is a case of hype from a popular chef who has neglect his goose and is only interested in collecting the golden eggs.  It might have been great one time, but not anymore.
