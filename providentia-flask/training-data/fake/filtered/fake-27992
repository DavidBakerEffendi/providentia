As a vegeterian I found this diamond in the rough.  Their rice noodle vegetable soup is as fresh and tasty as can be.   I found a gem in their menu, vegeterian cracked/diced roll (i believe the name is something close to this, menu item #143).  What a treat and delight.  I have been going their consistenly every week for 2 months, cant get enough.
