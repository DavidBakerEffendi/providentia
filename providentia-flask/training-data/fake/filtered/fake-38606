Good specials, nice atmosphere.. but the one qualm I have is the amount of room that's inside the bar itself.   The chairs and tables are a little too close together, and make me feel cramped every time I'm there. That being said, I always have fun going there, and I enjoy the live performances and specials.  Recommended for a date during the early evening.  (Gets a little wild at night)
