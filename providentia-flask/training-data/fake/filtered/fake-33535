I would really like to write a review of this place, but I'm afraid that due to terrible customer service, I can't. A group of us booked a table for 9:30pm on a Saturday, which was fine, but we ended up being 15 minutes late. We'd called ahead to ask them to hold the table but they gave it away and didn't really care ("well, you could go to Ella down the street"...). Â More galling was that another group also arrived late and they got given their table, despite not calling ahead. So thanks for that. Apparently doing the polite thing and calling ahead gets you nowhere here.
