I absolutely love this restaurant & it's servers, managers and all. They all played a big part of the success of my boyfriend's 24th surprise birthday dinner. The food was amazing, all of it . I do not like fish but their fish is absolutely amazing. My waiter Alexis has to be the sweetest, patient, and helpful person I've come across. The manager Lance, & assistant manager Matthew are amazing . Even the security personnel made sure we were all set and satisfied. They hospitality a whole new meaning . Definitely will return
