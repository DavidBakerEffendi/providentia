I went to this restaurant for a friend's birthday a few months ago. Â I was excited to go because all of my friends had spoken very highly of this restaurant and said how good it was. However, I was disappointed for a few reasons. Firstly, I ordered a chicken plate which really was not that great (it tasted as if the chicken wasn't even cooked that much), in addition, the tables did not have table clothes and the waitress was a 'rough' east coast / south philly woman. Perhaps I just did not have a great experience, but I know I will never be going back there (unless it's for someone else's event)
