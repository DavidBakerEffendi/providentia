I am thankful to have Queens Kickshaw open up in my neighborhood. I love the v60 pour over. It takes a little more time than you may be used to but it is well worth the wait. I had the coopac and it knocked my socks off. I love the decor of this place and the lay out of the tables. It's nice to see a place that tries to cultivate human interaction.
