From the moment you enter this establishment you will be impressed. The decor is clean and crisp and sets a nice atmosphere. The restaurant is set on 2 levels and each floor has their own bar and restrooms. The bar is fully stocked with a wide selection of alcohol in general as well as a broad range of Greek wines for you to choose from. Appetizers: We had the Grilled Octopus which was cooked perfectly and was very flavorful. It is served on top of a chickpea salad which was also very tasty. Our second appetizer was the Saganaki which did not disappoint. The texture was as it should be and the taste was right on point. Entrees: Two of the four in our party ordered the lamb chops served with potatoes and they were both very impressed. One in the party ordered langoustine orzoto which was thoroughly enjoyed. Our last entree was the Pork Belly which was cooked just right and left nothing to be desired. For desert we ordered the lavender mousse and baklava served with ice cream. The lavender mousse was light and airy and the baklava was served warm. All of the portions were generous and nobody was left feeling hungry. Service was prompt and very attentive though not overbearing. This was a very impressive first time experience and we will most definitely be back again.
