Definitely a fan of The Smith. Although the atmosphere is noisy and very crowded but they always deliver on the food! The cheese & corn appetizer is amazing and the steak frites was to my liking! I definitely recommend going there, but make a reservation a head of time on the weekend or go during the week!
