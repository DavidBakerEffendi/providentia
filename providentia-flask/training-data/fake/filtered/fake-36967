This tour was excellent! I just created a yelp account so I could write a review. I live in Manhattan, and I had a great time. I would highly recommend it both to tourists and to locals. Fun for a date or with the whole family. Scott is knowledgeable, engaging, and fun. It's an awesome way to explore the city.
