Quite possibly Â my favorite restaurant on the upper west side. I would have given it 5 stars but for the noise level - it can become quite jarring on a weekend evening. The red sangria is among the best I have ever had. The matador combo is a steal - chicken cooked to perfection and the sides are always good. Their seafood entrees are also excellent. Try the ceviche - either one, both have a clean, crisp, fresh kick.
