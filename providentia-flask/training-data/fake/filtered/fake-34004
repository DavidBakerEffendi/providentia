HERE IS THE DEAL ON RESERVATIONS... I read a ton of complaints about the wait. It sucks. But the pizza is unreal and the best in New Haven. I grew up here and I rank them as 1)Sally's 2)Modern 3)Pepe's with BAR being fourth. But all do different things best. Clams Casino at Modern is the best Pizza in New Haven but for just a simple pie Sally's is TOPS..It is like artwork! Back to reservations. You have to be friends with the owner (Flo) or staff. There is a rumor that there is a special reservation phone number, but I do not think this is true. I have a friend who knows Flo and just calls Sally's and talks to her and she reserves a table. That means you get to completely walk past the people in line to a table. More importantly it means you get your order cut into the wait. So people who have been seated for 2 hours will see a "reservation" group get their piza in 15min. Â It was fun when we were snot-nosed teenagers just walking by the masses and then hearing them yell at the staff when we got our food so fast. It is the best Pizza in New Haven overall. I have seen many refrences to the reservation thing so I thought I would explain it.
