As a Tribeca local, I've  been a fan of this bar for a while. Good cocktails, smart and helpful bartenders, and good music. It's proximity to my apartment made it a natural choice for a final drink on New Years. The drinks prepared for my friend and I were great, but it was the treatment we received by one of the owners at the end of the night that will forever change my opinion of this bar and preclude me from ever setting foot in it again. As we were finishing our drinks just before closing time, we overheard him berate his bartending staff and then asked us if we were done with our drinks, to get the f*%k out. When we followed up with him to say that was uncalled for, he said he didn't f$%king care and to get out, we should have left an hour ago.  A series of his flippant remarks and expletives followed.  We left, but this experience marred what was an otherwise great New Years Eve. To all other customers, while the drinks are good, there's absolutely no need for a bar that treats customers this way to survive. There are way too many other great cocktail bars in this area to have to put up with this treatment and clear disregard for patrons. To the other owners, you should not let Kenneth (I believe that's his name) handle anything in the front of the house if you want your business to survive. You've lost a great deal of local corporate and personal business based on this evening alone.
