I want to start off by saying that I am never one to take the time to write a negative review of a restaurant.  HOWEVER, our experience on New Year's Eve was SO AWFUL that I feel it is due diligence to inform the public about the horrid service we received. When we made our reservation over the phone, we were told it was a regular dinner menu that evening.  When we sat down for our 9:30 reservation we were given a $175 pre-fixe menu.  The manager apologized and offered us two rounds of complementary drinks.  It was all downhill from there... We did not receive a single drink from the bar for 50 minutes after sitting down.  At this point, we called the manager over again to complain about the delay.  He brought us a bottle of champagne which was a nice gesture, but not what we wanted.  Our first course actually came out before our drinks.  After that we were served soup without spoons.  It took the server 10 minutes to get us spoons and by then, our soups were cold.  When our entrees arrived, my sister was served Salmon although she ordered arctic char. Because the service was so slow, we did not have enough time to enjoy the fourth course (dessert) because it was midnight and we wanted to watch the fireworks.  Our server suggested we enjoy the dessert buffet on the deck (which was gone when we got there). To add insult to injury, our server added a 20% gratuity to our check.  No where on the menu did it mention gratuity was  to be automatically added.  We surmised that she added it on because she assumed we would not tip due to the horrible service. Overall, this was the absolute worst fine dining experience we have ever had in Philadelphia.  We will NEVER return to this joke of a restaurant.
