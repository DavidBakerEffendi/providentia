The place has a very comfortable look. A brick wall with a fish tank and an Etruscan style stained glass separate the bar from the restaurant. the food was excellent. My wife had the stuffed flounder. To our surprise there was 3 pieces on her plate. I had the Mariscola with green garlic sauce. This was to die for. Drowning in this delicious broth are mussels, scallops, shrimp, clams and half of lobster cut lengthwise. I couldn't stop dipping this delicious crusty bread in it. With our entrees came a delicious broccoli soup a large plate of roasted potato's and a medley of steamed vegetables with Portuguese rice. We topped it with a warm chocolate lava bunt cake dripping with hot fudge, whipped cream and ice cream on the side. The Cappuccino is great too.
