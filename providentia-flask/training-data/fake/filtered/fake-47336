My first visit to Stowes was September 2005. I live in California and visit West Haven Ct 2-3 times a year for 2 weeks to 10 months. During those times, I have to visit Stowes at least once a week. Their fish and chips are to die for. I was introduced to lobster rolls there. Have tried that at other restaurants, NOT!! If for no other reason than to go to Stowes, it is worth the trip for me to fly to Connecticut..
