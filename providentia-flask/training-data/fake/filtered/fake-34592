This place is great!  I had never eaten Indian food other than curry so this was a true adventure.  I needed a road map literally and the guy at the counter Rajiv is very nice and helpful in explaining the dishes.  There are many dishes to choose from but I always get the same thing.  Their dosas come with different fillings and my favorites are the chicken and also the potato masala -- fantastic!  They come with your choice of chutney.  The cilantro and mango are particularly good.  I highly recommend because the food is great, the people are nice and it is particularly good for people on a gluten free diet since the dosas are made with lentils and chick peas.  A big thumbs up!!
