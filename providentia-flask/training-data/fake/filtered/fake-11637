Loved this place!  Went for my birthday a few weeks ago....food was fabulous and so were the drinks!  The loaded tater tot appetizer is off the charts!  The cheese sauce it is in is heavenly and I'm not even a big cheese-loving kinda person!  The cheeseburger eggrolls were pretty good too...although if memory serves, I think they were more like a cheesesteak eggroll, but still good.  For dinner I had the Grilled Panini which was fantastic!  Other folks that I went with also enjoyed their dishes a great deal...some of which were the Mac & Cheese, the Grilled Polenta Capresse, and the burgers.  I don't remember what everyone else had...because I had too much Moonshine!  lol  Seriously, delicious drinks too!  I had the Spiced Pear Tini and it was fantastic!  Others had the solar sangria and other drinks.  Everyone seriously enjoyed everything!  Keep doing what you're doing guys....it was a really nice evening...thank you!
