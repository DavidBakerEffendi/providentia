Was disappointed that the place wasnt more decorated with flowers on the outside of the inn. It was the last week in May. And there were weddings.  The house itself is beautiful, but the additions are in much need of repair and update. Strong odor of dampness throughout the place. Our room had a bullet hole in the window with tape over it and many cracks. The toilet ran off and on all night. Nothing special/extra in the rooms for the price. Mattress were very limp. The financial part of our stay was very confusing. Was charged more than quoted for everything. The breakfasts and the reception dinner were excellent. Food was great and the set up was beautiful. Alla did a wonderful job. The cook and waitress were both very pleasant. The lady at the front desk was a little icy. There's where the financial confusion kicked in also. Enjoyed meeting Max, their dog. Also enjoyed the spa.  My recommendation would be to pay up front, no cards. It's a nice place but, I doubt l would go back there. Sorry.
