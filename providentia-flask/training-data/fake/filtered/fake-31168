Wafa's is by far the BEST restaurant in all of Forest Hills, and probably the best in all of Queens. The food is tasty with the perfect blend of flavorful spices and the staff is super friendly and accommodating. My favorite dish is the 'lamb special'. I could eat there every day and never get sick of the food. In one word, this place is truly AMAZING!
