Hands down, one of the best restaurants in Philly. The asparago pizza and the beet salad are both to die for. Along with the meatballs, gnocchi, budino, sheeps milk ricotta, octopus...I could go on and on. But that pizza! And the chefs making the pizza. It's heaven, really. If you haven't been you're missing out. And now I'm drooling just thinking about it all.
