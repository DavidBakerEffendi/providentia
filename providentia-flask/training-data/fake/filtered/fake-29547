Four of us had dinner at Noir last Friday night.  When we arrived, the owner, Billie, came out from behind the bard to greet us!  What a great dinner! The stuffed artichokes are to die for. Our friends had the chicken wings (the best they ever had), a wonderful light salad, and we had the bronzino (absolutely perfectly grilled) and a pasta dish.  Can't wait to go back!!!
