Ate dinner here Saturday 11-16-13.  Excellent place. Food was great. Went at 7pm, place was crowded, but only waited about 15 minutes for a table of four. Waiter was professional and there very quickly. The appetizer was eggplant rollatini which was fresh and well made. Salads were all nice big portions with fresh ingredients and outstanding seasonings in the dressings. My main course was a special, tilapia over linguine, which was amazing. Fresh, well prepared, nice portion and very tasty. Everyone at the table was very happy. Gluten free macaroni is available and very well made. The deserts were all excellent. The lava cake is great. The place has nice high  ceilings, plenty of room and they don't rush you out. We sat there for over 3 hours, never got a dirty look or felt rushed at all. Price was very reasonable. Excellent place for families (lots of pizza selections to choose from) , but it's great for adults also. Great place, highly recommend.
