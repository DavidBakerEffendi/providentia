this palace should be closed by the board of health! servers are over worked, mold on the floors and walls by the restooms. even the glass dividers look like someone washed them with a chicken wing. food was below standers and sushi was old with imatation crab. i have traveled the world and never came across anything like this. we walked out. don't bother going until its cleans up it act.
