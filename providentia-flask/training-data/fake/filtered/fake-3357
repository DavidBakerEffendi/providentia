The tacos are made great by their wide array of freshly made salsas. Chipotle mayo, jerk, devils hot, and many others. The tortillas are not freshly made (store bought), as are the chips for guac and salsa. but other than that, they scratch make everything themselves right on the line. Cool place that's open late and sells cheap tacos. what else do you want?
