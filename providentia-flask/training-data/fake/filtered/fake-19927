I love this place! A unique rustic yet elegant setting gives this place an amazing atmosphere, you just never want to leave it. It gets very busy, but you feel comfortable and want to just soak it in as long as you can. The food is to die for... everything we had was on point, well executed and nicely presented. The search for interesting flavors is their strength - try the mussels, the broth is soooo good! The schnitzel is superb, just like a proper one you can get in Vienna; the ravioli and the short ribs were also outstanding. Â The staff is extremely attentive and helpful, even when the place really fills up on week-ends. At the end of the dinner they reccommended we have a drink at their cocktail bar up the block - The Third Man - that is just another gem! What a great night on Avenue C - will have to come back soon!!!
