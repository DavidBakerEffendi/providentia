Great meal. I ordered the lamb, cooked well, great presentation. Definitely not a place to go if your in a rush. Take your time and enjoy the wonderful flavors. Ambiance is perfect. I took my wife here on Sunday night before her busy week began. Great way to relax. Note: they have unisex bathrooms, which I'm not a fan of. Also I asked for items with no pork or alcohol (Muslim diet) and the waiter was very helpful in guiding us through the menu accordingly.
