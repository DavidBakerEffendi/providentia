Absolutely love this place.....great variety of food....kinda crowded on Saturday afternoons.....I personally do not like crowds especially how tight people are in there....My best place is the produce corner....has everything you would need and the prices are fair.....A little upset when the spice store closed in the back...A must to go to when downtown Philly....pick up some cheese, wine and sweets....
