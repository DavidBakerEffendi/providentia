I absolutely love this place! I always order a #1 and a milk tea here.  The bread is delicious and crunchy.  The lady who is making the sandwiches is not cheap with stuffing up your bread.  It is filled with meats, vegetables, and sauce.  Just by reviewing this place on Yelp already makes me want to go out and order a meal there.  However, I realized the prices are going up as time goes by.  A bahn mi that used to cost $3.25 is now around $4.75.
