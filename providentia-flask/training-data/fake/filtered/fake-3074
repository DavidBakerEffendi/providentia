Great tapas - definitely try the hazelnut-infused goat cheese! Perfect size to share and small enough not to leave you stuffed for your main course. It's BYOB which is convenient! You can order sangria and add your own wine/rum/liquor to it. We had the banana sangria and added rum - delicious! For the main course, I had the coconut crusted fish filet which was to die for. Just a warning, this place has a loud atmosphere, so if you're looking for a quiet place - this isn't it. The decor really makes you feel like you're in a Miami beach restaurant and in the warmer seasons, you can sit outside in their outdoor courtyard area.
