Really nice food and good portions! I have been here a half dozen times with my boyfriend and my family. Thee waiters are always extremely nice and they give you soup before the meal too. Decor is also really pretty. Highly recommend this place. If you're looking for Chinese food in the Parsippany area - this place and Qin Dynasty are where you should go! Not Noodle Chu - that place is rude and unsanitary.
