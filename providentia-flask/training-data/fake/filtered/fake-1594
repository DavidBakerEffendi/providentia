I have had lunch too many times to count.  Always the best. Have used Deli A Go Go for catering 3 times.  The food is to die for.  Everything from the bread, to salad to main dishes and the dessert it GREAT.  I love the Rosemary Pork, the Lemon Chicken and their baked mac & cheese are my favorites!!!!  I highly recommend!!!!!!!
