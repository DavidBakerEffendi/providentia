If you are looking for a great place to sit down and enjoy a nice ambience. Go somewhere else. Patzeria is a Pizza joint, plain and simple. This is one of the best pizza slices I have had in Midtown. The grandma slice is off the walls. Amazing sauce and crust. The tomato basil slice was also equally excellent. This is going to be our regular delivery spot from now on. Only negative is that they close at midnight. The Pizza was fantastic and we will be going back when we come back to NYC.
