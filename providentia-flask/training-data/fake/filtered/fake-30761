I absolutely love Marea so I decided Ai Fiori was worth a shot.  The space is wonderful, with a kick-azz bar space as you enter.  I had some tasty bites and drinks here as I waited for my group to arrive. Did the four course prix fixe menu.  Fell short of expectations, but maybe that's because I was holding to Marea as a benchmark.  Razor clam dish was overpowered by the chorizo I thought.  Pasta was yummy, crab and bottarga was a great balancing combo.  but the main dish was a let down.  Read a lot of things about the veal chop, so excited, but it really didn't live up to hte hype.  Looked like the cod across the table was met with high reviews, too bad I didn't get to try!
