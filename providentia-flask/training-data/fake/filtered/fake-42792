This is my first time to write a review on Yelp. However, my purpose is to warm ppl like me who like to us Groupon discounts for restuarants. My sister and I  went to Nyona today with a Groupon of 5 dollar off 20 and i do saw good comments on this restuarant... However, We were very disappionted. The only reason i gave two star instead of one because the veggie shrimp was good. I ordered a veggie with shrimp and My sister ordered a veggie with pork  on the lunch menue which comes with a chicken veggie soup. However, the soup didnt look so good when it comes. My sister try it and told me it was okay. I thought maybe it will taste better then how it looks. Okay,...lets give it a try.... and then.... the nightmare started... i  found a  dead fly in the soup bowl right after i swallow the soup!!!!!  I was about to throw up... I call the waiter and told him that there is a fly in the soup bowl and show it to him. He look at the soup and then say..."sorry"... then he turn around and  took away the soup bowl .... he disappeared for 5min and come back with another bowl of same soup.... i didnt even want to look at that soup... i told him i dont want it ... and then he just left.... when my entree comes, i felt better . cuz the veggie was pretty good.  However, they bring the wrong entree for my sister, she got some kind of yam with pork instead of veggie pork. she was gooing to keep it until she try her first bite.. she told me it taste awful...  and i try it ,... its some kind of yam with fatty pork in dark soy sauce... which taste weired.... so i called the waiter again  and told him that he brings the wrong entree and just took it away and look at us like we were asking for troubles... 10mins later another waiter came back with the veggie pork which looks almost the same as the Yam pork..... We both end up going home with stomachache  .... Theres many good Malaysian food in the area and with better price... i really dont recommond this place !!!!!
