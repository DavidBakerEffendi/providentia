I wasted ten dollars eating from this place. It was my first time eating from Lombardi's after seeing how popular it is. It even said "BEST REVIEWED" on the side of a banner so my friends and I thought it might be a good place to eat. We got into the store and we were guided by a waitress who placed us in the waaaaaaaayyyyyyyy back corner of the store where the other exit was. The waiter who arrived moments after we were seated, was smiley and nice. We ordered the 18" pizza with four toppings. It took about 30 minutes for the pizza to come out and it looked delicious. We each ate 2 slices...and as I ate my second slice, I tasted this bitter flavor which I thought was from the red onions. I then turned the pizza over and it was COMPLETELY BLACK and BURNT. I told my friends to flip their's over and theirs' were burnt too. I called over the waiter to tell him that we were eating COMPLETELY burnt pizza. He looked at us with a "so.....what?" look. I also asked him if all pizzas are supposed to be burnt like this. He then tells me, "have you ever tried a pizza before? They're usually cooked in traditional coal ovens that have no temperature control, so they come out different every time." I was a little mad about him questioning me if I ever tried a pizza and told him how carelessly prepared the pizza was. He then tells me "Oh, you're supposed to tell us to cook it lightly or do you want it harshly cooked." He NEVER offered such an option to us, so instead of asking for the manager to report this waiter's ignorance and rudeness, I just told him "okay." He walked away quickly. If this waiter was not rude and annoying, I would say that the pizza was okay. It was not the best pizza I've ever tried. The meatball topping is a must get.
