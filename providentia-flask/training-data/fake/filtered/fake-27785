My boyfriend loves Thai food, especially super spicy.  He often complains about Thai food or the level of spice... but not with  Clifton Thai! He asked for an 11 on a scale of 1-10 spicy-ness & was not disappointed. I ordered the pad thai which was delicious & not too spicy for a first time thai eater.  Also tried the potato & chicken dish which comes with rice, very good! I brought leftovers to work the next day & everyone was asking where i got the food b/c it smelled so good! We love Clifton Thai!
