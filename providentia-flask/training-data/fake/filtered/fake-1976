Not a good place to enjoy your evening! I came to this restaurant at least once a week. I consider myself is a value customer. But I never impressed about their service. I was at this place for dinner tonight. Service was terrible. I asked the waiter if I can order my meal while I am waiting for my friend at the table. He said "No" and then he replied that he can't take my order until my friend come. He said that it is the rule that his boss has given and they have to follow the rule. On a Monday night at 7pm, there are only two tables occupied. 8 tables are empty. And there were no reservations and no other people waiting. He has to follow the stupid rule and let me wait in the waiting area. I talked to the manager, I can't really believe that this guy sounds even worse. He was so rude and said that if I am not happy then I go Vietnam Palace across the street. Basically he kicked their customers out of their place. His name is Allen but he refused to give me his last name. He also refused to give me his boss contact info. Who is the owner of this restaurant? I don't think it is hard to find out. Does the owner ever know how their employees treat their customers? If the restaurant keeps the service like this, sooner or later the business at this restaurant will be moving to across the street. By the way, Vietnam Palace across the street from Vietnam is a very good restaurant and their food is good and the service is much better than this place. I really feel sorry the owner of this restaurant.
