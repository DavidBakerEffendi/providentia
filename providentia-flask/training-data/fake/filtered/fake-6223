Friendly manager....however, had an uninvited guest crawling across then under the table. The manager (?) kindly hunted  it down and disposed of it. Got dessert for two for free in compensation....my friend enjoyed the tilapia  but my chicken with sausage & yellow rice had 4 to 5 lumps of beige, rubbery pcs of chicken and gloppy rice........very disappointing.
