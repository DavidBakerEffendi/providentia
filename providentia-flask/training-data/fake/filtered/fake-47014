My husband and I went to Banana Leaf last night while walking around Chinatown in Philly. We enjoyed the restaurant and the experience. We started by trying the Roti Canai (fantastic) and the Satay Tofu (also very good). We were pretty stuffed after that, but decided to have Beef Chow Fun and Curry Sliced Chicken Noodle. Both were delicious. The Beef Chow Fun was not pretty to look at but tasted good. The Curry Sliced Chicken Noodle was a HUGE bowl of soup but was very good. We had plenty to take home for lunch today. Both the Beef Chow Fun and the Curry Sliced Chicken Noodle reheated well and were still good the next day. We'd definitely go back.
