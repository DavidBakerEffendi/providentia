I am a returning customer and I was really looking forward to another meal at Doma. Unfortunately my meal was ruined by the shittiest service. The server looked and seemed drunk. it took about 10 minutes to get an ice bucket for a bottle of wine and when the check came they wouldn't accept an american express gift card because "our system thinks this card is expired even though it isn't". Food was good but when you're paying that much for a meal, I would have liked a better experience.
