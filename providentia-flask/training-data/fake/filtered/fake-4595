I was thrilled to learn that Luis Bollo was returning to NYC. I had eaten so many wonderful meals at his former restaurant, Meigas, and was saddened when it close and he left town. After eating at Salinas I wish he would have remained out of town. Although our waiter was quick to point out that he was in the restaurant the night we ate there, I'm sure he did not taste any of the food that was being prepared because it was awful and most of it was inedible. This is a pretentious place for show and not for food. If you have money to burn and don't care about the quality or taste of the food then you should pay them a visit. If you want some real Tapas in the neighborhood try Tia Pol or a bit further down in the West Village Caliou both of which produce consistently outstanding food.
