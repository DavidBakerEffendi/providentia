12/4/11, I have been to the Argyle many times over the years. My last visit was,  especially good as it was St. Andrews day and there was some very good entertainment, Pagpiping, Highland dancing Banjo/Guitar playing and singing. I can't wait until my next visit which will be sometime in January 2012. I will be taking agroup of friends for the annual celebration of Rober Burn' birthday. The menu has been updated and many very good items have been added to the always good Fish & Chips, Meat Pies, Black Pudding and Haggis. The Dining room  looks great with new tables and chairs. This is the first time that I have written a review for any restaurant. BYOB Bob N.
