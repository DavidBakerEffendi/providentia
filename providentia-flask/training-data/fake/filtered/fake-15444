My husband and I came here for dinner.  The service was very friendly, and the food came quickly.  However, we were very dissapointed in the food itself.  We ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs which had tough meat and not tender with a bit too much barbecue sauce.  The stuffing and gravy looked old and tasteless.  The pulled bbq chicken sandwich was not good at all.  I think it had a lot of dark meat chicken (i'm used to eating only white meat), so maybe that was part of the problem.  It also had very little sauce and was very bland.  The best part of our meal was the onion rings.
