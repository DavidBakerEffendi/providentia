Would have to agree that the Kale salad and the Brussels sprout salad were very good, though the flavor was quite strong and salty.  Maybe a bit on the heavier side as this is accompanying the rich brothy ramen to come... The main ramen, - I ordered the miso ramen and the pork topping and the noodles were very nice, but unfortunately the broth did not have any 'dashi' - soup stock in it and made the broth taste very bland.  The eggs were not boiled long enough as it shouldn't be too runny.   Friends who tried the pork steamed buns said they were very very good, with the cilantro in it.   The interior and the service/staff was very nice.  It's a good size place for a ramen joint.
