We chose this place on the back of reviews here and boy what a decision - we ate here on our second day and never went anywhere else for breakfast after wards. Its a superb place for excellent food and Johny himself was really cool, makes you feel like a regular on your first visit. Would recommend this to anyone, very good value.
