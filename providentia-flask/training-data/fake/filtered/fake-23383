Shade is a definitely a place I like to go for a low-key hang out. A smallish bar, with tables, stools, and some cushioned pews along the wall (which I always aim for,) the bartender greets you as you walk in, welcomes you to sit anywhere and will shortly be with you. The food menu is simple with crepes and sandwiches, and honestly hasn't yet impressed me (hence the missing star.) However, the happy hour and drink specials, and the awesome service that we get has made up for the food. Another plus to Shade is it never seems over-crowded or loud. I'm not quite sure how they accomplish it, but its a great asset along with their prime location. I would say Shade is one of my go to spots for some relaxed drinks.
