This place is horrendous.  Horrible drinks, worst beer - who has bad beer? They food is trying to be creative and it just gives you a stomach ache at the end of the night.  Oh - and not creative! This BBQ concept is a bit played out.  If you are trying find a restaurant in that location, the good thing is - you are surrounded by MUCH better places to spend your money.
