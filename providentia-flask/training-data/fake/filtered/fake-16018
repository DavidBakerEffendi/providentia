A fun looking spot that is part of a Russian chain; hence, the old farming implements hanging from the ceiling, the waiters in costume, the complimentary parting shot of spicy vodka and slice of pickle. Lovely and friendly staff. One expects crowds on a Thanksgiving weekend Saturday evening. The nearly empty restaurant (when we left at 8PM) may speak to the lackluster food. Borscht was good, but the Ukrainian dishes, such as latkes, dumplings, etc. were flavorless and mostly flour and bread. A non-alcoholic home-made "beer" is unusual tasting and definitely worth a try ("kvas"). I was hoping for some exciting food, which is why we went with a friend from Kazakhstan. Not sure why other reviews rave about the food.
