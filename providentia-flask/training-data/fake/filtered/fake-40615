So when you google best pizza places in NY...this place comes up...it blows...pizza was below subpar at best...our waitress showed litte interest in our well being and appetite for some bad ass zaa....oh and wait everyone who goes there should order the BREADSTICKS!!!!!....there are the best thing in that place....WRONG!....those things tasted like the cardboard box the homeless guy was sleeping down the street on...just when you need to something to wash down those deliciously tasty sticks you are denied the option for a free refill leaving your mouth high and dry with the taste of New York street... bottom line..I HIGH ENCOURAGE THE BREADSTICKS!!!! OH and the beyond mediocre pizza which is just searching for more sauce and better taste should leave you feeling refreshed and full!!!! Enjoy the goodness!!
