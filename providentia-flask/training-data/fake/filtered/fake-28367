I live down the street from Kyclades and loooooove eating here. Everything is delicious put I tend to get the Greek salad, swordfish kebab, fried potatoes, horta. And the free dessert at dinner is soooo yummy. However....do NOT EVER sit inside the tiny restaurant, the noise from the open kitchen is beyond belief. In 8 years we sat there once! In the winter they have an outdoor space that is enclosed and heated with overhead heat lamps, in the summer they take down the plexiglass walls and diners enjoy the weather.
