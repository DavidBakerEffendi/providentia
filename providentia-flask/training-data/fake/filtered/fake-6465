Though Tung Hing's food is OK, their service SUCKS!  They have the worst woman in the world taking their phone orders!  She's so nasty, especially when they make a mistake.  They got my order wrong and when I asked for them to fix it, she asked "can't you just eat that?" No!  I want to eat what I ordered!  I'd give them 3 and 1/2 stars if they got rid of that nasty woman.  Never ordering from them again after that.
