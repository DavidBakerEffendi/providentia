This place is more on the authentic Mexican side and is very good if youre a displaced Texan and kind of homesick. Steak and chicken are nicely cooked, salsa is nice and hot (and green/tomatillo based), ceviche is good. Chips are a little greasy and ground beef can be very fatty. If I had an issue with this place (aside from fatty ground beef) is that its a bit on the pricey side. Actually, more on the expensive side. That said, its worth a try if youre craving mexican.
