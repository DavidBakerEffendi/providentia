very basic menu - and food is just ok.  The service from the female owner, and later on from her brother was the worst i have seen in years.  They were very rude, pushy and gave us a lot of grief for not having one of the people in our reservation there on time.  They took forever to take our order as sort of a punishment even though the place was not that busy.  I would NEVER go back there after the way the owners who wait tables as well treated us.
