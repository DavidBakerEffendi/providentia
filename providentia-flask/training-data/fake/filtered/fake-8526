Don't waste anytime reading this...simply head over there.   The chef is actually a chef and loves what he does.   It shows in the way the place feels and what's on the menu.  Why five stars?  The food is excellent..excellent...excellent and the owner and staff have a way of making you feel you're at their place for dinner, or lunch or breakfast.  And I do not have to travel to Soho to eat anymore.  That's worth 15 stars! You might be wise to check this place out in it's infancy because when spring time hits...this place will be jammed.  And you will have the distinct pleasure of being a  member of the I found it first club.
