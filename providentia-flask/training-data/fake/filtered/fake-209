OVERRATED.  I'm from philly, born and raised, on the playground is where I spent most of my days!! lol.  Seriously, the only time I eat from Pats or Genos is when Im drunk off my ass and its 3 in the morning, otherwise, these places get way too much hype, its a f****** tourist attraction.  You can get a way better cheese steak from a corner takeout place AT A MUCH CHEAPER PRICE!  I can't believe that so many people actually pay almost $10 for an average cheese steak.  Once again... I hardly go here, its usually out of desperation because after the club lets out no1 is open and this is a drunk's man's hungry option
