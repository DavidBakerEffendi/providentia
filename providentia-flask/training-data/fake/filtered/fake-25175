Amazing meal in tiny restaurant. As mentioned before, AC and restroom exists, tap water does (luckily) not. Impressive quality ingredients, strip steak better than Peter Lugers the day before, and inspired cooking. Some reviewers note high prices but with BYOB without corkage you should figure in a 5 buck saving per person on drinks which makes the total bill fairly cheap. Both the convenience store across the street and the one on 4th have good selections of beer.
