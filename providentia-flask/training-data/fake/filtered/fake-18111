I had the most terrific meal at Estia last week. I am traveling and I am a small business owner, and I was telling a friend about it and she had asked me if I wrote a review and I said no, but the next time I have a few minutes, I'll do that. Anyway, if you like fine dining and reasonably priced, great-tasting wine, you'll love this place. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars was because the service was a little slow. The ambiance and the food and wine were over the top! I'll be back at Estia soon. The Lamb Chops are to die for!!!!
