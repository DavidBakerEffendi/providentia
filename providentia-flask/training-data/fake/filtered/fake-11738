This place is amazing! I took my two friends here for the first time last night and we've each got at least 15 years of sushi eating experience. The food was excellent and the price was very reasonable. I suggest eating at the sushi bar if it's crowded. When we left there were still people waiting so the joint is jumping. It's not a huge place but its interior is well-kept. The staff did a good job of keeping up with our orders. One suggestion: Don't fill up on the fried, hot food if you're there for the sushi. I had some Chicken Udon soup, Shumai, and some Pork Katsu, which slowed down my sushi and sashimi marathon. :-) Finally, they don't serve alcohol but it's BYOB so bring along some saki and plum wine. FYI: Someone mentioned sushipalace.us as their website but that's incorrect. They don't have a website yet. The referenced link is for a different restaurant in Hamden, CT.
