Best Pizza in Philly.  Thin crispy crust, fresh toppings and sauce, just like you get it in Italy.  Great pasta too.  I've been going here since I was a kid and it opened and it doesnt get any better than this.   Dont be fooled by the location and not so fancy looking front.  This place is amazing.
