All class and no judgments. I live near Tribeca and I run often on West St. along the water. Today I was extremely thirsty and had forgotten to bring any money. I decided to stop at the first restaurant I saw. Keep in mind I'm in shorts, tank top, running cap and I'm literally drenched. Despite my appearance, the hostess was really nice and asked me if she could help. I told her I just wanted some water. She accommodated by pointing me towards the bar. And it so happened that the owners were sitting at the bar eating their late lunch. The owners, a lovely couple by the name of Joshua & Heidy, told me to sit down and take a breather(probably because I was THAT sweaty lol). The bartender(who's really cute by the way) started pouring me a glass of water without me even asking. What nice people! I looked at the menu and everything sounds interesting and delicious. With such a wonderful staff who treated a sweaty runner like any other customer, I've found a new place in my neighborhood that I'll be going to again and again. Thanks Michelle, Heidy & Joshua. See you soon!
