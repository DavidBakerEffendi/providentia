If you pay attention to what goes in your mouth and have any food allergies, you will absolutely love this place.  They are entirely gluten free and mostly paleo. I love the chicken tenders and the kale salad is seriously amazing.  The paleo muffins have become a staple.  Their menu is how I would cook for myself if I had the time.  I order from here several times a week now that they are on Seamless!!!!
