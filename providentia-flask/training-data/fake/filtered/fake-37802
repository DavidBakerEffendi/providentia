Would not return... We had a large party for a bday...... We were called hours before our reserved time and asked to arrive 15 min early.... We could not, so when we did arrive we were rushed the entire time... Food was fair.. Boxed pasta. Veal was undercooked and very gristly.... .. Very, very dissappointing... Will not return... Would not recommend.. what a shame.
