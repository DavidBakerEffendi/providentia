Tried to go here at 6pm and was told that they were holding the 5 open tables "for neighborhood regulars". Even after explaining that we (a party of 4) live 3 blocks away and had been there multiple times, we were told it would be an hour. Between the pretentious service at St. Anslem, the terrible service at Spuyten Duyvil, and now that Fette Sau doesn't deliver anymore - I'm done with this trifecta. There are too many good places in this neighborhood to put up with bullshit. These places are for tourists.
