Got sent here from the Barber shop around the corner Hairrari. Really glad their barber Sarah sent me here because I'm new to Williamsburg and this place is really cool, friendly and cheap good food. The burger is amazing, ill definitely be coming back soon to see what the place is like at night, but for lunch, def 5 stars
