Great Food. The food at Green Chilli is amazingly tasty and just perfect for me and many of my friends & family. I tried several items and was always satisfied with the food quality and dining experience. If anyone needs authentic indian home style taste, he/she should definately visit Green Chilli. Kudos to the chef and friendly management. Good to know that they also provide Catering services. Looking forward to use their catering services soon.
