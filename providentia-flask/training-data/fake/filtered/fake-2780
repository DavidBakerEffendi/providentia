DO NOT GO TO CUBAN PETE'S!!!!!!!  I witnessed something that happened last night that should NEVER happen to ANYONE!  A party of 11 were sitting next to our table.  One woman was in a wheelchair.  The waiter asked the party to move her wheelchair three times, shoving her into a corner that her wheelchair was unable to move backwards.  I mean I could not believe what I was seeing, since this was the first time we choose to eat at CP's.  Then they asked the others to move their seats because the long bench was in an awkward place.   It was about 45 minutes and all the waiter AND hostess was doing was moving these people from side to side. IT WAS LUDICROUS.  Then they were asked to go out the side door to a back room where there might have been more room.  These people ONLY wanted to have dinner.  At this point, I heard someone ask for a Manager.  They were told the "Manager/Owner" was not there and that she would phone him.  The hostess came back and the message from the Manager was to tell these people to "JUST LEAVE". This is AFTER they finally just sat down and gave their order!  THERE IS NOT A MEAL ON THIS EARTH THAT MEANS MORE TO ME THAN TREATING A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR WITH RESPECT.  WE ALL GET OLD, WE ALL HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS THAT ARE OR WILL BE IN A WHEELCHAIR AND HOW DARE THEY NOT BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO MAKE THIS GROUP HAPPY.  We will never ever go back to Cuban Pete's and I pray that anyone reading this will feel the same. DOMINIC R./OWNER YOU REALLY SHOULD BE SHAMED OF YOURSELF.  If I didn't actually see this with my own eyes, I would not have fully believed it, BUT I DID.
