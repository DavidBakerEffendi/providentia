FOOL ME 3 TIMES. I have been to this restaurant three times. The first two experiences were downright awful, but like a sucker I decided to return a third time ( it was very cold and I moved in across the street ) The last time I went in, there were very few people inside. I ordered three tapas plates to go. The order took 40 MINUTES TO ARRIVE. When I was handed the bill - ALL of the prices that I had based my choices on, online were suddenly doubled. When I made the bartender aware of this, I was dismissed. P.S I made her aware of this POLITELY The food I waited 40 minutes for was old and disgusting. DO NOT GO HERE
