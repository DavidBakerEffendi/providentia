I had ordered cheeseburger deluxe from this place Well done meat with sauteed mushroom, pickles, lettuce and tomatoes were the toppings I had.  Buns are dry and the meat just tasted old and nasty.  I would never eat here again.  Just a tourist attaraction place with high price and low service/quality.
