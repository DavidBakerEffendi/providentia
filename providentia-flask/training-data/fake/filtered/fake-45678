condering that this place was transformed from a Big Ed's Ribs restaurant,Which sat there empty for years. I'd say they deserve a round of applause. The building was in very bad shape. In time it will have it's own personality. You know the saying "Rome wasn't built in a day." Getting a restaurant off the ground takes time. We've dined there quite a bit and have had some wonderful meals. Like any other diner, their's always room for improvement. Â The place has only been open for a very short time. It hasn't had much exposure yet. I must say that their tuna is terrific as well as their Burgers. We've had Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner there. The staff is very friendly. When a restaurant first opens it's a very awkward time. Getting familar with the community takes time as well. If your not happy with something let them know so they can improve it. They'll do well if given the chance. Again, remember what was there before. They deserve a pat on the back for bringing a diner to South Brunswick which really doesn't have many eateries of this type. Spread the word and help them grow.
