This place was incredible! On a second date with the guy Im seeing this place sure did make the awkwardness a little less awkward! The space is gorgeous, eccentric and super chic at the same time. A bit fancy even, I felt quite underdressed. We had a great time and the music was mellow, I LOVE italian food so this was an easy win. I had to go with the mushroom ravioli which really stood out compared to other places with similar dishes. My date had just a salad, he loved it...unfortunately I didnt try it. We had a very delicate glass of red wine and something deliciously unusual for dessert, but too sweet so we couldnt finish the whole dish. The over all service was ok, I didnt really understand the waiter, he spoke quite fast and seemed to be in a hurry, not the most attentive, but very kind. We stayed for some time at the bar after Â dining, enjoying a glass of wine which was great because it did lead to a third date :).
