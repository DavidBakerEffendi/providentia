I would definitely recommend this place to anyone, who enjoys the french kitchen. I went there with my girlfriend in January, i had a wonderful "Mussels mariniere" with a lot of taste, and an outstanding soup at the bottom. My girlfriend had a really nice "Duck confit", which she enjoyed very much. For dessert we shared a perfect "Creme brul√©e". When we return to New York, we would love to come back to this place, and enjoy a french meal. Besides the fact that the experience was great, it was also very affordable.
