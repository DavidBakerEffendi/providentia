As a chef ,after being duped into thinking might want to try this ,I did. Thank God Ilive on the west coast where you are not restricted on what you put on your burger or how it's cooked. Undercook meat should be left to prime cuts, this was not. White toast there are better options. For drunk people, yes it stays open late, not good enough reason to go there. GREAT BURGERS ARE CONSUMED AT MOES IN S.F. THAT'S HOW IT'S DONE!!!!!
