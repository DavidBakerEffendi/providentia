Great experience, except for the bouncer, who was a real jerk. I've been to Standard Tap before and had a great time, but I was there on Friday night (5/31/13) and the bouncer was incredibly rude and terrible at his job. I went with my 24 year old girlfriend. Bouncer looks at her license and stares at it for 2 minutes before claiming that he thinks it is not my girlfriend's license (note: it was her license, the picture looks just like her, and she has never had an incident like this before. He then has the nerve to say "give this license back to its real owner. You're not getting in." Obviously he doesn't know how to do his job, so I ask to speak to a manager. He quickly changes his tune and says he will go get an "Age Declaration card" where my girlfriend has to sign a card declaring that she is really 21 or older (which is stupid because she was already doing that by presenting the ID and the card wouldn't save the bar from liability if they really were serving underage kids). While she was filling out the card, the bouncer lets numerous people in without even checking their ID or slightly glancing at IDs. I make a comment to my friend in our group about it and the bouncer tells me to "shut your mouth or you are not getting in." Once we were all in we had a fine time, but the bouncer was awful. I probably won't go back simply because of how much of a jerk the bouncer was.
