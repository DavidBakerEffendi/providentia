I started a delivering job and I had a drop off right next to this amazing food cart. All I can say is I was very impressed with my food. I ordered the chicken on a grilled pita with veggies with white sauce and hot sauce. It was $4 by the way and I would gladly pay more for it. I encourage everyone reading this to give it a try. but beware, don't order the hot sauce if you don't like hot food. Very clean and great service.
