Went there last night to have dinner. The service from the get go was sub-par AND rude. After they ran my credit card, they brought back the credit card receipt without my credit card. They claimed it was in the check presenter they placed on the table and that I was the one who lost my own card. Ridiculous!!! How could I have lost my own card when I relinquished it to the waitress and didn't get it back??? After all of this rudeness, I still remained calm and waited about 15 minutes to see if it would turn up. Nothing. They never called to apologize. I've definitely lost my appetite for this place.
