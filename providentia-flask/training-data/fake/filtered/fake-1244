Amazing food, great service and friendly waiters. I ordered and tasted 5 different appetizers and loved them all! The grape leaves and squid were particularly tasty. I highly recommend them. For the main i had the poached salmon, again delicious. The rice it came with was a tad oily, but it was still tasty and i enjoyed the salmon and the dressing on it. The restaurant is one of the nicest greek restaurants ive ever been to and i will definitely be back!
