Tried this place for the first time for dinner a few days ago, and the food and service was excellent. I'm so glad to see another Diner in the area again; I'm tired of the "corporate" restaurants. This place has your typical Diner menu with all kinds of choices for everyone! The inside decor was a little mismatched and strange like they pieced together three diners, but it was clean and the food and service was great, which is what really counts!
