I can't even comment on Ekta's food. Why? Because it still hasn't been delivered, nearly two hours after I ordered it. I've never had, or even heard of, such terrible service. I've called the restaurant to check on the progress (if you can call it that) and have been told each time that it will be another fifteen minutes. I'm so angry I didn't even cancel the order because I want to see how long it takes at this point. Never again.
