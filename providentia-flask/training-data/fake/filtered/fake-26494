My company Mti Inc will have our first annual Christmas Party here on the 17th of Dec 2013. I haven't had any time really to check out this new place. But I heard from so much people that it is a great place to have your lunch or dinner here at Church Publick. So as soon as I tasted the food I will make my review but for now it is a great place from the outside and I am really looking forward for my companies Christmas Party here next week. Have a great day.
