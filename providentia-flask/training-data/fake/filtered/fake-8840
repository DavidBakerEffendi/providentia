Background:  This is a nice new edition to this area of the city.  This is my first time eating here.  I got the rotisserie chicken on a whole wheat pita with pepper parmesan dressing.   What I like: The ingredients are fresh and delicious.  They use red bell peppers instead of green ones; green are considerably cheaper, so I thought that was telling of their perspective on high-quality.  Whether or not the calories count would agree, I felt like I was eating a health-conscious meal which made me feel good about myself. What I don't like:  The dressing is not applied by the pita maker when they assemble it.  You're given a side dish of the dressing, however it is difficult to apply once everything is 'packaged'.     Recommendation:  Good food, cool relaxed environment.  I'll be coming back, this is a good place.
