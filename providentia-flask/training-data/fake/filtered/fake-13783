I frequent this bar often. I love the food, the bartenders John & Jess. However, the owners (Ciro and Roseanne) are the worst. They are very condescending to their wait staff, embarrass them in front of other guests, and are verbally abusing. They fire staff for no real good reason. They have had made major improvements to the layout of the restaurant and it really opened up the bar area, and looks great. I would recommend this place for the food and for the wait staff. The reason I am giving this place 1 star, is because of the owners. They are miserable, horrible people. Sitter clear of them when you come, and you will have a great experience!
