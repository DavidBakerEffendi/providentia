Horrible staff. One of the employees tried to flirt with me. I told her that I was not interested. A few months later, I was sitting down enjoying my drink. The restaurant was almost empty. The same staff member passes by me. There is plenty of space between her and I. I felt a hand on my behind. I turned around quickly. And even though she was already ten feet away, she turned around and said a quick "I'm sorry". She did it on purpose. A week later I see the same woman while I am crossing the street. She smiles and says hi. Get your staff together. Let them know that it is inappropriate to touch or hit on customers. She's a black lesbian, dresses butch.
