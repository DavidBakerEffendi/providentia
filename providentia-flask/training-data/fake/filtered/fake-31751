Really bad food. I guess this is what happens when all you care about is minting money and not about the quality of the food AT ALL. I ordered some Indian style Chinese food for takeout tonight and Boy WAS IT BAD. So bad that my Saturday night was thoroughly Ruined. I think the owner of the restaurant should start paying his Chef. My advise, please do not waste your time going to this. And for the owner of this restaurant, YOUR FOOD SUCKS MANNN.
