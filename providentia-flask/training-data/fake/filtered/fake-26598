Based on the flavor and price, I suggest looking for another falafel place. I love falafel and decided to try this since it's new and looked really clean.  First, the restaurant was basically empty and no one was in line, yet they ruined my order.  I ordered the falafel pita with tabouleh  to go.  When I got home, I find for $6.95, they have me 6 tiny falafel... NO PITA AND NO TABOULEH!!!  The side of rice was $3.99 ...tasteless!!! I won't bother going back.  First impressions last....
