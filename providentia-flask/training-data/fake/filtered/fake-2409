I had dinner at Becco, and it was a wonderful meal. The place was packed and noisy, but the service was very attentive. The restaurant is bigger than it looks and we sat in one of the back rooms. The pasta is amazing, and they bring it out in pan right from the kitchen and serve it at the table. Portions are big and prices are reasonable. They have an extensive wine list but also serve by the glass. If you are in the Theater District and want great Italian food in a somewhat casual setting, this is the place to go.
