My family and I came here after my brother's graduation and this place was unlike any restaurant that I have been to before. The decor is really unique and the atmosphere is cozy and the surrounding area is just simply gorgeous. We took a little tour around, thinking about the possibility of having a family get together here, and we're definitely interested because of how surprising affordable it is for a Sunday night gathering/event. The menu has fewer options than I was expecting, so it's a little easier to decide what you want. The food was phenomenal and so were the drinks. Their drink options were really interesting and some of the stuff I had never heard of before. I'm not entirely sure I would order the drink with the bacon-wrapped date nut, but there are more yummy drinks to choose from. To experience it, just go there! It's not as snobby as I originally thought. The people that work there were definitely not as pretentious either. After you're done with your food, check out the grounds!
