Lousy pretty much all around, at least for breakfast. Terrible service, staff that stands around talking with one another who can barely give you the time of day. The ironic thing is their t-shirts pretty much give you an idea of how they feel about the customers ("Customers attitude may affect price"). Took forever to get menus even though the place wasn't busy. Server was nice enough. I ordered the pancakes. Absolutely awful, they weighed about 3 pounds (it seemed), doughy and not cooked on one side. My wife had an eggs benedict, eggs were hard and apparently there is a shortage of hollandaise sauce as there was barely any there. The potatoes were tasty, the ones that weren't burnt to a charcoal briquette at least. Same for my mother in law, benedict as well, hard eggs, hardly any hollandaise and half the potatoes were cooked to oblivion. Maybe this place is a good coffee shop with pastries but it certainly isn't a good breakfast place. Avoid.
