This place is mediocre but the bartenders are super nice.  They did forget about our appetizer and it took 20 minutes to get there. Then, we ordered a mezcal drink not knowing it was a $24 drink.  We didn't care for it so the bartender took it away and got us something else.  When we got the bill he had charged us for the drink that went down the drain.  If I had known this drink was going to cost me $24 you better believe I would have drank it.  That's ridiculously expensive to begin with - and not getting a heads up is kinda sneaky. I was a bartender for 8 years and would never dream of charging someone the price of an entree for a cocktail without giving them a heads up first. Unbelievable.
