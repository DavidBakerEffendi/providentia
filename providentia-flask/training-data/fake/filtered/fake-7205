Had the Chef's Tasting menu, and everything on it was fabulous and beautiful. It was a fun way to feed a larger group. However, the service ruined the experience. Made a reservation weeks ago--at which point I needed to enter my credit card & was told I'd be charged if I cancelled within a given time frame. This is laughable seeing that they made us wait over 45 minutes past our reservation time before we were even seated. The table they gave us was crammed in--one diner was pushed up against a propped open door, & we were next to the wait station. One of the guests pre-ordered/paid for a cake which they completely forgot to bring out...even though she reminded them of her order when we arrived. It wasn't until after the Chef's Tasting dessert was served that we questioned if the cake came in slices...then they realized their mistake! We had to come home with the pre-paid cake (for our friend's birthday) in a box. From start to finish, the service ruined the experience, which is a shame because the food was to die for.
