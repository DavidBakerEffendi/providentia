I have been to Junior's twice now, food is good, milkshakes are very good.  It's an avenue away from Times Square, so you are somewhat removed from the crowds on the streets.  Oh, and Times Square at midnight on the 31st of December - not fun.  Freezing and packed in like sardines in baracaded sections, could barely make out what was going on, stick with Dick Clark and your living room couch...
