We went here to watch Sunday afternoon NFL and have lunch. Â We'd give the place 5 stars if you're favorite team is getting blown out and you're looking for a reason to go home. One could surmise that the owner's 3 year old was in charge of the sound system. During commercial breaks in the game, we were "entertained" by intermittent loud scratching noises and random music played 20 decibels above TV game level. Food was 3 stars, service a bit less than 3, atmosphere is flat line pending the results from my ear doctor.
