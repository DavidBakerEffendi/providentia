Last night was the second time I have eaten at Geronimo.  The food is great and the atmosphere is lively.  It is definitely not "high end" as far as attire is concerned, but don't come in looking like a schelp.  The portions are decent and the drinks are pretty good. However, the Geronimo Margarita was awful.  We went to the restaurant for my mother's birthday and both my mother and father had their "signature" margarita.  It tasted like saltwater and lime.   The service was a whole other issue.  The last time I went the service was phenomenal; this time was the complete opposite.  The waitress was grating and annoying.  She had no timing or poise.  She disappeared for quite some time and forgot my drink.  The bus people and runners were not much better.  The runner almost dropped our food right in front of us.  Then when we were finished the bus person took our plates and wiped the table while we were still sitting there!   Needless to say the food is worth the diminutive service.
