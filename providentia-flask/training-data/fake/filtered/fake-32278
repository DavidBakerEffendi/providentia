Snapshot: 1) Fantastic food 2) Quality service 3) BYOB (with no cork fee) 4) Cash only 5) Small space (won't fit large groups) Meal Experience: When my wife and I entered, we were immediately warmly greeted by the owner, Konrad. We were seated and he brought out a large corked bottle of water and bread (complimentary when you are seated). We ordered the mushroom cigars as an appetizer, based on Konrad's recommendation. I must say, I normally am not much of a mushroom guy, but these may have converted me. They were fantastic! I could have ordered a couple of those and made that my meal. For the entree, I ordered the Tuscan chicken (which was rolled with spinach and a cheese) and my wife ordered the Portobello Mushroom Burger with balsamic sauce and goat cheese. Rosemary fries on the side. They were both really wonderful! In all, I would highly recommend this place.
