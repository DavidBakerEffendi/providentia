I am a regular at Ippudo and the food has been consistently tasty, filling, and a perfect meal for the winter. I wonder why it is only now I am writing this review but today I went to Ippudo for Lunch by myself and noted the flavours were more bold and distinct than ever. Maybe it was the winter cold but to this day Ippudo is a delicious delight. I always stay with the first three noodles bowls on the top of the menu: - Shiromaru Hakata Classic - Akamaru Modern - Shoyu Ramen These have been all delicious and if you were to get a appetizer: - Hirata Buns!!!!!! Hand down - although they only give two - you will be asking for more and more of a reason to come back. * Big important advice: If there is ever a special ramen noodle being served - you will be doing your stomach a big disservice by not trying it out. * I recommend getting there by 6pm for dinner as the wait builds. Still hands down my favourite ramen place on the East side and better than than those noodle shops on St. Marks.
