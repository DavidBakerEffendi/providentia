I've just read a lot of reviews of di faras and have seen complaints covering a whole lot of issues: namely the time it took you to get there and the time you had to wait for a pizza. You judge a pizza place first and foremost by the pizza itself. If it takes you an hour or six to get there who cares, what's that have to do with the pizza? Regarding the wait, well that's the problem with being a pizza tourist. If there's a line (I go there when there usually aren't any lines) I just leave. If you're in town only for a few days -- well the lines exist because pizza tourists have found the place. Regarding the décor, it is what it is.  It's a hole-in-the-wall. Regarding the price Dominic uses excellent ingrediants. You get what you pay for. Let me just say that Di Fara's today is not what it was a few years ago. Father Time has caught up with Dominic. Five years ago it was perfect all the time. The cornicione (the outer crust) was crispy and chewy at the same time. (Due to uneven thickness). The crust had just the right amount of pull and there was always a perfect blend of cheese, tomato sauce and basil. Now you have a fifty-fifty chance of getting the PERFECT pizza. The other half it's simply good; too much of the cornichione is outright burnt (instead of the crispy) or else the crust may be dry instead of  chewy, or there may be too much oil or not enough basil. If you're a pizza tourist you're in a hard place. Definitely go to say that you went to di fara's but know that you may not always get THE di fara pizza. It's best to go there more than once and the subway is right there. Always get a pie. It's the best value for the money - and after you get the pizza ... wait. Let the cheese and the sauce cool down. Don't eat it straight out of the oven. And go with friends, get a pie at Totonnos (when they reopen), L&B and di Faras. Four people can easily go through 3 pies.
