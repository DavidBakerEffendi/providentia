It didn't look much going in, but it has a sleek marble bar with awesome terracota statues and the people who own the restaurant are lovely. We came in after hours and they re-opened their kitchen for us. Their food was delicious and unique; I eat Chinese a lot and I was able to try new things. Apparently, it's a 3 story place and you can have private karaoke parties on the top floor. Thank you for being such lovely hosts!
