Cash Only's a bust at times, dunno why in this day and age. Their $1 taco night is always packed though for the most part the tacos on other days aren't much more expensive. (I think the Al Pastor is a buck seventy on a regular day). Burritos are amazing and they offer several vegan options too. Their salsa could be more saucy, and less 'a pile of chopped tomatoes and onions with water at the bottom of the bowl'
