This is my go to place with my guy. I love the atmosphere and the food. ( low lighting is my fave since I eat like a pig and I get sloppy with a couple drinks) I order the Chaufa every time with chicken chunks. I can't get enough of this rice it's amazing. And with a little of their spicy green sauce on it it's even better. The price is reasonable , the drinks are good. (Try the sangria) A night out here is always fun for me and my friends.
