What can I say that already has not been said? A friend took us here as a treat and what a treat it was. It was an experience - truly. Enjoyed all of it and would recommend that you do this before you die if you are a foodie and into gastronomie. We did a set menu of courses that was simply fantastic! Expensive as heck, but well worth it.
