My favorite place in New Haven!!!  Love the vegetarian arepas, either the grilled, cheesy, piled high Colombian style or the baked, stuffed with fresh avocado and sweet plantains Venezuelan style.  Also. The guacamole. The wait staff is so kind and friendly :) Also I love to have large parties here. You can make a reservation and get a whole wing to yourself .. with great music to boot.  They don't serve alcohol but I find this to be a plus -- you can bring your own wine / beer and have your favorites without paying restaurant prices on the drinks.
