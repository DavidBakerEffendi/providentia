Where to start? First off not allowing a no star review is ridiculous as it demands that a restaurant at least be serviceable. Sadly, this place is not. Old warm sushi rolls, a cobbled together salad made with "aged" (see: wilting lettuce) and no soy sauce. You'd be better off licking a port authority door knob than eating at this place - it may actually taste better than the junk they pass off as food at this place. Zero stars. Avoid like the plague. There are tons of better options out there. So, save your money and don't hate yourself or loved ones enough to waste your time with Tendo.
