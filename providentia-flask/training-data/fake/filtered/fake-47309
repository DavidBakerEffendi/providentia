ok. this place is ok. just ok. i came in a couple weeks ago after work one friday for dinner as i was passing through the area the food wasnt great ordered a steak sandwich and it was very very chewy, sweet potato fries seemed like they were out of a frozen bag, soggy. But now the service. the service here is immaculate. it all started when one of the managers politely greeted me and brought me to my table. then my waiter, i believe his name was luke (ask for him) was one of the best servers ive had in a long time; he couldnt have been more polite, knowledgeable of the menu and specials. Even the kid who brought out my food was very polite and clearly well trained. the only reason i would come here again would be for the service.
