Waited over an hour in the line. We finally got in with much anticipation. I gotta say, it was a huge disappointment.  It is not worth the wait and money.  Just go some place else.  I also want to add, a service charge was already included in the check which I paid.  As I was leaving a waiter chased after me saying I didn't leave a tip on the table.  I pointed out that it was already included in the check.  I guess he thought I came from overseas and didn't know what "SC" stands for.
