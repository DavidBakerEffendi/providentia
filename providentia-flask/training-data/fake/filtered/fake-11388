not that this place needs another review BUT i live just down the block from here and i love it, i havent eaten at any of the restaurants except the beer place upstairs (awesome), but i come here weekly for all of my coffee, produce, nearly all of my cheese/deli and their fresh pasta is amazing. great when i just need a small portion of fresh pasta for two people.
