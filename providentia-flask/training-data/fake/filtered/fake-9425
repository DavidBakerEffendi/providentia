I love this place. While you wait, you can perch (literally) on this little perch they have at the front of the restaurant that overlooks all the tables.  You're elevated on this perch and that's just pretty cute. Came here for brunch with a friend and even the wait was fun (thank you, perch). The portions are on the small side, so order a few dishes if you need to.   They shop at Fish's Eddy.  Another plus.
