giving this place one star seems like a huge compliment. i dined in here a few nights ago with my family and was assaulted in front of my grandparents. after finishing our meal and having paid our bill, Â i started to walk to the bathroom and felt a hand on my butt as i walked beside the counter. i stopped and turned around to see a large white man at the counter with his hand extended & cupped while staring at my ass and making an "ooo" noise. my grandparents were at the table near to the counter and saw the whole thing. needless to say we promptly left. on our way out, i found out the large man behind the counter was identified as the owner. after reading reviews about this place, i saw that the owner has a reputation of being aggressive towards women and argumentative toward men. he clearly has a psychological disorder. don't eat here.
