Went in on Saturday night, Melinda was our server and was outstanding!  Fried pickles, fried mozz, vermont chicken wrap, truffle fries and of course the soft pretzels.  The food was piping hot when served and delicious.  Twice managers came over to see how our meal was, one actually apologized if our dinner was taking too long but truly it wasn't long at all, only waited about 8 minutes between apps and dinner.  We will definitely be back
