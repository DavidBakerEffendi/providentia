We ordered 2 cheesesteaks from Geno's (while on vacation in Philly, decided to see what all the hype was about).  Both with onions, one with cheese wiz and one with provolone.  Both were dry and mediocre.  I liked that Geno's has hot peppers on their condiments station and they had more seating than Pat's.  We also went across the street and bought a cheesesteak with cheese wiz and onions from Pat's to do a taste comparison.  Pat's bread seemed fresher and their meat had more flavor.  Don't get discouraged when you pull up and see the lines for both places, they churn out service pretty quick and they are very efficient.  Overall both places were not bad but not spectacular either.  If you decide to try it, go to Pat's, they're much, much better.
