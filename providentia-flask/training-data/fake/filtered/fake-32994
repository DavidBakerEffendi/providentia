I was craving Chinese and this was one of the only places around me that delivered so I tried them. I had crab rangoons, bar b a beef, and sesame chicken. The crab rangoons were not the best I ever had but at least they weren't bad. The bar b q beef sticks were mediocre and the sesame chicken was the same. A plus is that the delivery was speedy. All in all it's a mediocre Chinese food place but in a pinch it's good enough to get rid of a craving.
