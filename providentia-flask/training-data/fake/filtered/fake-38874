I just went to the Auténtico Sabor Peruano at El mercado  and got me Jalea... for $12.99 it was the most biggest theft... it was 1/4 of the container and over fry .......... never again I'm gonna buy at this place again.... one star is to-much........... I own an apology to Piolyn where Yes You can get REAL !!!!  AUTHENTIC !!!!!! Peruvian Food... or CoraCora.....
