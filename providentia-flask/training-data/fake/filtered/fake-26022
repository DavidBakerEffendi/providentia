This place is UNBELIEVABLE. True authentic mediterranean cuisine for incredible prices. The portions are huge and everything on the menu is delicious. I have been coming here for some years now and I think I've tried everything on the menu and I have never been disappointed. The place is unpretentious, friendly, romantic and fun. I came with a date the other night and we had the best time. The wine was delicious and we shared almost 15 appetizers and when the bill came I literally thought they had calculated it wrong because it was so inexpensive. This place used to be a hidden treasure, tucked away in China town, and now people are starting to appreciate what is going on there. A true gem and not to be missed. Brunch is incredible and you can have breakfast and coffee for under 10 bucks. The staff is attentive and fun. If I had my choice I would only ever eat at this place, but I think I would start scaring them. GO GO GO.
