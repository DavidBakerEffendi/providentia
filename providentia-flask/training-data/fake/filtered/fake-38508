A. Kitchen is an utter disappointment. Went for brunch and service was very good and polished. I believe what they were shooting for were "thrice cooked" chips, a spotted pig fave. What we got were potato rocks with slightly sour taste. Kobe beef was chewy. High street and Fork are delicious but this needs work. You could do better in philly on a Sunday than this place for sure. Bread is awesome!
