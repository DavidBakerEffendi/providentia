Dined here on Saturday, Dec 2. Eagerly looked forward to trying out a new restaurant and supporting a local business. As previously mentioned by some, the service was slow and fairly inattentive-15 minutes before water was served and wine was uncorked. The waiter was clearly inexperienced and said more than once that he was not Italian, and that the menu was hard to understand and he couldn't pronounce most of the dish names. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good and that alone would bring me back. A pretty interesting variety of items to chose from, especially for Yardley, which isn't exactly known for imaginative cuisine. Improved service and an attentive, experienced and knowledgable waitstaff will go a long way towards making this a first rate establishment.
