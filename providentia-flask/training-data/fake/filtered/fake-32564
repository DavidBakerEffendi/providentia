Awesome food truck. Great value, large portions, and it is DELICIOUS. By far the best gyro I've ever had. I wish I had gotten the combo ... and was seriously tempted (despite being full) to go back in line for round two. They're very friendly, and although the line can get long quickly, service is quick. They've definitely perfected their system.
