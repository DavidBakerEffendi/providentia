My rating above describes how my experience was pre- pretentious owner deciding to sit down next to our all-Filipino table and speak to me, my mother, and my two co-workers about Filipino culture. Some may read this and just be concerned whether or not the food was good or not (which it undoubtedly was) and stop right there, but personally, going out to eat with friends/family is more than just what is going into our stomachs - it's about the lighting, the waiter, the waitress, the awesome interior design, etc. We were having an awesome time until the owner sat down next to us and started cracking Filipino-themed jokes, one of which was about how Filipinos pronounced certain words. Maybe in an ideal world where there's no such thing as ignorance or stereotyping, this might have been acceptable, but to me, it was downright disrespectful and rude. At first, I decided to chalk it up to him being friendly and trying to let us know that he's versed in Filipino culture, which is cool, but then he decided to tell us that some percentage of tourism in the Philippines is attributed to sex. After this comment, I wasn't exactly sure if this was a dinner outing, a history lesson, political debate, or amateur night at the Apollo. Call it taking it personal, maybe he was just trying to make us feel welcomed - but I was insulted and uncomfortable as was the rest of my group. He warned us, jokingly, to disregard comments on Yelp about the "annoying, white guy who just sits down and talks too much" but I'm here to confirm and/or warn you that that person was spot on (if that review is even on here). Unfortunately, this place left me torn. I entered with excitement and an empty stomach and left with disappointment and angst. *sigh*
