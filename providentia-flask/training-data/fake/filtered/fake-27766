On our recent visit to Woorijip, the buffet standouts were "simmered mackeral" and "chicken stew." The mackerel melted in the mouth, and its spicy marinade provided a rich foundation for the light notes of pepper flakes. The moist, juicy chicken pieces in the hearty stew were saturated with the bold flavor of red peppers, while tender potatoes and carrots added sweetness. It was an irresistible combination of flavors, and we mixed every remaining drop of the stew with our white rice. Among the pre-packaged goods, we enjoyed the chewy, tangy squid in the squid and rice roll ($5.50), which contrasted nicely with the simple flavors of the rice and the sesame-oiled seaweed. We also paired the bulgogi over rice combo ($5.50) with the spicy rice cakes with fish cakes ($3). The generous mound of marinated beef lacked moisture and flavor, but the sweet and spicy chewy rice cakes mixed with cabbage and onions kicked in some of both, giving us a wonderfully satisfying dish.
