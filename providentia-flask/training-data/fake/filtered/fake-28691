Hey thanks for taking it way back. I was born and raised on the Jimmy's Buff food back in the 70's. I now live in Baltimore and i go back for that taste of home. It's been about 8 years since I've been up on 14th street and the name has changed to Lous Itialian Hotdogs...it was a unforgetable meal. Thanks Â  Neil.
