I've been to numerous diners in NJ and I think PJ's is one of the worst in service (our waitress took 10 minutes to give us water and another 10 to take our orders and it was on a Thursday morning!), worst in flavor (the regular 2-fer breakfast, I had slices of overcooked bacon that crumbled at my touch!), horribly priced (they charged 50% more than other nearby diners) and the table had so much carving in it, my plate couldn't balance straight! Â I think because of it's history there in Princeton and the notoriety of the place, PJ's stays afloat. If it was solely graded on food, they would sink to the bottom of Carnagie Lake.
