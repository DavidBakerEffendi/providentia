I'm a big fan of eataly and all it has to offer. Granted, it's a little overwhelming inside, but I find their fish and meat selection expansive and fresh, as well as the fruits and veggies. For so long I have been purchasing whole foods fish to cook for dinner, eataly has put a stop to that. They always have wild fish which I greatly prefer to farmed. Their homemade pasta selection is amazing, try the squid ink linguini! Although it can get very hectic, I really like to go to eataly for their meat and cheese platters. They have great options, including many types of mozzarella cheese, my favorite. Good wines by the glass and pretty good service for how busy it is. If you go to the pasta restaurant get the pappardelle with the veal ragu...bomb.
