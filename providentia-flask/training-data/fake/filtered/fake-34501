A landmark for those who are from the area- very good pizza, love the thin crust.  All kinds are delish but the Pesto Pie is my favorite.  My husband & his buddies meet here for dinner every Tues night & if they could rate it they would give it a million stars. Only reason I gave 4 not 5 stars is bc rareky but a few ties it was a bit burnt & also bc its also packed.  Try it - anyone would love it.  Take it home or eat in- good for kids!
