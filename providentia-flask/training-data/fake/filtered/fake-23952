Only recently I found out about this restaurant from Yelp reviews. Within the last ten days, I went three times to eat and found incredibly tasty and freshly prepared food here. The owner is very kind, polite, and accommodating. My family and I tried many dishes and all were extremely tasty and not extremely spicy nor bland. The portions were quite good and prices reasonable. The 3T thali with two sabjis, daal, two rotis, rice, raita, pickles, papad and mithai was excellent. The chats and pakoras, vada pau and the chutneys were great. Most of the dishes were like home made food. Another excellent thing that I liked was that all the food was served in glass utensils and not paper plates so the restaurant is environment friendly. Only water was served in plastic glasses. Perhaps the owner will change to glasses. My three year old grand daughter commented that the food was yummy and the bathroom was very clean!. The owner was very friendly to her and her 6 week old baby sister. Please give this restaurant a try even though you go to Dimple, Khasiyat, Desi Galaxies, Bombay talk, Pakwan, etc. and see the difference. Â You will love the food.
