Shame this place has such atrocious service as the food is pretty good (had the baby octopus and a beet salad). I've been a few times, and each time the hostess has always been rude - even when I've made reservations. The wait staff rush you through dinner and seem annoyed when you ask questions about the menu. Granted, I usually dine late, but my last experience was the first time I've ever felt completely unwelcome in a restaurant. I will never go back to Casa Mono based on their extremely rude, miserable staff.
