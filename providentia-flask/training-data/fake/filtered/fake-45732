Food was 4 out of 5, although it seemed a little cold. BYOB was a plus. but lots of little exceptions. We sat outside, My wife pointed out to the hostess that there was something spilled and noticeably sticky on her seat. The hostess quickly apologized and switched seats with the table next to us, only to seat someone there less than 10 minutes later, without it being wiped clean. The tables outside are uncomfortably close for two parties of two. We couldn't help but converse with the table beside us (but we wish we didn't need to). They accept cash only and there was no fair warning of that on the menu or when calling ahead to reserve seating. The waitress very rudely directed me to the ATM of the restaurant across the street. Wish we had just ate there. Philly is a great restaurant town with lots of our favorites but I can firmly say we will not be back to Mercato.
