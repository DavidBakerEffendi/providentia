I've been here a few times and enjoyed it. Last night i went with my boyfriend.  We called and they do not take reservations for two. We waited for nearly an hour.  We thought it would be okay because the food would be worth it. I went last night and it was beyond terrible.  The food was just so-so and the service was pathetic.  We asked for water 3 x and bread and did not get served. When we asked someone for the manager, we were informed that our waiter WAS the manager. He was rude, when we asked him about the menu, he gave short answers. We did not get attention nor did we have a great dining experience. It ruined the entire night. Let's just say we will think twice before dining there again.
