Pizza is good but not as good as it used to be. There are really good brick oven pizzerias in the area now, which are far better. Their other food is not very good at all. If you want really good Italian food, my recommendation would be to go to Paisano's in Rutherford. The bar is your typical bar with macro beers. You would think they could at least put some craft beers on, so I wouldn't even recommend going there for a drink at the bar. Many regulars go there, and some are pretty obnoxious.
