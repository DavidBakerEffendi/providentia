My husband and I became victims of the Stage House Tavern on Thanksgiving day, 2012.  I have never experienced a buffet the way it was presented by this restaurant.  The turkey I was served was shredded and cut up into chunk size pieces.  The stuffing was burned to a crisp on the bottom and so dry on top a dog would probably turn it away.  When I finally went back to the buffet table to see if there was any that had not been burned to a crisp, I was served some.  The cornbread stuffing tasted like wet cornbread - no seasoning whatsoever. Side dishes (mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes )were tasteless.   With the experience of the turkey over, I decided to try the ham.  Ham is served by the slice and that is what I expected.  Instead, they served me chunks of ham with some gravy over the chunks.  After the horrible entree experience, we decided to try dessert, thinking they would have a table set up with several different pies and cakes that would be served by the slice.  WRONG!!   They offered poor versions of peach cobbler, something that looked like mousse - couldn't figure out the flavor and little tiny pies - like the ones you once purchased in the supermarket..  What a disgrace.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  This restaurant should rethink their way of cooking, serving, etc.  before they ever expose customers to such an experience.  I'm giving this place one star because the review requires that a rating be given.  However, I would not recommend it to my worst enemy!!
