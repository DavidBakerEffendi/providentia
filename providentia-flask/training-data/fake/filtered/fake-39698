07/06/2014 Outstanding!! We wanted a special resturant to celebrate our 46 th wedding anniversary and Lithos was  the right choice.  Our waiter Mina went out of his way to make our dinner a special occasion.  He  offered to take our picture and gave us a real insight into Greek  food. We split an order of snow crab legs for our  appetizer delicious , best I ever had.  Then came the Bronzini cooked to perfection, and the scallops were perfect.  We ended the meal with baklava , coffee and Greek dessert wine. I highly recommend  Lithos.  We will certainly go back again. Andy and Betty C.
