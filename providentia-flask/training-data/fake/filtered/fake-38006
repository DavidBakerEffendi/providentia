The UWS is not exactly a dining destination and Jacobs is one of the few places I genuinely like. I appreciate that they use quality ingredients and I've always enjoyed the few vegetarian options that they offer. I also love the ambiance, they've clearly invested a lot of time and money into creating a certain vibe. The only thing I really have a problem with is the service. I had lunch with a girlfriend last week and I couldn't believe how they kept pestering us. Not exaggerating, our server and presumably the manager, checked in on us every five minutes. It was very intrusive. Plus, our server clearly forgot about our wine order. We were half way through our entrees when he finally brought them over and didn't even acknowledge the fact that it had taken 30 minutes. And, yes, we were still charged. My last experience was so annoying, that I will probably not be back for awhile. But, if you're not that picky about service and have never been there before, I still recommend checking it out.
