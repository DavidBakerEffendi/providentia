Globally inspired and delicious! Check the sizes on the wall- the men needed an 'original' size to get full. I was ok with a small. Burritos: 1) Teriyaki with carnitas- "amazing"! So good he went back for another. 2) The Summer with carnitas- "delicious"! 3) Classic Mexican with chicken- "very good with the addition id guacamole. I wish I had ask for hot salsa" The side of guacamole and chips was perfect to share. The chips are fresh and perfectly crispy. The kids meals were perfect. Great sizes and the Nutella shake was so good they wanted another one.
