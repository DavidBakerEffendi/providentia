I am so excited about this restaurant! I've been looking forward to its opening for ages, and it's here and living up to expectations. The gnocchi is delicious, but the skate wing... I've been dreaming about it ever since. It's reasonably priced, unbelievably so considering the quality of the food. It's nice and cozy with a knowledgeable staff. All in all, I can't wait to go back. Fishtown needs more restaurants like this!
