I wanted to adore this tea house and at first i did. Beautiful decor, very inviting and welcoming. I am a tea fan always on the lookout for great tea salons. I was there recently and enjoyed what the soup and tea i had. The server was a bit weird with me though, just a very strange attitude of super fake smiling and when after waiting for my soup for 15 minutes she came and asked if i wanted to order something else (the soup had not arrived yet), i said i'd like a glass of water while waiting, she returned to the open kitchen station and simply did other things than bring me water, among others, talking to other waitresses and unloading the dishwasher. The soup eventually came, with a glass of water. After i finished my soup she came to ask me if the food was good.... maybe she could have asked before i finished, otherwise, i don't see the point of asking... I'll try them again for their apparently special deserts.
