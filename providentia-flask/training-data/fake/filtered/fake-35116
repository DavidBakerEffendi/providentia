This is a very quaint but scrumptious place for drinks, food, sports. I would reccommend this place to anyone who wants to escape the craziness of the city for a quick bite to eat. The people were friendly and low key and gave us exceptional service. The food was also delicious. Just don't try any of the pumpkin draft beers.
