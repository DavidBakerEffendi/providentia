Food is creative and thought provoking - but make sure you eat before you go.  Portions are ridiculously small and left me feeling short-changed and hungry.  Had the celery oyster stew.  I know it's Brooklyn, but since when did potato and oyster cracker filler cost this much?  The stew scarcely covered the bottom of a cavernous bowl.  Conversation throughout dinner tended to echo off the exposed sides of said bowl. Heard every story twice.  Dekalb, maybe focus less on furbishing the walls of your restaurant, and more on furbishing the walls of my bowl of cheap-ingredient-yet-fancy-named-stew.  Probably won't be a next time. P.S. Semi-redeeming quality: Squash Tots.  Good concept, but "squash" becomes more of a verb upon meeting a fork.
