Finally got around to visiting Bar Tano and glad that I did. I live on the border of Park Slope and Gawanus and usually opt for the former when I go out in the neighborhood. I went to Bar Tano on a Thursday night, about an hour before their kitchen closed. The first thing I noticed walking into the restaurant was a contrast between the somewhat gritty 3rd ave area and the restaurant - the decor and lighting represented a casually refined atmosphere. The bartender and staff were also very friendly and accomodating. I ordered a Maker's Manhattan and it was definitely on the potent side (exactly how i want it). My meal, a panini was good, but not great. I thought it could use a bit more cheese or somethig else to take it to another level. The included chips were really good. Overall though for the price, it is hard to complain. I'll definitely be visiting here again soon for drinks or to check out the other menu choices. Overall just a very nice change of pace from the other 5th and 7th avenue offerings.
