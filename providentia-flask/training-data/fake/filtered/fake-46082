I never review on Yelp but felt it necessary to take a moment and start with singing praises to Rose Petals Cafe & Lounge for their outstanding food, quality customer service and owners who really care. This quaint gem of Germantown is the start to some positive change for the area and should be an example of what small businesses in Philadelphia could be all about. Ownership has a story, but more importantly they translate there passion to caring abou there customers, going above and beyond, being a part of the community in many ways, while still serving Amazing fresh, quality food. * I felt the need to mention that some of the other reviews I have read are disheartening, especially knowing that this is a restaurant that has owners and employees that are so humble, pleasant and attentive to their customer base. I suppose some people feel the need to use yelp as a venting space, especially relating to one review stating "they have criminals working for them" simply due to what seems to be a simple credit card pos error. FYI these things happen in chain restaurants all the time, and I don't believe for 1 second they would be stealing from their customers, but again not really the type of dialouge for yelp. I have noticed that Rose Petals continues to become busier and busier, which means the word is spreading so great job guys. Keep up the good work, and remember your not going to please everyone (as yelp has already shown you) but keep true to your mission and vision of this amazing destination as those who really know appreciate your generous efforts. For those who don't I will continue to pray for you as some of the critical comments are unnecessary, but keep patronizing IHOP as that leaves more space on Sunday afternoon for me and my family to enjoy the real stuff!
