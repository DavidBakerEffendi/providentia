This is easily the worst restaurant in philadelphia.  There was one waiter for the entire restaurant.  He was distracted and had no idea what was going on.  We waited 1.5 hours for our food, which was beyond mediocre.  Then he puts an 18% gratuity on a party of 5, saying that it is their policy.  It's my policy never to go back to awful restaurants, and it should be yours never to visit Slate. Slate should enjoy a speedy burial next to other comparable culinary disasters, such as Midtown IV.
