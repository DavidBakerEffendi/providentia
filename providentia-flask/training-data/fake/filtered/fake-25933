My husband and I decided to try Devil's Den on March 6 for a Beer Week event.  I read several reviews about the place here on yelp and was a little concerned about the food.  Several reviewers called it "hit or miss."  We've been down that road before.  If you are a bar/pub, DON'T mess up the french fries!  Anyway, on this particular night, everything was a hit!  The place is cozy, the staff (all of 'em) are friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable, and the food was great.  We had mussels, fries, and two sandwiches (hot brie for me, grilled veggie for the hub.)  All of it was delicious!  Plus, the Bella Vista specials were super cheap!  We will be back and if you haven't been, you should go!
