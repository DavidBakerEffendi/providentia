I went to Village Whiskey with a friend after hearing good things about it.  We got there around 1:30 after the lunch crowd, but it was still busy.  I told the hostess table for two and she said where's the other person, I replied he'll be here in a few minutes.  "Can't seat you till he is here"  So i went to the bar and as it turns out he was having a drink.  So I went back to the hostess a few minutes later and she said, "you'll have to wait".  I said there are a few empty tables.  "Can't see you, you'll have to wait."  So we went back to the bar and eat there.  I was just about ready to leave but we decide to have the burgers and tehy were great.  Probably one of the best i've had.  Very expensive with all the toppings but very good. I ordered the Village Burger with truffled mushrooms, cheese, lettuce and tomato and a side of duck-fat fries. The truffled mushrooms took the burger to a whole new level. If I didn't have such a negative experience with the hostess I would have rated it five just on the burger alone.  If they could just get good staff to work the door it would be excellent.
