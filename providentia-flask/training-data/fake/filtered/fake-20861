The Farmacy... Where do I begin? Hmmm... I have been eating here since the restaurant has been open. Not ONCE have I had a disappointing meal. Everything here is so delicious. The service was friendly and fast. I do have to say that making a reservation is a must, even for brunch, to guarantee to get seated! I can't wait to go back next week! This place is to die for.
