Unquestionably the best Thai place in New Haven, dare I say Connecticut. It would be tied for first even for the places I have been in NYC (Sripraphai). Very fresh. Super tasty yet not doused with peanut sauce or other flavors to over power the taste of the individual components of the meal. Feels light rather than a heavy meal. Favorite dish is Seafood Curry. Favorite appetizer is chicken puffs. Green curry chicken entree is really good too (and equally amazing as a left over - best left over I have had of any type of food). Decor simple. Service fine. Authentic Thai food (even an associate who owns a Thai restaurant said this was the closest thing to authentic Thai food in the area). Even NY Times rated it highly.
