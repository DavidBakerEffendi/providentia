everybody talks about the corn... for a reason - out of this world.  that cotija cheese just melting as it gets to the table - omg.  i never want to share it (two per order), but i do, so i can have room the the fish tacos...  i dream about those tacos.  the fish is deep fried to a delicate perfection, the hot sauce served with it - so yummy!   the rice and beans - unexciting.  got lucky yesterday, a tuesday, walked a little before 2pm and got the tiny table next to the window in the front. within minutes.  have also stood on long painful line at times in the middle of the week.
