Vin et Fleurs is completely charming.  Have been here a couple of times for brunch. It's the little things and thoughtfulness behind the food and atmosphere that make this place stand out. For example,  the first time I ate here, they warmed the milk for the coffee, the orange juice tasted freshly squeezed and there were gorgeous flower arrangements around and nice little vases with flowers on all the tables.  The food was great and there is thoughtfulness behind the preparation and presentation.  Nice quiet place for brunch.
