This is one of my Saturday mornig breakfast stops.  Parking is a little difficult in this neighborhood but worth driving around a couple times to find a spot.  It is very clean inside.  The service is fast and friendly.  I get scrambled egg on a croisant with cheese.  It is always good even though the cheese is never fully melted.  That little extra touch would make a difference.  They also don't have ketchup, which I have been meaning to ask them to consider.  Maybe it is my personal preference but I think they should offer ketchup to their customers.  They carry Honest tea, which is one of my favorite things to drink.  Their pricing is pretty good considering that the sandwich is filling. So far, so good!
