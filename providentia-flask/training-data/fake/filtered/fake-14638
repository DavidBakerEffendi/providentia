My friend and I were expecting your run of the mill chinese/vietnamese joint. It looks like a hole in the wall from outside but after renovations is a whole lot cleaner and larger inside than expected. Also it was a few months of eating here before we realized there is a relatively clean if tiny restroom in the back we can use. Now onto the food. Decent. I don't eat meat but I do eat copious amounts of fish and the catfish bahn mi is bomb. So's the rice claypot dish with catfish. Veggie pho is meh, I like the tofu a bit better than the soy protein but they're both deep fried. You're better off grabbing a soup side with your bahn mi instead if you just want a hot liquid-y chase. The classic bahn mi tastes proper (unlike at bahn mi saigon on mott) according to my friend. Exceeds expectations, overall - which admittedly were low. Service is laidback. The owner's half Chinese but the friendly girl working there is Vietnamese. The girl working remembers us and what heat and how we like our bahn mi, regardless if it's an order we phone in for takeaway or dining in. We've taken to picking up the bahn mi and sitting at the park nearby if the day is nice . . . so much more relaxing plus you don't walk out permeated by an aura of grease. One star off for the smell.
