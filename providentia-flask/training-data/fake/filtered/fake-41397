Rao's Please give me break... this place is the most overrated restaurant in New York.. id rather eat at Mcdonalds(overexaggeratiob a lilbit i know). the only reason people eat here and praise its name like Jesus rose Â up and started cookin in the kitchen, is because they wont let anybody in... its the nightclub effect... turn everybody away and then everybody will wanna come.. i know someone who has a table there, he invited me there once so i went to c what the hype was about... its JUST FKN PASTA WIT GRAVY.. red sauce and spaghetti.. people have to go to a real retstaurant get a life.. focus on a place you can actually into into... the sauce is ok worth a buy at the market to get the taste.. but not worth all that money.. have a nice day pppll... go out find a place with grandma in the back where u can walk right in and get a meal 10 times better than Rao's...
