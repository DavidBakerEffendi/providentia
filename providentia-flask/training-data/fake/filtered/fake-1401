Sisig, Khao Soy, coconut rice all worthy dishes.  Swirling the raw egg in with the fried pork is kind of fun.  Only complaint is that the Khao is at least moderately spicy and I wish they had a milder option as the sauce is delicious.  The fried chicken is good, but there's about 2x more fried skin than chicken and I wasn't in the mood to just eat fried skin.  Only other mention is that they serve a lot of food.  We shared 3 small plates and a side for 2 people and it was PLENTY!  Eclectic group of cocktails with a low maintenance beer selection.  Beat expectations.
