I came here on a Sunday evening around 8:30 without making reservations and there was an hour wait so we ended up eating at the bar.  The wine list is quite extensive with Spanish wines that I've never heard of, but the bartender was really informative and helped us choose something.  We started with a cheese plate which was very delicious and served with very nice pairing of spreads complimenting each cheese. My favorite was the aged machego cheese. The artichoke and wild mushroom flat bread was quite delectable had such great depth to it.  The Arroz de Langosta was also very flavorful and was reminiscent of a risotto.  This is probably Jose Garces' at his finest and is definitely a place to visit to experience all that he has to offer.
