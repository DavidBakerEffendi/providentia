I have had great food and great service every time I visited The Spot. The staff is friendly and very accommodating to young children. Each time I have been pleased with my meal from eggs to cheese steak sandwich. Sorry french fry lovers they serve chips. The surfs up decor is pretty cool too! Huevos Rancheros is Spot on!
