There was a long wait, so we had to stand over at the bar.  While standing there, a busboy rammed a bus-bucket in my back so hard I spilled my drink on one of my friends.  Once seated, service was slow and the waitress never came around to ask about refills, despite the fact that all of our glasses were dry for about half the time we were there.
