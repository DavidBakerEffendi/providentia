I hate to be so harsh but this was so bad I had to review it. I've had pho - pronounced "fuh" for more than 20yrs spanning six different states, most notably TX and CA where it is hands down the best. This was the murkiest bowl of pho I've ever had. Noodles were severely undercooked, the broth was unacceptable (sweet) and there was an excessive amount of low low quality meats. The thing was a luke warm swamp. And to top it off, they've shamefully replaced the Sriracha sauce with something they've concocted in-house and denied it when questioned.
