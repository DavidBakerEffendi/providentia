We live down the block and couldn't be happier with this restaurant.  It's exactly what this neighborhood needed and we welcome you with open arms. The food at Le Petit Paris is by far some of the best dinning in Brooklyn.  I am hopelessly addicted to the steak Au pouvoir, the staff has encouraged me to try other dishes, which I have and I am just as impressed with every dish.  Do not be afraid to try the escargot or the rooster, both were wonderful surprises. The wine and beer selection is decent and affordable, the tea choices are wonderful and presentation is impressive.  The decor is nice and simple and I appreciate the suttleness.  It's a great Brooklyn restaurant serving proper French cuisine. The staff and owners are all very friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating, they have made me and my guests feel very comfortable throughout all of our meals.  No pretension here. As a life long Brooklynite (and serious food snob) I can honestly say you will not find a better brunch deal for $10.00, seriously the food is that good.  Nice Job folks!
