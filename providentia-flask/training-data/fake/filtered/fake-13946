Alma de Cuba is consistently a great place to go, especially for interesting takes on seafood.  I love the ambiance, the service is attentive and friendly and they make a great variety of mojitos.  Their tuna is to die for, it has a nice kick to it and they wrap it in some kind of delicious fried concoction.  Just don't plan to take any elderly relatives here... it's DARK and you have to walk up and down a million stairs to get anywhere.
