I would not recommend Emporio. The staff is obviously overworked and making mistakes. My salad was actually WET (ugh), and my friend's lamb skewer appetizer was undercooked. Moreover, our entrees were not very impressive and my friend's was actually missing one of the ingredients. Emporio is not taking the time and effort to live up to the buzz. I was expecting good, solid, rustic Italian food. Instead, we got a mixed-up, disappointing lineup of foods. Rustic? Well, maybe. Good? No.
