After waiting an hour and a half to be seated, my party of five was put at a table for four. While normally this would be acceptable, a larger table for six was open right next to us. When asked if we could move we were told this table was being held for a larger party. Five minutes later, TWO people were seated there. Although the food is great and very reasonable the people who work here clearly have no common sense and cannot run a restaurant efficiently. Be prepared for sub par service with your delish fajitas.
