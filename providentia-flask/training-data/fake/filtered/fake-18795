FIrst time there...would go back. Was treated very politely as I waited for friends to join me. The waiter patiently returned a few times as we enjoyed the appetizers and took awhile to choose entrees. The food was fresh and good. Salads large, crisp, and clean. About average in cost. The address is 3 West not 3 North as above. And parking is not in a private lot per se. Took a few minutes to find parking in this beautiful, newer, busy mall lot but it wasn't impossible.
