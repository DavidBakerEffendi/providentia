My apartment is directly across the street from the Pier I Cafe, so I have the pleasure of eating there often.  I have yet to be disappointed, nor do I find it to be expensive, relative to the neighborhood.  Sure, I guess you can find cheaper carry out, but walking East from the pier the next restaurant you encounter, Club Luxembourg, sells their very tasty Luxembourger for over $25.  The nearest grocery, Jubilee Marketplace, is, well, lets just say 'very expensive'.  $5 imports is MUCH less than any of the trendy haunts in this hood.  IMHO, the food is excellent, prices fair, and atmosphere one has to experience for themselves.
