Amazing.  The pizza is wonderful, the salads are great, the sandwiches are delicious. The decor is lovely too.  The only downside is that it's so crowded (and doesn't take reservations) but that's only because everyone else knows how great it is, too.   Our favorites are the margarita pizza and the Campania salad, although everything we've tried has been wonderful.  Can't wait to go back!
