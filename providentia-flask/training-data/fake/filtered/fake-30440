Coming back on road trip from DC back up to NY I decided to stop in Philly for lunch and to give our 2 1/2 year old niece a break from the long trip.  We took her to a chuck e cheese which is right next to John's Roast Pork.  It wouldnt be a trip to Philly without getting a cheesesteak!  Quickly checked the reviews on Yelp about this place and was wowed.  As well as it was evident how popular this place is when I saw the long line wrapped around the building.  Ordered the "pizza" cheesesteak which was an awesome treat for the ride home back to NY.  Would definitely recommend this place! Only complain is its cash only.
