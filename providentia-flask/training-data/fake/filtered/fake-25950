I was in the Village and my date suggested Italian.  We decided to give a new restaurant a try.  Mark ordered the grilled shrimp, but I opted for the lemony Chicken Francaise.  It was moist and yummy, but not heavy.  We had some to die for garlic bread and calamari.  The prices were reasonable and the waiters were super attentive.  I would definitely be back.
