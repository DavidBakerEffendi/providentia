Excellent food, excellent wine list and a great value.  I miss the old Sanford's (the 80's decorated, sorta old and dingy looking place that served ridiculously amazing food) but the new place is much nicer.  It's an elegant atmosphere but with a comfortable feel.  Their balsamic dressings is hands down the best, I think I could drink it if they sold it in bottles (not really, but it's good).  If they offer the filet as a special, get it.  It's from a butcher shop near by and it is awesome.
