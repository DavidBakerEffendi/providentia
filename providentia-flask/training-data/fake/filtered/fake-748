I lived 2 blocks down from Toms and on certain days such as saturdays, the line would be soo long at Toms. I am not from new york and have been living in bk for about 5 years now. I've heard so much about Toms and how great their pancakes and stuff are. Well I was dissappointed. The food i order was bland and home fries was soggy. The pancakes are not that spectacular either. I guess all those fancy butters and syrups they give u make the pancakes better. Anywho, I was dissapointed and prefer Shanes cafe instead.
