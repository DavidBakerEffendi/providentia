Recently moved to area and took relatives to brunch on Sun. 12/23/12.  While the service was very good, the food was medioca at best.  Sat near the kitchen and serving location.  Watched a waitress drop a piece of food off a plate she was about to deliver.  It sat on the floor while staff ignored it and eventually it was ground into the floor.  As we left, some of the kitchen staff were leaning against the dumpsters near the back entrance while they smoked. Couldn't help wondering if they washed their hand before returning to the kitchen.
