Went there last night with a groupon.  That usually means low anticipation and a one shot try.  NOT this place! Food was way better than I thought it would be and I WILL return.  Had the medium Buffalo wings and Tai Chili wings;  both were crispy and well sauced and a generous portion to boot.  The pizza (made at a brick oven at one end of the bar) was great.  A medium sized pie with generous and quality ingredients....super thin crust done just right.......had a regular pie and a spinach pie.  Lots of drink options at fair prices ($13 for a domestic draft pitcher).  Groupon deal was great but when I go back I know it won't break my bank.  Overall a spruced up neighborhood bar offering terrific food, drink and service!
