Another one of my fav spots downtown! Â Can't help walking out of this place in a meat coma everytime I visit. Get a tough piece of meat ? Throw it aside and wait for the next batch! Don't skip the salad bar either it's amazingly good! Little tip, hit em at lunch for pretty much the same dinner menu at about half the price!
