Once our server helped us with the menu we then enjoyed a fabulous Sunday brunch. We started with Bloody Marys with shrimp and octopus garnish. Our first course was thinly sliced fresh prosciutto, lamb crudo (tartar), served with warm, herbed crostini,and a wonderful arugula salad with toasted hazelnuts and sliced red grapes. Our main course was Branzino (sea bass) with a compote of garbanzo beans and marinated red peppers and a Purgatorio, eggs poached in a homemade tomato sauce topped with light cheese and buttered bread crumbs. I highly recommend this authentic Italian contemporary cuisine, Delicioso!
