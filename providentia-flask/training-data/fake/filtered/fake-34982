This review is based entirely on service. I looked forward to Agricola's entry on the Princeton restaurant scene for months, sensing an antidote to sub-par restaurants in the downtown area. Given the attention to detail in the menu, farm to table approach and decor, I had high hopes. Last night was my second time here but I have now been let down twice. We arrived late into Princeton, so I called ahead twice to make sure we could still get food off of the late night menu. Both of us were tired and weary from several hours of traveling, so imagine our relief when we arrived and the hostess again assured us we would be served, as long as we checked in at the bar and got a menu before 11:30. I attempted to place the order at the bar when the waitress did not pay us any attention, but I was told to wait for table service. When she eventually came to our table, she was at first apologetic, claiming we had missed the cutoff time on the bar menu, but her tone quickly turned accusatory. She insisted that she saw us seated at 11:33, and she repeatedly vilified us on this claim she couldn't prove. She then proceeded to berate me and my date about how it wasn't her problem that she didn't take our order when we arrived-in fact it was management's strict policy. Whether or not this was a problem of restaurant policy or us supposedly arriving three minutes late falls short when I consider the fact that we were promised food service on multiple occasions-calling ahead twice and telling the hostess and two bartenders of our situation upon arrival. The waitress' unjustifiably accusatory tone, the perceived lack of communication between the staff and the inability for this restaurant to deliver on multiple promises warrant one to no stars. It is a shame that I have yet to try sample the carefully crafted menu because of cripplingly poor service.
