The Subz Tikka Masala (or however you spell it) is the bomb! Oh man was it delicious. I love the sauces! I mean, no lie, definitely smelled a little bit afterwards, but it was so worth it. My gf thought my clothes and stuff stank, but that's what happens with delicious food. It doesn't just leave you in your stomach, it also becomes a part of you. That's why I utterly enjoyed this restaurant. It's not just lunch -- it's a cultural experience. And I think that's why I love ethnically rich and delicious food (besides the fact that it's delicious, of course). It's like you're entering another world, quite honestly. Like nothing else matters except for you, your hopes, and what you plan on devouring on your plate!
