What better way to celebrate Mexico kicking Cameroon's ass in the World Cup than to go have some of my favorite Mexican grub!! Chips and guac, vegetarian burritos and cheese quesadillas OH MY. Si, I am vegetariano :) Loved every bite, as per usual, and prices can't be beat. Mexican comfort food at its best!!
