Excellent new Vietnamese restaurant. Restaurateur Henry Trieu was part of the original crew at San Francisco's famous  Slanted Door restaurant, and he has now brought us his favorite Vietnamese dishes. The braised pork belly and the lemongrass pork chop are fantastic, as are the appetizers (go for the ChaoZhao shrimp rolls). Heard others rave about the shaking beef. The decor is also very nice, with a nice bar. Check out the bird cage lamps!  A welcome addition to the Brooklyn -- and New York -- dining scene.
