You go out to a restaurant to have something different than the regular food and feel: Lets see what you get in this one. I heard about it recently from some of my friends so I decided to give it a try: 1. Ambiance: Bad - couple of tables in a hall. Doesn't feel like a restaurant. looked like a canteen. 2. Service: Very bad- I had to ask for water and then the cups. Order was delayed. 20 mins difference between one dish and the other and just 3 more tables were busy. Had to go to the counter to call the server. 3. Food Quality: Bad- Oily, no taste, I ordered dal makhani and they gave me something not even close to it. I checked with them and was told that This is Dal makhani. OKAY...my bad. Paneer Karahi was more like a bhurji,oily very less quantity. Goat Biryani was horrible, no salt just colors and 3 chunks of bland meat. These people have no idea what they are preparing. very very basic culinary skills (In fact I cooked biryani today much better than what I was given). 4. Staff was very rude, inexperienced, indifferent, no respect for customers. 5. Cost of the dishes was high as compared to the quantity they give. I tried to complain and was given the bad looks. (I did get scared honestly I realized I am sitting in a Pakistani place and so quietly had my dinner and returned) I also heard them not accepting a voucher from another group of people. Horrible!!! Horrible!!! Horrible!!! Please do not ruin your evening or a holiday by visiting this place. I am not going to any Pakistani restaurant anymore.
