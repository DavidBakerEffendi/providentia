Another great addition to our burgeoning scene along 3rd Ave. So far I have only been lucky enough sample their breakfast pastries and coffee. Great apple turnover to go with my macchiato. The space is really cool with a friendly staff. Â Looking forward to returning to try what looks like a great dinner menu. Go Third Ave!
