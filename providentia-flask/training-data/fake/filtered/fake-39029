My boyfriend and I went to the Wrap Shack on Friday and we had a fantastic meal.  The menu had so many choices, including some really nice vegetarian selections.  My boyfriend had the Freeman Wrap and there was a ton of meat and the perfect amount of spice and sauce and he (usually complains about still being hungry after a meal) said he was perfectly full.  I had the Grilled Veggie Wrap and all the ingrediants were fresh and the goat cheese was a perfect addition.  I think next time I will try the eggplant Parm which the extremely friendly cashier recomended.  I would definitely recomend the Wrap Shack on the Square and since they deliver, you dont~ even have to go out in the cold to eat thier tasty food! ~Ryan
