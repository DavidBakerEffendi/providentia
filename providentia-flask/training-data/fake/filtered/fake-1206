We arrived on time for our reservation and were quickly greeted by a server, who called over the hostess for us. They accommodated our request for an outside table with no issue. Inside the tables and decor were clean and trendy. Both our drinks and meal arrived quickly, myself having the Hanger Steak and Shrimp. It was most delicious. Overall the service and food were excellent.
