Thank goodness this place recently opened in my neighborhood! El Diablito is outrageously wonderful! The ingredients are super fresh, the food has been cooked perfectly every time I've ordered (three times in one week!), delivery time is very fast, and the service is excellent. The serving sizes are great, too (except the small guacamole is a little small -- order the large if you want more than a few tablespoons). The employees are so nice there! The guacamole is superb, and I'm crazy about the shrimp burrito. Also, order a huarache! Fabulous! THANK YOU, El Diablito! My new favorite Mexican place. :)
