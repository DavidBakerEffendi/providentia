I've been hearing some beat up reviews on sharky's wings and raw bar. The food sucks on so on. Are they talking about Sharky's Â in Clifton,NJ? The one in Clifton rules! Happy hour 30 cent wings they freakin' rule $1 pints. They have blue moon on tap!!! You can get fresh live raw clams they rule too. Go on a Sunday for the game or Monday nights. Also I've been bringing my clients for a business lunch and the place is quite and perfect for meetings. Keep up the good food.
