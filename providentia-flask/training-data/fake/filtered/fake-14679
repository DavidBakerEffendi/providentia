Great Burgers, Great Beer. If your in the area and love a craft beer and a great burger then this place is a must do. It's not very often that I can order a medium rare burger and it comes out perfect, but it was spot on. Your able to create your own burgers with any toppings and sauces. If you are expecting a cheap $8 burger them go to Wendy's or Applebee's. The counter is well worth the extra $4 for a gourmet burger.
