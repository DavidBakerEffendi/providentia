As a chef and transplanted New Yorker living in Boston places like the north end grill reminds me of why New York is one of the great food cities in the world. The dinner was unreal from apps to dessert and our table of 4 had 4 courses each so we cover a lot of the menu.  All the desserts were top die for, I had carrot cake sundae  and even this most simple sounding dessert just blew me away with flavor, texture and originality. Kudos to the team there and I will be back
