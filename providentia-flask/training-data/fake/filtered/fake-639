This is a perfectly acceptable Italian restaurant with a wide variety of menu options. The food is fine and you can expect to always get food that is fine. I particularly enjoy the pappardella montrachet. Â The specials range more into exceptional - but they are also priced as exceptional. (The specials generally revolve around seafood.) The dining room is spacious and well kept; sometimes a bit noisy. Service is generally friendly and efficient. This is a BYOB. The pizza parlor is generally pretty busy and we have had both good and bad luck with pies to go. We have decided Friday night is NOT the night to order out pizza, but Saturday has been fine. Not sure if that is a staff or volume issue, but this is our observation.
