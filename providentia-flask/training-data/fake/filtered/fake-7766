Horrible service. The waitress with the red and black hair was awful. She ignored us all night. No one bussed our table. The waitress tried to bring us our food while our tiny table was full of empty glasses and appetizer plates. Our food was cold and some items were uncooked and raw. The waitress didn't care and gave us our check with an awful attitude. Never coming here again. Nice atmosphere but that's about it.
