Extremely bad experience. We made our booking for 9:30. The restaurant people did not tell us that they are serving VERY limited entrees on the menu. On top of it, the restaurant manager was very agressive and rude to us. During our 30 minutes wait time for our order to go, we were told at least ten times if not more that restaurant is closed and food can't be served. We ordered whatever they were offering. Food was very costly as compared to other indian restaurants and Â taste was average. The ladies there were still polite but the manager needs to learn customer service 101. We took our friends and was very embarrassed and disappointed with the service provided. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. I would drive 2/3 miles extra and try other indian restaurants in the area.
