Great place for brunch. Wonderful atmosphere. Waffles were perfect, not soggy like your normal diner would make. The fruit topping was very fresh and delicious. Omelets were perfectly cooked- light, fluffy, flavorful. The side of mashed potatoes with the omelette was delicious and I'm not big on potatoes for breakfast. The coffee was equally great.
