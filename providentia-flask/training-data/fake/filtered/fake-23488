Ordered the tuna burger and got food poisoning. Was in the NYU ER very shortly after eating their food. I called to warn the tuna was bad and was assured my dinner charges would be reversed. Â I was also told the GM or owner would call me. THEY DID NEITHER OF THE ABOVE. Don't patron such a poorly run establishment.
