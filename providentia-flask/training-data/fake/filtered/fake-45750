I'm so glad my friend told me about this little Italian cafe!!!! their food is to die for, fresh and tasty like being in Italy. This place looks beautiful, the style is organic, charming...at its best! wood, old tins and reclaimed barn wood everywhere! it's a surprise in a surprise, walking on Madison avenue you wouldn't expect to find such a rustic Italian place, like making a turn in one of this little cute street that I love in Firenze!!!! Must try the spaghetti lobster....mmm....delicious! the pasta is cook al dente, just perfect, and the lobster is juicy and tender, you can taste the olive oil and fresh basil, so good, nice touch the bruschetta!!! I'll definitely be back to try the rest of their menu! the vegetarian lasagna looks amazing! They do not offer a lot of dressing choices, but the Â balsamic vinegar from Modena in organic olive oil is one of a kind! By the way they sell great capuccinos!!!! I just had mine, I know, I know you should never order capuccino after 6 p.m. but I'm a big fan!!!! Ciao Piccolo!
