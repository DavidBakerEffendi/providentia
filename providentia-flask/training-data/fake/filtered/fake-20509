Had dinner here on a visit last weekend (April 26).  The food was excellent.  We had the chef' tasting menu.  So many different dishes, all very flavorful and fantastic.  The hummus was amazing.  The lamb to die for.  For dessert was expecting only one choice, had four different dessert tastings.  Heaven! Service was excellent.  The staff knew the food.  The service was fast and unobtrusive. Will definitely be back on our next trip to Philadelphia.
