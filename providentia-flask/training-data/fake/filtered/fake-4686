Ok so, I ate here just a few days ago. Dont get me wrong, the food is pretty good. I personally got the mussels, or moules whatever. They were excellent. And like, mussels are so plain, so to make them taste this good was pretty impressive. The frenchfries on he side came with a mayo type dip. I didn't even use it because I just dunked all the fries into the leftover broth after I took out all the shells. Yum. OK, And I drank a Bloody Mary which is my favorite drink that I always order. I'm a bit of a bloody Mary snob so I actually have opinions on this drink. It was spicy, which i like. I'd watch out if you are sensitive. They also put a small pickle in the drink which I thought was a nice touch. You can tell them make it fresh every morning, which I even asked the waiter, and he confirmed. The only thing I didn't like, which i why I only rated 4 stars, was the way the outdoor tables were set up. They all face towards the street, even if you are 4 people, you all face outward. It is as if the sidewalk is a runway. I guess if you are a people watcher, you'd probably love this place. But I found it a little uncomfortable. Over, all, good food and good atmosphere. Sit inside!
