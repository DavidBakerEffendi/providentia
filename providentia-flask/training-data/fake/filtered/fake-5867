My family comes from the gulf coast.  I remember eating fresh seafood in and around New Orleans growing up.  Often, a place that looked like a casual hole in the wall would turn out to offer world class seafood. While the Blue Point Grill looks like many of the great seafood places along the coast, they operate at a slight disadvantage to restaurants that are a stones throw away from the water.  Freshness is the bottom line when it comes to seafood, and the Blue Point grill clearly understands this. I went to the Blue Point Grill while my brother was in town last week, and as usual the place was crowded.  I usually try to get whatever is local, but I felt like trying something new this time so I ordered the Costa Rican Tilapia and my brother ordered the swordfish.  We both ordered our fish grilled and both orders came out great.  Mine was very minimally seasoned and cooked to perfection, light yet rich in flavor but not overly modified.  You can really taste the true flavors of the fish you are eating, which suggests the chefs are very confident in the freshness of their products. The one downside to the Blue Point Grill is the fact that it is a BYOB, so you have to remember to bring a nice bottle of wine - I prefer Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, since it seems to go well with just about anything I have ever ordered here.  If you forget, there are a number of reasonable wine stores nearby.
