Best for takeout. Their pizza by the slice trumps their whole pies. For $4 you can get a slice of fried calamari pizza and be on your way. Do what I do, call when you get off the ferry and they'll have the slice ready for you when you get there. The service isn't great and I definitely wouldn't recommend staying to eat. But the calamari pizza deserves 4 stars.
