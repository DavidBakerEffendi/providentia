I absolutely LOVE this place..... the people working there are so nice and friendly and of course the sandwiches are super delicious!!  They are so fresh, made to order and the size is very satisfying considering the low price!   The atmosphere is also great - super clean, cute, and the photos on the wall are beautiful.  I go there quite often - for lunch and take-out dinner.  And I am going tonight to pick up my sardine sandwich!!
