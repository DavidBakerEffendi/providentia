So I came to New York with some of my friends to visit a week ago. I went downtown and everyone told me that this place has awesome dumplings, so I decided that I'm going to go and check it out. Don't get me wrong, the dumplings were pretty good (even though I've had better) and their beef pancake was excellent. Their service was terrible, in fact, they were not exactly sanitary when comes to a lot of things either. When I first walked in, I ordered 30 pork and cabbage dumplings and the beef pancake to share with my 2 friends. We waited about 5 - 10 minutes or so and our food was ready. We came to find out that the person who took our order only order 10 instead of 10 dumplings. So I told him that we ordered 30 and thought that he would put the order in. He gave me this dirty condescending look and said I quote "no, just take the 10 dumplings ok? there's a long line behind you" I was dumbfounded!!! My friend and I figured that we will just eat this as a snack and then go get some other food, so we dug into the beef pancake and dumplings. It tasted pretty amazing, until we realized that the guy who took our order and handled the cash WAS MAKING THE PANCAKE!! At that point we completely lost our appetite. So long story short, we didn't finish the pancake and left this place. Was the food good? Yes. But would I go back? Probably not. With poor service like that and unsanitary conditions, I would rather eat elsewhere.
