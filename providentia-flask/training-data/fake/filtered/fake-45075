The pizza was ordinary.  There are lots of places with better pizza, lots of places with worse pizza. The problem is that the food, average as it was, was the best thing about this place.  Dark.  Crowded.  Noisy.  Inattentive service.  They charge for beverage refills.  Nothing egregious, but certainly nothing to justify going back.
