Ordered an assortment of sandwiches for a small office meeting today. Service was above and beyond - Aaron helped me on the phone, called to review my faxed-in order, delivered lunch on time and called to follow up to see how we enjoyed our lunch. Food was great - just what we needed, and everyone was more than satisfied. Good menu choices, nicely sized sandwiches, fresh ingredients, exactly what we ordered - couldn't ask for anything better! We'll be repeat customers for sure!
