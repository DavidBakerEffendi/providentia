I don't usually write Yelp reviews, but this place is in my neighborhood and I felt compelled to write something. I've been here several times and every time there are at least one or two things that really bother me. The food is hit or miss. Some of the brunch items could have more flavor but my main complaint is that for what they are they should not be so expensive. The soups are usually pretty good and I got their chili a few times last winter and it was SO delicious. Really hit the spot on those cold nights. Menu can be confusing though, as the chalkboard is not the same as the menu they hand you. Maybe they've changed the hours since I've been there, but their hours seem odd and inconsistent. For a while the website had the wrong hours, or wasn't the same as the hours posted on the door. One time I checked the hours before going there and it said I had over an hour. So I brought a book to read and ordered a full dinner meal when I got there. Right after she brings me my food (which was very bland) she starts acting impatient and keeps coming by to try to take my plate away even though I'm reading a book and therefore taking my time eating. Because isn't it supposed to be the kind of place where you can hang out and read? Quite a while later she says something implying that they need to close up soon and then follows a very confusing conversation about what time they close. Turns out their actual closing time was right when I got there...as I was ordering my food! Why wouldn't she have just said something when I got there? I do keep trying to like this place but every time I get some sort of bad service. The atmosphere is a little stuffy and unwelcoming. They also seem to really rush you out of there. If I'm paying a lot of money for my food then I should also be able to enjoy the place and spend some time there. Also they make it very confusing; should I order at the counter or will I get served at my table? They are so inconsistent!
