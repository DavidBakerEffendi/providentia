My mom and I were staying in the area and stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday. What a gem! The biscuit sandwich was seriously the best I have had. The biscuit was so tender and flaky. Eggs cooked and seasoned perfectly. My mom had the rosemary potatoes and I had the grits and gravy. Both were wonderful accompaniments and perfectly done. Service was so friendly and attentive. The owner sat and talked to us and was very kind, intelligent and thoughtful. Highly recommended!
