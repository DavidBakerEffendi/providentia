116 ROCKS.  This is for those with an aggressive palate open to trying exotic drinks made with ingredients that you've never heard of. And they are all FANTASTIC. Yes, a little more pricey but worth every penny.  Who knew little New Haven could handle a unique sophisticated joint like this? LOVE IT. Oh and the cheeses are delicious too. Truffle fries. Haven't had anything I didn't love there. In short: Just go.
