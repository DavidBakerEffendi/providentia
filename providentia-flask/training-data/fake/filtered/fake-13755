The food was good but the service was so slow I walked out. After waiting ten minutes we got to order drinks and they came after just a few minutes. Five to ten minutes later we got our appetizer of wings that were pretty good. We were happy and considering making it a regular spot. However, after another fifty minute wait for food, and watching other customers receiving appetizers and main courses I'd had enough. I walked to the bar and was told by a waiter that "everything was fine, we make it now" and I was done. How long does it take to go from a cozy 7 to a walkout? About an hour fifteen with no fajitas to boot.
