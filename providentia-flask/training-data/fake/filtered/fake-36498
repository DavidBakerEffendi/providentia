This is one of the best restaurants in New York. Having eaten at some of the finest restaurants around the world I often find myself longing for the Duck Egg with Mojama at Casa Mono. The sepia is amazing. The razor clams are amazing. The goat cheese and pumpkin croquettes are amazing (they come with flash fried sage but be sure to ask for extra). The wine list is amazing. I LOVE CASA MONO!
