Anywhere else in the country this place would get all five stars from me, but this is ny and the general claim is that its the best in the city.   First off I had to wait in a line that wrapped around the block which put me in a bitter mood, that cost them a star. When I finally made it into the place the host was pushy and rude, which I took as a good sign.  He gave off the attitude that this pizza is so good that I don't need to be nice and polite, fine. The pizza was good, but not great.  The crust was under-cooked leaving a doughy texture.  Maybe they had so many people to serve that they didn't have time to wait an extra two-three minutes to get the pizza perfect, which is what I expect from a pizza place with such a reputation.   In summary, the pizza is good, but not worth the wait.  Try another brick-coal-oven pizza place and save yourself the time and frustration.
