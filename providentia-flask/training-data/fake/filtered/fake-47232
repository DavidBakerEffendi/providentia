Really cannot say enough good things about Luca's in Somerset. Superb service, thematic but not 'cheesy' decor, reasonable prices and fantastic food. I went with a party of 10 (only 2 had ever been here before and recommended it highly), none of the 10 of us had even a single complaint by the time we left. I had the Gnocchi Genovese and it was super delicious. The portions are substantial and BYOB is a nice feature given that this delicate little hole-in-the-wall is tucked away in a strip-mall next to a liquor store. Do not miss a chance to try this place. I'll definitely be back.
