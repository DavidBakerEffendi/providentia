This is a reliable go-to when you're looking for a place that will accommodate even the most basic palate, without disappointing your food critic pal.  Plenty of options, ranging from elevated bar fare to dinner entrees, most of them done surprisingly well.  Whether it's brunch or dinner, at either location, this place is always packed to the brim, so make a reservation if you can.  Or if you're like me, and never know where you're heading for dinner until you arrive, simply embrace the crowded atmosphere as a testament to their solid menu offerings, grab a drink by the bar while you wait, and get absorbed in the friendly din.
