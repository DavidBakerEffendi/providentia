This place is hands down the best Greek place I have ever been to.  The Hummus and Tatziki are amazing and so flavorful.  Also, the fresh pita bread they serve with it is always hot and fresh.  I have tried the 3-day marinated lamb and it is very tender and juicy, no game-y-ness at all.  An the fries that come with it are awesome!  well, fries aren't very Greek, but they use a super Greek sauce on the fries and fresh Parmesan and truffles. For veggies, get the wilted greens or grilled veggies, also awesome and tasty.  My friends had the fresh fish and they said it was great as well.  Basically this place rocks because it's authentic and uses super fresh ingredients. the catch?  well, it's a bit on the pricey side.  The average person will spend $30-$50 each for a great time out.  also they have a full bar, so no byob here.  enjoy!
