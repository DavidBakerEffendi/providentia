I LOVE DUFFY'S. Great food, great atmosphere, friendly people, great bartender, Â and cordial waitresses, and more than reasonable prices for lunch and dinner. I recommend the "Shepard's Pie" for lunch, and a $1.50 Miller from the tap. What's could be better? -- Lou Russo, Art Director, Mandolin Brothers
