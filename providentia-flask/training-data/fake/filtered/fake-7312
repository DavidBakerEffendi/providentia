My family went to Balthazar for brunch and it was really not that great. The hostess was friendly but our server was kind of rude. She was not very attentive and she acted like she did not wanna work there. The food was okay. I had duck shepherd's pie. It was way too salty. My brother had eggs benedict and he said he's definitely had better. Overall, this place is overrated. I was quite disappointed.
