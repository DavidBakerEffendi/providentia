This was the worst meal I've had in a long time. I love the food at Juniors in Colchester, and I was looking forward a similar menu but better quality based on what I had heard about the new location. The food was bad; I left hungry. I ordered a wood fired pizza. The dough recipe did not work in the high heat, it had a very poor texture. The sauce had no flavor and the toppings were sparse. My boyfriend had spaghetti and meatballs. The portion was half the size we get at the other Juniors, yet it was still $15 . We think the meatballs had been frozen and the pasta was nothing special. There was no real atmosphere either. I was almost tempted to drive to the other Juniors after we left to get a real meal.
