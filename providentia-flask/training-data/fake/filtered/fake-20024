Best roast beef in city. I always order the beef combo and the gravy fries that are almost as good as the sandwich!!! I have been going here since I was a kid and I bring my kids here. Never, ever had less than a delicious sandwich. If your lucky they'll have the "outs' and get it "overboard". Thats the ends of the beef(crispy) and the sandwiched dunked in gravy. Awesome.
