I've always been a huge fan of Habana. It's in my hood, it's a great spot, with a great crowd, and with cheap drinks. overall great vibe. I hate to say, though, that their food system has completely failed lately :-( the truck folks are completely disorganized, which results in your order being ready in 30-45 minutes, cold, and after having switched hands several times. Also, your name will be whispered very quietly from inside the truck, so make sure you're standing right in front of it for those 30-45 minutes, asking about your order every 10-15. another small comment... you can't charge me $8.50 for a sandwich with guacamole and cheese coming off a truck in brooklyn, when a beer is $2.75, meat-filled options are cheaper, and there is no service. no particular stand on those points, but the relativity just doesn't stand. almost anywhere else, the veggie option is reasonably priced.
