Just awful. Someone wrote "The food is ridiculous." This is true. I recently had lunch here with a friend.  My entree was mussels and house fries - this consisted of 5 mussels and a handful of very limp fries. But I was so hungry that I devoured the latter. Hers was squash soup. This was cup-size, so she ordered some kind of onion quiche thing - inedible. I have to admit that the presentation was creative and interesting, but the bill for this lunch was $50 + tip. Both of us are on the thin side and not big eaters, but we were starving when we left. I went home and ate an apple. If you like weird, expensive  stuff, this is the place to go.
