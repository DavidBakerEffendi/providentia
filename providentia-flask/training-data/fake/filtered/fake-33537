French and Mexican Bistro/Cantina, YES, SI, OUI! And since you're in such joint, try the combination of French/Mexican fares, such as Mexican tartare, the mussels -- their version of Mexican Moules Frites, even though it's not labeled as such, but it's a spin on the traditional Moules Frites with Michelada or Chipotle sauce. the Cantina Bouillabaisse and the Croque Señor.  And happy hour specials, such as oysters, raw or friedfor $1 ea. You'll come out jolly from Jolie.
