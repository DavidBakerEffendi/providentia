Went to Alta with a group for a birthday dinner.  The food was good, but everything else was a disaster.  Service spotty, attitude high, and noise deafening.  Was offered a food allergy-specific menu after inquiring about ingredients, then told they couldn't guarantee I would be served the dishes I ordered -- they have too many other diners who need to be tended to to worry about something like that. (At this point of the  evening the restaurant was only half full.)  Not willing to risk getting sick, I explained that I couldn't risk it and cancelled two dishes I'd ordered and figured I'd celebrate my friend's birthday and eat at home after.  Then the manager -- at least I think it was the manager -- he didn't introduce himself or have a nice thing tpo say.  He stridently announced their policy which is not to insure that someone with a food allergy gets the dishes they order because the restaurant is way too popular and waitstaff couldn't be bothered with something minor like that (I'm paraphrasing, but not changing the content of what he said one bit).  Why have allergen-free menus if you don't honor them, one wonders.  Rude, arrogant, and only for people who enjoy a little abuse with their tapas.    At $10 - $15 a plate, and 3 - 4 to add up to a meal, you're easily in for $100 with a glass of wine.  For that, I can get much much better service, food and ambiance at a hundred other places in town.
