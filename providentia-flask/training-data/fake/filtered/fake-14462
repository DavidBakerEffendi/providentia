I write very few reviews on places but I had to comment on my experience at Vesta. My friends and I had been wanting to try this place since it opened but were just waiting for a day we could all get together. After reading some of the reviews we were a little hesitant at first but we were totally blown away with our experience. Everything from the decor to the food to the service was awesome!! Immediately when I walked in I felt comfortable..the ambiance was perfect. The bar was full with customers with the music going, the TVs on and the wood fired ovens burning. The place just had a great buzz about it. We were greeted with a very warm and welcoming hostess and then by our waitress who was outstanding from beginning to end. We ordered the Calamari and Arancini for appetizer. I've never had Calamari so crispy and mouth watering...the Arancini which was recommended by the waitress left us fighting over the last piece. For dinner we all shared pizza. One was the prosciutto & arugula (waitress suggestion) and the second was the buffalo chicken pizza. WOW...I don't think I will ever eat pizza anywhere else =) I've been craving it ever since and can't wait to go back. We were so full that we weren't going to have any dessert but when the waitress told us about the Nutella pizza we had to give it a try. It was incredible and I'm so glad we did. Throughout the entire meal both the waitress and staff were always accommodating and around whenever we needed something. I've eaten at many restaurants around New Jersey and have never come across such a warm welcoming place with exceptional food and service like this. If definitely looks like they know what they are doing and are all about creating a great environment for there guests. I can't wait to go back and am sooo glad a place like this has finally opened in the area.
