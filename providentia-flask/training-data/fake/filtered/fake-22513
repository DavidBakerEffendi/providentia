I have eaten at Mediterra a half-dozen times over the years so when I was invited to lunch for my birthday this year I chose Mediterra. I thought I was very safe ordering the chicken caesar salad. I've ordered this a hundred times wherever I go and they are always the same: chopped romaine, croutons, parmesan, sliced grilled chicken, etc. Mediterra's version that day was inedible: a warmed stalk of romaine unchopped (leaves plus stalk whole) with dressing in one plate and rubbery sliced chicken on a side plate. It was the worst interpretation of a chicken caesar salad I have ever had. I Â am afraid to eat there again.
