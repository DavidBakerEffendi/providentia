I have being going to Kelly's on and off for the past few months & have to say its one of my favorite places in New Haven. I went in there last night for happy hour with my work colleagues.  The fireplace is a big attraction for some of the girls in our group but unfortunately the tables by the fire were occupied when we arrived.  I spoke with the manager asking her how long it would be for a table by the fire.  She was so helpful & sat us at the bar while we were waiting & gave us some delicious complimentary homemade potato chips with an awesome spicy dip. The service was very prompt & courteous at the bar & also when we sat down in the dining room.  I love the wine selection, a great assortment & prices.  Not just your typical choices but a lot of unusual wines from around the world, a lot to choose from.   We are having our office holiday party here, in their private room, which we are all eagerly anticipating.  Try this place you won't be disappointed!
