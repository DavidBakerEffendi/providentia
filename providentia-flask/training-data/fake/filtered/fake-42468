I attended a private surprise birthday party in the Carriage House of the Palma Restaurant at 28 Cornelia St., NY, NY.  The staff were fantastic and the food was absolutely incredible.  Everything was out of this world, but the spinach stuffed raviolis and the meatball appetizers were to die for.    Along with an incredible Italian Feast, we were entertained by a very talented violinist by he name of Slava Gelfand.  The violinist was a perfect accompaniment to complete the perfect Italian Feast.   I am therefore providing his contact information - (917)596-9925.  Have a dinner party there, or just a dinner for two, you won't be sorry.
