The store part seems fine, but I'm so done with the deli.  I went for the first time a while back during my lunch break and got a delicious italian sub.  A few days later I went to pick up a large one on my way home to split with my wife for dinner.  After asking for a large italian and being asked by the kid what kind of meat I wanted I reiterated I wanted an italian.  He clarified, "the italian combo?" and I said yes.  I get it home and it's a pathetic amount of meat and the wrong meats.  It was deli turkey, ham, and like 3 pieces of salami on the whole thing.  If I lived closer I probably would have taken it back, but instead I just tried to eat it and ended up pitching half of it. I stopped in a week or two later to give it another chance and got the girl who made the first sub.  Order a large italian and it's perfect, just as good as the first one. Attempt #4: today I stopped in on my way home, ordered a large italian, and gave my bread choice.  A minute later she asked what I wanted on it, so I told her what veggies I wanted and cheese.  I get it home and it's just lettuce, tomato, onion, and cheese.  The, "italian" part apparently was completely missed.  You can't see the counter where they're making the sandwich so you don't know if it's right until you get it home. I've never had a problem anywhere else ordering clearly, not sure what the issue is.  When they've actually made what I ordered, which is only 2 out of the 4 times, it's been great, but after a 50% fail rate I think I'm done.
