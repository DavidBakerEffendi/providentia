The food is good and fairly authentic but the problem is that it caters to vegetarians!!!  For that reason, if you're hungry, you should probably have a burger or go to the Kebab place nearby.   Since their vegetarian food is completely made up of standard produce (nothing special here) it's much much too expensive. Ambience is good because it's usual full during dinner service.
