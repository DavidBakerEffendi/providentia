Generally pleasant space, nice staff but lots of mistakes and missteps combined with high priced mediocre food ensures I won't return.  The vegetarian antipasto was not an antipasto but four pieces of grilled zucchini with some overly sweet "caponata" on it. The bread that it came with was stale. The fried calamari was crisp and well cooked, but overly breaded and the type you could get at most decent sports bars.  We ordered Chicken Parm, Eggplant Parm. a pasta dish, and while all were well flavored, they were dry, overly salty and overly breaded (the chicken and eggplant at least). Any halfway decent authentic italian restaurants in Boston, New York or Philly, would have put these dishes to shame for half the price. The service was generally efficient and friendly, but they forgot to send over a dessert we ordered for our friends at another table and charged us (and presumably them) for the drinks our friends had bought us earlier in the night. There was nothing we had at Pascolo that an average cook couldn't make better at home given the abundance of ingredients we have in Vermont. At the end of the day it was no better, and perhaps a bit of a step backward, then the restaurant that occupied the space for years prior.
