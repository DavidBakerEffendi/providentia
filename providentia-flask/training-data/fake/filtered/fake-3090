We went here for the first time this past weekend. How we really found it was on Restaurant.com with a coupon. The food was very, very good and the staff was very friendly and attentive. The prices are a little on the high side, as we have eaten at other Indian restaurants where the food was equally good, but the prices were about 15% less. However, the dining experience was very good and we will definitly be going back.
