I love dosas, so was excited when I found out I could get them in Philly. I had the regular old school dosa because I wasn't keen on the indian fusion dosas. Be warned if you ask for hot it  WILL be hot. The dosa was definitely not the best I've ever had but was good. I do wish they had more indian style options!  I also had a samosa which was big and kinda greasy. All in all this is a nice place to eat for cheap, but if you are looking for more authentic south indian food look elsewhere.
