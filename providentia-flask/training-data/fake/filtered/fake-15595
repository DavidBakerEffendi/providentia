"Buttersby" If you like butter and rich food, this is your place.  Most of the dishes are hands down delicious such as the kale salad and several of the pastas.  I have been here a couple of times and while I always enjoy the food, I can't help but notice, especially during my last dining experience,  how much butter is used....it can be overwhelming. Another point of contention is that they never...ever.... answer their phone!  Luckily i live somewhat nearby and am able to walk by to see if there is any availability for the evening. However, most of the time there is not.  It would be considerate of them  if they just answered the phone and informed people of wait times and or inability to take any more parties.   Not to sound like debbie downer....house made ricotta amazing! I would recommend this place but not for parties over 2...near impossible to get a name in.
