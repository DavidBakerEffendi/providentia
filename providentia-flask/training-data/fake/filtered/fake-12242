C.O. Jones is a ripoff.  The margaritas are watered down, and the food tastes like it came straight out of a can.  The worst part is that they slap an 18% gratuity on all bills over $50.  I went out there with a few friends for dinner, the service was terrible, and we still had to shell out this big tip. When business owners have a practice of automatically adding gratuity to small bills, they're sending a message: either the service is always terrible or they think their customers are cheap deadbeats.  Either way, it's insulting.
