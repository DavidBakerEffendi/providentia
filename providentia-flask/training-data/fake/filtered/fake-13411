I visited early on a weekday evening for dinner before a theater date. At this time slot it wasn't dead as I'd expected, but not at all crowded.  However, it was for some reason very loud. Speaking with my dinner companion across the table was difficult without leaning across the table. The food is fine, but not incredible and perhaps does not quite justify the price. I might be here more often if either the atmosphere was more conducive to a relaxed evening, or if the food was spectacular, or if the food was more reasonably priced for what it is.  Any of these three things would put this restaurant into a 4-star category - but short of any of the three, it's just so-so.
