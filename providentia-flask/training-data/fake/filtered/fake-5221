After 20 years, my husband and I returned to Montclair and went back to Marzullo bros for our favorite subs. Much to our surprise, the deli of 20 years ago is now a nice restaurant but still serving the same delicious food at the same reasonable prices. The service was great and after a taxi pick up snafu, the owner drove us to the train station himself !! Speaks volumes of why customers refer and return!
