I would come back to Patzeria over and over again. The pizza is so delicious! Thin crust, tons of toppings, amazing flavors, reasonable prices? What more can you ask for in a pizza? I tried the tomato/basil pizza, the grandma pizza (a square cut, thicker pizza with sweet tomato sauce), and the lasagna pizza (tastes EXACTLY like lasagna, is a bit heavier to eat and very filling. Their garlic knots are also very good (very garlicy, oily on the outside). The only thing I would really say negative about this place is that there isn't a lot of seating areas. People usually sit on stools or stand, crowded inside, or there are a few seats outside. If you wanted to have a big group eat Patzeria pizza, it would be best to do a carry out I think.
