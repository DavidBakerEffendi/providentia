Great staff and the times i have been back there is always something different going on. Saturday nights are awesome with great DJ's for the 'dance crowd' and wednesday nights is beer pong there as well! Food is above average for a place like this and everything is very well priced. Staff is quite friendly too! Will become a regular hangout for my friends and I
