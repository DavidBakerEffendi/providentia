One word. Awesome. Now the Details : Dosa is out of the world, probable the best dosa I have ever tasted. I hesitate to order dosa as it is oily but the dosa served here is so damn delicious without being oily. Chutny is like home made. Sambar is authentic. Gutti vankaya reminded me of home :( Now coming to biryani... I ordered the food to be medium ( not mild not hot) spicy  but it was so damn spicy, I got tears.  So watch out. But the taste is awesome so I ended up eating the whole biryani although with tears in my eyes. Dal fry is so good with the cilantro smell setting a nice ambience.... I would go again when I go to Edison !
