This is my favorite place in NYC. I've been to many shabu shabu places but nothing compares to Shabu Tatsu.(altho momokawa has better meat quality by 2%). Best quality meat + Best Service + Best everything. Their portion is just right and people who works their are very helpful and friendly. Must try their green tea ice cream for dessert with yebisu :)
