The four of us went there today for lunch. The ambience is very Mediterranean and mellow, we liked it. We had the Tunisian giabetta sandwich and enjoyed every bite! The Mediterranean salad trio was very good as well. The other couple had some lamb dishes and says it was great.. I would love to come back with the kids but it seems to tiny to fit a stroller in between the narrow lanes in between the tables. I would probably think the same for a wheel chair.
