I love City Steam- whether it's for lunch, dinner, comedy club or just a few drinks. It's so versatile. This past visit we were disappointed that we couldn't sit upstairs. The band was so loud (and horrible) and we got stuck listening to them and having an okay time. Ehh, I wish this visit was better. There are definitely more classy places around...
