Ordered wings at 2:30pm yesterday for delivery at 6:30pm for the Superbowl. Our wings never showed up and to top it all off, when we tried to call their phone to find out the deal, it was taken off the hook and busy for the rest of the night. Â This was our first experience with Urban Chicken and it will be the last. Still pissed that we had no wings for the game. So much for ordering early.
