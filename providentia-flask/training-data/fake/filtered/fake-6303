I selected one star just because I had at least to select one...after one year that we had been customer we call them to order the usually "one cheese pizza" and the didn't take our order. Aout 30 minutes later they contacted us saying that our pizza would be there in 2 minutes. We thought that was really nice of them and they gave value at our fidelity. After that we waited outside 10 minutes and....the results: they called us thinking was someone else, no pizza for us!!!!!!! I don't have words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
