I would give this place five stars even if I were a Steelers fan, which- thank God- I'm not. The menu is basically bar-fare that you could take a date to. The place isn't crazy loud like other bars/grilles in the area. The portions are big and filling. My favorite thing on the menu is the Rogue's Burger. Get it with bacon. During football season, I highly recommend the Dawson Dog, for two reasons: 1) it's a big chili dog and fries for $5, and 2) it's named for the Browns' leading offensive weapon. I'll be back in the offseason, and every week once the Browns are back!
