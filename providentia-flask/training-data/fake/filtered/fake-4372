HJ House is one of the few Asian restaurants in Burlington that I really enjoy.  I love ramen, and as far as I know HJ House's is the best in quite a large radius.  The broth is the stand-out here: rich, creamy, and, if you're wise enough to get the spicy meat ramen, laced with delicious, bright-red chilli oil.  The noodles, in contrast, are only so-so: usually cooked a little bit too long.  Still, for the price and the overall taste, this place can't be beat. Make them a success!  Burlington needs more good, interesting restaurants.
