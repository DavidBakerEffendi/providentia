I've been to other Cluck-U places and this Parsippany location is the worst. I'm not sure why but the service is bad, my to-go order is NEVER right. The chicken just isn't as good as other locations. I've never complained online, but this last incident annoyed me so bad, I created an account just to warn others about how bad this location is and to avoid it.
