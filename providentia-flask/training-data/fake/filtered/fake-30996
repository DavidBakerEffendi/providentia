Have had lunch and brunch here multiple times, most recently yesterday!  Their grilled cheese with avocado and tomato is DIVINE!!!  Their salads are terrific!  The burgers are DELISH!  They have a fantastic coffee/tea bar, one that rivals a coffeehouse! Sunday brunch is really FABULOUS!  The lox-eggs benedict sandwich is really, really good!  The breakfast potatoes are YUMMY!!!   Have had some very, very good meals here!!! We couldn't be happier having this new place in our community!  A huge bonus to Woodbridge!
