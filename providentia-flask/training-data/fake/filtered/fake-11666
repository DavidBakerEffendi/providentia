After seeing the reviews, I was expecting to not be disappointed. But maybe my expectations were too high? For this to be in Macy's, everything was excellent. If it were in its own little place out on the streets, I'm not so sure. I had the rotisserie chicken with escarole and crispy asparagus. The escarole was amazing... The chicken was average... The asparagus was burnt. My mom had the sea bass which she said was average. I tasted it and I would say it was dry. For what you pay here, the food should be better. Service was good, but nothing to write home about. We definitely won't be going back. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars is for the brussel sprout/ cauliflower app... A. Maz. Ing.
