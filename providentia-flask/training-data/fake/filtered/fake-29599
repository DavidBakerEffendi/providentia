It could be that I came alone, but their service was underwhelming. I waited by the door, inside, but when noone came for a few minutes, I approached the register, where a server pointed at a table and asked me to wait. After looking around for 15-20 minutes, finally a server came to ask about what I'd like. They forgot to bring water, so I had to ask for it after they brought my food. Food was quite good-- I recommend the big salad. Arrived fast. The tables are made of refurnished surfaces of all sorts are pretty quirky. Specials of watermelon and plantains and other treats are good as you can't find them in many other places.
