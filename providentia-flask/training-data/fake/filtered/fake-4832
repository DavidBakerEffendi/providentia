Comfortable, spacious dining room aiming for an upscale "modern rustic" feel. The bar area is very nice and would be great for a group at happy hour. My server was pleasant and attentive without hovering. I started with the Cobb salad, a very generous serving of fresh organic greens, lime-grilled chicken breast (juicy and delicious), blue cheese, crispy real bacon, and chopped tomatoes with a light balsamic vinaigrette....but unfortunately they forgot the chopped egg. Even with this oversight the salad was still excellent, and can easily be shared by several people. The grilled sirloin steak, however, was OUT OF THIS WORLD! A thick chunk of perfect juicy medium rare meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, no gristle, no fat, just total beefy perfection. The chef who cooked my steak is an artist. The sides, grilled fresh asparagus and light crispy French fries presented in a cute little wire basket, were also impeccable. I can't wait to go back for another slab of charred beefy goodness.
