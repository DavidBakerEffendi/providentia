I lived in boonton for many years.. i try not to order from here because i know to only order here if your drunk and want food late because its always over cooked or just bad all in all. But sunday i did thinking things may have changed there.. Boy was i wrong!! They cant even count!! I asked for a 15pc boneless chicken and i got 12!! Yes its only 3 missing.. but come on i pay money and figure i get what i pay for!!! Idiots!! Never again!!
