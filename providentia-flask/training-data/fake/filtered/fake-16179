I used to go to cafeteria every week. Tonight I was horribly disappointed with the bouncer john Ross. Not only did he let 10 people in front of us, but he manhandled my friend by grabbing and hurting her wrist. While it will be a long time until I come back, Â i must mention that Jacques and Felipe were wonderful servers. I'm thankful that all that work at cafeteria do not adopt John 's morals and hope that he will no longer be around to contaminate the culture.
