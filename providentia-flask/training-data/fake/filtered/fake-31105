Great atmosphere (English pubbish) and decent food. I had the Autumn salad and a burger.  The bun tasted straight out of a bag...and I had asked for the burger without the bun in the first place! Service SUCKED!  My waiter brought me a glass of Pinot Noir that looked like it was 50% water. I sent it back and ordered a Malbec which was chilled?!?!  And of course the waiter acted stupid/oblivious to my comments/complaints about the watery Pinot Noir (literally it was crystal clear around the edges), the chilled Malbec, and the bun I didn't want (I was VERY nice about it, not rude at all). Won't be dropping any major cash here again!!
