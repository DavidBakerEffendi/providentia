This place sucked. There was no menu, ordered a cheesesteak, no onions. They handed me a roll with bland dry beef - about two slices and a cold piece of provolone cheese. No napkins anywhere, which I didn't really need because it was like eating a dry sawdust sandwich. Not one person that waited on me (two different windows) said a word to me other than the amount of the bill. I also wish I could give this no stars. I knew this was a low rent district, but the neighborhood is disgusting, dirt and trash everywhere, and got to watch a dude smoking crack sitting at a red light.
