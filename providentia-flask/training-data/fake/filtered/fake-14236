I mean, this place was really awesome.  Let me first say, I'm NOT a pork and meat person.  I eat it, but most of the time, I choose the vegetarian or fish option.  For some reason, I was feeling meaty last night.  A friend who had recently been to the restaurant  suggested the potato chip nachos.  What an cool take on nachos!!  These had bechamel sauce, jalepenos, and pork belly(?).  Imagine the most incredible, interesting snack you've ever had, and there you go.   We then had the bone marrow.  I like to say I'm adventurous, but bone marrow is usually where I draw the line.  I tried it though, and it was tasty.  You just have to get past what it is (really, just don't think about it), and savor the fatty goodness that is laden with garlic and other good stuff.   Equally as amazing were our entrees. Let me stress this.  This is not just a bar with great apps and average entrees.  This whole place is a great dining experience.  You'd want to come here for dinner, not just drinks and finger foods.  There were three of us so we shared the arctic char, burger, and the duck breast.  Phil Conlon (from Cafe Cluny) is not messing around.  All of our entrees were to die for, and what you'd expect from a high class joint.  Surprising, since Swine is more like a rock n' roll bar.  Lucky for me, that's the kind of place I like.  It's a perfect Saturday night -- you get your bar scene all rolled into your great dinner.  What could be better than that?   It's definitely worth checking this place out!
