I love this place. I love the atmosphere, I love that is is a hole in the wall (we walked past the entrance at first), and the food was great. It took a little while to get our pies, but that was expected as it was the middle of the lunch-time rush. We had a few different pizzas, but the margherita was by far my favorite. This is due to the simple flavors present. You could tell that you were getting some solid mozz from the taste, and the basil was out of this world! Simply the best I have ever tasted, and I actually have some in my own garden at home. The waitress did not come as often as we would have liked to refill the drinks, but I am attributing this to how busy the place was. Like many places in the city, I wish I could walk in there without a card, but it has remained true to the cash-only payment plan.
