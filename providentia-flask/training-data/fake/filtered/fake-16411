Awesome place to eat and drink. I go here all the time. This place is West Hartford's best kept secret. For food, my faves here are the lobster roll and the fried belly clams. For $12.99, you can't beat it anywhere nearby. Also really like their raw oysters, lobster bisque, and other fried and broiled seafood dishes. The garlic parmesan wings are phenomenal! The fish here is fresh and fantastic. As for the bar, they recently renovated their bar area. Its a brand new space with hard wood floors and great to hang out at. Great place to drink with many flatscreen tvs. Friday nights they have karaoke, which is great. Thursday nights is live jazz, love coming here for live music. Accoustics here are excellent, not like other bars around. I give them my highest rating for value and quality. Worth checking out!
