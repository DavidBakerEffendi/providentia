Yuck. The only benefit to my experience here was that it inspired me to join Yelp, and write my first restaurant review. My husband and I had lunch here, and we both ordered vegetarian plates (him, the Veggie Combo; me, the Veggie Enchiladas).  Both plates were swimming in grease and cheese, and lukewarm at best.  The vegetables in the dishes were not fresh, and my enchiladas had a few of these "veggies" sprinkled on the top, while the enchiladas themselves were stuffed with what could only be described as thick, cold cheese logs.   My husband is currently en route to a convenience store for Tums, as he has been in and out of the bathroom for the past few hours and was actually tempted to force himself to vomit. I shudder to think about what a meat dish from here would do to a customer...
