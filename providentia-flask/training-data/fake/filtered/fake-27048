i went to Cresent Gril for a nice dinner with my boyfriend Â and the food was amazing best tasting i've had in LIC service was wonderful and friendly, but there was some qualities in my night that were far from amazing. The owner seemed very disgusted and angry giving me an uncomfortable vibe. I've eaten at this location twice already and both times i witnessed the owner in this mood. Another unpleasantry in my night was how the co owner named Daniel came to our table and at first made small talk but began on talking for a long unnecessary amount of time which was rudely interrupting my dinner with my girlfriend. I went for some quality time with my girlfriend and ended up having more unwanted quality time with the owner. If you're thinking of eating here you're in for good food and service. I recommend you trying the the organic chicken, the tomato and watermelon appetizer.
