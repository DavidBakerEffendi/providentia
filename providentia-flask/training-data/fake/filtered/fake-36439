Horrendously overpriced for low-quality and very salty food.  We paid $18 for 3 quarter-sized pieces of cod.  Everything was greasy and the service was incredibly slow for such a small and EXTREMELY cramped restaurant.  The worst was that they tried to charge us for 3 bottles of wine when we only had two.  We had to correct their $65-dollar "error."  Don't go!!!
