I go to this Qdoba all the time! Love the chill atmosphere and friendly staff. The food is always delicious, and I never get bored with it. I typically get the naked chicken burrito (with their queso! so good) or the Mexican gumbo, the latter of which is especially tasty on cold days. I've seen other reviewers mention feeling like the helpings are "stingy" but personally I've never experienced that. I don't know enough about Mexican food to judge whether or not the food here is "authentic", but I know that I always enjoy coming here and leave satisfied. One of my absolute favorite places to eat in town. :)
