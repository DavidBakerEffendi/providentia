Pat's get 5 stars not for having the best cheesesteak, but for inventing it. If you are only going to have 1 while in Philly, come here and give homage to generations of people who enjoyed these tasty sandwiches at this historic location. I like mine "american wit" (You'll understand if you go there). While enjoying your sandwich, you'll have a good view of Geno's Streaks, so you can take a pic of Geno's but eat at Pats.
