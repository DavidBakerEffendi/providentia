First and foremost....THIS IS A BRAND NEW restaurent "PERSIS".... Absolutely authentic indian food. Weekend buffet is incredible in addition to other menu items especially pepper chicken, chicken biryani (yummmmmy), velluru fish curry, mango malai to name a few. Staff is extremely courteous. Won't hesitate to say this is the best biryani I had after a very long time. Going with 5/5 for Persis Indian Grill in Hamilton, NJ. Thanks.
