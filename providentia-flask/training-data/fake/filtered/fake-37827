As in the Princeton location, the pancakes are nothing special, and the "syrup" is not maple syrup, likely corn syrup.  You can order read maple syrup and pay extra for it which is a must do.  The portions are too large.  They should charge less and serve less.  They have got to fix their tables.  We moved several times, each table rocked and we spilled beverages.  The staff was mixed, the person who came initially did not even smile, just plopped one menu down on the table for 3 people.  The waiter was very friendly and accommodating.  We went early in the morning during the week and had no wait.  I'm surprised their food isn't better given that they have the same owners as Osteria Procaccini and the food their is out of this world.  We'll probably be back because their aren't many breakfast choices in the area.  Hopefully they will fix some of the tables...
