Best place for a party!!!   I called a week before a party for 50 plus people because the place I booked told me that they no longer could accommodate me.   Catherine and her staff not only matched the other menu but they were so helpful and willing to adjust anything needed to make our father's 90th birthday special.   Great customer service and flexibility you can only expect from a family owned restaurant.
