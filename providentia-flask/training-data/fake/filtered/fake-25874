Went there today for lunch.  I ordered lasagna, my friend a chicken parm "platter".  The "platter" was a piece of chicken parm and a side of spaghetti.  We both ordered a lemonade.  For a Friday afternoon out for lunch, I thought that $36.00+ was a bit expensive.  The lemonade came in a small, 8 oz glass, packed with ice at a price of $2.00, no refills.  After that, we asked for a glass of water, and it came in a smallish juice glass, this time, no ice (which suits me). Bread came to the table with only a few little butter packets.  We did ask for a little more bread when our meals came; we were given uncut bread, but no butter.   Our waitress was grumpy and service was mediocre, at best.  The menus were thrown on the table. I don't know if I'm just picky about this, but I don't want a server's hands on the rim of my glass or their fingers INSIDE my drinking glass.     That being said, the food was delicious.  My friend and I both thought that the portions were reasonable.  I would have rather had the lasagna on a plate with a little more sauce, but it was still really good.  It was served in one of those metal plates that go in the oven.   I think they ought to have a lunch menu, maybe a bit smaller portion and a bit better price.  I eat out a lot and I was surprised there was not a lunch menu.  However, after leaving the restaurant and looking at the menus of some other near-by restaurants, the prices and lack of lunch menus seemed to be normal in the neighborhood. I gave it three stars mostly due to the service and prices.  The food would definitely be 4+, but the service and prices would get a 2.  I'm not going to include ambiance.
