I was a Penn student living near this cafe in the mid 90s and have come back here every year since.  I have spent a fair bit of time in France including the Basque region  where the owners are from. This is for me the quintessential neighborhood spot.  A combination of comfort and great food.  My favorite is the Gaulois.  But in any case those living nearby are lucky. I wish I had something close in NYC.
