La.Va - it's a pretty cool place with great artwork that changes from time to time.  They have great coffee, bagels, and other snacks.   For a pretty busy place (a lot of people are big on studying there or grabbing drinks to go), the service is pretty quick and the food is always legit; not half made or thrown together.  The employees are all awesome, funny and down to earth- defintely a group of people I would grab a drink with.  Totally have a crush on one of the staff members after going so much! The only downside is that some items are a bit pricey.  I'd give only 4 stars if the food and service wasn't so good, so I guess that's a good thing.
