Talk about potatos, alot of dame good potatos! These fancy thick and crispy belgian fries where YUMMY!!!! Man this is a little place and the line was out the door! But we did find a place to have a seat, I might say it is kind of comfy..............? FANCY FRIES: We had a double order with three sauces, which runs u about $10.25. Yeah the DOUBLE ORDER(u could feed at least four people) and we where only two hungry dudes. SAUCES: Roasted Garlic Mayo :-| Sweet Mango Chutney Mayo :-) :-) Cheddar Cheese :-) Theres soo many sauces, 30+ Nice place to have fries, cause thats the only thing thats on the menu, its worth the visit.
