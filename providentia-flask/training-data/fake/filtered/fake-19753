It's never a good thing when you have a reservation and still end up waiting for a table, even if it's only a 10 minute wait. The room seemed to be nothing more than a glorified cafeteria with very high ceilings and a noise level that made us feel like we were at a Devils game. The disappointment continued when they were out of the shrimp appetizer, and this was at 6:30; no excuse. The food overall was decent, but none of it was hot, and the portions were barely enough to satisfy my 2 cockatiels.  I then tried to change my dessert, and was told I could not. The coffee was undrinkable, not because it was barely lukewarm , but it had a chemical  soapy taste. The service was fair at best. Regretfully, I cannot recommend Nico, and we won't be back.
