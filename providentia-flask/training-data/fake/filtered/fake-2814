I would like to start with not giving a star to this place. A restaurant is not always all about food. It's a combination of Food, Ambiance and Good Service.  Out of which Cuban Pete does not even know the meaning of the word ' Customer Service'. The restaurant manager is doing his best to loose all clientele as quickly as possible. That's putting it mildly. He is the rudest, most un courteous manager that our group has ever had the misfortune to come across. And we go out to eat a lot.  The food has gone down in quality tremendously in the last 6 months. In fact it's more hit or miss. If you are lucky you might get good food or it could be very inedible. Your luck!  If the manager and the hostesses are in a good mood you might get some little service or you would be totally ignored. The place is dirty. The bathrooms are unhygienic and God knows what goes on in the kitchen. I would not advice anyone to go there even if its always full. The only reason it's full is because people want to go see and I can bet you that majority does not come back. I would rather recommend people to go to COSTENERA , another Cuban place just up the street. Food is awesome! Service is great and the Chef comes to your table for any special request. Not only that, prices are almost the same. So Don't waste your money at Cuban Pete!  Regards A Very Disappointed Client:(
