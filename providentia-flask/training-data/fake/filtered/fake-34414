I love this restaurant. I've been going here for years and it always aims to please. Very warm, cozy ambience, great wine selection, and tasty, rustic food. It reminds me of Tuscany...sigh... I'm a big fan of the spaghetti al limone and panna cotta for desert (the chocolate-hazelnut combo is stellar, a go-to if you like the taste of nutella). Also, it does get kinda busy on weekends so expect a long wait at the bar. It's worth it if you're with a friend and want to chill with some vino. Don't go here if you're starving and need to be fed asap... The cash only is a bummer but oh well. Also, if you're planning a large group outing, make sure everyone shows up on time. Had a birthday here once and the host was very cool. Although people were late, he was able to hold the table for us but this doesn't happen too often.
