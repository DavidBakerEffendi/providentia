Went there as a part of the group of 14. I have to accept, it's one of the best dining experience I had since long time. The presentation was awesome. Food quality and taste were superb. Service is fast, polite and all what you expect from upscale restaurant. I had fried rice and cucumber crab salad, both dishes were awesome. Decor and ambience is breathtaking. Highly recommended.
