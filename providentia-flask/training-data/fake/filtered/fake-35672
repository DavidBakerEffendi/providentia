So tonight was one of many nights that I have "taken out" from Uncle Moustache. As usual, the service was prompt and very polite. I usually place my order, receive my food, and make my payment with the owner of the restaurant who usually hangs out at the front of house. Tonight though, he introduced me to the chef/his partner who was also very nice. They both treated me as a "regular" there and sent me on my way with the food I ordered (falafel and beef shawarma) as well as some baklava and some hummus that was "on the house".. The food I had ordered, as usual, was great (hence why I keep ordering it), and to add to my delight, the baklava and hummus were also wonderful. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone, and tell them that the food is great and the service is equally as good.
