Went there Friday, May 17th. Service was the most terrible I ever experienced. Waited 20 minutes before someone to come over and bring a menu. Waited even longer, no one even came to take our drink order. Then a lady came by and said our seats were reserved. I said there was no reserve sign on the table. She offered us another table, but I couldn't see that table, looked like some dark space where you wouldn't be able to see anything like it wasn't a part of the restaurant. My friend and I left and we will never return ever. And I'll let my friends know.
