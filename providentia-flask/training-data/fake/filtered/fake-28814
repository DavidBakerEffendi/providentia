On a recent trip to NYC, we were on a mission to find this place ... we were a little thrown because their neon sign wasn't working ... but in the end, this dining experience became the highlight of our weekend. The space is narrow but accommodating with three levels uniquely decorated. I especially enjoyed the large, fully functioning hourglass on the second floor which they turned frequently in keeping with their theme and mission (cleverly written on the front of their menus). The tavern's owners, Beth and Josh, were very friendly and spoke with guests as if they were long time friends (and I believe some were). ~Go Steelers~ = inside joke for Josh. All the staff that we met that night were really outgoing and added to your experience. The food was incredible. We started out with the potato mushroom soup, bread and spanikopita. I have to admit that we didn't eat the bread because we didn't want to get filled up too quick, but Beth says they make their own bread in-house ... so I bet it would have been great. Just wanted to mention the soup again, it was so creamy and earthy and hearty -- a perfect comfort food for the snowy weather. Our entrees included the bourbon braised short ribs w/ mashed potatoes and asparagus and the penne pasta in a creamy marinara sauce with sausage & gorgonzola. WOW! Both were excellent. My mouth's watering thinking about this stuff. For desert we had a chocolate layer cake and a Greek inspired, nutty, custardy, crunchy confection. Aside from the building itself, the folks who run it, the good food and the drinks, the patrons were equally as friendly, inviting, interesting, and hospitable. I would highly recommend the Tavern to anyone and I hope that you will become enchanted by it as well.
