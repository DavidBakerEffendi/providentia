I saw this place from the outside and it looked pretty unique and nice. Once we went inside whoaa it was a pretty nice decorative place. We were seated and the waiters and waitress were nothing but kind. The menus were on the table already out of paper they were unique as well. We orded this tofu soup and it was only about $10 but the portion was great for you get full. And also the side dishes were very good as well. This place has some good food and i will surely come back and bring my friends!
