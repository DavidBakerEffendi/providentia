One of the best and most unique restaurants in New York without a doubt!! The food was amazing and the servers were really friendly and attentive. I had the Burger with the lot and my friend had the lamp lollies-both phenomenal!! I loved how the owner came to our table to talk to us about the food, explain what is what and how the food is prepared. Definetely going back!! P.S. When you go don't forget to order the Triple T tiramisu for dessert...trust me on this!!
