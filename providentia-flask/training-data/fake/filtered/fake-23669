The food here is delicious, and just having a hamburger is almost a crime.  But more criminal is the front door service for seating.  If you want to make plans with others to eat there at a certain time, watch out.  Because unless you can all get there at 5:30, good luck not having an hour or two to wait.  My friends and I are too hungry to wait that long to eat after work.  But if you can wait the vegetables and gnudi are crazy good.  5 star food, 1 star seating.
