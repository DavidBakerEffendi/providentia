I guess I don't get all the hype.  The pizza was all right, but it certainly wasn't the best pizza I have ever had.  John's on Bleecker in the Village is much better - both the crust and the ingredients. I had both one day apart and ordered the same kind so I could compare. There were five of us at our table, and we all agreed that John's on Bleecker was better.  We also ordered an antipasto plate that was pretty awful.  I have had much better on the Hill in St. Louis (STL version of Little Italy).  And the service was really crappy. No refills on drinks - and all I had was water. I got one small glass, no ice and no refill.  Certainly not worth the trip from Manhattan.
