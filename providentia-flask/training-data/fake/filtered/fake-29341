I will not go back again, sorry.   Too much hype, too much noise, and the food lacks value for the expensive price tag.  The variety of tastes are excellent, but not enough for the price tag.  I suggest eating a hearty meal first, then going there to "taste" the food.  Be careful not to be taken for a ride.  And, best of luck.
