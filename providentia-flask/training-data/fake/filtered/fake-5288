Went for lunch, had amazing food but lackluster service (one staff member for the bar and all tables), but totally worth it.  Came for dinner and had food and a full on blackout tequila experience that was everything such an experience should be. Pork tacos. Steak tacos. Calamari tacos.  Can't go wrong.
