I would love to give this place 5 stars. In fact, if it was for the "heat" alone I believe it should get 5 stars. However, based on the service and ultimate substance of the meal I feel like I should only give it 3.5 stars. That of course is not an option so I am going for 4. Why you ask? Well, I have been to this marvelous joint twice so far and each time I have had the same quality of heat but also the same complaints. Each time, I had a different server but each time I also received mediocre service. When you order your options (I have had about 10 of the different options on the menu), make sure to demand A LOT of white rice on the side. If you do not demand this, you will end up having to ask multiple times for more rice. When I eat hot food, I like to have something to soak up the heat (by hot, I mean SPICY). Apparently, this is not acceptable at Han Dynasty because two different times, two different servers failed to give me more than a small bowl of rice to split among 2-10 people. Five minutes after the server walked away each time, the rice disappeared and my mouth was left burning for more. It is like giving a child cake without ice cream. From years of dining and working in retail, I have learned one thing...give the customer what they want. If they ask for rice not once, not twice, but more than three times...then give them a bigger bowl! I really love the menu and the food is outstanding but it is difficult to enjoy it without something to soak up the flavors.
