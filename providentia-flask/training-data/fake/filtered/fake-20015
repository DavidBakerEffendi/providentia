Great choice for dinner for our group of 10. Took a bit after our reservation time for our table to be ready but that's completely understood with a larger party. Ordered a bunch of dishes to be shared amongst the table. The best appetizer we had by far were the Â rock shrimp bao buns, but the salad, & edamame dumplings were strong as well. As far as entrees go, order anything involving a short rib if your a beef eater. The sea bass must have been so good, it was gone by the time it got to my side of the table. So many of the other entrees and sides were just as good. For dessert we had the fresh made dip sum doughnuts, which are outrageous, sorbet trio ( coconut, chocolate, & plum) & chocolate bento box- out of the 6 items in the bento box, there was only one that our group didn't care for, but the others more than made up for it. The service, from the front desk, to wait staff, to bussers/food runners, and management was impeccable. Wasn't slow, but yet wasn't hurried, and didn't hover. It was if they appeared and disappeared at just the right time. Staff was personable and professional, but didnt overdo it with phony politeness. Food turned up at just the right pace at breaks in the laughter. Great place for dinner w friends, and it's amazing that they're still going this strong after so many years.
