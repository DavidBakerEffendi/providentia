My boyfriend and I had the pleasure of dining here recently. We had read the rave reviews and our companies have done long time business with this restaurant so we were quite familiar with the quality of food they were purchasing. I have to say we were pleasantly surprised that Uva was as amazing a place as we were told. We had the honey and ricotta bruschette to start and it was divine, so creamy with just the right amount of sweetness. We also had the shrimp pasta and the truffle pizza ( I can't recall the exact names but they were oh so good) Unfortunately we were to full for dessert but we have definitely marked Uva as a fan favorite, Chef Claudio is definitely doing an excellent job on creating exquisite Italian cuisine.
