Terrible - waited 45 min for food then left - gave it 1 star cause I had to Came in with our kids on a slow afternoon and put in a simple order - appetizer, mac and cheese, chicken sandwich, club sandwich. We got the appetizer. Then we waited. And waited. Asked if it would be much longer. "Just a few minutes". We waited some more. Finally after 45 minutes told the waitress we couln't wait any longer, and left. At least she didn't try to charge us for the appetizer and beverages. Maybe she forgot to put our order in, or something went wrong in the kitchen, but if your table sits without food for 45 minutes, wouldn't you try to figure out what was wrong? A resturant does two things - takes the order, and serves the food. Salt Hill has to work on the second step. We'll never go back - plenty of places have figured out how to get the order to the table.
