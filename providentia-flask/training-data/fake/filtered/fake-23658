This place is a unique find in the West Village/Greenwich Village. I think the ambiance was pretty cool and cozy. We had to wait over two hours which is ridiculous for a Wednesday evening. However, they had many beers on tap and their menu changes daily. I was a little disappointed they did not have more vegetarian options. I ordered ricotta gnocchi which was superb (however, I think it was about $20 - $25 which seems steep for pasta). The wait staff was really friendly too which is a rare find in this neighborhood of NYC.
