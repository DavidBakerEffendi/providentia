Had a few beers, sat outside with my wife -- felt pressured to order food by an impatient server at a table unsuitable for more than a drink. Only cash!  And there's an ATM machine inside!  Very tacky indeed. Owner spent all this $ to fix up the place and won't except cards. Poor business plan and vision.
