It is what it is. Pizza, wings, take-out beer. That's about it. The pizza is average for a pizza joint, however the wings are really, really good. They have nice sized flat screens TV's in the place, so if you are there by yourself, you don't have to stare at a wall, or pretend to read City Paper or Philly Weekly.
