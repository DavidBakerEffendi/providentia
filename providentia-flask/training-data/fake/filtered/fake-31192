Just had a great taste of the mediterranean here! Cannot remember the names of all the dishes, but had some chicken - perfectly moist and delicious, lentils with bulgar and sauteed onions, baba ganoush, cauliflower, and an eggplant dish .... all made fresh and delicious. SAVE ROOM FOR BAKLAVA~ it is made just right- not too sweet, but sweet enough, perfectly flaky - a joy just like the meal.   Will return again- Good service and good food at reasonable prices.   Good for families as well as couples and friends.
