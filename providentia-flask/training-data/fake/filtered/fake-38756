I LOVE this little cozy, hectic, crazy, Italiano restaurant! I have only been to this restaurant once, during the winter, while visiting friends in Philly. The salmon was fantastic! We had a reservation, and yes we had to wait about 20 min after until we were seated, family style. Worth the wait! If you're looking for a private, table for two-like dinner, this is definitely not the place for you. The wait staff is super social and friendly. Our wine was flowing, as well as the bread basket, not minutes after we sat down. For the price, no corking fee, amazing cuisine, and friendly atmosphere, I give it 4 stars! Not 5 because of the small wait. ;)
