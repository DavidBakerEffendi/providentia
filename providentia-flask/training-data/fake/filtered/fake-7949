I had one of the most amazing meals of my life this week at Hot Tomato's. I and a few of my friends had the "Chef's Table." When I tell you, you cannot go wrong... Get a few folks together, make a reservation and have the chef blow your mind with what he concocts. A couple of the courses were served family style and our server was gracious in preparing our plates, even to slicing the entrees, which consisted of veal, a sirloin and a grilled pork chop. All three were wonderful and cooked to perfection. This night was deserving of five stars, I just tend not to give them.
