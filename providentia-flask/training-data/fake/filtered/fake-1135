I love this place.  I come all the time.  Burgers are the best in town.  I love the feel of the place.  Very vibrant, youthful and fun.  Has a midwestern feel in my opinion. Hipster neighborhood (in case you're not interested in partying with that type of crew), but you will see some "normal" people in there.  I'm not a hipster and I feel like I fit right in.  It's pretty diverse.  Just note that they don't really have much else to drink but beer. PS, Fries are awesome!
