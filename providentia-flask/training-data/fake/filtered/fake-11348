Celine the hostess of the section serving Vegetables was my reason to have confidence in Eataly...she was able to seat me for a late lunch and keep my 83 year old mother from getting overwhelmed by the crowds The food in this section was delicious and we wonder if eventually the opportunity to get dessert or coffee without giving up your table will become an option
