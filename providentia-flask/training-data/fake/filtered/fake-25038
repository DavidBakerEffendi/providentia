So I feel almost bad about writing this review...but then I get mad thinking about the 15 bucks I wasted on nachos that made me gag :/  I live in the neighborhood and after my roommate sung La Calacas high praises we went to dinner and grabbed margs and their famous nachos...which are awesome...or were The past two times we ordered nachos we noticed ehhh stuff was burnt, things werent fresh etc etc..but this time I actually had to write a review.  We decided to go with the brisket on the nachos and whatever meat they put on it was horrendous.  By meat I mean just gobs of white fat they must have shaved off from the carnitas that was going to something else because our whole order was just literally....fat.   Ugh terrible had to throw the whole thing out and we have decided third times the charm on the no bueno list :(
