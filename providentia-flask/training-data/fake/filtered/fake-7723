Third day of the aftermath of hurricane Sandy and this restaurant was open. I drove from Jersey City to Montclair midst all the chaos created by hurricane Sandy. The trip was worth it!!! Don't be scared by the interiors or the size of the place. If you are going for ambiance, then this is not the place for you. However, if you are going there for just FOOD, then this is the place to be.
