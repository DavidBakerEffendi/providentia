Wanted to write a review for this for so long but after I tasted their Diwali sweets yesterday, I simply had to log onto yelp. Their selection of Diwali sweets absolutely delicious. They make sweets on site and everything was so fresh. It reminded of the indian taste. The food is excellent quality as well. We have been going three ever since they opened in 2010. Management is fantastic and very accommodating. Their Saag and Chicken Tikka Masala are my family's favorite. This is the only indian place that my kids like as they can make dishes mild for their taste. Would keep going. Good work guys!
