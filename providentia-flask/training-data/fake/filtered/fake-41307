Went with a friend for lunch.  Food was mediocre at best.  Glad we decided to go for lunch rather than dinner after looking at the dinner menu online.  For those prices you could go to a real restaurant with real service and good food.  There was minimal attention by the waitress and rude service by management after bringing up a problem.  For a small business they definitely don't try hard to impress you.  I would pay more money elsewhere to get better quality food and better service.  Won't be returning, as it wasn't really worth it.
