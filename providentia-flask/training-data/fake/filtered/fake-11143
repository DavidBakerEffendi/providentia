What happened to once wonderful Eataly?  Its lost its elegance and superior products.  I brought out of towners there for a visit on Good Friday, and they wanted to leave the moment they arrived... seeing nothing but hordes of crowds and super inflated prices.  It had the ambiance of a large trade show full of tourists. Some of us stayed, thinking we could enjoy some fine wine prior to our dinner reservations in the neighborhood.  Big mistake... after using my well honed  "get a seat on the subway" strategy and skills, i was able to locate some seating at a small bar  in the piazzo area. Unfortunately, the bartender banned  us from the seat because we were just ordering 3 glasses of $20 /glass of  wine.  The rule was we must order less profitable food in order  to sit.  He suggested we take our wine and move to the entrance of eataly where people order gelato and coffee, and sit there.  Yeah right... like there would actually be one of the 20 seats available on that crowded evening. We canceld our wine order, and got the heck out of there.  And walked just 2 blocks down the street, where we went to Brio, another Italian spot full of hospitable employees.  We were welcomed with open arms, and treated to excellent service & not forced to eat just to get a seat at the bar. Nice selection of wines by the glass too. If you want a true Italian experience, go to Brio and skip the chaos at Eataly
