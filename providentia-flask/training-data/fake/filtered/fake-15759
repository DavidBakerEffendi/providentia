Dont Do It!  This place used to be great, but it's seen it's day.  The food is just "eh", and the service is poor.  A shame, as it used to be excellent in it's hay day.  Gave it 2 chances - thought maybe they were having an off day, but the 2nd try of recent was HORRIBLE.  Manager is rude too.  There are so many great Italian places, why settle for lousy food/service and pay top dollar (prices have really climbed too).  We should have gone next door to Savin Rock Roasters!
