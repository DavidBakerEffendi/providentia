Came here for the first time a few weeks ago and I feel deprived. I feel deprived that I have spent all these years going to some mediocre diners when I could of been coming here. If you are looking for some great diner food then this is it. pancakes were nice and fluffy, not heavy. It seems like everyone here is ordering some type of pancakes. This place was also very crowded when I had arrived. I've seen been back a few times.
