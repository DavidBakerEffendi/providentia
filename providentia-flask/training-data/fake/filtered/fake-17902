While the food was great in taste and proportion - and I suppose that's what everyone is evaluating the restuarant for - I was very disappointed with the service, additionally with all the top ratings one would think that the 2nd hand help-whom they readily take full advantage of as the servers themselves do nothing but take orders and maybe come by and ask how food is- would be better versed in how to take away plates and the timing of same... seemed more like a cafeteria type setting actually with no ebb and flow at all.  I"ve been to many an Italian Restaurant and I don't see how this is so unique.  Again, food fabulous, but short of a well rounded experience. Disappointing.
