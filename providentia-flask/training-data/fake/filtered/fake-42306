If you were walking by 46 eldridge st. You would do just that walk by. This hole in the wall walk up joint has a limited menu and a hectic pace. I was showing two friends around New York and I had found this place and marked it on google. For $7 we were all three full and we agreed it may have been one of the best tasting meals we had. We had the fried Pork and Green onion dumplings and we shared a slice of the fryed sesame bread. If I lived in New York I would take the subway here at least once a week.
