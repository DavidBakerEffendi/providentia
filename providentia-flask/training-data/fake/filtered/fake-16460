After being a fateful Yelp user for years, I finally decided to create an account just so I could warn people how bad this restaurant is. I've been so grateful to have honest reviews and accounts from others, thought I would finally get involved! (I promise to start writing positive reviews as well at the many area establishments I genuinely enjoy!) As for the Republic... I went there on NYE with a small group of friends. Despite being told on the phone that the normal menu would be available in addition to a special prix fixe menu, when we arrived we discovered we could only order from the prix fixe items. There were no meatless options on the menu (so the two non-meat eaters were SORELY out of luck). The waitress made no effort to help the situation and offered no real solution to the problem. She made it clear we were being a pain for asking if there were any alternative options. For $40, one was supposed to receive a starter, an entree and a desert. For the two who didn't order the meat dishes, that meant $40 for a few small potatoes. Literally. Again, the server made no effort to credit the bill or anything a more experienced server would have done. Even a simple request from someone to have the salad dressing on the side was rebuffed. For those who ate the full meal, no one had a nice thing to say about their meal. I can honestly say, it was one of my worst dinners of 2012. Would never go back.
