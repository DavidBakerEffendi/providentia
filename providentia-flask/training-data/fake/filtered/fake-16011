I came here on my birthday and was expecting to just be in a place that feels like I'm back home in Ukraine. The food was not that well made with little attention to the details of Russian/Ukranian cuisine. The borscht was terrible and the main entree which was chicken ragout was absolutely disgusting I couldn't even believe the chicken tasted like its off and I was very disappointed with the whole experience.
