This is my first ever review.  I was compelled to write because of the exceptional attitude of the service we receive.  Doing a good job is not hard, but how you deal with a situation when something goes wrong really shows who you are.  There were two of us, ordering sandwiches #22 & #23, one with a roll and one with a wrap.  When they arrived, I must have made a little noise due to my disappointment that the wrong bread went on my sandwich.  I'm not one to complain, and would have eaten it as is, but our waitress said, "What's wrong, tell me."  She whisked our sandwiches away immediately to correct the situation.  She brought our sandwiches back with a smile, and let me tell you, not only was the service exceptional, those sandwiches and fries were DELICIOUS!
