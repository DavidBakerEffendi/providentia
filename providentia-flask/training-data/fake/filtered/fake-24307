I live around the corner from Ngam, and I've been a frequent customer since they opened several months ago. I have probably visited upwards of 20 times, and I have yet to be disappointed. The food is AMAZING and reasonably priced. While many of the dishes they serve are traditionally Thai, there is almost a southern comfort spin on each of them. The papaya pad Thai might be my favorite dish. However, I've also enjoyed their oysters, spring rolls, chicken wings, Chiang-Mai Fries, Thai corn chowder, beet ravioli, the branzino, and the brussels sprouts with bacon (to die for!).  Last night, we didn't receive the spring rolls we ordered (the first time this has happened to me), and Chef Hong treated my friend and I to the brownie with homemade ice cream. It was UNBELIEVABLE. My friend referred to it as "The best brownie I've ever had."   The waitstaff is always friendly, and Chef Hong is very engaging and personable. I love this place!
