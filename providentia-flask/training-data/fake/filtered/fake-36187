I'm actually surprised there wasn't more low ratings for this restaurant. Both the service and food was terrible. The minute my friends and I walked through the door, we were met with hostility. The host immediately told us that the table was on reserve and that we could dine but we'd have to leave by 8pm. That should have been a warning to leave immediately. But we stayed despite that. From that point on, they continuously messed up our orders with another table and kept giving us adjunct looks of disapproval. I lost count of the amount of times our table was ignored in favor of the other guests. And the food? Horrible. Most people at my table ordered the lamb platter and the meat was incredibly dry and stale. It was clear that they simply recooked refrigerated meat they had laying around and just caked it with more seasonings. My one friend got curry and his curry was possibly the only good meal at the table. I suspect it was also the only meal freshly made as well. Overall this is possibly the worst restaurant in the area. However, if you want to get food poisoning and experience extreme hostility than this place is for you.
