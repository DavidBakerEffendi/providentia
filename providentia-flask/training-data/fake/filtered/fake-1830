We have been eating at Iron Chef for over 7 years! Always stellar sushi. I give four stars due to the often slow service as well as long door wait times. Often when arriving there is a crowd in the very narrow doorway and no one at the host table to greet or take names and give a wait time. The fish is always fresh and the portions are large. My favorites here are the triple spicy combo, crazy couple and sweet potato rolls. The salad ginger dressing is one of my favs as well. Since it's a very small place it can get crowded on peak weekend dinner times. We will often order togo or delivery and get the sushi quicker than had we waited for a table:) Due to how small it is, it also makes a great romantic date spot.
