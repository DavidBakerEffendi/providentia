I felt disappointment over last night's dinner at the Canoe Club (brought a visitor and several colleagues. I have doubts that I will return (except to the bar, for drinks) unless absolutely pressed. In our group, there were reports that the pasta was bland and the mussels not tasty. The purees drizzled upon the beet salad were too much -- I am an adventurous eater, but there is a difference between adventure and excess for excess' sake. The  honey - type drizzle had a crystallzed consistency and was unduly chunky (note this was not the crystallized ginger, a nice touch to an otherwise overly-produced dish that frankly tastes better without so much trapping). The only item on the menu that is vegetarian is the Risotto. This was not only mediocre in taste, but the vegetables within the dish (a butternut squash, I believe) were, I kid you not, hard as rocks. Completely undercooked. More attention was paid to the soup (a delicious lentil). The desserts went over well, I will say, and the marshmallow on the smores was quite great. I'm very surprised that the overall meal quality, however, was as mediocre as it was-- especially given the price. The risotto in question was at least $15 if not $20.00.  In some cases, the food was downright inedible. I hope they attend to these issues ( I am a local, and have contacted the management). The restaurant might also consider offering more vegetarian entrees that are cooked at least somewhat thoroughly. Someone on staff should be assigned to tasting the dishes occasionally to make sure the blend of flavors remains interesting yet edible.
