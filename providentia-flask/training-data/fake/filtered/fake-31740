We have been frequenting the Spice Grill for long time, and order take out frequently as well, however last night 07/25/14 was our last visit. Up until last night service was great, everyone was very professional, but last night It all changed . I ordered Chicken Tikka Masala. When the dish arrived the only "chicken" in the dish were scraps of the thigh bone with a little brown meat around the bone. Not a piece of white meat in sight. When I pointed this out to our waiter and asked for a dish with white meat, he said yes of course and off he went. He came back to our table and asked if I wanted the first dish wrapped to go as I had ordered another meal. I said no, I have no intention of paying for two meals, in the past this dish has always been white meat...his response " you have to special order white meat it says so in the menu" When I looked at the menu it does say on the last page special orders can be accommodated, but no where does it say dishes come with dark meat unless you expressly ask for white meat. I then asked to speak to the manager. Our waiter came back and said we won't charge you for the first meal and brought me another meal, but the manager never once came to our table. The waiter was incredibly rude and disrespectful, it was a really nasty experience. On past visits the manager/owner or his wife would often stop by and it was a lovely experience with great food. Not sure what is going on there but the regular manager/owner nor his wife were in attendance. Â  So If you do go to Spice Grill, make sure you ask for white meat in your chicken dishes or they will serve you the scraps!
