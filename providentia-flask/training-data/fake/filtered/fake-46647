Beyoglu was pretty busy the night we went so I had high hopes.  However, the service and my dish were very under par.  We were a party of 5 for a birthday dinner.  We shared some appetizers....and then waited...and waited...and waited.  Our waiter did not come by to ask if we wanted another drink or to apologize for the delay in getting our entrees.  When I politely asked him as he was zooming by us if we would be getting our meals soon, he looked perplexed...and then proceeded to blame the dish I ordered (the shrimp casserole) for the delay...saying it takes awhile to make the casserole.  I'm sure I then looked perplexed because I've never heard of such a thing - it wasn't anything more than shrimp and veggies and cheese.  Very odd.  Then we waited some more and they brought our food.  When he served my dish, he again said the casserole was the reason everything was delayed.  (I couldn't believe it - as if it was my "the customers" fault.)  And to top it off the shrimp casserole wasn't even good...the shrimp were tough and they had tails on them still (which seemed odd cutting into a casserole and coming up with a tail shell, no?)   It was so obvious to all of us that the waiter made the "casserole delay" up as an excuse (and a ridiculous one at that)....he could've just said the kitchen was backed up, my apologies.   I live in NYC and have eaten at so many restaurants and this by far is one of the worst I've experienced service-wise, I'm sorry to say.  I will not be returning and would never recommend this place.  Be forewarned.
