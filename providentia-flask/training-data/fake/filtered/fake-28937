I really like coming here.  On my last visit, the staff was friendly, attentive, and made knowledgeable recommendations for food and wine.  I thought my entree and glass of wine were very fairly priced.  I could nitpick about their bread (fresh and warm, but not necessarily exciting), but this was offset by a wonderful olive plate. BM&TB is also easily accessible from New Haven, has plenty of parking, and seems to suitable for groups large and small.
