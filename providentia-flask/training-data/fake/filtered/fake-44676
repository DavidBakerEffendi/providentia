i live 3 blocks away and i rather to go to Lava then any of the other coffee shops around, i love the food the coffee and i think the stuff is great. i fell like home there and the owners allways try to give their 100%, even when they r busy. lava is more then a coffee shop , it;s a community , i remember how that block looked before lava opened. i think u guys are great .
