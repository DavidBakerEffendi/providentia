osteria is one of the best restaurants to open in our area in years...to read the one negative review, obviously, is to read something written by someone witrh an agenda. BURNT PIZZA is NOT a carcinogen...thats for steaks and meats fyi. them pizzas are small, they are brick oven..however they are THE BEST. the food is not cheap, and the quality is self evident, so..if you are cheap, or dont like a small , intimate setting that hustles and bustles because its so popular..you should avoid this restaurant..however, of you like quality, taste, and just damn good food, osteria procaccini is the place to go....period
