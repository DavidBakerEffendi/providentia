The Very Best Pizza in Brooklyn, Slices are expensive @$5plus, i suggest that getting a pie is the best idea.. The artichoke or plain is my favorite, I usually get a half artichoke, half plain. This is a local place that has gone global, people come from all over to get a pie here. The only line is the pie order list, everyone just hangs around the counter or at a table salivating over the pies that come out before their own, while waiting for their order. The dining area is a little grimy sometimes,The old guy behind the counter, Dominick the pizza artist is usually covered hand to elbow in flour. he uses three kinds of cheese (ie. buffalo mozzarella, my favorite.) The pizza comes out on the burnt side most times, that is how it is meant to be. Dominick's adult children take the orders and re-supply him, Dominick is the only one making the pizzas and he is a man-machine, making pies non-stop, even though you'll probably wait about an hour for your pie, as he skillfully designs each one, it's worth the wait. If your looking for a pizzeria to run in a grab a slice, this is not the place for you. It is good food, not fast food. i can go on on about this place, but the best thing to do is to try it yourself and do yourself a favor bring 1-2 friends or family members along and split a pie with them. It will be a memorable experience for all you 'Living in a State of Di Fara Deprivation'.
