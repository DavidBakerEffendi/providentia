I LOVE TEQUILAS!!!  I have been several times and it never disappoints.  The food is absolutely delicious and the drinks are great too.  My personal favorite is the carne aquacate while my boyfriend never strays from ordering the filete grito.  The ambiance is great and the staff is awesome.  Good for a date night or with a group of friends.  Tequilas is definitely my favorite restaurant in Philly.
