The food was amazing. We came for brunch and shared the Banana Blueberry Pancakes and the Brickyard Benedict with Lump Meat Crab. I was initially disappointed because the crab was mixed in with the spinach, but it was plentiful and so delicious! Every bite was better than the previous. Really was one of the best meals we've had in a long time. And the drink selection is great too.
