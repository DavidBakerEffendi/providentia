My friends and I were wandering around Williamsburg one night around dinner time.  I yelped the neighborhood and we decided on Mogador because of the great reviews and it really truly lived up to the stars ratings.   The group ordered the Mixed Platter for appetizer and there was nothing left.  We actually ordered more bread so we could lick up every last bit of sauce.  If you're a sweet and savory diner, like me, go for the Lamb Tagine with the apricot and prunes but I tried a bit of my friend's Casablanca and it was also tasty.  The service was pleasant and helpful, the atmosphere was really cool - I felt like I was in a greenhouse, and the food? absolutely delicious.   Maybe I'm a bit biased because I L-O-V-E Mediterranean food since I basically lived in my best friend's Egyptian house... Or maybe the food just simply lived up to my biased palate!  Take it either way, just go.
