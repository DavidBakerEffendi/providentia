If you can deal with the walk-in only, wait for nearly 30 min guarantee, it will be well worth the wait.  The spicy raman is incredible.  They do go long on the broth and a bit short on the noodles and meat so order your dishes with extra noodles and meat to soak up the broth.  It's great for lunch and the best "east village" option you will find in midtown.  It's a hole in the wall spot, which is what makes it so charming.  Enjoy!
