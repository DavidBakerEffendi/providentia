The best.  Good food, comfortable atmosphere.  Owned and run by a couple who are always there - no slacking off by the staff when the owner is gone.  We, the family, used to take my father-in-law who was in a wheelchair and they were considerate about arraigning things for him to be comfortable (not always the case in other places).  At 97, his favorite was the meat lovers pizza.
