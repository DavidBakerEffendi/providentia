A really cute restaurant just off the hipster trail in Williamsburg. The food is consistently good, both for dinner and for brunch. Try the Uruguayan wine. Best parts about brunch are that it isn't super crowded and they have great specials. The windows are kept open wide and there's a backyard, so it's perfect for summer.
