Everything from the train ride out there from manhattan, to the truly old school bathroom, to the date cake was worth it. My girl and I went out there after a late Saturday night for brunch and the food didn't disappoint. I had the house eggs with a creamy tomato sauce, she had the house baked eggs, we also split a panini (we're both thin, but figured if we're going out there on a 30min train ride, we're going to sample everything that looks good). The only reason I wouldn't give this 5 stars is that the wait was longer than I'm used to in restaurants with this good of food; I think they only had two waitresses for the place on a Sunday afternoon, come on!
