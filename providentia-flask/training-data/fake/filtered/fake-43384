I have been here a few times and had great experiences. The food is fresh and always tasty. The atmosphere is typical of the young, urban, green folk in this neighborhood, so its eclectic. Although the red head who works there was extremely rude when I was there for a business lunch and very snappy toward me at the register...I guess her Toms were a bit too snug today... I hope the customer service improves because there are far too many places to go in this neighborhood to deal with bad attitudes.
