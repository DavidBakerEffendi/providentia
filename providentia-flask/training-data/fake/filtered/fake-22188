Been there three times now! The food has been great and their shakes are out of this world! Tried their Bison Burger and a peanut butter chocolate shake today! Yummy!! They have a wide menu and everything is very fresh! My only issue with the place is that I wish it were bigger!! Its usually crowded so you have a bit of a wait but I think its worth it!
