Went on a quiet Monday night. First time, overwhelmed by the menu since it's loaded with insanely tempting dishes. Did a bruschetta, risotto, carbonara, filet. Ate every last bit. It was timed perfectly as we finished each plate. But what really made the experience the best was how attentive the service was. Our server, Shamyl (I hope I spelled that right) was extremely welcoming and helpful, but also not over zealous. And even when she was busy, the manager was always present and made sure to come over and ask us how everything was. By far my favorite tapas spot. Disregard all the negative reviews... those people are just miserable with life and feel better about themselves to put the place down. :)
