First for all of the negative comments written comparing this to Prime 16, they're different restaurant one doesn't have to be better than the other they can both be great. I have been to Plan B now 3 times and each time it gets better and better.     There were a lot of growing pains when they first opened as far service, and waiting for a table. The service has improved considerably but it is still a bit of a wait for a table most times, I guess that speaks enough about how good the food is, and the word of mouth reviews that this restaurant has received. The beer is fantastic and always changing, each time I go the selection has changed but is always fantastic. I have only ever eaten burgers here but they are fantastic. The beef is natural, grass fed, chemical free,  and ground fresh daily. It has ruined burgers that i used to enjoy at other restaurants because I did not know what a burger truly could be until I ate here. I suggest everyone go once and try it for yourself
