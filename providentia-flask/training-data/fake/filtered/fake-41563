Visiting New York from California; fairly a foodie myself and a BIG fan of seafood we stumbled upon FISH. Within walking distance from the Maritime Hotel on the trendy and quant Bleecker St we decided to dine @ Fish. No reservation and at prime service time we had little wait for a party of 2. The space is a bit loud, crowded and overwhelming at first......not in a bad way, in the way where you want EVERYTHING on the menu. Needless to say we ordered everything from raw oysters, crab legs and paella. The food was fresh and full of flavor, staff was great as were fellow diners. Seating is close to say the least so you can embrace it as we did, sharing a bit of our main course with our neighboring table and great conversation with the other beside us! It is safe to say in the remainder of our 4 days here in NYC we WILL be headed to FISH again.......but this time for their all you can eat Maryland Blue Crab for 20 bucks per person! For sure a MUST when visiting NYC!
