So I used to frequent this place a ton, but recently I've gotten bad vibes from the owner guy and the staff. For example, I asked if it was possible to pay for a BLT at 10:30 AM, but they insisted that lunch items only start at 11. So I asked them to sub eggs and cheese out of the breakfast sandwich and put in lettuce and tomatoes, but they insisted that they could not serve out any lunch related items without remorse. Also, another time, my bill came up to 4.87 and they would not let me use my credit card because of a five dollar minimum. I love the location but after the rude service and small portions, I might stop frequenting august first a bit less for sure.
