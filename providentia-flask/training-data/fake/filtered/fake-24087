I can honestly agree with the last review that was posted up a few mintues ago. I as well go there for lunch or for happy hour with my co-workers. The food is great  when the young kid is working, the bartenders are friendly and outgoing. I must say i went  there on a weekend and order a  medium rare cheeseburger and came out exra well done. Talk about hard as a rock...  I would not go there to eat on a weekend. Durning the week the food is great. Weekends are horrible they should have the same cook on the weekends. The only good thing that night was the drinks..
