From the moment you walk up and smell the smoke, you know you are in for something good. Have had BBQ all over the country, all styles, sauces and rubs. This BBQ is easily some of the best. Between the tenderness of the brisket, the bark on the ribs, the delicious baked beans and sides, Lawrence and his crew are delivering a taste experience that is truly satisfying and very uncommon. We also sampled their smoked chicken wings, which are amazingly flavorful, a must try for wing lovers. Â Everything we had was really great and the portions are generous. Aside from the food, Lawrence is super friendly and attentive to his customers needs. The Wood Pit is a great place in all ways! Can't wait to go back, wish we lived closer.
