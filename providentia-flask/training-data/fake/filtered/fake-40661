I brought friends here that had arrived from Newport RI. I had been living in NYC for over 5 years then and had never checked out this famous pizzeria, The seating arrangements are great, they have a true italian feel and the decor is family oriented and very pleasant, but i mut say the pizza itself was nothing to rave about. Would certainly recommend checking it out, however would not make this a constant stop on my schedule.
