I feel the minimum you should tip is 10 pct, for bad service.  If its really bad service maybe talk to a manager.  20 cents is sort of disrespectful.  BUT having come here 1x, with my girlfriend, i have to say it was top 5 worst service i have ever received.  The burger was not good at all.  My medium rare burger must of been pressed down while it was being cooked.  It caused all the juices to seep out.  Very dry bland burger.  Totally sloppy.  Waiter was not rude, but also treated us like he had better things to do.  Rolled his eyes at me, when I didnt get my drink which i ordered.  Maybe he didnt hear me ask for a drink, but rolling your eyes?  It left a bad taste in my mouth, and so did the Burger.
