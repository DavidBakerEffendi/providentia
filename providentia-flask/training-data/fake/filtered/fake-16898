I have been to ABC Kitchen three times and each of them have been wonderful.  I love the mis-matched flatware and plates, the simple small vase and delicate flowers, and the large round "tree stump" tables. If you're not in the mood to drink alcohol, I love that they offer organic avenue fresh vegetable and fruit juices.   The food: Clean cooking focused on the intricate flavor pairings.  The servers are well trained to know what's in the dishes and what order to have things come out.  The last time I was there, I had fiddleheads, roasted beets with homemade yogurt dressing, and suckling pig.  Everything was delish.
