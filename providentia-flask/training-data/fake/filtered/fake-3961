It's not too often that I will go to the same restaurant twice, but on our recent trip to New York, I discovered Juventino's. We sat outside in their lovely garden and had a lovely brunch. Their menu is very interesting and had a lot of options which I could actually eat, which is not often the case for brunch since I like to be gluten free. I enjoyed the food so much, especially the salad my husband ordered, so when I was looking for somewhere to go two days later with a friend, we went back there and I ordered the same salad and though it was prepared differently, it was still delicious.
