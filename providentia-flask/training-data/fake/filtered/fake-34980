Whatever happened to customer service!  First walking in the hostess was talking to another staff member and did not even acknowledge customers walking in...no hello, can I help you...so we decided to go to the bar.  Found 3 seats at the end of the bar which had a weird "L" shape at the end.  Drink menu too "out" there.  Ordered drinks to which the bartender seemed like he was doing us a favor!  No napkin under drink.. bartender actually pushed the drinks in front of us....very, very poor....felt like I was at Applebee's or TGI Fridays.  For the price of the drinks, at the very least we could have received a hello!  Two more of our friends came in the bar to meet us and had a hard time getting the bartender's attention so our friends could get some drinks. The bar was not that busy....and the bartender could not handle it.   The bartender totally made the experience bad....previous Lahiere's, which we have gone to many, many times, the bartender Chris Canavari was always cordial, courteous and knew how to make a drink!    Bring in Chris for great customer service!!!          The 5 of us walked out after our drinks and went to another "grill" down the street.  Why stay for dinner after that!
