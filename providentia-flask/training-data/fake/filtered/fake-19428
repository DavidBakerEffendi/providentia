This place is great!!!!! I left there happy, full and with money in my pocket. We ate some really good food and had a good time. The staff was really friendly and made sure we were happy the whole time. Everyone we felt with was extremely nice. The food was awesome and inexpensive. The only thing I didn't like was that they didn't serve alcohol. My 3 year old loved the people there too and didn't want to leave so that's always a good sign.
