Just like Tom S. said, the outside never would have lured me in. I got out of my car, called my friend, Mike DiAngelo, and asked him what the name of that great restaurant at the Italian Market is. The food was as good as it gets; ravioli pasta was made this morning; meatballs and gravy were amazing. The waitress was a bulldog who treated patrons like we walked into her house and interrupted her. All other staff seemed to be compensating for her personality. A 4 oz iced tea was $2 and I paid for the refill...and they wonder why everyone's ordering water with lemon these days. The iced tea (which, by the way cost them about 2 cents a glass) was very, very good tea...perfect. I highly recommend it.
