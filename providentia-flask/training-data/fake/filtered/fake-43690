I just visited NYC for the first time, I live in Austin TX. I went to quite a few restaurants and this one was the bestttttt. There was a 45min-1hr wait, which is quite a while, however the amazing hostess said she would text me when the table was ready. What? thats awesome! haha. so we went to a bar to get a beer and the wait went by quickly and I received the text and we went back to the restaurant and were seated. The atmosphere here is just so great. Its busy but still intimate. I had a burger and fries which was amazing. We also shared some oysters which were fantastic. Next time I go to NY this place will be #1 on my list to go back to.
