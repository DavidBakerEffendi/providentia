LOVE THIS PLACE. I was introduced by some friends of ours and I'm so glad we went. The food is amazing and so is the environment. They also do nice little birthday stuff. The seafood pot is delicious as well as all the meats. I've never had any issues at this place. I recommend it to everyone. This is something you have to have an empty stomach for and at least 3-4 people. Its a lot of food.
