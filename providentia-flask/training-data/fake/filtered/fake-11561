I just had my wedding here Saturday August 2, 2013 and it was Absolutely AMAZING!!!! People are constantly messaging me and telling me that it was one of the best weddings they've been to in years if not the best one in their lives. Service was beyond exceptional and I could not have asked for a more Beautiful Wonderful Perfect wedding. Thank you for everything and making my wedding truly a fairytale  Steve Goodman was the absolute BEST to work with; he was literally my life saver and helped me keep my (and my now husbands) sanity. If it wasn't for him I would have gone completely out of my mind, but he made sure EVERY little detail was exactly what I wanted and he got back to me always within 24 hours if not sooner.  But I can't end without saying that the whole entire staff was also absolutely phenomenal! I would recommend everyone there for ANY event!!!!
