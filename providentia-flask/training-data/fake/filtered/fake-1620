I've been going to Massimo's for years for their decent food and relaxed atmosphere. However, the other day the guy at the register basically asked me for a tip, and that just ruins it for me. This happened at the point of putting in my order at the counter, before I had received any kind of service. At first I didn't even understand what he meant when he said I "had to fill out the top portion" of the credit card receipt "for his records." When I caught on, I asked him "you mean the tip?" and he, rather testily, said yes I had to fill it out for his records and if I didn't want to tip I could also just draw a line. In my mind, he created a situation that was designed to make me uncomfortable enough to tip him. I don't mind tipping, but I generally like to receive service before I do, and I don't think a tip should ever be demanded. That just takes the cake. I won't be going there anymore.
