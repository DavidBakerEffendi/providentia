This is my first taking having ramen from a restaurant. I have tried many different types of instant noodles. I love them though they aren't good for you. I thought the food here was great. I got Karai and it was perfectly spicy with a kick, but not too spicy. This makes for a very filling and affordable dinner. You order at the counter, pick up the food when your name is called and you put your dishes away when you are done. No tip required!
