Not sure where my original review went, but lets try this again. We booked a reservation for this restaurant for a special occasion (birthday celebration). When we arrived at the restaurant on time, we were told to wait. We got seated about 20-30 minutes later. Things went downhill quickly after that. Although we were seated before the table next to us, the waiter took the other table's orders first. He took about 10 minutes taking the other table's orders. Then he went to another table. When he finally came to us, the attitude was very unprofessional, giving one word answers to our questions about the menu. Our appetizer was not brought to us for at least an hour. When we finally got our dinner, the next table had already completed their meal and left. The waiter was still bantering with the other diners. The worst part was that the meat was way over-cooked when it was brought to me. It was really not edible. Yecch. We finally have had enough and told the waiter to wrap up our other dishes because we had all we can take. His response was that "we have others to wrap dinners" and just walked away. Given the very expensive dinner (the horrendous ala carte meat dish was $30), the very poor food and the atrocious service, I would recommend diners to go elsewhere. You get better food (and much better service) at Wendy's!!!
