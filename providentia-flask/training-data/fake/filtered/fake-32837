Just went to dinner there last night and was very dissapointed in the food.  Although the portions were more than generous, we found the food to be overly salty.  But the part that was most disapointing was the "free apps" the waiter pushed on us.  We were first offered some special cheese and declined.  Upon them offering us the home-made bread with sausage, we felt rude declining again and decided to taste it as the waiter plopped it on our table.  At the end of our meal we saw the $4.00 charge on our bill.  Since when is bread $4.00?!? specially since we didn't even order it.  This definitely made us decide not to go back here again.  There is a great variety of restaurants in Newark to pick from, than to go back here again.
