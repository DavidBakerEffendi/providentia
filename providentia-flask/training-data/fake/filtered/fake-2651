OMG... I am in love with Kobeyaki... it's my new favorite restaurant.... prices are reasonable... portions are generous.... tuna tataki salad is amazing... kobe burger is out of control delish... spicy tuna roll, california roll & shrimp tempura roll have a few unique twists and are incredible.  Next time I go, I'm going to try the soft shell crab bun.  It's clean & has a cool atmosphere.  Even my very, very picky 7 year old loved it.  And the cinnamon buns for dessert were a perfect way to end a perfect meal.
