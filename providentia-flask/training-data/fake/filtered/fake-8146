The Smith is a great restaurant which I highly recommend. Also a cool place for a large groups. Starters included hot potato chips with blue cheese fondue, jumbo shrimp cocktail, and white clam pizza. All very delicious. For my entree I had the Smith Bar Steak with side salad, medium well, cooked perfectly and very savory. I had an agave mint lemonade to drink which was also very good. The waitress was very courteous and the service was very timely. There's absolutely nothing bad I can say about my experience. This place is awesome and I plan on returning.
