This restaurant/bar was recommended by a colleague - and it certainly didn't disappoint. An inviting and charming neighbourhood place, extensive wine list and bar options, varied menu and served by friendly and helpful staff (including the owner). Food was tasty. My only criticisms - there are always criticisms - might be the relatively high noise level, and the tables are fairly small and occasionally was a challenge to find room for plates and glasses. Camembert was good. It was just so yummy. Also a wine bar, we will seek it out next time we are in that city. Prices? I can't tell...I was invited, so didn't pay much attention to them.
