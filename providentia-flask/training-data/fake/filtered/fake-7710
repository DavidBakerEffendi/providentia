Was in Philly last night and stopped by this place.  All I can say is WOW!  The place is amazing.  Some of the best pizza I've ever had.  Fresh ingredients, great sauce.  Ridiculously good.  All the food I saw coming out of the ovens looked like a picture in a food magazine and I'm sure tasted fantastic!  I highly recommend Zavino.
