I made the trek from Manhattan to put the pizza to the test. Apparently the dirt was piled too high and the Board of Health shuttered it up tight. Someone walking by in the neighborhood told me he's been closed for many weeks. She also mentioned it was about time they slapped some violations on that rat infested hole. According to her tale, she stopped eating there 10 years ago when she got the cockroach slice. I give him one star for not opening back up in time for my journey.
