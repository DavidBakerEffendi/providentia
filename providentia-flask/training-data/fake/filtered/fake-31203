I started going to Wafa's a couple weeks after it opened and have made sure to go there once or twice a week since. The food is relatively inexpensive ($5-8 per sandwich), healthy, and good. I would rate her falafel among the best I've had. The design is different then most as well. Instead of cramming a small pita to the near breaking point, she stuffs a large pita about half way and then wraps the rest of the pita around the sandwich to increase its sturdiness, which also make it much easier to eat. The area doesn't have many Mediterranean/Middle Eastern places, let alone one with a comfortable atmosphere. The inside has a hand painted and textured Â mural of a Lebanese seascape, while the rest of the restaurant is painted in peaceful, mellow colors. There are two cafe tables with two chair each and a bar along the window with another four chairs. They were successfully able to transform the space into a comfortable, cafe-esque environment enjoyable for longer stays and pleasant for pick-up and go. Wafa, herself, is the cook and all cooking and preparation is done in front of you -- something that I greatly prefer to a back kitchen. Also, everything in the restaurant, including deserts, is made by her, which I find to be a precious rarity these days. The service is super friendly and kind and yet another bright point the restaurant has to offer.
