Horrible experience all around. I can't decide which was worse: the food, the drinks or the service. Met a friend at the bar and as soon as I sat down, the bartender threw a menu at me and walked away. That dude set the tone for the evening. He begrudgingly dealt with us all night, snarling in our direction whenever we needed something. I made the mistake of ordering the red sangria. Meh! Way too much orange and awfully sweet. You'd do much better sticking with the wine list. For tapas we ordered the brussel sprouts, empanadas, steak tartare, bacon-wrapped figs and pork belly. The figs and empanadas came out two seconds after we ordered them and appeared to have been pre-cooked and sitting around all night. The brussel sprouts were decent, but can you really mess up brussel sprouts? I enjoyed the steak tartare, but the pork belly was an overcooked mess. Spongy, tough and just all-around nasty. So disappointing. To add insult to injury, when we asked for our check, the bartender (that lovely fellow who threw the menus at us) tossed it in our face and walked away. My advice, don't waste your money at this place. Walk a little further west and enjoy an evening at Tia Pol instead.
