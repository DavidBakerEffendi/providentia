I just can't say enough about this new bistro--the atmosphere is fantastic, and the owner Jason is always willing to go the extra mile to make us feel comfortable. Â Joe, the head chef, is incredibly creative and has a new menu of locally sourced fresh meat and produce every day. My friends and I especially enjoy eating their great vegetarian tarts outside on the patio on a beautiful spring day.
