In sum: overpriced, unimaginative, badly-prepared food.  I came here with a party of four for a birthday dinner.  The steak, ordered medium rare, arrived very well done and had to be sent back.  The gnocchi with duck was so gamey, I was worried the meat had gone bad (and for the record, I like duck) and the gnocchi was like chewing on elmers glue. We secretly had cupcakes delivered for the birthday girl ahead of time, with specific instructions to deliver them at the end of the meal. The first words out of the waitress's mouth were "so whose birthday is it?" When we all stared at her, horrified she was ruining the surprise, she then doubled down saying, "oh, do I have the wrong table? I was told the cupcakes had been brought for you guys."  So much for a surprise. And the service just went downhill from there - no water glass was every filled except when we asked, no wine was ever brought unless we begged. At this end of the market, just unacceptable.
