I had gone here this morning. I had a party of 8 and made reservations for 11:00. Got there right at 11:00 and were not seated till about 11:30. Finally we got seated and service was pretty swell. The waitress brought everything requested, although she could of been in a better mood. The food was alright. I personally work in a dinner as a waitress in a local suburb and preferred the eggs Benedict at my work. I got my eggs benedict and there was hardly any hollandaise and not to mention it came out luke warm. I asked for extra hollandaise and it was like paste and cold. I almost thought it was honey mustard dressing. For a 10$ breakfast dish I expected a little better. The pastries are really good however and so are the pancakes. I really enjoyed the coffee, the waitress kept filling it up. The best part of anything I had was the wheat toast. I never had better toast in my life. It was homemade from a fresh local bakery. I even went to the bakery and picked up a loaf for $5. Over all it wasn't bad, just don't think the eggs benedict is there fortay.
