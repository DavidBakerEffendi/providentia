I'll start with the positive. I really like the cozy decor of the place. Everyone working there was VERY nice and welcoming. The food was good and filling, and affordable. My boyfriend and I both got food and smoothies, and the bill only came to $30. Why I can only give it 3 stars: I had the BBQ Turkey Wrap, which was good, but I was not blown away. The menu description said it included roasted peppers, yet there were no peppers to be found in my wrap. My boyfriend got the same thing, but the advertised "sauteed onions" were raw. The waitress got my smoothie order wrong, which i don't understand because it was only 2 ingredients. I said mango and strawberry, and for some reason she decided to add banana, which I did not ask for. She apologized and made a new one correctly, and it was mediocre at best. I can get better smoothies at my local North Philly donut shop.
