Everybody talks about Mamoun's.  I tried it, but must be frank; it was not all that.  Sorry.  The place is really tiny and at lunch time it is difficult to get in and out.  Standing room only.  Never enough napkins.  Three stars because it is decent food at a decent price.  I've actually had better off a cart.
