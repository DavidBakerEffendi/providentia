Ok who doesn't like french fries? Especially hot crispy ones served in cones with a huge list of dipping sauce choices? This girl loves them and hence each time I'm in NYC I must stop in for lunch (yes I have french fries for lunch) at Pommes Frites. My favorite choices for sauces: Garlic Mayo (hey don't knock it till you try it...I used to think the combo of mayo and fries was gross but now I love it!), Sweet Chili (I actually got the brand name and buy it for home use now...so good!), cheddar cheese, pesto mayo and ketchup (hey what can I say, I'm a purist). The space is quite small, but you can usually find at least wall seating (which is quite literally a bar/shelf facing a wall with chairs) or space at the booth in the back. (Most people I've seen get their fries to go). The portions are quite large - my husband and I split an order and we are definitely good to go. Always a must when we are in the city!
