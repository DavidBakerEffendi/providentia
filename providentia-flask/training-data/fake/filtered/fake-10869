First time every having Crabs, Lobster & Crawfish (all seafood were fresh) Cajun style - love it!!!   The garlic and spices in the food was delicious!!!  The raw oysters tasted fresh, the oyster sliders are awesome  (crunchy and tasty - yummy).   Price is very reasonable... The server was friendly and always checked in to ensure that our visit was enjoyable - thumbs up to that!!  Overall - food and service was great!  Will definitely come back again soon.
