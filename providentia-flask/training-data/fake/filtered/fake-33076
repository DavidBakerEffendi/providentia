I had always had a great bagel here...On my last visit, a Saturday Morning, I had the freshest, tastiest, bagel I have ever had. Fresh out of the oven it was so warm, and soft, and OMG I got my usual, bacon and egg on the bagel and it was pretty great as well. Thick cut bacon, and plenty of it! AHHHH I am so hungry now! Eat here!
