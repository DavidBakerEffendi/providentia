I'd gladly like to say that last night was my first time at Blend on the water. Not only was the restaurant it's self amazing the management along with front of house staff was stupendous. I was very well accommodated by Lance the manger on duty last night . He took care of my party & my self and gave us a great experience. As well as my server Stephaine . Together they both made my dinner party extremely enjoyable. And I will most definitely be back in the near future .
