one of my favorite restaurants in nyc. I have never been dissapointed with the food or service at this place.. and the wine.. ooohhhhh the fabulous wine. They have an amazing wine list, which comes in the form of a book! The only reason it gets 4 stars is because it gets pretty crowded and the tables can be pushed very close together.. sometimes i want to ask my 'neighbors' if i can try their food too. They are that close. Dessert Platter is a MUST have :)
