The taco was decent, but nothing better than you can get at an "authentic" taco cart. The service here was a joke.  A woman came up after I ordered and started babbling to me, the customer, about how her co-worker left Nyquil on the front counter or something.   Then the co-worker comes back and shoves money back in my hand, as he tells me he is giving me the money back I paid to put guacamole on my taco because, since it is "against [their] policy" to do so, he wasn't going to do it anymore. Then a girl comes in with her dog, which is wearing a vest, and politely states that it is a service dog and asked where the best place would be to seat her - the confused and rude staff didn't know what to do.  They went to the back.  Some stoner manager guy came over and told her they can't serve her, WHICH IS AGAINST THE LAW. This place is just so lame, none of the people are from anywhere around here, and the customer service is terrible.  The tacos are decent but even my friend who originally reccomended I tried it out was just griping to me about how they wouldn't seat her and her friend in the not-that-busy restaurant until their 3rd friend got there, even though he wasn't going to eat.
