There are variety of things from their menu, however notice myself most smitten with the recent mozz and sundried tomato hero. it is so straightforward, however it's awing. I additionally extremely relish the capellini salad: angel hair, cherry tomatoes, basil, and lots of garlic and vegetable oil. Addition to the food shop things, they sell frozen entrees, soups, recent/dried alimentary paste (the fresh pasta is great), canned tomatoes, and taralli. in fact you'll be able to additionally obtain their recent do-it-yourself mozz, foreign cheeses, and salumi.
