This has to be one of the most interesting and unique restaurants on earth. If you ever the get the chance to be lucky enough to granted a table here (my reservation came from someone else) you are in for a serious treat. The family style atmosphere is something that is lost in most italian restaurants. The food is a culinary masterpiece. I left feeling sick I had stuffed myself so full with food. I am a big fan of the bottled sauces and I can honestly say the real thing is a gem. Even the ice cream (apparently from a local producer) is incredible. Rao's is a taste of the old world down to the server who takes your order sitting in a chair turned around. It is a treat when you get the chance and worth every penny. If only I could go again
