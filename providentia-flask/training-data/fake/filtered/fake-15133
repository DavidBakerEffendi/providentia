This is my favorite gluten-free restaurant!  I love the gluten-free beer and pizza.  The breadsticks are so good that I still have trouble believing they are actually gluten-free!  I've only ever been on a weeknight, but have never had to wait (although once I had to sit at the bar). The staff has always been super-helpful and friendly.
