All the awesome things: cheesy grilled cobcorn. Soft tacos. Frozen margaritas. Outdoor seating, huge. Allegedly green recycling and energy-consumption. Bad things: always a long line (already been mentioned in other reviews). Only one sometimes two cashiers. = slow. No dogs allowed, because have to walk through the inside to get to the outside garden, if you know what I mean. To me, outdoors space in NY is wasted if it doesn't allow dogs. Despite its downsides, irresistable and great place to bring friends and family when they're visiting and want something refreshing yet neighborhoody.
