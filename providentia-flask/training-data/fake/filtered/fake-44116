mr.sushi gets my vote for 5 stars. it was suggested by a friend who went there before and it didn't disappoint. i'm a greedy person when it comes to food so the combination of quality & quantity was important for me haha. i usually get 3 rounds of 3 orders of special rolls which is 9 orders in total so i don't know anywhere else where you would only pay $20+ with oranges @ the end or even the surprise vanilla bean icecream for my 1st visit by the friendly staff.
