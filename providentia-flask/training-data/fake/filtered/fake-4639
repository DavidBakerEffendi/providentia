So I wanted to take my girlfriend out for a special dinner on her birthday and having read the awesome review the NY Times gave Salinas, I decided not to look any further. I thought it was going to be impossible to book a reservation considering all the great buzz surrounding this spot, but turns out, the friendly hostess was able to squeeze us in and accommodate us in the stunning garden by the fireplace.  Not only that, but I told her about my girlfriend's birthday and they surprised her with a candle on our dessert! And don't even get me started on the food, which was out of this world.  We had the corn crusted veal cheeks, the crispy quail wrapped in bacon, the salt crusted striped bass, and the crispy fideo pasta dish (Rosejat Rapida, which I found out was named one of this year's best dishes according to "Time Out NY").   Since the moment we walked in to the moment we left Salinas, our dining experience was beyond our expectations.  I'm so happy I was able to treat my girlfriend to a very special dinner on her birthday. Thank you for making it happen, Salinas!
