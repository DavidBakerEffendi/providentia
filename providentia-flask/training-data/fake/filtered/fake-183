There is no doubt that Amada has made a vigorous attempt at becoming an authentic tapas restaurant. The decor is beautiful and they have a good selection of wine, sherry and Manzanilla. But just like Cuba Libre misses the mark on being a "Cuban" restaurant (how would an American citizen know what a Cuban restaurant is like anyhow?), Amada completely misses the mark for being a Spanish style tapas bar in its atmosphere. The food is good but severely overpriced; as are the drinks (the sangria has only wine in it and misses the other ingredients common to pitchers of sangria in Spain such as triple sec or brandy). After having been to Granada, and having lived in Sevilla, I found the atmosphere at Amada was disappointing and lacking. The plastic covered prosciutto (or jamòn) over the bar reminds one that the FDA continues to rule the American restaurant, and the slicing machine under it would never be seen in a decent tapas restaurant. The jamòn would be sliced with a knife throughout the day on a special board with a clasp that keeps the jamòn in place.   The affluent patron that could afford the high prices of bite-sized plates is the final blow on what would otherwise be a tapas restaurant worth visiting. Let the companies bring their guests there to expense the meal, or a middle aged person "impress" their entourage by picking up the check there. At those prices (I could afford them, but don't see the value), I'd rather buy jamòn, olives, cheese and shrimp at the Italian Market, a bottle of Rioja at the state store on the walk home, and host .
