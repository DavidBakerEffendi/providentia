Lillie's is a special place for me since I am fully versed with the history of Lilly Langtry. The food is excellent as well as the beer selection. The other day I had an avocado soup that was amazing and the staff their so great. I highly recommend this establishment. In addition to that Cynthia is a wonderful manager.
