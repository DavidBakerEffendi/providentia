Ok, first off you can't claim to be an SF style burrito in New York without calling it a Super Burrito.  I hear about this place; (being from SF I miss my burritos), and I come in and order a super carnitas.  They laugh, and repeat you want a burrito?  Yes I want a B-U-R-R-I-T-O.  I actually want a super carnitas.   So here's my issue with this place: LEARN HOW TO ROLL A BURRITO.  It was painful to watch this guy struggle with the roll, I mean a burrito is about the quality of the tortilla, the ingredients are obviously important, but the roll is the unequivocally deal making or breaking part of this whole beautiful procedure.  So I see him roll it, and he follows up with some losely fitting tin foil.  If you like to eat burritos with your hands the roll and the tin foil are downright CRUCIAL.  Anyways I get my burrito and I peel off the upper layer of tin foil and notice the sogginess, the limpness of this thing.  I react in HORROR, how can you do this to me?  Claim SF, laugh when I say super burrito, and then this thing needs some viagra or something.   It gets worse, the tortillas they use are of a bad quality.  I take a few bites, and peel off some more tin foil, and I notice a fissure, a crack, this burrito is self destructing in my hand!  I stop, I complain, and I finally ask for a re-roll.  When you need to ask for a re-roll  you know somethings a miss.  Anyways they unravel it and the whole thing is SPLIT open like a crack in the crust of the earth, this thing is a not a fissure anymore its a god damn crevasse.  I gave up and ate it with a fork.  It's a sin really, great concept, but learn how to roll a proper burrito, upgrade your tortillas, and call it a super burrito and you're up to Gordos status, no La Taqueria, but you can claim Gordos.
