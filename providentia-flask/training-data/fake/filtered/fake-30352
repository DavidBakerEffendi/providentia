Best service ever. I wish I could remember the server's name... Genevieve? Maybe? Anyway, she knew exactly what to recommend based on my table's very different tastes. The food was good. I loved the 'Salad of herby lentils, green beans, avocado, toasted pecans and baby gem with pomegranate molasses and avocado oil vinaigrette' as well as the 'Grilled scallops with sweet chili sauce, cr√®me fraiche and green plantain crisps' ( both of which they should come up with a simpler name for) The "flight" was exceptional. Their Grenache is a new-found favorite of mine. If I could criticize anything, maybe the server should limit her diet of rainbows and butterflies to two times per week, if only to avoid building up a tolerance.
