This restaurant is an absolute delight. Â My husband and I took a friend for her birthday and enjoyed it so much we went back for a date night. It was just as good as the first time. Everything we ordered was not only delicious but also creative. It's such a treat to be able to enjoy this type of restaurant and not have to drive into a major city. The views of the Delaware river and friendly staff round out the incredible dining experience. Did I mention it's also a BYOB? Bottom line is that it's not pretentious and the quality of the food is superb. I highly recommend it for a small intimate dinner or for a large group.
