I stop by here about once a month. Everything I've had here has been delicious and lovingly prepared. Soft pits, great hummus.  Can not find something like this on the West Coast. I hesitate to deem any place 'the best' for anything, but Taim is close to the top.  The ginger mint lemonade is also wonderful for washing down your food.
