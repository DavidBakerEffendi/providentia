Excellent place to go to that I immediately recommended to friends. Was there for a business party and I have to say that Armel was an excellent host, and that absolutely everything was devine. The place is very nicely designed and the FOOD... ahh, the FOOD: the wine is fabulous, the mushroom risotto marvellous and the crème brulée fantastic!
