To be honest any new restaurant in town with home-cooked, loved food is welcomed in my book. What I love about this place is the different angle of a menu, bringing home Jersey favorites like funnel cakes! Any sort of mood of what to eat can be quenched by trying a different platter.  I'm already over my 5th visit and I think I'm addicted. Give it a try, and if you don't particularly like your meal, try a different one next time. I didn't like the chili all too much at first even thought my girlfriend did.  But these sandwiches  are something special so give them a try at least
