I love going to eat at the bar at a Michelin-starred restaurant!  Chicken-under-a-brick, a great glass of wine (bartender always makes a good recommensation)-- and boom! Happiness ensues.  It's pricey,but not THAT much more than mid-range places--- so spend a little more here and get some GREAT food.
