This is one of the best Turkish restaurants I have ever been to in America. The food is as good as in Istanbul. The ambient is cozy and authentic. I eat lunch here almost every day and feel like I am on the Bosphorus. The owner and some of the waiters have worked in restaurants in Turkey and know what they are doing. They have the best baklava in New Haven. All the dishes are prepared with special care and everything is fresh. The waiters are friendly and you can learn a lot about Turkish cuisine from talking with them. Most importantly, the atmosphere is warm and original. The owners want the customers to feel special. The furniture and decorations are also nice, as is the music. One can hear stars of Turkish music such as Zeki Muren and Selim Sesler. Many Turkish restaurants in America lack a "personal touch." But Istanbul Cafe definitely has it. If only other Turkish restaurants could be the same. As someone who knows about Turkish food, I definitely suggest you try this restaurant.
