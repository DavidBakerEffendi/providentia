We recently had an event for 25 at the Market Table. It was a dinner in their private room downstairs. The room was lovely, compact, easy to converse between the two large tables, but we were not impressed with the meals. A noodle based appetizer was given high marks, the mixed salad was average. There were mixed reviews on the chicken entree, and most indicated that the monkfish medallions were a bit overcooked and salty. The flourless chocolate cake and berry french toast were both enjoyed by everyone. The service was impeccable. I am willing to go back and eat upstairs in the restaurant, because it can often be difficult to get twenty five entrees cooked and served all at once.
