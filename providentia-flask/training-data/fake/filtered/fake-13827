The food is phenomenal. I have eaten here a handful have times, and have yet to be disappointed; the chef puts a surprising spin on classic dishes, which has made me a repeat customer. The beer selection is always changing in connection with the seasons, which is always an added bonus. The space may be small, but it keeps in line with the gastropub menu and feel: no unnecessary flare and just the right details. The bartenders and servers are incredibly pleasant. I highly suggest this venue!
