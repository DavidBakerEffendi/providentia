We have been to both Tony D's many times however, this time we brought friends that have never been.  We made early reservations on line for 4:30 pm. at 43rd St.. We arrived at 4:15 and the hostess checked our reservation and seated us immediately.  We ordered two orders of the mussels FraDiavlo and they were huge and better than I remembered!  Plenty of tangy sauce with just the right amount of heat to dip the crusty italian bread into!  The bread is excellent and the mussels were even better.  We ordered two veal dishes and one pasta dish.  Veal Parmesean and Veal Marsala then Vodka Rigatoni.  All were excellent and prepared perfectly.  The veal was tender the sauces great and the pasta cooked perfectly!  If I had to make a suggestion it would be to go early!  By 5:15 pm the place was full and there was a line on Saturday night.  As we have been to both locations we like them equally as well.  The food quality is exactly the same.  I don't know where these other reviewers have been going in "Little Italy" but I have been to many places there as well and for the price, you can't beat Tony D's!! Enjoy we always do!
