My husband and I come here at least once a week. It's sort of sketchy, and the service quite frankly sucks. We keep coming back here because the food is GREAT, and you can have a full meal for two people for less than $20. Get the summer rolls and pretty much any type of Pho - I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
