Great place , great Management , tonight  I was handed the lunch menu and ordered a steak not knowing there was a lunch and dinner menu. I thought that this steak was to good to be true. At the end of the night the bill reflecfted a much more expensive steak. After speaking with managment my bill was  adjusted by 20 dollars less  than the dinner menu.. I even offered to pay the higher price but they insisted on making this right. That goes along way in this economy.
