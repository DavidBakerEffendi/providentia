I have been here many times and mostly it is good. But I would say that around 20 precent of the time my order has been messed up. In the past month when I unwrapped my burrito all of the food inside fell apart. Another time the cheese was almost frozen. It was cold and 3/4 of burrito was chesse. Also I came and the rice was stale. I have always really liked boloco but this might be the last straw. Next time my burrito is bad I might never come here again. I cant afford to spend this type of money just to throw my lunch away. I suggest that you spend more time to make sure you make the burrito is good. I hope that you take consideration of this!
