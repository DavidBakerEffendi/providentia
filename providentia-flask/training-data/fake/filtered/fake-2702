This place has horrible service. They simply do not care about the customer, they just care about the tip. 4 of us went to dinner at Valenca and I made reservations. When I got there, the reservation did not exist. I even gave them the name of the worker and they pretty much said I was lying and would have to wait. 30 minutes later, we got a table. It took an additional 20 minutes just to get water and bread at the table. There was a giant group at the restaurant, so they pretty much wee trying to get the tip from that side completely ignoring the other side of the room. After ordering the sangria, it was was watered down. You could literally taste the water. Not quality at all! Took an hour for us to get our food and on top it it, the food was undercooked and what was cooked was cold. The fries were stale and seemed like they had been made hours prior. When I took it up with the manager he wanted to hear nothing about it and just offered me a free drink to "fix" the problem. Immediately, I left and did not consume any of the food. Beware! They treat you like crap here. I will NEVER return here ever again!
