Marco's long slow decline continues.  Ordered a vegetarian special pizza with modifications (no broccoli, half olives and spinach).  It was difficult to communicate with the order taker who seemed unfamiliar with their own menu and had a very casual attitude.  Telephone connection was poor (i could hear all the restaurant background noise) even tho i was calling from a landline only a mile away. They did withhold the broccoli, but the rest of the toppings were scattered thinly and uniformly (no "half").  Tasted okay, but the cheese and toppings just weren't sticking to the crust, making it impossible to eat without a knife and fork.  Not the end of the world, but the Garlic Knot is what gets them to one star. I say garlic knot vice knotS because they came as one big undercooked doughy garlic loaf-like substance.  I ended up cutting it up and putting it on a cookie sheet at home and re-baking it to come even close to what garlic knotS (again, knots PLURAL) should be. Cleanliness has also continued its long slow slide.  It's been fun, Marco's - but no mas.
