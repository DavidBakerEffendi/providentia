Went to Marc Forgione last night and i LOVED it. I love restaurants and rely on yelp-ers to guide me in the right direction. But this is the first restaurant that compelled me to write a review. The place is a really good size 1/3 dedicated to the bar area and the rest to the dining + outdoor seating. The place is nice, comfortable & well designed; love the wood & openness of the space. I started at the bar with a white sangria with blackberries & raspberries - refreshing and not too sweet. Then moved to a table and our waitress was attentive but not overbearing and very friendly. I ordered the bacon wrapped pork chop with   onions and a potato puree (with a bit of wasabi). AH-MAZING; meat was cooked perfectly and the onions gave it a delicious accent flavor. My date had the steak with red wine & peppercorn sauce - the sauce was the perfect compliment to the steak. Again perfectly cooked flavorful and so delicious.  For dessert I had the "peaches & cream" which was sort of a deconstructed peach tart - not so great.  But the banana dessert was really good! HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place. LOVED it and I can't wait to try it again.
