Had dinner last night with a few foodie friends and we shared several dishes which were all absolutely beautifully prepared, (ART on a plate) and mouthwatering!   1.  BBQ Pork Buns:  They were extremely tender and juicy, with just enough sauce. 2.  Salmon Belly Tartare:  The combination of ingredients made us curious and we loved this so much, we ordered another one.  It was creative and just divine. 3.  Seafood & Chips:  This actually had chunks of lobster and while I was with a refined group, we all kept using our fingers because it was just that good! 4.  Crispy Chicken & Waffles:  Incredibly scrumptious combination of food.  The Waffles were so fresh and moist, while the chicken was perfectly seasoned and crispy.  We didn't even use much syrup because we did not want to cover the flavor of the chicken (another dish we are having at brunch tomorrow). 5.  Shrimp & Grits:  My Southern friend said between the Chicken & Waffles and this dish, someone must have a Southern Momma because these were both the best he had ever had.  I had never tried grits before but loved this dish so much, we are going back for brunch tomorrow!   Overall, extensive and creative menu.  Beautifully prepared and plated.  Will try to save room for desert next time. We went back for Brunch and had the Shrimp & Grits, Chicken & Waffles and added the Bleecker Omelet.   Everything was just as good as we remember and the Omelet was so fluffy without a trace of color except the yellow of the eggs.  Impressive!   The bartender was just adorable and very attentive without being intrusive.  Brunch drinks were fantastic.  All too often, bartenders add too much juice/mixer or too much alcohol. Thanks Celest!
