I have been to this restaurant more then once and I was never disappointed. The food is great and the service as well. We had the rib eye and shrimp which was great. Also, surprisingly the vegetable dumplings were delicious (although not too appealing as i have never tried green dumplings). And for dessert, you must try the green tea ice cream. It's creamy and has a strong kick to it, but all the more reason to love it!
