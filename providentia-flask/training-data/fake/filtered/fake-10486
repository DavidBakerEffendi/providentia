I newly just resided in Princeton, and I've just picked up the New Jersey monthly magazine. I was awed when I saw Princeton Soup and Sandwich Company as critics pick out of all NJ Soup and sandwich places in New Jersey since my fiancé and I just moved into Princeton I had to check out what this establishment was all about since I LOVE soup.  I swiftly picked up the phone and told my fiancé that we have to try this place out, as we both taste test soups wherever we travel.  It's a tiny place but don't let trick you. They have seating outside and couple counter seats inside. Right in the heart of Princeton. There's a lot of good menu items but I went with the lobster roll and the lobster bisque. The Lobster roll was probably one of the best lobster rolls my fiancé and I had ever tasted. With the amount of meat and the different seasonings that it had. It had my mouth sizzling with flavor. I also had the lobster bisque which was awesome. It has really chucks of onager meat in it! Delicious! My fiancé had the chicken and provolone sandwich, but she doesn't like hot peppers so they kindly removed that off the sandwich. She said the sandwich was delicious! It's definitely a place where we will be eating at again. It's a great fast meal when your on the go also. I would highly recommend eating at this place! It was delicious! Very reasonably priced too!
