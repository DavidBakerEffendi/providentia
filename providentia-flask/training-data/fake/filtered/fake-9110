"Despite this being my family's restaurant, it's amazing!"  When you live 3,000 miles away and you can't get anything close to a Bagel Market bagel or muffin you still don't go somewhere else!  So, what do you do?  You pull one out of your freezer, even if it has freezer burn!  That's how good this food is.  Maybe it's part of my DNA by now but I miss it more and more every day!  If you're in town, don't miss your chance to have a bagel that puts any NY bagel place to shame (including Katz deli)!
