We love this place. We have been going for years. I always get the greek salad- to share because it's alot. I always get the grilled calamari with the lemon potatoes. I try and stay away from the warm bread- I would eat the entire loaf. If you are there early enough they give you complimentary dessert which is yummy!!!! However, the place is always crowded but definitely worth the wait.
