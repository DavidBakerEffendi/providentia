This may be my first review on Yelp.  But feel like it is necessary in this case since we enjoyed it very much and have been recommended this restaurant since...we were spurred to visit based on only hearing good things and we are glad to report, they were all true! The owner and son (chef) were gracious hosts stopping by the table to check in.  We were impressed with the eclectic menu--the special of the day was Country Fried Shark Steak!  The atmosphere was perfect for our grown-up night out (we rarely get a sitter) and considered it a treat to be with good friends in setting that was comfortable, cool (trendy but not pretentious).   We each had an entree'--shared bites and all were satisfied with the variety of flavors ranging from fish, steak, pork and risotto. While we do not always go out and spend $20+ for entrees and consider that a treat, comparing the quality and price to what else is in the area.....I will not hesitate to return!
