I have never had such terrible service. Every host and server was so rude and not willing to accommodate my friends and I when we walked in looking for a table for three people. There were plenty of tables available and they were not willing to push two together for us to sit down when we explained we were in a rush to make a movie. They said "we need to keep two person tables reserved for two people only". Which made zero sense because we were the only ones waiting! They were definitely not interested in pleasing the customer or keeping our business. We were all so frustrated by the horrible service that we will never go back here.
