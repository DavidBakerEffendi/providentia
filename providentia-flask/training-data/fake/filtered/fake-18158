My first trip to Temple Grille was out of desperation on a Friday night because everything else was packed. I'd never heard of it before but when my boyfriend and I walked in we were greated right away by a very friendly guy and seated in about 2 seconds. The inside is very cute and small, but it's new haven..what do people expect?! The staff was very helpful and kind and at this point is was 8-9 o'clock on a Friday so we were starving! I ordered a burger with sweet potato fries and some toppings my boyfriend got a burger as well and regular fries. Everything was SO delicious! I was so excited that we ended up there. And for two people with an appetizer/ drinks/ 2 entrees the bill was extremely reasonable. I've been back three of four times now and have never been disappointed. I love the salad card that they have and their pasta is delish. Overall I am so happy that I stumbled upon this restaurant and it is now my boyfriend and I's little place to go to. I strongly recommend everyone give this little place a chance. And if you do, try those homemade chips! (YUM)
