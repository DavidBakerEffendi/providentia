this place put a very good, family run BBQ joint out of business. The food is very subpar, have only eaten the twice. Once right after it opened. chopped beef was nothing but bark, figured it was was made with the left over cuts from the smoked brisket. hoped it was the learning curve and they would figure it out. Ate there again about 8 months later and it was still crap, got a rack of ribs that were so salty they could not be eaten. if they are cooking on the learning curve they are slow learners. I cook and would not serve to my family what I paid for. this place should be ashamed. Lesson, if you are wanting good BBQ it has to be cooked with love and passion, and stay away from anyplace that offers a franchise.
