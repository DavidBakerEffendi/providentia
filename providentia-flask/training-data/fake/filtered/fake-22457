First before the food I would like to coment on the AMAZING music, they have a great combination of 50's, Everly Brothers, to Jerry Lee Lewis, to a switch of great punk classics Dead Kennedy's and the Ramones.   Also the fact that they have a projector playing what I would consider and all time great the original Dawn of the Dead.  The ambiance was perfect for me. Now what for something completly different!  The food was really great.  I had hush puppies, and the fried green tomato sandwhich.  The sandwhich was amazing crispy and spicy with the cool cold slaw.  The Hush Puppies were warm and crispy on the outside but moist inside.  I didnt care much for the butter milk ranch but that is only because I am not a huge pepper fan, it is not so muc pepper but it is fresh cracked and I don't care for the taste. My boyfriend had the pulled pork which was very tasty but the meat was a little dry by itself but when they put the BBQ sauce on top it makes it a lot more moist. The food comes in large portions so don't let the price of $8 hush puppies fool you I was full before the meal came. Also just the ambience, again the music was amazing and seriously Dawn of the Dead on big screen awesome.
