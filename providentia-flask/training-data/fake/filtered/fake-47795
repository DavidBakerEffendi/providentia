The best place for Sandwiches and Coffee..........Wow the Turkey and Brie Sandwich that i had couldnt get any better............The best Sandwich i ever had......About the coffee, I had never tasted coffee like that....As a coffee lover, i asked one of the staffs about the coffee and i was so much pleased that i was drinking the fair traded coffee imported from the Mountains.....Wow can it get better than that???? Folks, you have got to try the Cafe........Great atmosphere ( to study, social networking, hang outs).....
