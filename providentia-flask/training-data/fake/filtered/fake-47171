Superb atmosphere. I am a hookah smoker so I enjoyed their lounge. I had a lasagna special and my friend had a nice Steak & Mushroom dish that was cooked superbly. They were pretty busy when we went there, we waited for a while and I must admit, the service can be a bit better however... I am not a critic, I enjoyed the traditional atmosphere and the food is just fantastic. Highly recommended if you're in the area. Finding a parking spot sucks but that's typical of any downtown.. be prepared to walk a bit. I haven't tried the outdoor seating (in the Summer time) yet but I saw it and I'm really looking forward to it.
