Excellent tapas. Great portions and prices to try out several delicious dishes. We shared 4 tapas plates and a side dish between two people - perfect amount of food with just enough room to share an absolutely amazing slide of chocolate mudslide cake for dessert. They have a great selection of sangria too - white peach and red pomegranate and so much more. The place was mostly empty mid-day on a weekday and the waitress was very attentive without hovering or making us uncomfortable. I'd love to come back again.
