My husband is hard to please when it comes to French pastries because he grew up in Paris. He came with me expecting to be disappointed at another promise of authentic French food. We had a pistachio pastry and raspberry tart and both of us were impressed. The crust had flavor that complemented the rest of the dessert, the cream wasn't too reliant upon cream for cream's sake, and although the pastries were clearly decadent and indulgent they were not too sweet. The price is only very slightly higher than desserts at other local cafes (anticipate spending something like $2 more..we aren't talking much), however, while some other local cafes and restaurants rely on the same frozen distributorship or mass production to supply their desserts Petit Paris clearly produces their own fresh pastries and at infinitely higher quality. We left feeling that it was sooo worth it. It is the most authentic of anything we can find in the area. We will definitely go back! I will also use it to buy desserts that impress my in-laws and visiting relatives.
