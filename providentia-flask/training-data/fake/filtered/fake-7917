i've been going to govinda's for three years now, but have only been a vegetarian for one year.  before i went veg, i ate meat almost every single meal and swore by it, but govinda's was the only place i'd eat fake meat.  i've only ever gotten the "chicken" quesadilla, but every time i go it is amazing. large portion, delicious, and definitely worth the price.  i cannot comment on any other dish they serve but judging from my friends' reactions, the "chicken" cheesesteak is also to die for. AWESOME vegetarian comfort food in a city that sometimes thinks "vegetarian" means quinoa and vegetables only. however, i do refuse to give a full five stars to govinda's because from working in the industry for six years, i can tell that the main man himself (the owner) is a little bit of a jerk.  being a veg for the past year has made me well aware of the high price of fake meat, so i don't even contest govinda's considerably inflated prices.  what i DO contest is their lack of staff.  i honestly feel bad for the people who work here, because almost every time i go they are SO busy, and i've never seen more than one cashier and one cook working at a time.  this makes the very long line move extremely slowly, and probably somewhat affects business.  the staff always seems so overworked, it is no wonder that other reviews have mentioned their attitudes or unwillingness to smile.  they have no time to be nice!  mr. govinda, whoever you are, you are clearly making lots of money off of this very busy place.  try to come off of your high horse and share some of your profits by hiring/scheduling a few more people on busy nights.  remember that it is these cooks and cashiers, not you, that ultimately make the food delicious.  also remember that if you do spend some of your precious profits on scheduling an extra person or two, it will make the line move faster, please customers better, and will ultimately be more lucrative for you in the end.
