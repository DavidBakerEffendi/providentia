The food was great.  The attitude of the server was...just awful.  Maybe the server  doesn't like gay men, maybe the server was having a bad night, maybe the server is in the wrong business. I (we) are not going to let one bad experience with a server color the whole establishment in a bad light.  I've been there before and will go again.
