We stopped in for dinner last night and saw an available table against the wall.  We were told we couldn't have it because it was reserved and were seated in a booth instead. The owner/manager was annoying - he wouldn't let the servers have any conversation with the customers.  They were to take orders only and quickly. One of the servers was having a brief conversation with customers she obviously knew and the owner/manager interrupted her and told whipped out HIS order pad and told her HE would take the order. She apologized and tool the order. Very tense atmosphere.  The food was nothing to write home about.  I ordered the fusilli pomodoro with prosciutto & onions - had huge chunks of onions and very little prosciutto. The few pieces I found were little cubes and hard as rocks. My husband ordered spaghetti & meatballs and was very disappointed in the sauce and meatballs.  Remember the table we couldn't have? It remained empty the entire time we were there.  On a bright note, our server was very polite and efficient. We won"t be back.
