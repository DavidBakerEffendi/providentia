I took my wife here for her birthday dinner and it did not disappoint at all!  First it is a wonderful little(and yes, very little) restaurant decorated sort of like a fusion of a french bistro and a Tuscan trattoria.  Second, the mother comes out before each meal to great the guests and welcome them to their restaurant, which just goes to show how much this family cares about succeeding.  However, the crowning achievement is the food.   These are small plates, although they do offer a few large entrees as specials, so sharing is a must.  My wife and I started off with a cheese plate(all the cheeses are sold next door in their shop) which although not Italian, were tasty.  We split 3 small plates for dinner, the daily risotto of black rice and chestnuts, a tilapia with a raisin/butternut squash cream sauce and ricotta gnocchi.  The tilapia was the best fish dish I've had in some time!  The gnocchi was amazingly creamy and although ricotta is a heavy cheese, the dish did not seem heavy at all.  The risotto was a good consistency and the chestnuts added a unique flavor and texture.  Our only regret was not having room for dessert!   I highly recommend Skappo, just make sure you get a reservation!  We will be back hopefully soon!
