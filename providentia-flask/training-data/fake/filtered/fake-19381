Actually closer to Snug Harbor then  New Brighten, a great treat when visiting Snug Harbor, Best pizza I tasted in a long time, I tried  their Vodka pie, one of my faves. The Cheese Steak and buffalo chicken pies were also great, Crispy but not heavy and oily. . Worth the trip to Snug Harbor for a great pizza. The Pasta dishes are delicious  as well, had the Penne with Grilled Chicken and Vodka Sauce, finger licking good. I will be going to Snug Harbor more often. My grand daughter will enjoy both Snug Harbor and Crispy Pizza. Best place to eat in Snug Harbor in my opinion, clean beautiful decor for a Pizzeria. Will be going back soon.
