Their rose macaroon is a must try. It's like having an explosion of rose petals on your palate. The green apple is very refreshing. I've been to this location twice and there has always been a line up, but it is totally worth the wait. I also picked up two macaroon key chains for my girl friends. Looks really cute with small purses.
