Stuffed is an all around great Restaurant. A local family owns and manages this restaurant and I experienced that this week.  The Food is absolutely outstanding, the Service is genuine and the atmosphere is clean and refreshing.  I am from Baltimore and heard about Stuffed through a friend so I figured I would try it.  Stuffed more than exceeded my expectations and Highly Recommend you give it a try !!!
