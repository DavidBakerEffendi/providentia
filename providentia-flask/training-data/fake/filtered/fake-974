The food was excellent and I was really surprised at how extensive the menu was for the small space.  This was my first time and I am definitely planning on returning, to try the other items I couldn't order.  Pitchers of margaritas are great and I look forward to trying the specialty margaritas.  Service could be improved with respect to attentiveness.  Personality and helpfulness of the server was excellent.  I understand being busy - and it says a lot when you are full on a Wed. night - but noticing your table's water glasses need filling without being told would have given you FIVE stars.    But I am still coming back.
