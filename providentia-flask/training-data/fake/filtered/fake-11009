Got myself worked up over all the hype and the pictures.  Stopped by on my way back from JFK airport.  I understand the owner makes his pies one at a time, takes his time, uses quality ingredients, takes his craft seriously, etc.  Customers were taking pictures of the guy like he was a celebrity, which only added to the anticipation.  Waited around 30 minutes for a slice.  Was rather underwhelmed by the actual taste of the pizza.  Not that it was bad... It just wasn't nearly as delicious as I had expected it to be.  Maybe I'm missing something here.  Or maybe my expectations were just too high for what it was.  A very long wait and a very high price for what ultimately turned out to be just an above average slice of pizza.
