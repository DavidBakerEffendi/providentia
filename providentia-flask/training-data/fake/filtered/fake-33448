Terrible service!!! Will never order from them again! I want to be clear- I have never in my life sent food back except a chicken sandwich that was still raw, so for me to complain it has to be really bad. Â I ordered online for delivery. I ordered fried calamari, when it came I was certain that half of it had to have fallen out of the box, I actually looked through the bag to see if it had fallen out. I called Mix to tell them that I was confused about the size of the order considering that it cost $9. The manager was extremely rude and just cut me off, saying that there's never been a problem before and he was sure that I had the right amount. I then opened what was supposed to be chicken parmesan over linguine. Instead it was a chicken parm sandwich with soggy french fries.Normally I would have just let it go and eaten the food, but after the manager was so rude the first time, I was really pretty annoyed. I called back and this time the manager insisted that I must have ordered wrong. Since I ordered online I had my receipt right in front of me and read it back to him. He then said that it was a problem with Grubhub and there was nothing he could do. I was a server for many years, never have I ever seen a manager treat customers this way.
