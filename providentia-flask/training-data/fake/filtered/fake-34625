We've only came here twice and both visits were awful. The first time I visited, I thought the pizza was pretty mediocre and the staff was rude, but it was so close to our apartment, I figured it was worth the distance. The most recent visit was terrible because we paid $12 for a "small" pizza and fries. Their pizzas come in three sizes - mini (7"), small (10"), and large (14"). Instead of the small pizza, they gave us a mini, but charged us for the small. Then, when we got home and opened the fries, there was only a handful thrown in some tin foil. They gave us a huge container for like... 10 fries covered in tin foil. This was supposed to be enough food for two people, but we were still hungry when we finished. I don't know how even a 10" pizza and fries like this are worth $6 each, when we could have picked up a larger pizza and a bag of fries for about $5 less at the supermarket. Also, the staff was STILL rude to us during this visit. This place is nearby our apartment, but better pizza and a better experience is definitely worth the drive. We will not be back.
