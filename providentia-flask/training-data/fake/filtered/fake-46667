Based on the large crowds waiting outside Beyoglu and the Yelp reviews I convinced my wife and a friend to give it a shot. We went on a pleasant summer evening and many people were eating at the tables outside.  The windows were wide open.  The place has great energy and it's LOUD. Unfortunately the food was not that good.  We shared Karides Izgara (freshly grilled shrimp), which were good, but only 3 shrimp were served for $7.50.  (I took some comfort that only 3 people were in our party.)  I love middle eastern food and ordered one of my favorites - lamb kebob (Doner Kebab: vertically grilled thinly sliced lamb and beef over rice pilaf).  It was horrible - dry and tasteless.  My wife ordered Kilic Sis (char-grilled swordfish kebab served with rice pilaf), which was much better. The food is moderately priced.  The wine selection is limited, but not expensive.  Overall I was disappointed because I was expecting more based on the crowds and the Yelp reviews. The middle eastern restaurants on 2nd Ave in the 70s are better.
