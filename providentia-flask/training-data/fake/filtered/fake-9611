Just went here for the first time last night and i have to say it was a very enjoyable experience. The atmosphere was very nice, going for a modern eastern look. The service was great and all the staff were very friendly and helpful when one of our party had questions. The food is well worth the trip and is just delicious. We had a combination of sushi, hibachi and general kitchen meals and everyone left both full and happy. If you want to have sushi or hibachi, go local and go here. You won't regret it.
