Today my wife and I went to Ippudo Westside.  We arrived there 5:10, only 10 minutes after the restaurant opened.  We were told to wait for 45-60 minutes.  However, we did not sit in at 6:30 pm, more than 60 minutes the waiter promised.  We asked the waiter why people come later than us got the table already.  We were told that we could only sit at the counter.  Given we have a 7:30 pm concert to attend, we had to leave.  This is a ridiculous waiting time.  I seriously do not think it is a good experience to wait there endlessly and be told a false promise and wait time estimates, especially see people come after us getting the table/counter earlier than us.  Wake up, what do you expect to get from the Ramen after the so long wait?  By that time, you will be already hungry and everything will be delicious.
