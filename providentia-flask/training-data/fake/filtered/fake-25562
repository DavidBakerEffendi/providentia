My husband and I have been eating at Village Pizza for over 20 years!  The food is always fresh and delicious and the owners are the 2 nicest guys you'll ever know.  The workers are polite and the service is very good.  It's a great neighborhood restaurant and they do a great business!  If you want good food, friendly service and a friendly atmosphere, visit our Village Pizza on Main Street in Wethersfield!!
