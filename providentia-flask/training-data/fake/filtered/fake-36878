I love this bar! I know they will always be open after I get out of work. The bartenders are friendly and know you by name, as well as some of the bouncers. Â I'm not much into going during the weekend because of the club kinda scene. Although it is a lot of fun I prefer the week day nights its a bit quieter but you still have a nice mix of people. All in all, the unique personalities of bartenders, bouncers and customers and the atmosphere set this place on a different level then most irish pubs. And the food is decent.
