Best Thai food place in Brooklyn! The food is amazing, every bite is so flavorful! Going there is never a disappointment.  On top of the great food, the prices are very reasonable.  The only negative part of the entire place is that they only accept cash but other than that I would recommend Joya to anyone looking for a good, reasonably priced dinner.
