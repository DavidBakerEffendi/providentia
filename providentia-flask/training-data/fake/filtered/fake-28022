This place is slipping.  For years it was our favorite in the entire area.  The past two times, it was disappointing.  The bean soup is far less flavorful than it used to be and was served nearly room temp the last time.  The crab stuffed peppers are nowhere near as good as in the past.  Even the portion size of the white anchovies is shrinking.  Many of our all-time favorites are just not close to what we're used to tasting.  Still excellent flat breads, but who drives an hour on a weekend for great flat breads. Used to be impossible to get seating on a Friday night unless you lucked out at the bar.  The last trip we (party of 2) showed up at 5:30 and were seated right away.  Seems like we're not the only ones noticing a slide.
