Innovative, inspired, a great addition to the princeton dining scene. The chef is truly gifted. A menu of small plates from the fields, the land, and the sea. The restaurant itself is airy with dark wood floors. Reservations for 6 or more. A sushi bar like seating area also. Service was excellent. There is also an outdoor patio. From the fields we had the spinach semolina gnocchi, delicious. From the sea the octopus, scallop ceviche, bucatini were all delicate and tasty. The calamari were okay, the only 7 amongst a slew of 10s. From the land the merguez sausage chicken yakatori, and the pork belly salad were each extremely tasty. From the desserts we tried the panna cotta which was like a delicious light marshmellow. Also had the lemon posset. This was airy, delicate with a new taste of a frozen shiso which added a minty taste. There was nothing bad. We will go again and again. Please add bread so one can sop up all the sauces!!!
