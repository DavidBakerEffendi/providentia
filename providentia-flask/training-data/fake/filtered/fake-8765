I brought my gf she is she is vegetarian I went there because of my past experiences she loved enchiladas suizas verdes  with mix vegetables  with oaxaca cheese (like mozzarella but better) .the vegetables are fresh and I got the steak special with shrimp. We took pics with hats and this  rifle shaped bottle had a blast as usual too bad  there is no 6 star option
