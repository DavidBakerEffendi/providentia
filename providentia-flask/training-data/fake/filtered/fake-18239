Area - Use the buddy system. Decor 6/5 - It is a very beatiful restaurant with very high ceilings and massive chandeliers. Tongue pastrami and nduja 5/5 - They were good. Â I liked the pastrami more. They are well made. The cheese platter 5/5 - Bobolink Dairy JeanLouise was great and worth the price. The cheeses also come with two condiments including a nice jam. Steer Burger 3/5 - Very beefy! However, I think the effort to make the meat the hero ingredient was a mistake. It needed more onion spread and basically needed more flavor. I expected an amazing burger and I was pretty disappointed. Pretzels 4/5 - Awesome. The mustard that came with it is godly and awesomely spicy. However, there could have been more pretzels for the price, I mean its not oysters it is cheap to make dough... Desser 2/5 - I had the key lime tart. It was very lackluster. I was not impressed.
