It was a nice big space and the atmosphere was casual and nice. The service was pretty good - we got a table right away on Sat evening and our waitress was pleasant and efficient, checked on us adequately. They had a huge bar selection and good amount of drafts to choose from. Our waitress helped me order a mocktail because I'm pregnant and wanted something more fun than water (I REALLY appreciated this because I feel like some people act like it's a huge pain in the butt). I was just disappointed with the food! I really wanted to like this place. It was a pretty small menu so I assumed it was be smaller plates done well considering the chefs and how the place is marketed on their website. I got the pork belly banh mi. The pork belly was served cold on a cold hoagie roll with a bit of foie gras and a few pickled vegetables. It was pretty underwhelming - it reminded me of a dry cold cut turkey sub. (I wished it had been warm crispy pork belly). Â It was served with fries that were good and we ordered the onion rings which were good. My husband ordered the burger medium. It was well done which usually isn't a deal breaker but was also underwhelming. Definitely have had better. I swear we're not that hard to please when it comes to bar food - I don't need anything too fancy or crazy and I rarely write reviews on yelp but if you're going for casual dinner in Old City I'd go to Khyber or Eulogy. This would be a better place for just drinks and maybe a small app? Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, or maybe they're still working the kinks out since it's relatively new? I probably wouldn't go back to find out though.
