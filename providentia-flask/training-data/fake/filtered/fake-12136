Pass on The Spot, even if you only set mediocre standards for your lunch/breakfast dining experience. Here's why: 1) The staff is extremely UN-helpful and unfriendly; one employee's attitude reflected utter disdain for me and my "stupid" question about whether we order at the counter and seat ourselves. She said, "We're a full-service restaurant and we seat you. There are signs all over the place telling you that." For the record, as of my writing this review, there are TWO signs in the outdoor seating area--and neither of them faced the direction from which I entered. Also, there is no host stand inside to imply they will seat you, there was no host standing anywhere, and another server who was behind the counter could not even bother to raise his head from what he was doing to say "hello" or tell me I'd be helped momentarily. 2) They proselytize the charms and advantages of buying local, stating on their menu that "a large percentage" of their items are from Vermont. Sure, they don't say "all" their items are locally/regionally procured, but I would have expected a better quality of cheese than Kraft Singles on my $13 cheesesteak sandwich with potato chips, especially considering that Cabot is a nationally recognized Vermont-local item.... Oh yeah, and the straw thing--you're in the HOSPITALITY industry--just because it's your standard practice not to put straws in your drinks, you don't have to cop an attitude with customers if they politely request one. In conclusion, well, if you are willing to put up with rudeness, slow service and overpriced food to enjoy their outdoor seating or indoor ambience, then by all means, patronize The Spot, but otherwise, you're better off moving along.
