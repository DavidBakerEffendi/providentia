I went here for late brunch over a weekend and we did have to wait a few minutes for a table after ordering. but it was so worth it. their salads are huge! the buffalo soy chicken was a little spicy and very tasty. whatever you do, make sure you get the mini-loaf bread. delicious! I'll definitely be back here.
