The bread. The bread. The bread. This place is really something special, but mostly it's about the bread. I comes fresh out of the oven in front, and it works wonderfully holding together a sandwich, dipped in lentil soup or underneath a personal pizza. I've been eating here for the last few years and have never been disappointed. The food is tasty and very filling. The service is always friendly. And the price is just right. Definitely worth a try if you haven't gone yet.
