This place is awful we have eaten in many restaurants in princeton and this is the worst...the cappelini with shrimp and mussels was so salty you could barely eat it, the pasta with eggplant and tomatos it looked as if they poured a can of redpack over it! Service was good that is the only thing it has going for it, otherwise STAY AWAY go to Witherspoon Grill, Meditera much better!!
