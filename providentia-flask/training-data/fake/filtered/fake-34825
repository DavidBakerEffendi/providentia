We had lunch today at the Pond House Cafe and it is really a delightful setting.  You can choose from inside, porch or outside seating and all three areas were quite full today.  The lunch choices are simple but very good and reasonably priced.  I had a salmon nicoise salad which had an interesting variety of other ingredients, including some roasted cherry tomatoes which were a very nice touch.  I also had the gazpacho, which came with a dollop of finely whipped guacamole.  It was really superb as well. After the meal we walked the park, and that was also delightful.  I strongly recommend this restaurant for a fine lunch experience.
