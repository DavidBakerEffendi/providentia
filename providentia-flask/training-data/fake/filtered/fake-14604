Worst dining experience EVER!!!!! I am a longtime Pepe's eater but we wanted to try Sally's. I've heard that the pizza is compareable so we decided to go. Once we sat down it took 35 mins for the waiter to even notice us and take our drink order. That was the last time we saw our waiter until he delivered our bill. Did we get our drinks? NO did anyone ask us if we wanted somethig? NO Was the pizza good? NO Will I EVER set foot in that place again? NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!! Save your money, time, and patients. Go to Pepe's. The service is better, and most importantly the pizza is better.
