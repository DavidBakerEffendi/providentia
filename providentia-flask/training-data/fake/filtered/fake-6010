I've lived and dined in Montclair for over 25 years and Four Seasons has become my favorite restaurant in town. More than that - it has become our dining room - instead of entertaining friends at home, we take them to Four Seasons. It has everything - a great atmosphere, both inside and out back in the cloistered garden, is very family-friendly, serves fresh delicious food (many lamb and vegetarian dishes for the family that enjoys both), a very welcoming owner/chef and friendly staff. We've enjoyed many leisurely Sunday afternoons and evenings there, either for lunch or dinner and are always made to feel at home. Highly recommend the babaganoush, mediterranean salad, and lamb adana, - our son especially loves the falafel and stuffed grape leaves.
