GRILLED CHICKEN BANH MI! That's all I have to say! It is amazing! Good morning sunshine shining in your face, birds chirping in your ear telling you that you won the mini lottery (because let's face it, winning the jackpot is better than a sandwich), Ice Cube didn't have to use his AK it was good day Delicious with a capital D. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because the staff wasn't that friendly toward me. I did stop by late, so they may have been tired or maybe I was so tired that I misconstrued their attitude toward me. Either way, I will be back. Sandwiches are really good!
