Pier 76 usually does not feel the need to respond to yelp reviews. Even though some reviews are a little outlandish we appreciate the opinions of our customers and take into consideration all criticisms. Some reviews though are a little over exaggerated. ("Pier party"special which was once $25 is not $50 but now only $30 and the "dinner for two" which was $40 is now $50 this is because it offers a more expansive food selection for our customers. As for the "brunch" specials, Bud Light is unlimited which simply could have been recognized if a simple question could have been asked to are complemented (in the review, thank you) staff. As for conspicuous "beefy guy" (which is totally uncalled for) is our proud owner, whom is extremely tentative pier 76 because we celebrate our service and the product that we put out. yelp is a vehicle to celebrate the service industry to use it as a soapbox (which I'm doing now to protect our brand) is nonsense if there was a problem with product or service a bad review is acceptable but just to use it for slander is uncalled for. The owners of pier 76 are joe and Jeremy and we are MORE then happy to answer ANY questions or solve ANY problems. So please anyone who reads this do not hesitate to call we are here for your call and it is our goal to satisfy anything that could make a pier visit anything less then stellar. I wrote this in one shot so excuse any grammatical errors or spelling errors.
