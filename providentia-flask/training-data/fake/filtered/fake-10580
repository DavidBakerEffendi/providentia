I had dinner with my wife and some friends right before the holidays and it was great. Not only were the food and service both excellent, but it's a fun place to go as well with a great scene. Even if it's really busy and you have to wait a little while for a table it's the perfect place to sit down at the bar and hang out while you wait for your table.By the way, we only had to wait 10 minutes for a great table to open up and we went a busy night (Thursday) during a very busy dinner hour, right around 8:30. I highly recommend this place.
