Hooray for Beso!! This place is great and just what St. George needs.  The bar is perfect for meeting friends in a quiet, mellow space.  It doesn't get overly loud, which is great.  The drinks are fantastic as are the tapas.   I had to go back for dinner and was not disappointed by the food.  Everything was delicious and the service was very friendly.
