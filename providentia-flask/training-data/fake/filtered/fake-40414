This place is really great.  We've been going there for years -- almost since it opened.  I love the Yum Tom soup and the calamari appetizers (a bit dangerous, calorie-wise). Also the mixed seafood dish, with chili basil. Prices are good.  Wish they had a bigger selection of red wines.  And cashew nut dishes! The owners and managers are very nice and friendly. Definitely recommended
