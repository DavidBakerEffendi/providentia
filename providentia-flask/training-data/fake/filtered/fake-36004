Good Pizza. I don't care what everyone says about price. You know the prices when you look at the menu. What I care about are the portions - you don't know the portions prior to ordering. If I pay $8 bucks for a pizza I want to feel like I have eaten a meal not a snack. I love this spot, I just think a bit more food for the money is needed. The specials are very good  when they have them. The brick oven pork chop is always far far too pink on the inside and I never eat it so its large size is moot.  I look forward to Roberta's evolution as it always seems like the owners are dreaming up some new crazy scheme i.e. army tent beer garden??!@#$?!@$?  O-Yeah regarding the reviews that are sad about the lack of BYOB status, having been part of a few restaurant ventures that never got their liquor license I can say this: BYOB is a death sentence for any restaurant:  firstly it is illegal and comes with the treat of hefty fines and possible shut down, secondly the liquor helps bring in much needed profit. So if you like a restaurant you would hope they get their liquor license. Regarding cork fee: I think this is illegal as well. What a patron must demand is a wide range of prices in both beer and wine: economy for those on a budget and class for those willing to spend. Also proper storage of wine is necessary, I have noticed that many bottles are stored in the back near the hot hot temperatures of the kitchen. In my first restaurant this resulted in wines becoming cooked or corked and a lot of bottles being sent back. I have had to do this on 2 occasions at Roberta's. If you like the Pizza here try the pizza at Phorum  it was really good and the serving size a bit larger
