You'll notice all the good reviews here are for the pork buns. God forbid you order something else. I ordered the Pork Shank. At any German restaurant in the city, a pork shank is a big hunk of meat. Considering Momofuku charges $18 for the pork shank, I can be forgiven for thinking that's what I would get. The waitress arrives with a spring roll of shredded pork. "It's meant to be shared," she says as she hands us two plates. By what? Chipmunks? I thought it was a free appetizer or something. Nope. That was my dinner. My wife ordered the pork on rice cake. We got a bowl of rice cake with a glaze of pork, microns thick. Based on our combined amount of meat, I think the pig lived. He probably didn't even notice it missing and healed a week later. What made me upset was not the food but the price of such minuscule portions. We spent $40 for a spring roll and a bowl of rice. It was a joke. I can't attest to the taste because it was over so quickly. If you are the kind of person who likes to roll up hundred dollar bills and light them on fire to find the diamond earring you dropped under a dark table, this is the place for you. If not, stick to the oh-so-raved-about pork buns.
