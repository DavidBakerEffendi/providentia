Great food and atmosphere! We wanted to eat light since we were headed to the Eagles game. 3 of us split: margarita brick oven pizza, crab hush puppies, blue crab Mac and cheese, and some pork tacos. Everything as delicious! It it the spot and don't leave us feeling too hungry or too full. Would highly recommend this establishment for a relaxed and good time!!
