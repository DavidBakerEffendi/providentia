This Gem remains hidden because of WOOSTER St..  The pizza here is Greek Style with mini Pans, and is completely different from the others.  Don't get me wrong I like my share of the Wooster St. Pizzas as well, but I can never goto New Haven without picking up several pies from PIZZA HOUSE to take back with me to New York.  My favorite is the Sausage and Mushroom.  Give it a try.
