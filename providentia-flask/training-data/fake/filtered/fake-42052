Noodletown is classic, authentic Chinese food.  The taste is always there. Prices are not bad, maybe 50 cents or $1 more than other chinatown restaurants, but the food is good. Most of the dishes on the menu is good.  Our favorites are: Beef chow fun, Chicken chow mein in black pepper sauce, Hoisin chow mein (seafood), congee with cruellers (if they didn't run out yet), wonton noodle soup dishes are good, seafood dumpling is good. This place accomodates until late in the night; they close around 4 AM and re-open soon after that. Definitely convenient and good food.
