I was having dinner with my friends last night.Reached there at 7.15 Pm. food was good ,service was good until the manager Pradip came to our table Â at 8.45 Pm and softly said I need this table,customers are waiting!!!!! WE were shocked. We were 4 ladies minding our business. Of course we gave it to Pradip before we left after staying there for another 30min. Never did I get this treatment in the past 39 yrs. anywhere even in a roadside rest. Pradip should go back to basic training. It is a shame that he is employed at such a nice place. We go out a lot. This place is out of my list.
