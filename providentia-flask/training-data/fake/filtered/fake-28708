I myself am very into Japanese and Chinese food. The Sakura Mandarin definitely meets the criteria of being a top chief restaurant in my books. The small bites are in decorative dishes that are just a delight to have before the final meal comes in a fashionably manner setting up the table like a professional still life. The tea on the side spread the area with a fantastic aroma. Â The manners of elders eating first and kids not being loud and impolite are the typical environments of Asian cultural in there that light up my view of being an Asian American. The serves are polite and knowledgeable, really connects with me to order the food that I really wanted. And that is all before I started eating. Taking the scent of true Asian spices can water anyone's mouth. When the food enters your mouth, well, that's heaven! You really need to taste it yourself to make your own descriptions! The place has a modern look to it and I love it, really attracts all age and race of people. I like to give Sakura Mandarin a definite 5 Star.
