First off, this interior of this restaurant is truly beautiful. The large light fixture in the front half is an amazing serpentine box-type glower (I'm really good at explaining these things...) and in the back they have really cool lanterns that look like big balls of string. I am usually here for a quick late lunch or a few appetizers. Most other tables, however, seem to always be chowing down and getting dish after dish of great-looking dim sum. The scallion pancakes are the thin, crispy variety and are tasty. I love the Ma Po Tofu Noodle Soup - and its huge I always end up taking some home! And the prices are excellent. I will say that my friend had one slightly unfortunate evening when they went in on a busy Friday night and the staff was less than pleasant.
