Sahara is a fabulous restaurant. Coming from someone who has been eating middle eastern cuisine since childhood, I was very impressed with the quality and selection of food. My personal favorite, the stuffed grapeleaves, were delicious, as was the hummus and the baba ghanoush. As an entree we ordered shish kebab and kefta kebab, along with a gyro platter, and I was equally impressed with each plate. Everything was perfectly seasoned, and cooked to perfection. For dessert, I tried chocolate baklava, which was new to me. The chocolate was a great twist on an old favorite of mine. The portion sizes were generous, and we left very satisfied. Our server, Tarik, was especially attentive, and I will definitely be requesting him next time I am there! I would highly recommend Sahara Restaurant to anyone who enjoys middle eastern food.
