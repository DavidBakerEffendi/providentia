This is one of my most favorite restaurants in NYC. Â I always come back here whenever I make a trip up north. This place has always been consistent for me. I've never had bad food, never had to wait that long, and the servers have always been nice to me! The burgers are phenomenal. My other favorite dish is their meatloaf with the green beans. Can't get enough of those green beans. Of course, you gotta wash it down with their mint iced tea mojito! I particularly like to eat here during the day even though it is 24/7. So much light comes in from the big-open-garage-door wall...perfect for taking pictures! Cafeteria has a very clean, modern, and a minimalist style of design. I always try to come here with my friends whenever I get a chance.
