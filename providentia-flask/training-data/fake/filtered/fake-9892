Mmmmmm mmmmmmm mmmm!! Even with the memories of Tamarind fresh in my mind, this restaurant stood up to any criticism I could possibly give it. I went with a group of 5 to celebrate the Chinese new year, and nobody was disappointed. We started off with a beef sate with a perfectly crunchy peanut sauce and a very inexpensive but incredibly yummy portion of eel sushi. Both were a great hit! My boyfriend got a pad Thai noodle dish which was superb; even the tofu wasn't bad! My friend got a mango chicken overflowing with mangoes and served in a cut out mango. It was decadent to be sure! Her boyfriend got a beef dish with very moist, tender beef, but as a warning it was a ton of beef and no variety in the dish. For me, I had the basil chicken. It was packed with flavor and the perfect amount of spiciness. It had a ton of fresh basil. Wow, yum! The atmosphere and more adventurous dishes were a little daunting at first, but don't let that sway you. The food here is worth every penny.
