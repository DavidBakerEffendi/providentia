I used Fred & Pete's catered picnic option for a party I threw for 50 people recently. They brought a large grill and set up in the backyard. The guys were very nice and everyone at the party was very happy with the food. They stayed and cooked for a couple hours, then cleaned up quietly and left behind some additional food in case guests wanted more. I would hire them again for catering.
