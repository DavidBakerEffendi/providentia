We got lost in CT and came across this seafood spot. And let us tell you! Loved the Treasure chest filled with fried everything like fried clams, fish, crab cakes and plenty more! but our #1 draft picks are the buttery lobster roll, seafood chili & CT's different flavored bottled soda pops!  Check us out on a 4 part episodes of great food & our blooper show @ Stowes.  Enjoy our greedy antics! youtu.be/xk52Cp4ZcQA?lis… youtu.be/YKTktO0wi8E?lis… youtu.be/lJumyAG_uDk?lis… youtu.be/koi8h0ZaHoc?lis…
