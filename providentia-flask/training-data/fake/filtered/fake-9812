My wife and I went here when it first opened and found the service slow and the food unimpressive.  Nonetheless, with all of the attention that Marc Forgione has received of late we thought we would give it another try, so last week we walked in after 930 pm, and asked for a table for 2.  The restaurant was just over half full so we asked for a table that allowed us to sit next to each other rather than across.  There were three or four tables open that could have accomdated us, but the hostess said they had to be kept open for parties of four.  The kitchen closed at 11 pm so I asked if she really thought she would need to keep all the tables open for the next hour or so; indeed she did.  We sat at the bar next to each other in full view of the empty tables none of which were used for the remainder of the evening.  VERY ANNOYING!  We had a great meal, the food is both rustic and sophisticated and the bartender was competent and charming.  Nonetheless, we live in the neighborhood, and we are not rushing back.  This restaurant should realize, like the greatest restaurants do, that service is part of why people dine out.  A competent host or hostess is very valuable, and an incompetent one costs the owner dearly.  Great food and high prices deserve service that strives to accommodate rather than alienate.  We enjoyed a wonderful meal but I left with a bad taste my mouth.
