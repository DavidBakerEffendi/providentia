Went there after a day at the museum on a recommendation.  Ordered the past with seafood.  Very BLAND, didn't eat the meal and was still charged for it.  Poor wait staff.  Very tight seating.  Felt like I was in someones backward with the wicker furniture.  Plumbing in bathroom was being held together with aluminum foil.  What's up with that???  Are plumbers that expensive??  Would NEVER recommend this restaurant.
