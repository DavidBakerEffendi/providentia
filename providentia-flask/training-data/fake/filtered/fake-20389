Tried Mac Attack for a lazy Saturday lunch to go, went in with low expectations but were pleasantly surprised!  3 Cheese Grilled Sandwich on MBC bread (yum), an order of Burger Mac and Cheese and an order of Tater Tots (perfectly salted) were well more than 2 of us could eat, $20 + 5 for the counter staff, seemed like a great deal to us.  A definite stop on the way home from the train at night when you don't feel like cooking.
