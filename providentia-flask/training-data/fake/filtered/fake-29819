My favourite restaurant in all of greenpoint. I love great food. Most of my income goes to eating and cooking well. I love five leaves. I love the ambiance. I love the food -- brunch, lunch and dinner. Some particular favourites, brunch: sage scrambled eggs sandwich, muesli. Lunch: BLAT, Burger, Veggie sandwich. Dinner: Any specials, any fish. The ricotta "appetizer" is fantastic any time of day, even as a full meal if you love ricotta. I'm not a huge raw oyster fan (a foodie cardinal sin), but the flash fried oyster appetizer at dinner are one of the most perfect single bites I have ever enjoyed. Their truffle fries are awesome. Big fan. It's worth noting that there's ALWAYS a wait. It's super easy to get in if you're just 2 people, but I've only been able to go as two-top once, because as soon as I mention to my friends where I'm eating my group grows to 6. It's always a big wait, but its so worth it. (At dinner, consider heading to the Manhattan Inn bar for drinks while you wait!)
