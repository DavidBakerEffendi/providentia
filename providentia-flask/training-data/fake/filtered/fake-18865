I have eaten here several times and enjoy the pizza. That being said, imagine my dismay when after receiving my change, I note that I'm short 51 cents. I know that some restaurant don't carry change and feel that they have a right to basically just short change the customer, not themselves. This is not legal and should never be done. I'm disappointed and probably won't be going back.
