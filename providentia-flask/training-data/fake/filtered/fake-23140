Good steak , flat soda, dirty silverware, bad ketchup, old A1, rusty salt and pepper shaker, wobbly table, good waiter. The manager was very nice and got me a new bottle of ketchup and A1. When the waiter came back he said wow it really is a new one didn't know we had them, have never seen one. Â  In a word stay away ......
