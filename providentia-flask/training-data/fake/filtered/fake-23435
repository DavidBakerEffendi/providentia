I planned my sisters 21st birthday dinner here back in January. I had a party of 25 which the managers said they could accommodate me for. The cabana is a very small restaurants and it's not that good for groups unless they are smaller. Mostly everyone had a seat, except for me. I stood most of the time and the waitress repeatedly asked me to find a seat. She wasn't very polite. I would not recommend this place for large groups. Also while making my reservation, I spoke to the managers numerous times and explained to them that I would be bringing and outside cake. On the night of the dinner, when i arrived at the restaurant with the cake, the assistant manager expressed to me that there is an extra fee for bringing outside food. I wish that would have been communicated to me earlier. However I can say that I was extremely pleased with the way that they worked with me. half of my group wasn't there and they weren't supposed to seat us, but they did anyway. Also they were supposed to take away some chairs and tables after a while if people were late, but they didn't. Lastly, I wasn't pleased with the service that I received. My waitress was very rude. But the food was phenomenal! I give the food a 5!
