I came here with my boyfriend and some of our friends and we LOVED it. I live in midtown west and as we all know it can be a pain in the bet to get to the upper east side. But its worth the trip. We both got the Cemitas. The one called Brody (breaded beef, fried pork, ham, pineapple, white cheese, yellow cheese, and oaxacan cheese). And it was totally worth the $10. It was so big it lasted me two meals. Someone did mention the home made chips needed salt. and i have to agree. But other then that I was a very happy girl once my meal was over. I guess you just have to see for yourself. But I totally recommend it.
