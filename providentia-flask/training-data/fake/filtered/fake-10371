This place really surprised me. I was not sure what to expect, but wanted to try something new within walking distance. I thought it might just be some basic, heavy central European food, however, many of the dishes showed some real creativity and care went into the menu. Had to order a Czech beer and start with the Langos, the deep fried Hungarian bread with garlic butter. Both crispy and chewy. Very satisfying. Especially if it's the first bite to enter your mouth after a gulp of beer on an empty stomach. Could order this as a meal in itself with the cheese or sauce options. It also reminded me of fried pizza dough. We ate this alongside a baby spinach salad. But Ok. This salad seriously belongs in an episode of "Best thing I ever ate." You could order something similar almost anywhere (there were pears, grapes and blue cheese).  But this version...the dressing...damn. a mixture of walnut hemp oil and Tokaj. Never tasted anything like it. Really yummy. For mains, we split an order of the Halusky (very similar to spaetzle) with bacon, cheese and chives. Sort of an Eastern European mac and cheese, and I had the chicken Paprikas. Both were tasty, although nothing really topped the appetizers. This could be a great place to go with a group and share a bunch of different small plates. A lot of interesting flavors and creativity on the menu, as well alcohol options. My only complaint is the cash or amex only stuff. Beautiful, industrial/old-world fusion thing going on with the decor.  Very attentive staff.
