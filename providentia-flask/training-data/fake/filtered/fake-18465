Amazing is the proper description for this restaurant.  From the ambiance to the absolutely superb service; from the first oyster to the last bite of the sea bass, this was an absolutely devine dining experience.   Our server, Eva, immediately read and went with our mood - a group of friends out on the town, in full party mode and ready to explore.  Eva was happy to assist and gave us back as much energy as we put out as we paced ourselves through the bar and food menu.   The mohito's and the food were excellent.  The service was five star plus.   I can't wait to return!
