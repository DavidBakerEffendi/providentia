A good restaurant should have good food and service. The bottom line of good service is honesty, which this place doesn't have. (both the owner and server) I went to this place very often because the food here is affordable and pasta is fresh - usually with my husband. One day, my father came to visit me from Korea. I took him to this place. At the checkout, I was about to sign the check without paying much attention as usual, but (fortunately) realized that the price was higher than expected. I asked for the check with each item and found out that they added 22% tip without telling us, and then gave us the second check which required another tip (as if they did not add tip in the first place). What was more deceiving was that on the second check, the amount which included tip appeared as a "pre-tip amount". It was only two of us - not even a group of 4. Next time when I went with my husband, they did not include tip in the first check. So we thought Â they probably made a mistake last time. A few days later, I went with my father again. They did the same thing - tried to make us pay tip twice in the same deceiving way. We realized that since we looked like tourists who don't know much about tipping, they tried to rip us off. I gently explained the owner about the situation. To my surprise, her reaction was extremely impolite. I remember how kind she was to us when we looked like locals, who can possibly be repeating customers. However, the way she dealt with this issue was completely different - perhaps she thought we are tourists who have little chance to come back. If only she had apologized, we wouldn't have made this such a big deal. I cannot trust food made by people who lack morality. They may have made a few more bucks by deceiving tourists, but have lost what is most important - trust.
