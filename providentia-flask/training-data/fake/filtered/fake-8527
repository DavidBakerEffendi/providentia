Came here last night to grab takeout for my bf and me. Barely recognized the space!  They took out the old glass/metal floor to ceiling wall and made it an open kitchen.  The chef even chatted with us about the place while he made our food. We ordered the cuban sandwich, the catfish sandwich and a side of the brussel sprouts.  Sandwiches came with fries, and on yummy soft pretzel rolls.  In total we spent about $20, which we usually spend on delivery chinese anyway, but this was actually fresh and flavorful.  A much needed addition to this neighborhood.
