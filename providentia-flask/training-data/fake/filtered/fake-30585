I celebrated my birthday at Hiro what a beautiful restaurant. Simple elegant decor quiet an peaceful. I ordered edamame in burnt garlic oil, chicken strips , and house salad for the table as apps. They were amazing. The sauce for the chicken was Â a mixture of citrus and mayo which was fresh and clean against the breaded chicken that was bursting with flavor. For mains Hiros ramen with extra noodles housed a bounty of flavors with a peice of pork belly and a soy cured egg as a crowning garnish. Amazing time a wonderful place to run into on a cold philly evening and sit over a steaming bowl of ramen.
