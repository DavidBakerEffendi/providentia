What can I say about this place? Pretty much nothing good.  I will separate my review into a few different points for clarity: 1) food; 2) service; 3) overall. 1) Food: Way overpriced for the small portions; this place is not some upscale, five-star restaurant where the small portions are worth the price for the name and presentation of its dishes. The food was served warm, not hot, and it was incredibly mediocre: I had the chicken parmesan and the sauce was watery, the cheese barely covered the poultry, and to top it all off the appetizer (calamari) was undercooked and came only a few minutes before the main course (leaving us with no time to enjoy it). 2) Service: The waiter was incredibly rude and seemed distracted the whole time, almost like we were beneath him, unworthy of his service expertise. He was flippant, slow, and downright unpleasant.  When the dinner was coming to a close, I couldn't be more uncomfortable as the wait staff figuratively shoved us out the door. 3) Overall: I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone; it's overpriced, overrated and just plain not worth your time. How they remain in business is beyond me.
