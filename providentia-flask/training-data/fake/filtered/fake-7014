While on a business trip to Fairfield, NJ I stayed at the  Best Western Plus Fairfield Executive Inn. When inquiring about a good place to eat, the staff recommended the Cucina Calandra Restaurant.  Since the restaurant was part of the hotel, it was very convenient for me. I was lucky to be there at happy hour on a Tuesday evening for the  1/2 price pasta night! It was a very positive dining experience from beginning to end.  The greeter was very punctual, friendly and accommodating. The décor was interesting and unique; service was fast and excellent. The pasta was superb!!!   The nicest surprise of all is when I received the bill, it was  less than $25.00 which included dinner and cocktails!!!! I would highly recommend Cucina Calandra Restaurant for a very Special dining experience ~ My Kind of Place!!!!
