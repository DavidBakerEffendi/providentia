I've been to Audrey Claire twice - the first time was excellent, it was an early weeknight dinner in the summer, perfect weather with the windows wide open, no crowd and fast service.  The mussels were delicious, the rest of the food mediocre (not memorable enough for me to even recall what I ordered!).  The waiter was a little rude and mocked my friend and I for ordering what the waiter perceived to be too much food.  Note: never tell you perfectly in-shape diners that they are ordering too much.  ESPECIALLY when the dishes are quite small. My friend and I decided to go back several months later and bring more people with us.  We made a reservation but they weren't ready for us, so we went across the street to a bar to wait.  They called us 30 min later and told us the table was ready.  We got there within a few minutes since we were so close.  But they weren't ready for us!  The lone nice waiter, feeling apologetic, opened our wine bottles and gave us glasses so we drank as we waited by the door to be called in.  Another waiter took our bottles away and told us to move!  We kindly explained that we had been told our table was ready and that we were encourage to sip our wine by the other waiter.  He had it in for us from that moment.  45 min later we were finally seated and lo and behold he was our waiter.  As it was fall and chilly outside, we asked if they could turn off or turn down the fan.  He said, "No, we can't do that."  So we asked the next waitress, who kindly turned it down. When we finally got our dishes they were a real disappointment (except for mine bc I stuck with the mussels) I think I was the only full person at the table of 10. We tipped the polite waiter who opened our bottles, and told him it was for being nice to us, in front of his rude counterpart.  Service is everything and the food was NOT good enough to warrant even slightly mediocre service, let alone RUDE.
