These folks are amazing neighbors! They give a lot of love to their community and make wonderful food. I am addicted to their chocolate croissants and baguettes. The staff is so lovely, always helpful and friendly, and I go here pretty much every day. The space is gorgeous, too. A great addition to Gowanus!
