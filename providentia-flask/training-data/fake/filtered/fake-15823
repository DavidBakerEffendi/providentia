Cheesecake? Amazing! Service? Pretty Good. Food was very good as we'll. only thing making me not love this place was the long wait since we didn't have a reservation. After seeing a long broadway play with no intermission a guy can get hungry. Our table was better suited for 2 rather then our party of 4 but after eating our food we where pretty happy overall. Will be back again soon. Try the cheeseburger and fries. You will love it.
