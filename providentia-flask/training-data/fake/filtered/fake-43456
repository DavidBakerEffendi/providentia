Delicious food but definitely a bit over priced. It gets really busy sometimes and it seems they cannot handle the amount of people because orders take long and are sometimes confused. Also, the tables are situated relatively close to one another and it tends to be very loud. The food however is fantastic, so I still recommend checking out Paisano's Restaurant.
