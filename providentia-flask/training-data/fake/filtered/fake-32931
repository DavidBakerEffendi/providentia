My husband and I had left one restaurant after dinner, declining a second glass of wine because the ambiance didn't suit us.  We stopped by another wine bar that was also quite loud.  We gave up and walked toward Columbus Circle when we saw a quaint small table near a large window with people inside sipping wine.  Perfect! We sat at the table in the window and enjoyed a lovely, romantic evening with each other while watching people walk up and down 9th avenue.  We were able to have easy conversation without having to compete with ambient noise.  The music played in the bar was perfect.  The service was what we needed without any undue interruptions.   Thanks for a lovely evening!
