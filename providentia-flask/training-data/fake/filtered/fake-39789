I am so in love with my "TRIO" from the London Grill.....It never dissapoints...the trio consists of the following appetizers :  Mussels in white sauce, Potato pierogies, and Tuna tartare.    I have eaten the tuna appetizer at the Capital Grill, which was utterly tasteless, and bland; Have tried the mussels in white sauce at the supposedly french bistro called "Parc" in Ritenhose square, which tasted like epsom salts in mussels...pure seawater, with anemic soft white pomme-frites. Also had  the tuna tatare appetizer at the Prime Rib in center city which which again was tasteless and dissapointing for the price.... The chef Michael Mc Nally at the london Grill has a way with spices ! He is always consistant with my trio- the mussels are loaded with flavor of garlic , onion, rosemary, and you just want to dip your bread in it or drink the broth all up with a spoon!  The Tuna Tartare beats out capital grill and Prime rib because it tastes better than Nobu's version I had at South Beach..he knows how to marinate the tuna to perfection!    Now don't let me get started on the pierogies!  the filling itself, -Mario Battalli would die for ! as Battalli's raviolis filling  is as airy!  it is as smooth as silk with carmelized onions to die for!   and a shout out to our waitress Kelli who always adds to the enjoyment of our dinner  .    The chef I found out was cooking there for over 20 years!  no wonder it is always so good!!!! Sincerely, Kathleen Bradley
