Risotteria is awesome!   If you're on a gluten-free diet, this place is a dream.  I read a few reviews from folks who had bad experiences, but I've been there 4 or 5 times and the food is fantastic.  The breadsticks are out of this world, the pizza is excellent as are the meatballs.  Oh yeah, and of course the risotto. There were some great desserts too.  The brownies are my personal favorite, and the back-and-white cookies were great.  I didn't love the apple pie, but if you don't get a chance to eat gluten-free pie too much even that was a treat. The place is small, and sometimes the wait can be long.  They don't take reservations.  Other than that, I highly recommend a visit!
