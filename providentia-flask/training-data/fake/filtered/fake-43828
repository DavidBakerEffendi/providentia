I am about 7 blocks from Landmarc and I frequent this place quite often especially for weekend lunches or late night meal. I love sitting at the small bar - invariably you have a fun/good chat with friends, bartender or other people at the bar. I love the calamari, meatball spaghetti, and steaks here. On the steak tartar I need extra order of the trimmings to make it tasty for my taste. The wine list is spectacular and it is well priced. I have tried the branded wines and new wines they have - just an awesome collection. The price on the wines are amazing! Love sitting here and drinking wine as opposed to buying in store. Last but not least Â the service is amazing, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable - they remember you and make you feel special.
