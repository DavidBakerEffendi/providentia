I took my husband here for his birthday - first time for both of us! WE WILL BE BACK!! The atmosphere is very relaxing - even with the TVs playing Good fellas and Casino (that was playing the night we visited)!  Jarrod and Francesco were AWESOME!   Very friendly and attentive to ANYTHING we wanted/needed!  Bad service could really ruin a dinner out - but these guys were on the ball!!   You start off with their bread which was AWESOME (if you are Italian you KNOW how IMPORTANT bread is with your meal)!!  Complimentary bruschetta was a GREAT and DELICIOUS surprise!  We then shared the BELGIUM ENDIVE app which I could eat for breakfast, lunch and dinner every day!  AWESOME APP - a MUST HAVE!!  We then had the MEDITERRANEAN salad - VERY FRESH and NOT a lot of DRESSING!!  I had the VEAL SALTIMBOCA (no knife required) VERY tender with mashed and peas and my husband had the  CIOPPINO MULBERRY STREET STYLE (we called it the never ending bowl) as he was unable to finish it.  SAVE room for dessert as their homemade cupcake with ice cream and whipped cream is to die for - AWESOME!!  And to end the evening complimentary glass of champagne!   Speaking with the waiter, he told us that the patio upstairs will be opening soon!  And for you ladies - the restroom was SPOTLESS and me personally tells A LOT about a restaurant as to how clean the keep their restrooms!  Our COMPLIMENTS to the Chef and his Staff for our EXCEPTIONAL dinners and to our waiters!  We felt the prices were VERY reasonable and worth EVERY penny!!  You made my husband's birthday dinner VERY enjoyable and we still talk about how GREAT the food was - we will BE VISITING AGAIN SOON!  THANK YOU! THANK YOU!   A message to the Owners - DO NOT CHANGE ONE THING!!  CAPIRE!!
