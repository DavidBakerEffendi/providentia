First visit,our party of five found the food not so good.  We love vietnamese food and philly has some good viet restaurants so we looked forward to this new one.  On plus side, Staff were highly attentive and atmosphere pleasant.  With exception of Pho, most of what we ate was really bland.    The noodle rolls contained what appeared to be unseasoned dry crumbs or a tasteless powder  of some sort and noodles so hard and rubbery  the  roll fell apart with each bite. They were inedible. The corn and crab soup tasted like water. Our other dishes were passable but not good.  I'll try again in a few months given the good reviews others are writing.
