I've never been disappointed by the Den. Some of the most eclectic, interesting beers in the city with a laid back vibe, great food, and a very professional staff. I've been a regular for about six months there and have never been disappointed. The burger is solid every time, but the kicker is always the beer. Half off drafts for happy hour are rockin, and despite the crowd, service never falters. Despite other reviews I've had fantastic dining room service at the Den, Fransisco especially is an efficient, personable, and professional server. I've been in the industry for a long enough time to know when you're dealing with good people, and they are at the den.
