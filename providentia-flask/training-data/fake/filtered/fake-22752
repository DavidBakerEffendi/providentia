To start, I have been to many Chinese restaurant and know what I should expect. Good food, but probably not so great service. However this one is way below my expectation. Slow service to begin, and then gave us an unprepared dish, and the worst part is that they tried to accuse their customer for double ordering a cup of rice while in fact it was because the waitress gave us wrong food. Then they argued with us on the incident and never apologize for what they said or did. Oh, not to mention they tried to justify their slow service by stating that it would take them twenty minutes To steam a fish. I happened to be a good Cantonese food cook and I know by heart how long a fish dish should take. Don't lie in front of your customer, especially a Chinese who know Cantonese food inside and out. I was not impressed and would never come back again.
