Amazing. Had the Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken Southern Biscuit Sandwich and the regional flight of beer -- it was incredible. The prices were reasonable, especially considering the one sandwich can definitely feed two very hungry people (or you can have leftovers). More importantly, did I mention the biscuit sandwich was incredible?? I'm dying for more. Also, I too (like other reviewers) am someone who hates pickles, but nonetheless LOVE Jacob's Pickles. Definitely do not be discouraged by the mention of "pickles" in the restaurant's name.
