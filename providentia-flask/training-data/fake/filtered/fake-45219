Average Chinese buffet.. Nothing too special!.. Just like most reviews about this I want to mention that not all food is labeled which is unsettling.. Â Sushi however is really good. Not all the sushi is labeled. Not to many choices and staff wasn't very polite. All and all this place isn't the best option. I rather drive much father to a much better buffet. Unless you don't care what your eating or your just in it for the sushi this is your place.. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this buffet.. Entrance is nice.. It's got that going..
