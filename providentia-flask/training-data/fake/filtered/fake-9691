We tried this restaurant Saturday night, thought it was good, so we came back tonight.  It was good, again.   Waitstaff are friendly and helpful with suggestions.  We tried a bottle of Sake and the Love Boat For Two.  No, I can't say that I remember what any of the portion consisted of, but each was obviously fresh, and very tasty.   This is really good food, and I wonder why there isn't a line out the door awaiting entry.
