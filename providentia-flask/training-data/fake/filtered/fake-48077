The moment you walk in and are greeted by your minstrel host, you are swept away to a time of kingdoms and enchantment.  From the tiny sword-shaped knives, to the brawny grunting waiters, to the relentless background ringing of a hammer pounding an anvil, The Smith is sure to be a dining experience like no other.  The midget jester bus-boys feel a bit out of place, but are fun all the same.  Both items on the menu are cooked over an "open fire" and leave something to be desired.  It seems carrying the theme's authenticity over into the actual food may have been a poor choice.  But if you're looking for a fun place to "hammer" away at the monotony of NYC dining, then look no further!!
