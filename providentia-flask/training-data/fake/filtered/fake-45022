It took us 2 months to find our favorite pizza in the upper valley, but it was worth the wait.  This place is amazing.  Great pizza, and the rest of their menu is pretty incredible as well.  Always help you with a smile too.  So refreshing after trying some of the bigger places in the area.  From now on, I'll support the new local shop and get better food in the process. The only negative I can think of is eventually the secret will get out from this review, but their success is more important.  Best of luck guys and we'll see you every Friday for take out!!
