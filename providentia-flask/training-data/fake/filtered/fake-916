1st time at the new Thia Restaurant. The food portions were large. The food was great and the service was on spot. Never had to ask for anything it was like they knew what i was thinking. Think this will be a regular place to go. very good.Nick and Alexis liked the rib bones clean. Nick said those are the best ribs he has ever tasted. The Tiger Steak was great not to hot just right.
