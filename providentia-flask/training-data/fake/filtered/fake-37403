it's so nice after long time i went to Iselin to do some shopping on Oak Tree Rd and afterwards, we stopped in for dinner. We had never been here before so this was our first visit.  Negatives: Not much room for two people as the tables are small and close together. Also, the room was extremely loud for 9:30 at night. Postives:  The food was very good, would definitely recommend.  The service was excellent.  Our waiter was very friendly and  attentive.  All in all, a great dinner was enjoyed and we would most certainly go back again!
