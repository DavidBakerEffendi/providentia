I went there for the first time for Dining Out for Life, 2012 and really liked it.  Great menus.   The fig and goat cheese flatbread was the most commonly ordered item in our group.   Lovely atmosphere and very welcoming to everyone---including a bunch of straight girls :)    I thought the prices were OK and the service was very good, very friendly.    It was a little loud but it is a bar and it was Dining Out for Life night which may have accounted for the extra crowd.
