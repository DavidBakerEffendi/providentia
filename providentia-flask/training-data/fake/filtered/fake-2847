Can I rate zero stars? Because that's what this place deserves. To start, my party was late for our reservations, so understandable that we had to wait once everyone arrived. What is not understandable is scolding that we received from the manager. Like really, as your customer you're going to give me an extra nasty attitude? Life happens and people can't always be on time (and let's not get into the irony of going to a Cuban restaurant and getting screamed at for being late). Despite the horrible start to our evening, we decided to stay... we should have left. The food was mediocre at best, the service was slow and inaccurate, getting our wine bottle opened was like asking the waiter to go to Napa to get us a bottle (in other words, we were done with appetizers by the time he opened it). All of this "goodness" came with a great big bill. I say, stay away. There are a lot of other Cuban restaurants that are better in every sense.
