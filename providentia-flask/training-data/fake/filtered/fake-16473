The food was fantastic!  The onion soup is unlike the gooey French style you're used to, but it was incredible.  The "chopped salad" wasn't chopped at all, but contained chunks of heirloom tomatoes, avocado, cukes, and beans in a light vinaigrette - delicious! The atmosphere is noisy and busy - don't go if you hope to have an intimate conversation, especially if there's a large party seated nearby, as the noise reverberates, and it's nearly impossible to be heard without shouting above the loud voices nearby.  Also, on the night we were there the air conditioning was making the place frigid, and even with sweaters we were miserably cold.  An hour later, after requesting that they turn up the temperature a bit, it did start to become more comfortable. Service at our table was clearly inexperienced - no milk or cream was offered for either tea or coffee, but our waitress was otherwise friendly and competent - just a little shaky on the details.  More attentive management could have solved this problem. I know it sounds like I didn't like this place, but I actually do.  Great food is a perfect place to start, and with a few adjustments it will be a good place to have an evening.
