A couple days ago my friend and I went here for an early dinner after seeing Finnian's Rainbow across the street at the St. Jame's theater. Junior's seems to be a popular spot to eat for theater goers getting out after the 2:00 pm shows during the week but the its popularity is definitely deserved. We had to put our name on the list and wait about 10-15 minutes until we were seated but once got a table the service was fast and all the wait staff seemed exceptionally friendly and remarkably kept cool through the rush. I was happy with my reasonably priced grilled cheese sandwich which came on thick sourdough bread with a generous side of delicious steak fries. My fiend also enjoyed her Reuben sandwich which came with an array of fixings and sauce on the side. The delicious desserts and milkshakes were very tempting but we were too stuffed to try anything. However, I will try to make a point to stop by another time and try their cheesecake which looks like their specialty. By the time we were finished the crowd had died down a little so next time I might come around 6:00 or 6:30 pm rather than 5:00 pm. Overall the service and food were great and the diner style restaurant had a very fun and happy vibe to it. Try it!
