Our evening at the Pines surprised us at every turn and left with us at the end of the evening mulling over one of the best restaurant experiences we have had in ages. The space was warm and inviting , the buzz of excited and enthusiastic diners coupled with the warmth of the rustic interior made us feel at home as soon as we entered. There was a brief wait for a table but we were invited to wait in their large back yard where a campfire was blazing and surrounded by other patrons, chatting and roasting marshmallows. We struck up a few conversations while we waited snugly round the fire until our table was ready. We were guided through the menu by our delightful server who had a fantastic knowledge of al the items and also the wines. She helped us select a great bottle. Simply worded on the menu but complex and intriguing combinations for each course Â that was presented. The bread and cheese plate with a local brie and a simple farm cheese went so well with the (pickled?)strawberries that accompanied them. Pears slathered in goats milk yoghurt and sesame seeds were actually one of the highlights of the meal. The testa was amazing, apparently house made and one of the best I have ever had, served with warm pumpkin bread. The cappellacci was my favorite of the night, stuffed with oxtail and heaped with shaved black truffles, it was amazing. We tried half of the menu and are already planning our return to try the rest. The must haves so far are the testa, the cappellacci and the duck breast-but judging from what we did have the dishes left to try will be amazing as well.
