A few friends decided to check out this byob across the street from Helium before our show. They all have been there before, but my wife and I have not. The menu was very eccentric, and had a wide range of eclectic dishes. All 8 of us had something different and were equally satisfied. The service was very good and the food was delivered piping hot. We would definitely good back again. I would get the rack of lamb next time!
