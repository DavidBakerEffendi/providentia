My review will get right to the food. It was delicious, but the portions are ridiculously small and really expensive for what you get. We ordered what we thought was a lot of food and shared everything. We each felt that we had a "taste" of everything, and we were still hungry when we were finished, dreaming of John's Roast Pork. Even if we'd ordered our own dishes rather than share, we'd still be hungry -- and angry. Yes, the place is cool, and yes, "everyone" was there, as is always the case in a new, hot venue -- but we won't return unless someone with a huge expense account is buying. I could tell you what you should not order (ok - don't get the crudite - it is a joke) but i think i will end my review with, "Go for drinks, or just don't go."
