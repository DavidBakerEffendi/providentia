I live on the same block as Sotto 13 and I was so happy when they opened last fall. The manager is as kind as can be -- always looking to help you and the bartender is amazing. I have thrown 3 parties here -- the party menu is INCREDIBLE - a great deal for either drinks/apps or a sit down dinner. On the weekends they have "boozy brunch" for $25 - also INCREDIBLE. The amount of food you get is crazy, and the "all you can drink menu" is fantastic -- i have even Â told them $25 is not enough!! thats how great it is. I order from here at least 2-3 times a week, and the delivery guy is so sweet and always fast. When I drop in without a reservation, they ALWAYS work something out -- and not just for me, they treat everyone that way.
