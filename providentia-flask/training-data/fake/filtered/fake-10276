A hidden gem! Our waiter (I don't know his name, but, for the purposes of this review, it's Virgil) charmed us and steered me away from a poor wine choice, instead recommending two wines which were fantastic. The food was delicious and filling, the atmosphere delightful. The only drawback: the 12-liter mega-bottle of wine positioned in the window turned out not to be an order-able option. Highly recommended for lovers of "the life" (good friends, good food, Italian style).
