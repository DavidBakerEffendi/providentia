We arrived at 705pm for a 7pm reservation for a party of 5. Confirmed  reservation at 430pm with hostess  who  did not mention any time limit  on dining. Good food good service. At 845pm while were enjoying coffee, dessert and wine a server approached table dropped off bill and began clearing glassware still in use. At 850pm a server dropped off our coat un solicited. At 9pm an individual approached table and angrily informed us that "people were waiting  for the table and we had to leave" Although we were not finished we hastily prepared to depart. One of our party asked the individual  described above if she was the owner. She replied "yes she was the owner, we were very rude and not to call here again" The five of us were SHOCKED at how we were treated. We have all traveled extensively and dined all over the world and could not recall being treated as badly as at this restaurant, AVOID at all cost!
