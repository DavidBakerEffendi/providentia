My husband & I saw "Throw down with Bobby Flay" on Food Network  with Clinton St. Bakery & their "so called" famous  blueberry pancakes, and while in NYC we decided to give them a try.  We were very disappointed to say the least. The pancakes left a funny aftertaste!! Not worth the $13.00 for 3 pancakes for sure.
