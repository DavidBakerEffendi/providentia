This is fun place with a very welcoming atmosphere. We had the flavored vodkas and they were really tasty, you hardly noticed their potency. The borscht, of course is what most people went for near us and we were no different, both of us ordering it. We stuck to the old reliables. Vodka and borscht. It's like we were in Fiddler on the Roof or something. I recommend KTB for an authentic experience, although I can't be 100% certain it is true to Ukrainian culture but it certainly feels like it is. I will be going back for more fun and more vodka too.
