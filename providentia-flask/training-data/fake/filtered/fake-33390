Edo Sushi has been my favorite place for years, and I've literally had sushi all over the world.  Their sushi is always delicious - more than that, it sets the standard. The bad reviews are almost unbelievable.  The place is always very tidy, and the fish is fresh.  Makes me wonder which place these people are talking about.
