This place is the most obscenely overpriced, understaffed restaurant I've ever had the displeasure of going to. We had to search for the host to seat us and then waited another 10 minutes after being seated for our menus, which we had to fetch ourselves. We had to ask for simple things like bread and water, which was never refilled. I've received better service at the Mather Dining Hall than Trinity Restaurant. On top of all other grievances expressed prior to me even receiving my meal, I found the food to be devoid of flavor such that a Lean Cuisine would have sufficed. I've had too many lousy encounters there to give it any more than a single star. 2/10, would not recommend.
