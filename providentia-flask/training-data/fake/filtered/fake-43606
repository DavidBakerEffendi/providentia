I recently visited the Witherspoon Grill as I was visiting friends and they suggested we try it there on my way back to Delaware, as they love it there.  I have to say that is one of the best places I have been to in a long time. The food was excellent and the service was beyond excellent.  Debbie gave great food and drink suggestions for us.   I recommend it, if you have never been there, TRY IT.  I will be going back the next time I visit Princeton.
