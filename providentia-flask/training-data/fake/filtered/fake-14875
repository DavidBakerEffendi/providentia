Came here with 2 other people around 8. It was packed and there was an 30 min wait, but they call you so you dont have to just stand around. When we got there, we got a really good table, half chairs and half booth. Although they were busy, I felt the service was pretty nice, except for the lady who we asked for a second bowl of tartar sauce and in return gave us a death glare and an extra charge. We ordered the pork belly hot pot, the set A skewers(chicken,duck,garlic,pork,),the age takoyaki, fried oyster,and for desert, the red bean mochi with green tea ice cream. I LOVED EVERYTHING. my favorite was the pork belly soup, so flavorful and yummy.....the age takoyaki was really good with the tartar sauce, and the fried oyster was also really good. Coming here next time i think i would skip the skewers(they werent that special and were totally overburnt) but everything else i would give a go. I will def come back here, everything was so yummy! and although they had a line, they didn't try to rush us and came around every few minutes for refills and if we needed anything else. The bill was around$50 with tax so not too bad!!
