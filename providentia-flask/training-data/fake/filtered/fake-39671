This place was recently renovated and changed management; since then the quality of everything has gone way up. Great value for the cost. I had their veg biryani and chana recently; both outstanding. The tamarind sauce and coriander chutney were rich and delicious, better than anywhere (most places water it down). I had these with the papadam which I enjoyed as a light appetizer. My friend had the Mysore masala dosa which I tried a bite of: delicious with coconut chutney and sambhar. Service is excellent Â and the place is clean with its new contemporary interior: simple and elegant; the newly managed India Hut has a lovely atmosphere, great food, and fair prices.
