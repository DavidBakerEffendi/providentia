Total Disappointment.  Great decor and atmosphere, way overpriced mediocre, at best, food.  I've eaten here twice, the first time was not so good, but it had just opened so I waited several months and came back to see if any improvement.  Nope, the meat and sides were of average quality with premium prices.  I had the scallops which were fairly good, my girlfriend had the steak tartar which was heavy and tasteless.  I had their new signature duck dish which sounded fabulous from the waiter, but ended up being pungent in taste with a runny sauce.  My girlfriend had the Salmon, which my guess is that it was cheap farm raised, as it tasted bland and wasn't flaky at all.  The service was a little slow, but nice.  The rustic decor was very good.  I can't recommend this place though, as pricing versus the quality and taste of the food just doesn't match up.  And, it is SOOOOOO out of the way, I can't justify spending the time and money on a bad dining experience.  If you want a drink or glass of wine, maybe.
