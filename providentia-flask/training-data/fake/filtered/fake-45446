This place is mediocre at best.  I recently decided to go out to the Tavern after receiving a Restuarants.com gift certificate but will not be going back.  First of all, the waitress would not accept the gift card because "it was an event night".  The event was a minor league hockey game that was in town!  9 out of 10 nights in Hartford host minor league hockey so basically their gift certs are a scam.  Beer selection is good.  Food is basic and ok.  My tip would be to forget this place and check out the new Russian Lady which offers two floors, free pool and cool bartenders.
