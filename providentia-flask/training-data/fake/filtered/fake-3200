This is one of the best restaurant that you will ever eat at. Make sure you go in hungry. First off if you are trying to go on a friday or saturday night you should make a reservation because this place is always packed. Once you sit down you should start of with a pitcher of sangria. It is fantastic and reasonably priced. I recommend that you get the Roidzio. It truly is amazing. There are so many different kinds of meat from filet mignon wrapped in bacon to sausage to sirloin steak to veal the list goes on and on. If you are a little daring you can even try chicken hearts. The food is simply fantastic and you will leave full and enjoy every bite. Just don't expect to take a doggy bag home because that is not allowed. If you don't want to go with the Rodizio the menu has lots more to offer. Fernades makes one of the best NY strip steaks around and their seafood dishes are also fabulous. When it comes to price Fernandes is also amazing the entrees range from around 25-30 dollars, but in NYC these would easily cost over 50. I can truly say that Fernades is one of my favorite restaurants and I go home satisfied every time.
