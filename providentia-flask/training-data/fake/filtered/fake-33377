Awful, uninspired. I guess when a restaurant is near empty at dinner time is the red flag to try someplace else. Wish we had. Waiter spilled soy sauce on my partners suede shoes, seaweed salad was neon green, what were supposed to be fresh cold noodles (appetizer) were hard on the edges as if fridge burned and should have been served in a bowl not a flat plate. Bad ambiance, waiters could barely speak English....and on and on.....This place used to be good 15 years ago when the old couple was involved. I would never return to this place with the current owners. Really bad. Don't waste your money.
