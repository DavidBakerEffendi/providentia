Joined friends for late night. Waited awkwardly for 5 minutes before finally getting my own cutlery from another table...and my own chair. Ordered a red sangria; given a white one and told "they taste the same anyway." Hello? We is person. If you prick us, do we not bleedz? I would rather has cheezburgerz at Shake Shackz.
