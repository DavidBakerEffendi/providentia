One of the best dining experiences I have had in Brooklyn. Place is very small, I suggest arriving early. The bread was incredibly fresh. Fries were perfect. Food was fantastic.  Corn & Crab Chowder, Fried Oysters, Curry Fish, Tuna Burger were all excellent. Cash only, only down side.  But this place is good enough to bea a cash only spot. BYOB another plus.  There is a nice wine store around the corner on Union.
