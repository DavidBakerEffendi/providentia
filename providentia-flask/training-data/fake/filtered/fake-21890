We ate at both 500 Degrees and Five Guys. Both served good burgers. What follows is a comparison: Cost for burger and order of fries for two - about $20-$22. Burgers - 500 Degrees is the winner. They cook the burger to order, and it seems to be fresh meat, not frozen. Their buns were far superior to those of 5 Guys. 5 Guys, however, includes far more free toppings than 500 Degrees. Fries: Again 500 Degrees comes out on top. Crisp, thin fries were some of the best I have ever eaten. Those of 5 Guys were a bit soggy. Summary: 500 Degrees was a clear winner for us. It was about $2 more expensive for the two of us, but well worth the cost.
