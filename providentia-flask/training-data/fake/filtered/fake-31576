I heard about blend on the water a while ago an I'm so upset at myself for not coming sooner ! It was just an awesome experience from beginning to end.. We had a bit of a wait because we had no reservation but we were sat eventually and our server Felicia had nothing but great laughs and awesome recommendations from drinks to apps to entres and even dessert ! I never really take the opinions of others because I'm a very picky eater but she was very accommodating to my needs, as my mother is a vegetarian; we had the arepas which were especially prepared half vegetarian for us! The pernil, chicken fried rice, red snapper and salmon burger are ALL MUST HAVES ! The mojitos were deliciously flavored in a wide assortment ! (We had guava, coconut, strawberry & mango!) we shared the dessert platter because we couldn't just pick ONE ! We devoured it completely! I must say, Felicia is a phenomenal addition to the amazing view and atmosphere and complimented the chefs dishes with a divine attitude and cheerful spirit. We will return with hopes to have her again!
