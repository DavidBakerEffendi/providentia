My husband and I were driving to Rockport, MA and decided to stop over night in East Hartford at the Comfort Inn!  Across the parking lot was Nolita Ristorante!  What a find!  The food was fantastic!  My husband had the mussel chowder and loved it!  I had the Notlita Chopped greens salad!  Very good with basaltic dressing!  My husband had the Hells Kitchen Linguini and also loved that!  I had the Summer scallops on the specials menu!  It was super special with barley risotto and other delicious things!  We shared a Bombay chocolate mouse threat with Mango Colls and cheese cake!  Totally yummy!  We wish this  restaurant was closer to home--near Philadelphia!  We will certainly stop by again on our treks north!  The service was also fantastic!
