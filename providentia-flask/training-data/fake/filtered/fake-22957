This place was amazing, and best of all, it wasn't very expensive. The service was great. It gets sort of busy later in the night on weekends, but that's at every good restaurant in the city. I had a table of four right by the chandelier. The restaurant is dimly lit (which I prefer) with a great interior design -- looks real fancy. The food was good, I'm not a big judger of thai food, but I had no complaints. Surprisingly, the food wasn't expensive AT all. My meal, which was the squid ink noodles, was only $15. Can't beat that. If you're looking for a nice-looking place that's not very expensive and has a good crowd, I definitely recommend Room Service.
