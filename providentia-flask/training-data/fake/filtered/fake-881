This place is FANTASTIC!!  I've eaten here on dozens of occasions and they never fail to put out great food.  The staff always gives excellent service, even on a Saturday night at 7:30pm with both dining rooms full.  The pizza is to die for.  The hardest thing about eating here is deciding what to eat!!  Everything is that good!  Best of all they deliver!!  If you haven't tried Nauna's you're really missing out!!
