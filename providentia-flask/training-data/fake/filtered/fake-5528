Being a Paleo fanatic I was so psyched for this place to open as there is nothing in the City -- to the best of my knowledge -- with Paleo as a concept. And to top it off, it is right near where I live. Imagine the possibilities.  Now, even though I have eaten there several times (again, there are no Paleo options and only in dire situations will I still eat here!) I am not happy with this place and wish it made major improvements. The food is way over-priced and to be honest not that great. I can cook most of the things they make and was hence expecting a lot more creativity. It is almost impossible to get out of there with a simple takeout meal for under $20 as apart from the chicken meal ($20!!!) the way things are proportioned is very confusing and illogical. They have so many options in a cold bar setting that they will not warm up for you, but even if they did, why can't they pick fewer things and have them hot and fresh? Further, they have to measure each cold item one at a time, so if you wanted a meat and two sides, they literally have to weigh each one at a time and then put it on a plate. It takes way too long for food that is a slight step up from the Wholefoods salad bar. Did I mention how expensive they are? Last time I was there $12 bought me two tiny pieces of turkey meatloaf served cold without a side dish. I was starving afterwards! They used to have really good chicken wings that were free range and reasonably priced, but I guess that wasn't good enough for them and they scrapped them from the menu.   Finally, and this is annoying, they put these little quotes and words of wisdom on a sign outside from time to time. While I am not a nutrition expert, I do know the difference between grassfed, free range, pasture raised and all the other words of Paleo wisdom. Apparently, their expert doesn't as I have seen numerous signs with mistakes on them.
