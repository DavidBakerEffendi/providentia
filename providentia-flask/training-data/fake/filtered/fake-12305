True story.. I grew up in Clifton and never wanted to go.. One day I was out with friends and they wanted to go there.. I was going to go home, but I didn't... I went.. Thank god I did... I had the best night of my life.. I met the man I was going to marry.. and we did... 3 yrs later!  You just knew know what to expect when you go, but  I guarantee it ends with a good time!
