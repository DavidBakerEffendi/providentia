was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was and the service the server paid just the right amount of attention to us . the fact that I am a vegetarian normally makes things a little more uncertain- here the server was helpful and the meal i had was excellent. Â The dessert although I did not need it after such a good meal was just as good. fried cheese cake with a blueberry compote - but the frying was light and crisp and very tasty. I am sorry this restaurant is not neare r to where I live or I would be ther frequently
