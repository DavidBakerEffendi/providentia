I had both lunch and dinner. I found the staff just fine, professional. They were not chatty, but i wouldn't call them sullen. I was happy to concentrate on what my guest was saying. Both lunch and dinner were terrific. The menu was a bit long. So I didn't bother with that. I just asked for what I wanted. Mixed vegetables w/tofu over brown rice in a garlic sauce. Both lunch and dinner were excellent. Portions were large enough to fill me up, even when i was very hungry from walking around & biking all day. Mixed veggies were cooked as expected..firm & a little crunch.. Two things were different from where i live. The tofu was more dense than the bean curd I am used to and I was very happy to order the BROWN rice. Yippee. I really liked the atmosphere. The old building.. The heavy window curtains with beads hanging down at the edges were unique. Very pretty. Overall.. I would say don't miss this resturant when you go to Philly. Visited March 2012
