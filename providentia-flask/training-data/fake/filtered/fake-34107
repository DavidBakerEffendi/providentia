A last minute, Friday night choice, I took my husband to Bistro Mediterranean last week. I'd been there for an Xmas party and was a bit leery about them living up to the standards set at that luncheon. No need to worry; the food was excellent and the portions generous, everything had great flavor and the presentation was creative. The service was friendly and sincere. My husband had the mussels and parmesean fries, an odd combo one would think, but there was nothing left in either bowl! We both saved room for dessert, the caramelized bananas my favorite. It was truly an enjoyable evening and I know we both look forward to any excuse to go back.
