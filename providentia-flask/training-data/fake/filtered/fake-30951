Great place, have just landed it on my radar and have been in for lunch a few times and just went finally to dinner. Have been extremely impressed each time. Always clean, staff is well mannered and knowledgeable, and the sushi is amazing! I dont normally write reviews but I felt appreciated so I am returning the favor. Keep it up Sushi Lounge totowa!
