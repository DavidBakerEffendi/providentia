I organized a company holiday party here and I couldn't have chosen a better spot! Mark Melvin, the restaurant owner, was very accommodating and thoughtful in creating a gourmet menu that fit our budget and palate. He also provided waitstaff-Luis, Kyle, and Lauren, who were very friendly, detail-oriented, and timely. The ambient lighting, intimate set-up, elegant jazz playlist, and the intricately-displayed food, all made up for a rather immaculate and bonding experience. I will definitely look to Boulevard Bistro for future catering events and casual dinners with friends. Thank you!
