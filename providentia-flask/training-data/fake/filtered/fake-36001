"foi grass"? LMGTFY   Anyway, ate at Roberta's on a Wednesday night around 8:15 and found a seat at the bar (inside) right away. I was worried from reading other reviews here about the vibe from the staff, but  quickly found it warm and helpful. Had a salumi plate (excellent), a sweetbread entree (also excellent) and the Falco pie (a take on traditional Napels style salciccia I believe) which was technically done well. To be fair, the only thing wrong with it was that I've had the exact same pie in other restaurants and have been happier. Nothing the pizziaolo can do about that, the pie was spot on crust-wise (crispy, with a bit of char) and a good ratio of sauce to toppings.   With dinner I had planned on wine, but the bar had two of my favorite beers, so... Hitachino  White,  and Modelo Especial. Who doesn't like wine with dinner, but if you're really going to do pizza, in Brooklyn, beer's the only way to go.   The space is nice, just cozy enough without feeling too cramped, and I have to admit falling in love with the front. Cash only here and an ATM right out front? Pure NYC. That would never fly in SF, unless... plus the outside seating area is huge, about the square footage of the restaurant+, and covered from the sun/rain.   Overall, a great effort by a young-ish staff, and a wonderful addition to Bushwick, and the rest of the borough.   My only beef with this place, was that I had a great meal, and didn't bring anyone along to share it with.   On my way out, I started thinking how my night would have been, had I walked in committed to the ideal that the whole scene was "too cool".  Gad I let that go at the ATM out front.
