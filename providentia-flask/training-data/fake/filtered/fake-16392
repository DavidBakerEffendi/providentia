We have lived in Park Slope for three years and only now FINALLY have found a pizza place we love. Since we live about 14 blocks away, I hadn't realized they would deliver to us, but it was no problem. We ordered six large pizzas for a party (Margheritas and Diavolas), and the staff was incredibly friendly, responsive and right on time. Sometimes delivered pizza isn't so good, but this was still hot and just perfect. They were quick. I thought maybe I had ordered too much, but that definitely wasn't the case - everyone loved it. Will definitely order again and maybe trek over to eat at the restaurant, too.
