We all know how hard it is to find a really good pizza place, well if you live close to nino's pizza then you search is over.  I just move into the area 4 months ago and was pleasantly suprised.  The pizza is always good well through and taste great.   They don't deliver, but its worth the pick up, the staff is friendly and remember who you are, I would recommend it to anyone who likes good pizza.
