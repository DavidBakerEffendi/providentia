If you are looking for a mountain of smokey, no-fuss meat deliciousness, this is your place. (As long as you are organized enough to book your brisket weeks/ months in advance.) 6 of us went on an early Sat evening, just before 6PM to make it in time for $3 beer happy hour (mostly a Texan beer selection- perhaps more authentic, but not a good thing), and had the place to ourselves. Brisket, pork ribs, and beef short ribs were the options for the night (all meat is cooked off-site, and brought to Delaney for slicing and serving), along with 6 or 7 sides. We ordered 2 lbs of fatty brisket (you can also get lean, depends on the cut), 3 lbs of pork ribs, 2 potato salads, 1 brisket chili, and 1 collard greens.  Unlimited delicious sliced potato bread, pickles, raw onions, and hot sauce were on hand to wrap up hunks of succulent, dripping brisket. Truly the best brisket we had ever had, and yes, you want the fatty brisket, with its dark black outer char and coffee, peppery rub. Large, meaty pork ribs were also delicious. And the sides are not to be missed: creamy, celery salt-flavored, half mashed, half chunky potato salad, awesome collard greens, and spicy all meat Texas brisket chili. Divided up, it came out to about 2-3 ribs  plus a full cross slice+ of brisket per person. Could have used maybe one more side (I wish they had coleslaw!). Somehow, we still had room for a taste of pie: shared 1 slice each of coconut cream, peach + berry, and chocolate. Meh except for the coconut. YUM Thank BOG we walked across Williamsburg bridge before and after the meal to digest that filling feast. Definitely GOOD BBQ. That said, I am not sure I will crave BrisketTown the way I crave Dinosaur BBQ chicken wings. I love smoke, but I am definitely a saucey girl at heart.
