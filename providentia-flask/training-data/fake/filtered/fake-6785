First time here, what a blast. I stopped in while wating with my friend for the BoltBus to New York. Well suffice to say we missed our bus. A couple of beers turned into Â a party with a bunch of strangers. I wasnt expecting to be hanging out with a band who were due to play at the World Cafe Live a few hours later, a bunch of transportation workers who were ready to party after work and a bachelorette party in full swing. I knew this place was here but never made the trip. The Irish bartender poured me a perfect Guinness and the party was on. The 7pm bus was missed as was the 8 pm bus and the 9pm bus. By the time we left I had a full belly from their superb $5 cheesesteak eggrolls and great Guinness. But it was the customers that made my night, Some of them appeared to be regular imbibers at Slainte but my buddy and I were privy to a revolving cast of great characters. All in all I had a great night at Slainte. I live in Center City so its a quick shot to 30th St on SEPTA. I picked up a flyer advertsing live music on Friday nights so I am gonna be back. My only complaint--too hard to leave ;-)
