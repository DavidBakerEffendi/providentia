Unbelievable, I make an order for a bunch of empanadas of different varieties: ground beef , chili & beef, hawaiian, chorizo. Quantities varying for each. They send the right quantity but it's half chicken and half beef. On top of that the bag is soaked in the sauce they just threw carelessly on the bottom of the bag, These come in open wax paper bags which they threw in the bag upside down so they were all mixed up with no way of telling which one is which. Guess it doesn't matter when they sent the wrong ones anyway. I called back the restaurant and they verified my order was placed in the system and there wasn't one chicken listed. From the one empanada I salvaged I realized their quality has dropped significantly and they don't even wait for the oil to drip off, they just throw it in the bag. It's a shame a restaurant opens and tries to be the best of quality and once they make money they stop caring. Truly a sad day. I will never order from this place again in person, online or on the phone. BTW, I created my first yelp account just so I can make this comment. That's how much I'm disappointed and disgusted by the lack of care and customer service.
