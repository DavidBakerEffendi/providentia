Amazing! Came in with no reservations and even though they were expecting a full house they made a comical scene and sat us right down. We started with the garlic bread, definitely recommend. I had the gnocchi without chicken and it was to die for, huge quantities too. My dad had the pasta rosa which was also amazing. Even after biking 80 miles today, neither of us could finish our meals. When we were leaving one of the owners gave us some biscotti to take home. Definitely recommend this place!!
