A must go.  New chef, new owner.  Charming, warm atmosphere, attractive low-key Asian ambience.  Great for dinner for two (or one) and can accommodate large group at handsome refectory table.  Try house cocktails (elderberry and champagne)  or nicely paired wines and beers. Food delicious and memorable thanks to careful attention of Chef Josh.  Service pleasant and efficient.  Must have starters:  tuna sushi  (amazingly creamy and sweet).  Walnut beet salad.  Grilled octopus has you craving for more.  Short ribs on steamed rice Hirata buns (no better slides anywhere.)  Keep the tastes coming with Miso glazed cod, Jidori chicken, light and delicious, or Dungeness crab risotto.  Fabulous sides especially the addictive sweet potato tots. Save room for dessert.  The coffee and donuts semifreddo and zeppole donuts were never better.  Can['t wait to return and share this delightful dining experience with friends.  MAR-EATS.
