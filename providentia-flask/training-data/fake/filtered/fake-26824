A little expensive but a good place to take people who are being picky about lunch.  Not a huge fried chicken fan but it's good here.  The fish is better if you ask me.  Not as heavy.  Staff is ok.  They will get you your meal, fill your water glass, and drop you acheck.  It's actually exactly the kind of service i like the best but don't expect a TGIF server to sit down and josh with you.
