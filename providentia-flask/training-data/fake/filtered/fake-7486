Had brunch at Balthazar Saturday, April 30. Fantastic! Sat at the bar with my daughter who is very allergic to dairy.  Was amazed at our bartender/waiter's knowledge of the food ingredients and preparation.  Thanks to Chris, my daughter was able to relax and enjoy a fabulous pasta dish without worry. I had the waffles and bacon, which were just perfect. I'm sure all the waitstaff is as well-trained and attentive as Chris, but on my next trip to NYC and Balthazar, I hope I'm lucky enough to be seated again at his station at the bar.  Great food and great service.
