For great Dim Sum, go Saturday or Sunday morning. For a great meal say Saturday evening have their Triple Crown Seafood (squid, scallops and shrimp) lightly battered with salt and pepper seasoning, absolutely wonderful. Hot and Sour soup is very good and their vegetable dumplings are to die for. It is definitely a family style restaurant. I eat there around once a month and always look forward to it.
