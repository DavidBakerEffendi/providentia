I've been coming here for years. The guacamole is always fresh and the salsa is unbeatable. I'm incapable of eating salsa from jars now, anytime I'm craving salsa i call up Beana's and order a large portion of it. I always get the enchilada don verde, by far my favorite dish on the menu. The fajitas are a close second. The atmosphere is spunky and the service is impeccable, all of the servers are friendly and always tend to get a chuckle out of me. plus it's BYOB, which means no overpriced drinks. They provide wine glasses, margaritas, and frosted mugs for whatever drink you happen to bring. I can't say it enough, I LOVE BEANA'S!!
