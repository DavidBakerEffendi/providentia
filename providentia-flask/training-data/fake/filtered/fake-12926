While on a walking tour through Philly with the family, we decided to stop in for pizza.  We were pleasantly surprised with prompt seating for our large party.  The menu had many classic Italian dishes and an excellent set of beers in tap.  Half my family opted for pizza, the other half had a mix of salads and ravioli dishes.  A quick poll after dinner yielded high ratings from each person in my family.  Our server was excellent.
