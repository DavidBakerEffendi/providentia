A greasy spoon diner, with a dirty glass bar. This place is shoddy, and perfect. They make no claims to be much of anything, so there are no expectations to what you're getting. The place is randomly packed with roudy, drunk people at the bar, and families, or neighbourhood regulars stopping in for a meal. And, occassionally, political meetings o-0 The food is consistent, which is a good thing. Everything on the menu is pretty safe to eat. I think I've had all the apps, many of the sandwiches, the salads, and a few of the entrees. The best bet is to go with the specials. Karl puts out a menu every day of soups, apps, sandwiches, and other entrees. When in doubt, ask an employee. They've never steered me wrong. Things to avoid though: the special gumbo (too much okra), the jambalaya (just, no), the mighty mike (just too much goin on there), the french dip (greasy), beer battered portabello strips (soggy and greasy) Things I recommend- buffalo nuggets (chicken fingers tossed in buffalo sauce), bacon wrapped shrimp (amazing bourbon sauce), black and blue burger (cajun seasoning with blue cheese), blackened chicken quesadilla. And the bartenders seem to always know how to make a drink. The bartender on Sunday has a full bloody mary bar, with more fixins than any other bloody menu i've seen
