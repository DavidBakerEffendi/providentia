I am surprised by some of the negative reviews here, but of course most people don't take the trouble to log in and review a place unless they have an axe to grind! I have been here a couple of times, and had great meals. The appetizers are all terrific. I'm a pizza fan, and my friend had the steak and reported it delicious too. Emporio has a lot of atmosphere, especially the skylight in the back room. It can get lively, but if you want to be alone why go out in the first place? Our service was attentive even with a full house. Overall fun and a good value.
