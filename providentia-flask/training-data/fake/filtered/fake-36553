As a Texan native I thought it would be hard to find familiar food during my visit to Philadelphia...I was right. Last week I was staying with my friend in Philly and I decided to try Percy Street Barbecue. I figured I would take an attempt to show my friend what Texan BBQ was like...the attempt failed. The minute we walked into the establishment, I knew it was a mistake. Right when you walk in you are facing the bar and the beer selection was nothing but pathetic. Then to make matters worse I saw a worker who I later found out to be the manager. If it wasn't bad enough to be greeted by her grimace of an expression, her visible bra straps made her demeanor even more inappropriate. Now to the food....I ordered a half pound of brisket and my friend ordered a half pound of ribs. If the meat wasn't a disappointment, the bread most certainly was...the "texas toast" they brought out was an insult to not only Texas but to bread as well. If you want meager, airy slices of bread...then Percy is the place for you. The brisket was dry and stringy, leaving my mouth parched. As for the macaroni and cheese...these chefs should have stuck to Ramen...something even they couldn't possibly mess up. So what did I learn? I learned not to try so called 'Texan BBQ" in Philly...next time I go there I'll stick with a cheese steak.
