Sunday brunch is good;  the atmosphere is relaxed and parking is easy.  My biggest issue with Jesse's for dinner is the lack of parking.  You either have to arrive for happy hour, or have a 9:00 reservation in order to ensure you will have a place to park.  It's really sad, too, because it's a good restaurant.  Recently, we planned a family dinner at Jesse's, had 6:00 pm dinner reservations.  My sister and her husband arrived early for drinks and were able to park.  Myself and my parents (separately) drove around the parking lot several times unable to find a parking space before finally giving up and leaving.  It was extremely disappointing and frustrating.  Granted, it was a busy Friday night, but still, they should have ample parking.  They are not downtown where you have the option of parking further away and walking.  I will return for Sunday brunch, but unless they expand the parking, I won't take the chance of planning another dinner there.
