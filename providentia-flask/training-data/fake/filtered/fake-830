The bar is always fun.   The food is not!  You can go in two nights in a row and order the same dish and you won't recognize it as what you had the night before.  Bad food is bad enough but  when it's not the same each time it comes out of the kitchen, something is seriously wrong!  Inconsistency should be their motto. There is one bright spot - the host Jim.  Not only is he handsome, but he is gracious and friendly to everyone.  He is Knock!!  He makes Brunch fun.  Let's face it, anyone can fry an egg but when you're having fun and are made to feel special that makes eating cold food okay.
