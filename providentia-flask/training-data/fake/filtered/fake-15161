Amazing!  The sushi is fantastic, the ambiance is wonderful, the servers are great, and it doesn't burn holes in your wallet like many other sushi places in the city.  We went to town and only spent $20 a person.   For the money, I have to say that this is by far the best sushi restaurant in Philadelphia.  Highly recommended.  They're new so don't let them go out of business.  This one's a keeper!!!!
