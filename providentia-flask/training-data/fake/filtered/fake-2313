I have been hearing about this place and their blueberry pancakes for years. I felt like the only New Yorker that hadn't experienced them. People from all over the world come here to eat the pancakes and I live in the same city and have yet to try them. So Â I finally decided I had to try them. My friend and I got there and it was a 3 hour wait. I didn't want to wait that long, so we ordered the pancakes to go and ate it at home. We devoured them in seconds. They definitely lived up to the hype. I liked them so much that I created this Yelp account just so I could give it 5 stars haha. Obviously I did not try the other food, so the 5 stars are for the pancakes only. I will probably go back and order the pancakes to-go again. I'm thinking this will be a monthly ritual for me.
