While I prefer Balthazar, Minetta Tavern is worth the visit if you can deal with the cramped space and the sometimes, less than interested service. Hang at the bar and enjoy some great cocktails made by those who actually give a sh*t. The food is simple and well executed. The roasted bone marrow is a blessing. The Cote de Boeff is a transcendent experience and shouldn't be missed. If you find yourself in Manhattan, do yourself the pleasure of Minetta Tavern, then go to Balthazar, over and over again.
