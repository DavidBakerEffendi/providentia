! please   do   not  go  ! this place has so many things wrong with the food ! i know it's new but the food tastes very bland  &  tasteless  because they use frozen pasta my fish was undercooked the service was  poor. it took twenty minutes for a pizza to come out and when it came out it was the wrong pizza lol  two  thumbs down for this place !
