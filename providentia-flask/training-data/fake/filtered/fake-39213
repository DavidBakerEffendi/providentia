I've been in twice within the past week and a half. The food is always excellent, however my overall experience was definitely not. When I'm sitting at the bar, you can read that the thermostat says 83-84 degrees inside the restaurant. Now I haven't even ordered a drink and I'm already sweating. Mike was a fabulous bartender, as usual, but even he couldn't help but say "it's hot in here." Now given the price of a burger is around 13 dollars, the owners can certainly afford to fix the air conditioning based on the upcharge on food alone. You can see the bussers wiping their foreheads because they're sweating from running around. I can't imagine how warm it is in the kitchen but something needs to be done about the AC. If not for the mere fact that many customers are uncomfortable, but your own staff is visibly unhappy about the temperature. I frequented the rocky hill inn since last summer and the heat during the summer was so bad that the other dining room was closed. So it is known to the management that there is an issue, but when you say something to a staff member and they say, "it's not that hot," it's a tad insulting. Trust and believe you have lost a customer for the rest of the summer because of the lack of AC. So I'm writing to further implore my point, when sweat is dripping off your staff's faces or your own customers... the AC issue needs to be addressed.
