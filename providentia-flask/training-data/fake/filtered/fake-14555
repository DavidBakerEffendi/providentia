Service is horrible! Waitstaff walks around in 2's or 3's ignoring customers! I have never been to a restaurant where I had to ask a server walking by where our bar order was & this was 15 minutes after placing that order! Tomato bisque tasted like the tin can it came from. My husband's salad was delivered with the entree which got cold because he wanted to eat the salad. Waitstaff has NO sense of urgency & no desire to serve the customer. My chicken tasted like bacon which I don't eat, so I didn't eat the dinner. No manager ever came over to check or see what the problem was. This was on a Sunday night, ( one week ago), & they weren't busy. My husband and I dine out 2-3 times a week and have never had such a bad experience. This place won't last. There's too much competition in the area. The manager of this place should be fired along with any servers who are unwilling to provide excellant customer service. Re-training of staff is a MUST!!!
