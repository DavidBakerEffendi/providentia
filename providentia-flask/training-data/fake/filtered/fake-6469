The workers were very friendly, but there were no menu or prices.  They only have 3-4 options to choose from.  The ambiance was not good as ambiance can mean everything.  My kids though we were in someone''s house because we sat across from two refrigerators and a blue recliner.  When my family and I got or soups, we were missing the usual side herbs that went with the meal except for the basil and onions.   I ordered beef and it was well done and looked very strange, almost in the texture of corn beef and fat was hanging off the edges.  My husband said his shrimp didn't taste fresh either.  Our total came to $28 for all four soups, so I can't complain about the prices.  My youngest daughter brought the rest of her sop home and refrigerated it.  When she wanted to eat it the next day, I opened the lid and there was fat at the surface, which is unusual for Pho.  So when I went to scoop off the fat, I got some of the broth and it was like gel!  I t thought maybe that was just a little more gross fat that had to be scooped from the top but it wasn't just on the surface.  The broth was all gelled fat.  That explained why my husband was in the bathroom for so long when  we got home. Pho 99 is 100% better! Better ambiance, fresh and better tasting food, has a menu and more to choose from, the bathrooms are spic and span clean, and the staff and owners are extremely friendly and welcoming and will treat you like family. I'll stick with what's better, and it's Pho 99, not Pho 501.
