Spectacular food.  Growing up in London I was used to great kebabs but they are few and far between in the US.  This place has the most amazing kebabs, moist, perfectly seasoned and large portions for incredibly low prices.  It's well worth the 30 minute drive for me to get there.  If you like kebabs or middle eastern or indian style food you MUST try this place.
