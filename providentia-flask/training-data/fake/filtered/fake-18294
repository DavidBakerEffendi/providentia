LONG TIME CUSTOMER WHO WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN. I was in this afternoon and witnessed nothing short of a spectacle. After being a fan of this place since it opened, as well as their other locations within northern/central NJ. I was shocked by Ricky (the manager's behavior). I sat by a table of two young women, each ordering appetizers and entrees. Everything appeared to be going well until one of the ladies asked the waitress for assistance regarding her entree being burned. The plate was taken to the kitchen and Ricky returned stating that she began to eat the food and that she would have to pay for it. I almost fell out of my chair when he said to her, "You eat, you pay. There are no free meals here." He then walked away and proceeded to complain about her to customers at a table adjacent to mine. After some back and forth and telling management that he was unprofessional; the woman, who was obviously bullied and over-talked by Ricky, went to pay for her food and left the establishment. At this point in time I thought it was over with, I proceeded to finish my meal. Not wanting to add fuel to the fire by speaking with the manager in front of customers, I went home and called to explain what I had witnessed firsthand. I was met with Ricky, the hostile manager stating that if I didn't like it, I could come in and pay the server's tip myself. He then hung up on me. In a place that was popular for it's food -- service and the respect of the customer, both new and the "old faithful" like myself, are key. I and my company will NEVER be back. I will also be filing a complaint with the better business bureau regarding what i witnessed.
