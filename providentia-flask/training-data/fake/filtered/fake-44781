Although I wouldn't say that the Chinese food is the best from a general standpoint...I do think that it's among the best in the area.  It's good food but nothing about which to go crazy, in my opinion. The szechuan dishes are tasty, and I like how the restaurant uses zucchini instead of broccoli in some of their dishes, it's a nice touch.   The tofu vegetable soup is a nice complement to any meal. My only complaint is that the dumplings are a bit on the doughy side.  Cheng Du makes the best dumplings in the area, they don't overpower it w/ a chewy texture.
