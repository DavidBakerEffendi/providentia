This place never let's me down. Ricotta gnocchi were like supple little clouds. Pork loin with squash and Carbonara were amazing. We had a great server this time (last time our guy was a bit of a smart ass, but I can deal with it as long as the food is great) I hope this place never goes away. My favorite place in NYC. Smooch!
