This review is for the Chinese dishes from the menu.  Chinese food here used to be good but I do not know what happened within the last year. Pricing is not aligned with quality of food. Way overpriced. Some foods are relatively flavorless with lack of seasoning (we had pork fried rice - was probably the most ok dish of the night, pepper steak -  definitely not enough actual steak in the dish, vegetable fried rice - pretty close to just plain white rice, vegetable lo mein - not enough seasoning/flavor, hot and sour soup - lacked the spice this soup should have - I think the menu should just list it as sour soup) - so if you are a fan of blend foods I mentioned this might be the place.  2 stars just because it used to be good. Once again, Chinese food is overpriced and the quality is not there to justify pricing - I would not complain if the quality was there.
