Groupon deal made this place more than worth it. I came twice with my boyfriend. 1st time entree: Salmon which my boyfriend said was really good. I had the chicken penne vodka which was absolutely fantastic! It was really good and I seriously couldn't finish it all. Dessert: The tiramisu was just okay. It had this powder on top that made us choke whenever we had a bite. Although comical as heck, it wasn't the ideal dessert for a cute date. 2nd time entree: We both had the Burgers with seasoned fries which were so good!!! They were HUGE burgers and seriously filled us up. The seasoned fries are a whole lot of YES so I highly recommend paying a bit more for those. Dessert: The Canolis were pretty good. It came with 2 small Canolis. Overall I love coming here and would recommend it to everyone. The waiters are friendly but aren't as attentive as I'd like.
