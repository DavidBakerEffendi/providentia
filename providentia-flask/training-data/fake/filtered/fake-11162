DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME or MONEY!!!  You can eat much better in so many less expensive and less crowded, much more civilized restaurants than this place.  You can also shop at many places with greater variety and much less expensive prices and the food comes from ITALY NOT MADE FOR EATALY!!!  This place is a ripoff with a number of rude senior staff members .  It's a tourist trap!  I ran into a group of Italian tourists who walked around and laughed at the place.  Anyone who has been to Italy knows better than to believe this place!
