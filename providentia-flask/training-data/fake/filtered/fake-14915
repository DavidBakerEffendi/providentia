Went there on the spur of the moment. Our server Natalie was excellent - attentive to our needs and very prompt. Ashley, the bar tender, took our special drink order with aplomb and delivered some of the best Dewar's sidecars we've had anywhere (most bar tenders really screw it up). The Ahi Tuna Stack appetizer is to die for. They had a soup of the day - black bean cheddar soup - that was superb. The menu has a good assortment of choices that can meet the needs of almost anyone in the crowd. The chocolate souffle topped off a great evening. Thanks Natalie and Ashley!
