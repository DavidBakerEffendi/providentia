The people where so nice and polite. The food was good and had solid portions. The bugars tasted fresh and had a a homemade feel to them. Even their sides where given in generous portions and looked and tasted like they where homemade. I would recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a quick bite or a whole meal. I loved it.
