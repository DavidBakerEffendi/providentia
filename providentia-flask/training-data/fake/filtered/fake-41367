I've had a good experience here and a delicious burger. That said, I went back with a friend last Sunday early for brunch and it just didn't turn out so well. Friend and I each ordered the Bistro Burger and both had the same feeling that it came back a lot rare-r than expected for a medium burger.  We didn't want  to complain so we left that alone. The service was ok-a bit slow throughout but not a real problem. Then we get the bill. We had indicated we were in a hurry to finish and pay. Waiter brought the bill for our meal and we gave 2 cards to split it on. He charged our cards and we signed, tipped, finished our transaction. We were finishing up our drink as the waiter comes back and lets us know that he has 2 new bills for us-the bill he split onto our CC was another table's (although the original check he brought us was ours--guess we should have checked the math).  He then requests our CCs again and takes them back to reverse the previous transaction, and re-charge our cards for the correct amount--this takes almost 5 more minutes which is not that long but frustrating when you've indicated you're in a rush to go and the error was no mistake of your own. All in all - splitting the wrong bill on our CCs was his mistake and he should have let it go instead of making us wait while he fixes his error, and giving us reason to audit our CC statements making sure we aren't charged twice. Will probably go back but not for a while...
