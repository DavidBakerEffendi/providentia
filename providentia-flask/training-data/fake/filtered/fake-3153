Come here for the pork and brisket sandwiches! They are irresistable and it is all brought together so perfectly. (The meats, sharp provolone, brocolli rab) The only thing that sucks is the lines on the weekends. I can only go to Philly on weekends because of work and sometimes the lines are too long! Once i actually waited for an hour and by the time I got close, I was told they ran out :(
