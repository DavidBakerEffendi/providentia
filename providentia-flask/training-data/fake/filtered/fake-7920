I wish I discovered this place sooner. I had the pumpkin pie cheesecake last time I was there and I almost ate the plate it was so good. And I love that they offer agave nectar as a sweetner. Many shops in Philly offer soy milk, but only Grindcore house offers so many different types of vegan milks to add to your coffee. It's very welcome variety. The art gallery only adds to the wonderful atmosphere. I'd hang out there all day with latte in hand.
