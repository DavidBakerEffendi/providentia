I came in here with ridiculously high expectations and I gotta tell you, it didn't measure up.  Yes, the food is definitely good but not knock your socks off good. I ate the Chicken Parmesan and the missus had the Lasagna.  We also had a mozzarella/prosciutto appetizer which was just average.  All of the reviews about the unnecessarily long specials menu are accurate.  Our waiter was talking for at least 10 minutes.  Just put them in the menu and call it a day.  I would compare this Italian Restaurant to Parkside in Corona Queens.  Parkside used to be amazing but has gone downhill a bit and is now just average.  If you want really really really AMAZING Italian food you gotta go to Don Peppe's in Ozone Park.  Not to mention, you're surrounded by mobster looking like individuals that kiss each other out of respect.  So, with that being said, bring your appetite, keep your mouth shut and you'll have a wonderful experience.  Also, bring CASH.  They don't accept credit cards.  Hope this helps.
