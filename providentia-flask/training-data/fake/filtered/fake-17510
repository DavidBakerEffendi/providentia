I don't know why there's such a hype about this place. To start, my friends and I got there a little bit before they opened and there was already a line. I didn't mind waiting, even though I was starving, since my friend already told me that the line moves fast anyway. The line did move fast. There's one guy collecting the money and the other guy for ordering and getting the food. It's not their service I'm rating 3 stars though: it's the food. The chicken over rice came in a tin foil pan, okay, whatever. But the chicken was chopped so fine that it kind of just mushed into the rice and sauce. It's a personal preference, but I prefer my meat to have some texture so I don't feel like I'm eating something grounded, which, honestly, can be anything.
