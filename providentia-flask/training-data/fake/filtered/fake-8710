Last Sunday, my husband and I rented out Modo Mio for three hours for what guests believed to be a wedding reception dinner. We surprised our guests with a wedding ceremony. It was one of the best days of my life, largely due to the professionalism, accommodation, and hard work of the staff at Modo Mio. From the planning stages, the manager Chris Curtis was extremely helpful and very open for me to decorate however I wanted. He answered all of my questions in a timely manner and made sure his staff was aware of the details of the day. On the day of the event, staff came in earlier than scheduled to assist in setting up. Lucy and Gared helped move tables around, hang pictures, set-up centerpieces, etc. Throughout the evening, the staff was welcoming and extremely focused on our guests. The customer service was phenomenal and nothing was too much. Additionally, both Lucy and Gared remained calm and flexible throughout the entire evening. One of the reasons we chose to have our wedding at Modo Mio is the quality of the food. It is, hands down, our favorite restaurant. We love the Sunday family style menu and wanted our guests to have the same experience. Last Sunday, the food was incredible as always and we were thrilled our guests got to experience that. Many of our guests informed us that it was the best wedding they ever attended and the best meal they ever had. Thank you so much, Modo Mio!
