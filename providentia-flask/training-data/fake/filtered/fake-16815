I am deeply saddened to say that I cannot give ABC Kitchen 5 stars.  Although all of the food was delicious, I believe that ABC Kitchen is passing off Chinese Truffles as French Truffles.  I ordered a pasta dish with a large helping of truffle on it (and paid significantly extra as well!), and when I tasted it...it had absolutely NO truffle taste. It was a bland, chalky taste.  A real shame.  I informed my server and she simply said that it was "too bad."  Caution yourself when you order anything here with truffle on it. I absolutely love truffle, and what I was served was not French or Italian truffle- it was flavorless. I am saddened that this happened to me at a Jean Georges restaurant.
