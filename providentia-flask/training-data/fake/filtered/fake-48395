I tried this place once late night after hearing all of the Pat's vs. Geno's hype. To be honest, I wasn't that impressed with the cheesesteak. It was was good, but hardly that much better than a cheesesteak from any other hole in the wall restaurant on South Street. I guess it's cool that this place is open all the time and has become something of a Philadelphia landmark. I give it credit for that, but the food is nothing to write home about, in my humble opinion.
