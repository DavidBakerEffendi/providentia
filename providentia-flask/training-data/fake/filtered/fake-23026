Big disappointment, bad food and they acknowledged they knew it ! ... Ummm... hello?? Came there with my girlfriend for dinner. At first, we noticed the staff was quite friendly, and our waitress was very nice. I ordered tuna and my girlfriend ordered lasagna. My tuna was barely ok, but my girlfriend ended up sending her lasagna back after 2 bites - it was baaaad! They apologized to her and said that "this is not the first complaint we've had about the lasagna..." They tried offering us other dishes but we both weren't very hungry anymore. A few minutes later, without asking, they brought us 2 (unsuitably oversized) forks and tried to pitch dessert. "No thanks". In the end, another guy came out and apologized again, and again said they knew about the problem before... The whole experience was quite funny, but if it weren't for the friendly waitress, we would have both walked out on the spot. If you know you have a problem with some specific dish, do not try to feed it to other customers. You can not afford to be so unprofessional in such a competitive environment. It appears that this restaurant needs a quick reorganization and a management change - clearly something is severely broken here. Eat there at your own risk!
