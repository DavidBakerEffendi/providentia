I love Rosario's they have super fast delivery---most of the time they are faster than the grub hub estimated time. They have fantastic chicken or steak nachos, quesadilla's and even great salads. Not a fan of the pizza but hey its not an Italian pizzeria. I wouldn't suggest eating in---theres a line of tables but there isn't much space in the restaurant. The tables with the most room are right by the bathroom. Pick up or delivery are the best options. There is a TV but its mostly for the workers.
