I have lived in Verona for almost 14 years. One of my first times going to Famous Rays,  I really enjoyed it. The cheese tasted great and the  crust was awesome. After going a few times a month, it was still pretty good. Eventually I stop going for the past 3 or 4 years due to my schedule. A couple weeks ago I was craving some of their pizza. So, I went and ordered 2 slices of pepperoni. After having to wait almost 20 minutes and having the staff kind of ignoring me, they handed what looked like hot grease with some pepperoni on top of a really badly burned bread. Then.... I tried it. Ughhh!!!!!! It was horrible! I was extremely upset about what dump this place has become. Also, it could use a good cleaning.                                  If you are not from Verona or are not familiar with good restaurants in town, I suggest you look at the following -Mr. Bruns 8/10 -Salugo Bistro 8/10 -Verona Inn 10/10 -Frank Anthonys 7/10 -domino's 5/10 -Melies 10/10 everything is always great, next to dunkin donuts and a gas station -verona pizza 9/10
