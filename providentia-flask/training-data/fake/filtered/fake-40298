I was going to write a review complaining about my wait for a table at Cheryl's, which was well worth it once we were seated, but I must comment on JoAnna B's review.  OF COURSE YOU CANNOT BRING YOUR DOG INTO THE RESTAURANT!!!!!  It would be very hard to believe that being pet friendly means that you bring your dog into the restaurant, oh and by the way, why don't they have a place setting for the dog or maybe the dog can climb up on all of the tables and randomly sample everyone's meals.  I Love Dogs and I think that some dogs are cleaner than some New Yorkers, but that is utterly ridiculous that you would think that you could bring the dog into an eating establishment.  A restaurant can be cited and shut down for such a violation.   Back to my original review.  I believe Cheryl's is such a nice and cozy spot.  The wait is sometimes a bit long for Sunday brunches, but as I said before, definitely worth the wait.  Gotta try the poached eggs over salmon hash!
