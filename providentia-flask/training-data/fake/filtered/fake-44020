Great spot, try something new, drink some great rum. Huge rum list! I always eat way too much here. Two arepas were enough. Why order a third? The interior is nice, "favela style" and its great for a few friends/small group and drinks! Service is okay, no complaints. And the sauces on the table, oh my god. Please try not to steal it!
