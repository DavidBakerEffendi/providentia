So not worth it. Such a crappy diner and totally over priced. Been here several times, attempting to give it another chance time after time, and time after time they disappoint. Service is bad. Last time I ordered take out, they said 15 minutes for an omelet, and I got there 25 minutes later. There were at least 5 servers on the floor and the owner behind the counter, so I don't really understand why I was waiting so long for food I order 25 MINUTES PRIOR. Then after the first 5 minutes of waiting, I told the owner behind the counter I was waiting for an order for pick-up. She gave me attitude as if I was rude for asking for my food. Now, I thought the whole point of ordering take out is that you don't have to wait for ten minutes to get your food. Now normally, I would never write a review. But I was a waitress for 5 years. There were max 12 tables filled with people, with at least 5 servers. I used to handle 7 tables on my own so there Â is really no excuse. People who work there look totally unmotivated and bored.
