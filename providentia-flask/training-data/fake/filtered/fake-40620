For a few years I've been on a quest for the best pizza in NYC, and I was eager to taste pies from the first pizzeria in America. I even brought some friends who used to live here. Having grown up in Rome, Italy, I appreciate the crust more than the topping, which seems to be the main criterion for American palates. Alas, Lombardi's was a big disappointment. The crust was thinner than the American average, but still not as thin as Roman (Latium) style pizzas'. On the other hand, the dough was not as savory as the best (thicker) doughs that can be found in the Neapolitan pizzerias that sport the brand "Vera Pizza." I was surprised to find myself even more let down by the topping. Our second pie was their "Original Pizza," which is pretty much the "Margherita" you can have in Naples. The topping was so scarce as though they had run out of ingredients. There were few shreds of basil leaves, little mozzarella, and if there was any grated Romano it must have evaporated. A sprinkle of (hopefully extra virgin) olive oil on the pie right out of the oven, like the do in some Italian pizzerias, or even here (I've seen it done at di Fara's which is a parlor and does not have the benefit of a wood or coal-fired oven), would have rescued the pie by softening the crust, especially the large swaths that had not had the benefit of topping, as well as enriching its flavor. I tried this trick on the slice we brought home, as an experiment. It tasted better out of my humble toaster oven than fresh from Lombardi's oven. I hope our visit was just a bad night for Lombardi's, but they are far from topping my ranking. John's on Bleeker, despite their inconsistencies, is much better in my humble opinion.
