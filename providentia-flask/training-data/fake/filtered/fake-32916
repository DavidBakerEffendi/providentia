There is a reason they had to change the name from Vinny & Sons and my guess it was to run from their reputation for mediocre food. The pizza altenates between poor and inedible and their food is only marginally better. I have ordered take out from there twice and twice the order was completely wrong and cold. Don't waste your money.
