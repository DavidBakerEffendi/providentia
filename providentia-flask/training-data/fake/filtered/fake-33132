I have eaten at Westville over twenty times. Impeccable service. Fast take-out. Reliable delivery. Delicious food! The only con is that Westville is always packed. It's not a first date place because it's loud, but it's my go-to spot to catch up with friends. It is well worth your money to buy three sides for $15 bucks. My favorites: -Greek Salad with Grilled Chicken -Veggie Burgers -Sweet Potato fries are to die for! -Pies/Carrot Cake
