Like many reviewers, I really wanted to love this place. The location is perfect for me and I thought it could be a go to place. Sadly, it's not looking good. It is not a well managed place, from the hostess through the dining process, it screams for professional management. The hostess, Christina, barely looked us, gave us a menu insert rather than the full menu, was chomping on gum and offered zero in the way of greetings or enthusiasm. This is the first impression, the owner should understand how critical this role is and staff accordingly. It took forever to fulfill very basic drink orders and no one ever cleared our table....ever! I couldn't take all of the dirty plates on our table so I took the liberty of busing our table myself and no one noticed! Again, very poor management. Our waiter, Brett, was phenomenal. He did the best he possibly could considering he was stretched way too thin. He acknowledged, in a very charming and professional way, how bad the service was and gave us a desert on the house, which was wonderful. The food was pretty good. I am giving 2 stars instead of 1 because of Brett and the food. I agree that it is loud but I didn't mind that at all. I truly hope someone from the Centro team reads this review and takes the constructive criticism to heart. With proper management and an investment in training this could be a highly successful restaurant. Because of the quality of food and location, I do plan to return and hope for the best. Maybe 2014 will be a better year for this establishment.
