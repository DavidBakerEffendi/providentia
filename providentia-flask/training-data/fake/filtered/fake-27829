Great restaurant, I'm definitely a fan.  Will go back.  Owner was in this night and was very hospitable, holding our table and reservation (for four of us) even though we were over 30 minutes late and there were others waiting.  Wow!  That's incredible, did not expect that.  Food was yummy.  The kitchen was a little slow getting us our food and the waitress gave us two extra glasses of wine as compensation without even asking.  Food was great, the place gets a little loud, but overall I love this place and we will definitely be regulars.  Five stars for the price (totally reasonable for the quality of the food), the level of hospitality and service (these folks are wonderful, and just being a great neighborhood place.
