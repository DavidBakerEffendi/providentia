We just returned from dinner with two close friends.  A summer Friday night, the restaurant was uncharastically less busy than our previous visits.  In fact to our surprise the two tables behind us sat empty from the time of our arrival through desert.  So too was our surprise at being rudely told by the manager, the man in the wrinkled and uncomfortably tight suit, that after spending $400 on dinner, we had overstayed our welcome - "he had to turn the table over".  Funny the place didn't seem that busy.  While he had the opportunity to politely invite the four of us to the bar, he instead choose to be brisk and rude.    Maybe this made him feel important?  Maybe his pants were too tight?   Maybe his demeanor could explain the two empty tables behind us?  Either way, he will not see the four of us again.
