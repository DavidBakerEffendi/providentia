The food is very tasty and the drinks are great but the service is very poor. My family and I have resorted to ordering out instead of dining in. I don't think we will be eating there any more, we recently placed an order 55 mins in advanced becaus they are kind of slow, my husband gets there and not only is the food not ready but its also not in the system. Â We have to wait an additional 55mins for food! If you like rude service and over priced food then Star Tavern is your place.
