I am not quite sure what most reviewers are talking about. I have been to this restaurant many times (more then 20) and while every experience was not "perfect" overall any problems were handled professionally. I have always had a good meal and I have eaten most things on the menu. I think during almost every meal the manager stops by and checks in on your experience. That would certainly be the opportunity to let them know if you have some of the concerns of other reviewers.   This is not an inexpensive restaurant and the ambiance, food and staff reflect that.  Definitely a restaurant that I will continue to return to!
