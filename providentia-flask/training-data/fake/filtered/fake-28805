Enjoyed a delicious dinner at the Hourglass Tavern, and there are, indeed, working hourglasses on the wall. The service by Kelly was excellent, efficient and friendly. He made knowledgeable recommendations which we went for with no regrets. Both dinners were specials -- one the leg o lamb cooked to perfection and the other butternut squash pasta, which tasted even enter than it sounded. We enjoyed both red and white wines by the glass, and they hit the spot. The restaurant is very small, but extremely efficient. There are three floors and we didn't get past the first. Great spot before or after the theater. We'll definitely return!
