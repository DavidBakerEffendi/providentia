What makes this place great is the beer selection and decent prices. Not the best selection of food as the menu is limited it has some pretty out there choices. The place fills up pretty quick but we've never had to wait long for a table. It's dark inside and usually cramped. Average age of customer would probably be upper 20s and 30s in my experience. It's our go to place when we don't want to travel far for a drink and some light food.
