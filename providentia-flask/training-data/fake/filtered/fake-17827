The food was pretty good; however: -it took about 15 minutes to get a regular cup of coffee -it took about 25 minutes to get a gingerade and a brunch cocktail -they delivered our food to the people next to us (who came in and ordered after us) -my eggs were over easy instead of medium, I had to remind them I ordered a biscuit, and I had to request the jam that comes with the biscuit -there was some obvious hostility between the wait staff and the bar staff Keep in mind, we sat AT the bar. I may give it one more shot, but it certainly failed to meet expectations.
