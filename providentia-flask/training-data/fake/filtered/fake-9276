On Saturday I enjoyed the best meal I've had in months. This place is spectacular. I live in Boston, but would recommend a trip up to Burlington for the sole purpose of seeing the lake and enjoying L'Amante. I went with the whole family, and so was able to try many of L'Amante's dishes. The winners, in my humble estimation, were the squash fritters to start, the penne bolognese, chicken, and mushroom asparagus ravioli. The cr√®me brulee and strawberry balsamic ice cream were out of this world. It's a rare restaurant that gets me out of my own kitchen and away from the burrito stand. L'Amante was just that restaurant. Well worth the price and the trip up North. Simply delicious!!!
