Extremely disappointing. They advertise all you can eat blue crabs from 12-4PM. We showed up at 12:20pm on a Saturday and the place was empty. There may have been 4 people eating crabs.  We were informed that they were already out of crabs 20 minutes into the deal!  They shouldn't advertise this deal on their website if they only have 40 crabs for the entire day.
