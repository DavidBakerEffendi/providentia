I found this place by sheer accident - and just thought its excatly what it should be. A bit dirty, very cheap and...great dumplings. There were no seats, and my friend and I had to wait around 10 minutes to sit down. It was authentic - real food for real people, real prices (you do'nt feel like you need to pay for the interior designer and overall renting costs) - will absolutely go again if I'll be lucky enough to stumble upon it.
