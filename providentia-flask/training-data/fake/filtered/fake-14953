My husband and I LOVE Mama Palma's. We were both big fans of Mama Palma's while in grad school at Wharton and Penn. We both knew the owner before we knew each other and when we walked in on our second date, we got such a warm welcome! The owner is amazing and does everything to make your experience the best it can be. The pizza is original and sooo delicious... be sure and try the polenta bread too. It is hands down the best pizza in Center City Philadelphia!
