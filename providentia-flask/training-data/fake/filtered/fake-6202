Bruno's in Lyndhurst should get an award for the worst customer service. After delivering an incorrect order to my house, it took 2 phone calls and 28 minutes to receive the order I placed and paid for. And the owner/manager would not get on the phone with me to issue even an insincere apology. A neighborhood restaurant should treat their customers better than a chain. In Bruno"s case, I guess not.
