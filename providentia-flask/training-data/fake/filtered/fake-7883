This Thanksgiving I decided to have our meal catered by Sandra's Next Generation. It was one of the best decisions that I ever made. I placed my order two days before Thanksgiving and this restaurant staff handled the rest. The entire meal was delicious, especially the perfectly seasoned turkey! My family enjoyed every bite of the collard greens, yams, stuffing, and corn bead. I truly appreciate the staff for allowing me to concentrate on the true meaning of the holiday which is family time; instead of stressing in the kitchen! I plan to utilize their catering services for Christmas!
