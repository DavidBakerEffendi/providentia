Don't get the wrong idea--this place has completely homely ambiance.  Don't go there to impress anyone.  Go there to have good pasta and salad at a fair price in an otherwise over-priced area.   I've been coming to Il Corallo since 1996.  I don't think the decor, the staff, or the penne melanzane has changed.  I feel like I'm walking into Seinfeld-era NYC when I come here.   Which is a good thing.  You know what?  I'm giving it five stars.  I am so very grateful that this place exists.
