Been here for brunch a few times.  Never disappointed.  I especially like the turkey burger (magically, it's not dry like other turkey burgers).  Service can be a bit ditsy: the first time I ordered it, I asked how the turkey burger was; my server told me that he's not really into that vegetarian stuff, but he's heard it's good.  Um, sorry kiddo, but turkey was still an animal last time I checked.  Everyone there is quite friendly, though, and our orders have always come out quickly, tasty, hot, and correct (much more than I can say for some other places).
