I love this place. The meatballs, the sandwiches, the pastas, the lobster ravioli...I love it. I don't go here all that much, its more of a treat on a day when I have time to drive around. Robbinsville is a bit away from where I live in PA. That said, it's worth the drive and makes for a great treat. The cannolis are about the best I've had, I need to explore NYC Italian shops some more..well and go to Rome too. I don't have any complaints really. I do wish the proscuitto they sell was not of Boars Head Co. There are other companies that make proscuitto, wish they would get it from someone small, artisanal. Beyond that, with La Stalla in Newtown up for sale, I wish Dolce & Clemente's would consider buying it and taking over the Sleepy's next door. Make a nice size Italian market. The area would love it. Di Brunos would probably feel they'd need to open up some place in Bucks County as well especially as Eataly plans on opening up a store in Philly. Competition...it's good for the tastebuds!
