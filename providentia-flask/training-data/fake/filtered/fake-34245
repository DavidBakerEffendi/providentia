Excellent sushi. But a bit pricey. I just came back from Japan and I have to say that this is on par with some of the best sushi that I had over there. The service is excellent and the fish is prepared freh and ohhh so yummy. My favorite is the fatty tuna "toro". It just melts in your mouth. I loved sitting at the counter and watching the chefs work their magic. I highly recommend you use the Japanese term "omakase" They will serve you what is recommended that day. Don't forget the sake!
