Needed to have a quick lunch close bye in South Philly. Read the reviews and thought I would give it a try. The Summer rolls are some of the best I have ever eaten. Fresh and tasty. The Tom Yum, soup was delicious along with the Best pad Thai. Price was reasonable and I will be returning in the future.
