Just recently discovered this place. Have been back maybe 12 times in the past few months. I keep going back to this place for one simple reason. THE FOOD IS GREAT. The roast chicken is tender and delicious. The Ceviche is sooooo good.The rest is also very good. Depending on your appetite and cost only about $30. Chicken alone is worth the price. The restaurant itself tends to be calm and friendly. Service is fast and graceless. I wish I could give the place 10 stars... oh yes..almost forgot about the FLAN....THE BEST THING EVER!!!!!! Go there NOW
