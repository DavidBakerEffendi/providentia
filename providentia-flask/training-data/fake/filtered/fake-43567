Amazing. Reservations for 7pm on a Sunday night for 5 people. We arrived at 7:10pm and were seated immediately. A waiter was about to take our order but was brushed aside by the owner who took our order by memory. After reading terrible reviews about the owner, I was on edge, but everything went smoothly because we ordered family style and spoke in Chinese. Dandan noodles were very good and spicy of course. Fuqi feipian (thinly sliced beef) was amazing (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuâ€¦). Our tongues were burning from the peppercorn so beware. San bei ji (three cup chicken) was very good also. We were expecting meat on the bone, but instead it came out as small pieces of chicken. The twist made it much easier to eat. A tiny bit too sweet but still very good. Hui guo rou (twice cooked pork belly) was also very flavorful. Overall, the best Chinese food I've had in a while.
