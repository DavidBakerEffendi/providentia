WE were in the area and some friends recommended that we try this new pizza resturante.WE were suprised to find that they had  a great variety of  food chioices on their menu. The service was friendly and fast. I had the lasanga which was made perfectly. I love potato croquets ( ponzarotti ) they wre great i actually had them wrap 3 more to take home with me. The prices wre very reasonable. I would recommend this place
