I work nearby and order from OSH all the time.  While the food is good, the service is beyond questionable.  As of late, delivery orders often showed up cold, late, and incomplete.  When we called back to asked for the missing food, the owner would promise to deliver the missing food immediately.  However, our missing sandwiches never shows up.  On three different occasions one of my colleagues would pay for a sandwich and end up starving.  We will NEVER order from this incompetent amateur operation again!
