Today, I ventured out to see what all the gossip was about in Chef Garces new establishment. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a very attentitive staff who seated us immediately. Bread and water arrived within seconds of being seated. We started with the margehrita pizza. The crust was tissue thin but the copious amount of salt added to the crust destroyed the taste and ruined the pizza. Next was the potato and leek soup with seared sea scallops.  This was absolutely perfect! The soup was delicate with a superb consistency and the scallops were seared to perfection.  Our next dish was a pasta course which was made fresh on location.  We enjoyed the lamb ragu and fusilli with poached egg.  Both pastas were 16 to 18 dollars but left us feeling very short changed.  At this price, the portions could definitely be a bit heartier.  Each pasta was delicious but not an absolute for the budget conscious consumer. Dessert featured an assortment of cookies and French pressed coffee.  Both were reasonablly priced and complimented one another wonderfully.  We were able to get a 4 top table but those who came in later during the lunch rush were seated at 6 and 8 top tables that already had other customers seated there.  So you maybe bumping elbows with other customers while eating during high volume times.
