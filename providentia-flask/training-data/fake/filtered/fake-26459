A long time patron. I love all their pizzas and hot subs. I first discovered his former location, Franco's in Foxen, during my commute from Chester to New Haven. They were the only establishment that provided foam containers for their subs. Since I still had a way home, this started me as a loyal customer. Their home made bread is crunchy, not soggy, like so many others hot subs. Their pizza crust rivals any of my home town, which is known nationally for their pizza!
