Ha a 730pm Saturday reservation to celebrate my wife's birthday.  Ordered the 4 course Prix Fix menu with the waiter picking the courses for my wife.  Plating was very nice and the food was great with portions slightly smaller than I would have liked.  A nice touch at the end with some chocolates and a birthday candle Decibel level in the room  is great for conversation.  We will definitely eat here again.
