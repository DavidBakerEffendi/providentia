This "hole in the wall" has become our Vietnamese standard. We tried all of the other Vietnamese places in Montclair/Bloomfield area and this is the best. Our favorites are the fresh vegetarian summer rolls, the pork with rice vermicelli, and the chicken pho. The broth is good enough to have by itself- we specifically go get the pho when one of us is feeling under the weather. The fried spring rolls (with the lettuce & mint) are hit or miss for me but my husband gets them every time. When we get takeout it's always ready by the time we get there (about 10 minutes). As others have noted, it is scary looking from the outside, located in a strip mall. It's small and there's not much ambience. It can get very crowded, especially on weekends. But the food is outstanding, the portions are good, and it is reasonably priced, especially for this area. It's BYOB. We take our friends there for "real" Vietnamese food all of the time.
