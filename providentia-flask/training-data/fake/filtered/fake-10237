Shhhhh, don't tell anyone, but this is the best pizza not just in New Haven, but anywhere.  Having lived in New Haven and New York, I actually drive OUT of Brooklyn just to eat there.  The pizza is, well, phenomenal.  Don't go crazy with toppings (especially if anchovies is one) would be my tip, but people swear by the mashed potato pizza. The pale ale is the best beer I have ever had.  I wish I didn't have to drive to get there, because I would get myself a pitcher if I didn't. Service is lacking, sure.  Decor is forgettable.  But a 5+ for food keeps it as one of the few restaurants I will ever give a 5.
