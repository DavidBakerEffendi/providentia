We happened to see a GROUPON and seized at the chance to try a new restaurant.  We are so glad we did!  The zucchini pancakes with dill sauce were delicious; the Baba Ganoush was smokey and smooth.  Our appetizers - one chicken kabob and one lamb kabob - were seasoned and cooked perfectly!  The rice pilaf and pide were also very tastey.  The baklava with pistachio and Turkish tea topped off a beautiful meal.  The servers were attentive and most gracious.  We'll definitely return for a future meal.
