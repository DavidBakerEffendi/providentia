I have taken all my friends and family (celebrated my parent's anniversary here) to eat here because I love this place.  It just has that right vibe that makes it a standout in the West Village.  But most importantly, the food is amazing.  It's a miracle considering how small the kitchen is but it puts other bigger, pricier restaurants to shame. The brie cheese always has me fighting with my guests over it, but my absolute favorite is the pan seared sea scallops.  That's a dish I share with nobody (sorry Mom, LOL). By now I have tried everything on their menu and have yet to leave a crumb on my plate.  And please don't get me started on the Brunch Menu (chorizo con huevos is so good and the mimosas are prepared to perfection) And finally, I like to take this time to thank everyone at Condesa for making my parents day so memorable.  I cannot wait to go back!
