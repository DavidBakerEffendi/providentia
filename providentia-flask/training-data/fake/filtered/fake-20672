Maybe one of the best restaurants in the country. True they only have one Michelin Star but their food is always spot on. I highly recommend the bone marrow. Enjoy it with a glass of Les Baux de Provence. Seriously the best meal ever. The staff is amazing and will treat you well whether you are in a suit or shorts and tee. Just not enough good to say about this place. Whenever I make it back to NY its the first place I go.
