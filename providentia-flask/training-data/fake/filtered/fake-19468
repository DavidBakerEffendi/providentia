Authentic and popular with the local Vietnamese community.  Parking is terribly crowded but the restaurant has plenty of interior space. Their beef with watercress salad catapulted them to the top of my Philadelphia restaurant list.  Some recipes have changed over time but they still have enough great food to draw me back.
