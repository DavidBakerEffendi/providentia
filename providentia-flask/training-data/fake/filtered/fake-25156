Can't believe I've lived in Philly for nearly 5 years and haven't been to this little gem!  Went with a group of 5 and everything about our dinner was amazing!  The pasta dishes were freshly made and delicious (bucatini, and fettucine special), the desserts were awesome (tiramisu, tartufo, and chocolate cake), and the service was excellent.  Our waitress was very funny and engaging, and we enjoyed our talks with who we assumed was the owner.  Can't wait to go back for a date night!
