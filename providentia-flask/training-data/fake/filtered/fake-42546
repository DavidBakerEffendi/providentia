I was extremely disappointed in the service tonight.  Victoria (her name on the receipt) was the worst server I've had in years, possibly ever.  While I was a table of one (because your bars were closed for private events tonight) and I did not drink, I still had $42.12 of food. The server rushed me through dinner - bringing out the soup and hot app at the same time, then brought out the salad before I was done with both.  She cleared the plates while I was eating.  She then charged me for a drink that I didn't order.  Worst of all she claimed that she couldn't reprint the receipt.  When I told her I absolutely would not sign the copy that had the incorrect amount on the receipt, she proceeded to be able to print the correct receipt. Food was good.
