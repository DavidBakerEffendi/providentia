Go to Lulu's on Saturday mornings for unforgettable conversations with strangers and good coffee, just don't buy too much... those coffees get expensive! The atmosphere is completely unique and the place never loses its appeal. The owner is a fascinating woman who is one of the friendliest people around. However the shop closes at 3 so you better get there in the morning.
