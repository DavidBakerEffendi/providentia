My bff took me here after raving about the fried chicken and brisket sandwich.  I have to say I loved the chicken I just wish the mac and cheese had a little more flavor.  I also ordered the banana cream pie and I just about died it was so good.  Its a long way from home for me but I may consider taking a trip to williamsburg to give this place another go around.
