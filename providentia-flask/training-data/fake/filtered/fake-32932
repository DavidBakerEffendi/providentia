Came here Thursday night with some friends after work. Small spot without much signage. Very cozy and homey, staff was friendly and very helpful with wine selection. We had the goat cheese crostini, cast iron kale, ceviche tacos and fish stew. Everything was great. Definetly will be added to our rotation.
