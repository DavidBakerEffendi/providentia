It's deceptive to see all tropical looking interior/exterior and crowd from outside, but two things were a huge turn down for me. Food - Disappointed, I've had better cuban food in different places in the city. I thought they were joking when I saw what's supposedly 'Paella' when it came out. Seriously, it doesn't come fried in a pan, but what I get is seafood in a clay pot simmered in a sauce with rice served in a SEPARATE dish.   Music - My throat was sore after the meal because I had to yell to my friend due to a loud music. It explains a lot about how we easily buy into 'exotic interior', and lot of these hype places end up disappoint you when you actually order food. I would much prefer my micro mini-sized cuban restaurant with very modest interior, Pilar Cuban Eatery, in my neighborhood in Brooklyn.   At the end of the day, if its food can't keep up with its interior, it's not a restaurant!
