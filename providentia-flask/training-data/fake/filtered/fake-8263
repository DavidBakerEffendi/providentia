Best Falafel in Philly! This is one of my favorite neighborhood places to meet a friend for a drink on a week night. Good selection of local beers and micro brews. Great, intimate place to go see a show as well and usually for under $20. Â I don't recommend going on a weekend night as it can be jam packed and you'll never get a seat for dinner if you arrive too late. Oh and...the warm Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding makes me weak in the knees!
