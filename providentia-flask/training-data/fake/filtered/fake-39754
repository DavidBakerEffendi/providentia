Went to Talula's Garden tonight to celebrate a friend's upcoming birthday.  It was just their 3rd night, but they have it together beautifully!  Our service was informative and attentive, the food was fabulous and the setting is so charming!  I can hardly wait for it to get warmer so I can eat outside in the patio.  Would love to do their brunch...that will start Easter Sunday.  Congratulations to Steven Starr and Aimee Olexy!  What a wonderful re-incarnation of Washington Square!
