I saw that the beer garden was open around 7pm today. So, I called a friend and we planned to meet there at 8. When I got there, they were closing the gate and awkwardly kicking out my friend. Why have a soft opening with no hours published when you Â were publishing the opening for April 20th. Being pushed out of the beer garden at 8pm is not very welcoming!
