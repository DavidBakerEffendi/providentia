Great ambiance and really loved our waitress! The chef had chilled corn soup which was wonderful, my friend had the warm vegetable salad and that was amazing as well as my rigatoni with ragu and ricotta! Dessert definitely get apple cider donuts they were to die for! Wine menu is a little difficult to read we asked for Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc, the waitress bought us two similar wines to them and they were very good!
