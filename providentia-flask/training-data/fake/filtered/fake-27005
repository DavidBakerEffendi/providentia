Someone else made the reservation for here and I wasn't exactly thrilled when I read the Yelp reviews.  The disappointing reviews are pretty accurate.  The food was OK, but nothing worth the price.  My crispy duck was not quite as good as in Chinatown, and it was $28.  It came with rice, which was put on the table way before the entree so I had to send it back to be reheated.  The sides with the duck -- bok choy and sweet potato, both of which I love, were also cold, but everyone else at the table was already eating so I let it slide.  It was obvious the kitchen had some timing problems with the duck, but sending out cold sides is not acceptable. Our server was fine in taking our order, but an assistant brought the food and she didn't understand English, which complicated matters.  Fine if I'm having Mexican food in North Philly, not cool when I am in a high-priced restaurant near Rittenhouse Square.
