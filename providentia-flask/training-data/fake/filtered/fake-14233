Swine is so unique because it brings a dive bar feel to a nice restaurant with fine wine!  It has 2 levels so if you are in the mood for a cozy meal, you can sit downstairs.  If you are in the mood for a bar, you can sit upstairs (and still enjoy all of the yummy food options)!  PLEASE try the bone marrow burger...you will NOT be disappointed!! All of the staff are very friendly and welcoming.  Swine is my new favorite West Village hang!
