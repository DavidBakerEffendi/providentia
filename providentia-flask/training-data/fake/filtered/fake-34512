I cannot believe that anyone would not like this pizza! We have been going to Star for at least 50 years. First with our kids & now with their kids. When we ask our grandchildren where they want to go their answer is always "STARS" We always get the Misto Salad, hot wings & 2 pizzas, one with olives. Best thin crust pie in New Jersey!!!!!
