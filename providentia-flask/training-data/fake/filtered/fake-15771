Not entirely sure what I just ate.  That was an awful experience all around.  As a new place for us, we decided to give it a go.  Really regretting that now since 3 of us are sitting here with stomach aches.  First of all, the person taking the order seemed really confused and we had to go over it again and again.  Then it took 45-50 minutes to even get here.  By the time it did, it was cold.  Two coworkers had the Italian Beef sandwich and one of them didn't even finish it.  Said it kept getting worse as she ate it. The other said it was nothing horrible, but nothing they would order again.  I had the vegan chili, and I'm pretty sure I've never had anything like that.  It was so disgusting.  I appreciate the effort of trying to incorporate quinoa, but it was poorly executed.  It was a mush (really... i have no idea what was in there) of vegetables, quinoa, and crunchy peppers (I think).  It had a horrible mouth feel and an indescribable taste.  Definitely not chili, though.  We all ordered fries and couldn't finish them.  They are literally soaking in oil and were cold and mushy by the time we even got them.  Inedible at the very least.  The food was terribly overpriced for what it is, even if it was good.  I paid $7 for a CUP of "chili"..... a cup.  Let that just sink in.  So, tonight I'm going to spend about $6 on ingredients so that my boyfriend can make me his incredibly delicious vegan chili.... a whole 6qt crockpot full.  I hate to bash on this new place, but unless they try to clean up their act and re-do their menu, they're doomed.  I can't recommend this place at all, and would have given them NO stars if it were possible.  Eat at your own risk :/
