At first I thought this place would be bad from just looking at it. But when I got inside I could smell amazing foods. Good Dog Bar is a great place to go for lunch or dinner. It's only a couple blocks away from the liberty place shopping center. The place inside is neatly decorated with dog pictures. The service was good we didn't have to wait very long before our food came out. If you love burgers this is the place to go. They are to die for, they are so good. They are $12.50 but it's worth it my friend. If you don't like meat, they do vegetarian options . They also have a mini bar on the second floor is sort of sit down area. The 3rd floor has a pool table and pac man! The bottom floor is the more bar area. One thing I did not like about the place was it's very cramped. It's not a big place and we even had to split our table in half so another family could sit and eat. I guess that's why they have 3 floors to the building. Also if you think you have a good dog send them a picture they might put it up on their wall or even dub your dog the good dog of the year! If you like beer, wine, and philly food, good dog is the place for you.   Skinny Good dog cafe is a great restaurant. if you are a dog lover please come down to this 3 story bar. Good dog is a dog themed restaurant with many pictures of dogs everywhere.  also if you love cheese burgers this is the best place to get them, they are to die for. They even had the tv show On The Road by food network at their restaurant!  Don't be fooled this place may not look to nice from the outside, but when you go in the place is great. You like having fun? This place has darts, pool, pac man, and music! So please take the 13th street trolley station down to good dog bar!
