Tonight was the second time, in as many weeks, that my husband and I ventured out to the new Nolita Restaurant in East Hartford.  The food was DELICIOUS and fresh.  It was plated to appeal to the eye. as well as the palate.  The homemade pasta was beyond words and the salmon was Frrresh and wonderfully seasoned.   The only problem I had was that my martini was served in, get this, a bulbous red wine glass.  It took so much away from the martini experience.  All we got from the server was "lip service" via way of apology.  I know this might seem like a simple thing, but a martini by definition is served in a special glass.  Waiting for the drink to reach my lips was torture.  My second martini came in the appropriate glass.  Also, to add insult to injury, there was neither olive nor onion as a garnish.  I love olives with my martini.  The garden salad was fresh and the homemade dressing was flavorful; it had a nice balance of vinegar to sweetness ratio.  Our dessert was fresh cheesecake medallions with chocolate mouse medallions.  I thoroughly enjoyed the lightness and the distinctive flavors of the chocolate, the mango and the ricotta cheesecake.  My husband didn't care for the ricotta texture of the cheesecake.  Being from Brooklyn, he prefers a creamy  "NY style" cheesecake.   We have plans to return to Nolita this month with friends.  Hopefully the bar will have enough glasses in stock; perhaps I'll order another stye drink or bring my own glass.
