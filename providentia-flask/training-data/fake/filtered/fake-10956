Conte's is a Princeton staple! There are so many options for toppings and its usually filled with locals, for one reason, Everyone that goes once comes back! Your destined to find one person you know there and the host is a great guy and all the waitresses are really nice too. The thin crust is delicious. A great place to go and always the best of everything!
