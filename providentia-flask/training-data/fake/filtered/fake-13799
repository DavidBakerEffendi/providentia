The pizza is great! I can't really discuss anything else though. I live nearby, so all I really get is take out pizza.  I have to admit that the pizza is awesome.  The Brooklyn pie is very good as well.  If you're going for take-out, I'd highly recommend it.  I can't really give an opinion about dining in though.
