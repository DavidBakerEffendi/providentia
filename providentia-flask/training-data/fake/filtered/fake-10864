Never had the desire to write a review on anything (that's why I'm a Yelp virgin) BUT was at the Opening of the new restaurant/bar called the Boil last week and it was AWESOME! Crawfish and crabs that will get your  glands salivating.    The ambiance is warm and friendly for a fun night out with friends and/or family for drinking and  fresh seafood.  The seafood is  really fresh.  Love the Louisiana style with a kick of Viet!!  ADORE the Oyster Sliders!!  THIS IS A MUST PLACE TO BE.   Fun fact: sign your name on the window chalkboards.
