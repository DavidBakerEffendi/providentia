We were looking for a new restaurant to try and decided on the recently opened Dragonfly based on recommendations from friends.  The dragon statue anchoring the outdoor dining patio is quite amusing ("Hey I'm a giant dragon so this place MUST be Asian"). The restaurant was doing good business for a Wednesday night and while there were a number of tables full it was not too crowded.  The dining room is absolutely beautiful, with spectacular light fixtures that resemble floating jellyfish and a huge aquarium.  I guess trendy is the perfect word to describe it, something you would expect in Manhattan but not Central Jersey.  Perfect for a date night. I had scoured the website beforehand and ordered the Pomegranate Martini (delicious), Crab Wontons (mildly spicy with a lot of crab), Dragonfish sushi roll (also very good, but a bit large to fit in my mouth in one bite), the Chilean sea bass (a little sweet, a little salty, flaky and moist - just perfect), and "mochi" ice cream (not for me, but my husband loved them - different flavors of ice cream and chocolate stuffed inside dough). Definitely worth a second try... we'll be back!
