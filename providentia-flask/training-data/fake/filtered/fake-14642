The food was stellar, I had the baguette. The sauce was delectable and the ham topped with Brie... Yummy. My wife had the loco taco.. It was authentic and fresh. The service was very good, we went in with the children and were treated well by the staff. They were very attentive and pleasant. All in all pretty great.
