I've experienced better!!!     Went to the Muscle maker in Bayoone NJ, the other day.  I ordered the "godfather".  food was ok at best.  I forced myself to finnish it.  I would never order that again.   The menu was very extensive and my friend had the Arizona, we both would not return.  Seems like they do everything, but nothing great.    not a fan
