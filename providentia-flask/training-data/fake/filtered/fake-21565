I have to wonder if correspondent "Amy K" is talking about the same Claire's I have been going to for over 25 years. Who pissed in your cornflakes, ex-attorney Amy K. I would think that a law school grad might be able to work with native tongue a wee bit better, but I digress. Went there for Father's Day in June and had a nice meal and even got to talk to Claire. She is a nice person who has several successful cookbooks and many, many people who enjoy the restaurant. As to the hippie Â vibe, I dig it man. I doubt that Claire's will go out of business. In case you didn't notice, Amy, vegetarian/vegan food is huge. Also, Yale University has no plans to relocate, so Yalies will still be around to help keep it open. The only thing that would make Claire's go away is if one of the geniuses at Yale Leasing decides to put some crappy chain store in there, you know, Urban Outfitters-like. But, by all means, stay away, Amy. Don't be a buzzkill.
