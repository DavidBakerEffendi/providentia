Yes, the place may be loud, but nowhere else can you drink a reasonably priced beer while sure in the knowledge that you are drinking in the oldest pub in one of the oldest cities in the United States. The food is great -- Mile-high meatloaf and the red bean pancakes are two of my personal favorites -- and the drinks are downright affordable. I strongly recommend visiting in winter time, when they decorate for Christmas.
