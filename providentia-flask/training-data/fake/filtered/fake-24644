I came here before and it was amazing, so I brought my friend who was visiting from NY for a snack. It was 4:30pm, so we just wanted a snack instead of a $35pp Â 5-course dinners (it was restaurant week). We ordered tuna rice crackers, kobe beef satay, and kobe fried rice so it was a little over $33, but our waiter was upset we ordered so little. He didn't ask how we wanted the kobe beef satay, so when it came it was a little over done. He also only gave us ONE satay instead of TWO. I know it was supposed to be two, because I ordered this last time and it came in a pair! I felt super ripped off. $10 is already so expensive for 2 kobe beef satays, so $10 for 1 over cooked one pissed me off.
