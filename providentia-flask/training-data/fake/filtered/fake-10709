I've lived in Thailand for the last 8 1/2 years and this is the closest I've found to the real Isaan taste in the Hell's Kitchen area; I'd say in Manhattan but I haven't been to Zaab Eely yet.  I had typical Isaan stuff -- nam tok moo, larb ped, and som tam Thai, all with sticky rice -- and they pretty much nailed it.  My friends also really loved it, and they have only eaten that Americanized central Thai cuisine that most restaurants serve.  I don't live in the HK area but i will definitely be going back.
