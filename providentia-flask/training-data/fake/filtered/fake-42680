West Hartford's best kept secret! The food here is so incredibly delicious! We have frequented this restaurant numerous times and have never been disappointed! This is one of our favorite restaurants in WH. The salmon kebabs are outstanding. The pureed pumpkin is to die for! Try the eggplant as a side. Amazing! If you're looking for a healthy place to dine this is the place for you. It is also reasonably priced and the service is excellent. If you're lucky you'll catch some live music while you eat. Enjoy!
