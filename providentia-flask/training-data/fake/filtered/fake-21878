I had been watching the Man vs. Food show for years and have always wanted to try most of the places I'd seen. Dinic's was no different. Even more so because it won Best Sandwich in America. My boyfriend, his brother, our son and I hopped onto a Trolley and headed to Philly. Destination: Reading Terminal Market. We waited in line for a while and there were no places to sit so we ended up sitting outside. Anyways, back to the food. We ordered it the way it was shown on tv. My boyfriend seemed to like it pretty good. His brother could have done without the broccoli rabe and provolone. My son is 7 months old so he wasn't eating. Lol. Me, I didn't care for it really. I don't understand the hype. Disliked the rabe a lot. Not a thick provolone fan. The meat was kinda dry. I ate half of my sandwich because I was hungry but only after I removed the cheese and broccoli rabe. The other half we actually gave to a homeless guy and his cat.
