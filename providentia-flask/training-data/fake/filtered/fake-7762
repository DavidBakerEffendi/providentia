Always a good meal. The veal chop and osso bucco are the standouts, but the pasta dishes are all solid. This is old school Italian white table cloth. Best bet - go during Restaurant Week. While most Â NH restaurants have a different prix fixe during RW Adriana's lets you order your 3 courses off of the regular menu.
