I've been here many times and I have to say I recommend this place, they have great selections on the menu. One of a few places my lady and I like to eat, I find the setting perfect for us. The staff are usually all great and very friendly. Â Some entrees I consider small and for a big guy like myself who gets extremely hungry sometimes know not to order that. I'm the Pasta, Potatoes, Meats kind of guy and with a bit of wine tossed in, I'm happy as can be.
