I have been living in Winooski for about 5 months now and I have been to Our House 4-5 times. Each time has been equally as pleasant as the last and I have not been disappointed in the least. I've had brunch and dinner and even just to drink beer. The food was amazing, the drink just as good, and the servers have been phenomenal. I've had Emily as my server three times and she never fails to put a smile on my face with her personality and amazing choice in music. Our House is an amazing place to eat and drink and when you go, request Emily as your server and you will have an amazing experience, full stop.
