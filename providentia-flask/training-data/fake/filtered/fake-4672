My two star rating comes with an asterisk. While the majority of my experiences here have been great, the last 2-3 have come up short. They need to move the line faster, especially when there are only 15 people ahead of you in line. People would sit down at the counter after I got in line, get served and finish before I placed my order. When I did receive my roast beef the past few times, it was short on the sharp provolone and very dry with limited au jus. I must say it is a good sandwich when made properly and in a timely fashion. Maybe it was because they moved their booth but the setup is practically identical. I will give them another shot sometime, but they need to step their game back up
