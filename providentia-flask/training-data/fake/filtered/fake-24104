The first time I've written a Yelp review, but I had to for this place.  Some of the most flavorful Indian food I've eaten.  Went here for dinner and had the Samosa Chaat appetizer, which was large enough to be an entree.  Deliciously crispy with a very well seasoned chickpea and vegetable relish, and chutneys on the side which I forgot to try because the dish was already so good on its own.  Entree was the Saag Tikka Masala, also perfectly seasoned in a delicious tomato sauce.  Naan was light and fluffy.  Food came out of the kitchen fast, and the service was attentive but unobtrusive.  I will certainly go here again!
