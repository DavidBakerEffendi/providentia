I would describe Sabrina's as "a cool, hipster diner." The vibe is chill and the decore is quirky and unique. The food is way better than diner food, though...they serve the usual omelets, pancakes, and, french toast you'd expect from a breakfast/brunch place, but I tried the eggs benedict florentine (not my usual pick; it was an impulse) and it was so great that I went home immediately and joined Yelp just to give it a great review! I recommend this restaurant if you're going out on a date (you can sit around and drink coffee all afternoon) or if you're just kickin' it with friends (same reason).
