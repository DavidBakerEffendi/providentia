Checked it out for the first time earlier this week.. Amazing restaurant!!! The best pizza I've had in this area - great service and great happy hour prices! Our server - Greg - was one of the best servers me and my husband have ever had! Top notch place and I will definitely recommend Vesta to our family and friends!
