Although the food was decent, the seating was cramped and uncomfortable, the service was poor with a condescending attitude and the intense heat emanating from the unshaded window made this dining experience awful! This restaurant epitomizes the mind-set of certain NY restaurants associated with showbiz personality chefs whereby they treat their clients as objects, rather than valued customers, and no matter how much money is spent on small portions of food, it is unappreciated. This is revealed in their lack of concern for the comfort of their patrons and in the general attitude of their servers and Maitre'D. Personally, if we were in the presence of a brilliant Neurosurgeon or Rocket scientist I may be in awe. However we are talking about a restaurant associated with a highly publicized chef, and in such a context, especially when the ambiance, seating (level of comfort) service and attitude is poor, and the food is merely decent but costly, I am not impressed whatsoever. I would recommend that others seek more pleasant dining experiences in more comfortable and respectful restaurants.
