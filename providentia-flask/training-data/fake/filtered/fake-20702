I would love to rate this place higher but man, I can't. I went there last week Thursday or Friday If I'm not mistaken. Granted, the place is cute but they could have trained their stall a little better or at least select them. First the tall black girl behind the bar was mad slow and looked like she doesn't know what she's doing. I guarantee she has not been bar-tending for long. For such a cute place I didn't like her look with those crazy necklace or chain plus a handcuff as a bracelet, like really!! match up with the place. Another thing I didn't like was seeing her skin with some stuff I don't know how she got them, they were like red as she got bit by mosquitoes all over her body and she kept scratching her arm!! Â  I thought that was only the bartender so I got my drink and started to chat with my friend. He ordered some food and I ordered a salad. Not only it took so long to get it but when I looked by the kitchen I was disgusted by the cook girl scratching her neck. Then she came to the bar, got a drink and had a talk with the bartender. Honestly, the place is really cute but I just don't like seeing nasty stuff due to poor self hygiene or lack of common sense. My salad was not bad but my friend hated his food.
