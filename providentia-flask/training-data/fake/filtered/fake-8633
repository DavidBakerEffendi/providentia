This place is amazing! I heard good things from a friend and their pizza's the best in south philly(which I order on an almost weekly basis) so I figured I'd try out the restaurant.. Couldn't have been better.. Romantic!! Dim lit, romantic Italian music, candle light, then more music which was performed live by an cool ass OLDschool Italian playa on the accordion and the OWNER of the joint helpin him out on the vocals! That's what I call puttin the love into your business.. And the food! Fogettaboutit! If you don't like this place, then you don't like Italian food.. I grew up wit an Italian mother so I'm a tough critic and this place just flew to the top of my list..
