I come to New York for work often and am always looking for that perfect New York experience - great food, classy, historic, fun vibe, and that charm that you can only get here in the city.  Trading Post has all that and more.  The building is stunning with beautiful classic wood and leather and tons of seating for all sized groups -- including some of the best spots to cozy up that I've seen.  The food is fantastic.  I had the burger which was excellent as was the steak I kept nibbling off my friend's plate.  Wine list is excellent as well.  Neighborhood feels safe and welcoming - a really nice new spot for out of towners who haven't spent time in the Financial District to get to know the area. Already excited to come back next time in the city!
