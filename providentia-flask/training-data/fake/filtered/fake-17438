First of all this is my first time Yelping... And my experience at the Abbaye was so frustrating that I felt compelled to write this. I came here with 12 others for a birthday party. Someone in our party is a pastry chef and brought a cake for the birthday guy. Â We knew this ahead of time and when we called originally ( a few days prior to the party) we asked about the possibility of splitting checks ( which they said they could not do)... And we mentioned that we were also bringing our own cake, and was that ok... Which they simply replied 'yes'. After an exruciatingly slow service for dinner- we had requested that the cake be brought so we could get on with the night ( dinner took over one hour to be served from the time we ordered it). When the check was finally brought we saw that they charged an $18 'plating charge'.. For bringing in our own cake. After speaking with the very tall red headed manager, stating that not once did anyone mention this fee ahead of time, she just rudely fought with me, and completely refused to let the fee 'slide' this time, regardless of the fact that no one mentioned this policy to us when we called to check if it was ok to bring our own cake OR when we actually walked in with a cake in our hands. I will never return to this place, a place that will charge hidden fees for a table of 12 that spent over $300 on food and drinks with the excuse that bringing your own cake ' is taking business away from them'... This is pure greed.
