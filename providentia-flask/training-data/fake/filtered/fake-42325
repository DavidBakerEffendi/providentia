5 fried pork dumplings for $1 is for real. You can get a bunch of freshly prepared and delicious fried / steamed pork / chicken / etc dumplings for just a few dollars. They also have a few additional items so if you want anything other than dumplings. Can easily make a meal for less than $5. Downside is that there's basically little to no seating here so you'll have to carry out. There's a park a few blocks from here. Also, the cashier can't speak that good English but it's not a dealbreaker
