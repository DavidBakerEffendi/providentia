Bogota is a moderately priced (not cheap) neighborhood that specializes in Colombian food and drink. The restaurant has a festive atmosphere and serves up some terrific food. My wife likes their chicken quesadillas to the point of ordering them almost every time we go. I like the chicken chicharron, the tortilla soup, Daisy's Eggs, the signature arroz con pollo, the empanadas, the pernil. I'm determined to get through their menu, but it's a real challenge. When I try something new, I fall in love with it and then order it over and over again. They have a nice selection of beers and they make all the great hispanic drinks: margaritas, mojitos and caipirinhas, all of which can be ordered with any of the eight tropical fruits they have. Prices are reasonable, especially during their happy hours, which run all day from lunch until dinner.
