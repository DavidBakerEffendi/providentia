My favourite bar, hands down. One of the finest burgers I've ever eaten, Double Meat, Wicked Crazy Pink Sauce, and perfect thick cut fries. Great drink specials, like a burger and a beer, pbr and shot, bloody mary + food. Wild drinks like hot tamale shots with real hot tamale candy. A haven for the roller derby community. Met a lot of neat characters to Watch the Giants, Talk Literature, and trade Jokes with. Really goofy velvet painting of Putin staring down on the whole room. Real skulls up by the cash register, giant diving suit by the front. The graffiti on the street is spectacular as well.
