Started coming 8 years ago. Â Parking a hassle. The eggplant parmigiana best I've had out, and i swap pasta for garlic spinach. Vegetable sandwich is wonderful too! Food tremendous every time! Service outstanding from two of their servers that wait on us if we happen to get seated a their table. The waitress always puts a carafe of iced tea before our drinks are empty! Both have been around since me and my co-workers started having lunch here and it shows! Other servers acceptable but not up to the same level! Definitely eat here, food exceptional! Service varies but never bad! Very flexible with changing things too!
