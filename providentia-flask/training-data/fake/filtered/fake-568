I cannot believe someone complained about a Cheese steak at Genos. It is not flavorless lol... It taste amazing! Beef steaks with melted cheese running through your tongue is delicious! Its worth $9 and it is not your ordinary sandwitch! It is nothing like subway or anything else! It is def worth the experience.
