Thank you for coming to Times Square. I can't do a show with out a slice of your cheesecake. Mom - being from Brooklyn - always bought your frozen cakes fo our home in DC. But she never defrosted before serving, so I thought you just made crappy ice cream. BUT NOW - the angels of heaven rejoice in my belly. My wife and loved the Devils Food last night (The cheesecake I mean - No brimstone) I love the burgers too. I really need to try teh salads - very soon. Don't tell my personal trainer I am a regular.
