Went here for brunch, was pretty good. Ask about a party in their extra room.Shown the room and when called about renting our call was request was not answered. Also don't understand why it's called an "Irish Bar" Except for the name and Session every other Thursday night it's like any other sports bar in this section of NJ. For Irish Bar (Pub) try Egans in Montclair or West Orange. Food three staff etc one
