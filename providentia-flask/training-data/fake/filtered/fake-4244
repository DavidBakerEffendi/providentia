The bagels here are the best you'll ever have.  The owner is in all morning making the bagels fresh.  You can see the whole process while getting your fix which is pretty cool.  The owner is really friendly and seems to appreciate his customers. The sesame are my favorite, they have a flavor that is unique due to the boiling process he uses and the brick, wood fired oven.  They are simply amazing.  It's a long ride home smelling them in the car ;) As another reviewer noted, the location isn't too convenient, but it's worth the trip.
