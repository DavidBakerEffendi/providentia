I liked Ippudo. I heard this place had better ramen noodles than and is a cheaper, good alternative to Momofuku. I would return to Ippudo again. I enjoyed the noodles. I did like Momofuku more, but this is not a bad place to have ramen. It can be packed on the weekends and late night. Then you would need an alternative to the alternative. so basically, have a back-up plan if this place is too full.
