Horrible customer appreciation!!! We used to like this place and order there a lot. Just recently we got an order of chicken that was old and dried out. We brought it back to let them know we weren't happy with it - but not within the 40 minutes that they apparently require. They have no idea what a satisfied customer is worth. Aren't you tired of places that treat you badly - buy somewhere else!
