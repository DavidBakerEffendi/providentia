I booked the Malt House for a Happy Hour for about 200 people on a Monday night. The management and staff were wonderful to work with. The beer was delicious. We came in October, so there was a large selection of seasonal pumpkin and Oktoberfest beers. The food was tasty too. They provided a generous amount for the guests. The bar is in a great location, close to NYU and Washington Square Park. It got a bit cramped at times, but that is to be expected in the Village. Overall, I would highly recommend The Malt House.
