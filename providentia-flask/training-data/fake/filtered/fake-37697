We adore Taste of Tuscany. We always get takeout rather than eating in. If they delivered we would probably eat their food twice a week or more. My husband has a weekly games night, and they always get dinner from ToT. It's the highlight of my week. We love their sausage and peppers, their pizza is to die for, and their marinara is exceptional. This is not a "date night" restaurant, but that's not the point. They make terrific Italian food at reasonable prices. Highly recommended!
