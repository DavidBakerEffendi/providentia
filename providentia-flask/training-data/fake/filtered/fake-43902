A buddy of mine and I were visiting Philadelphia to see a concert at Union Station which is directly across the street (we are from Cincinnati, the land of no good music).  Our flight landed at noon and our concert was at 8 so we walked around downtown and saw all the historical sites and had a philly cheesesteak but found ourselves out of things to do at six so we made our way over to the venue hoping that the doors would be open.  They weren't.  And this was during that super weird early snowstorm in the middle of october.  So we were drenched, cold, and tired of walking and in a sort of bad part of town it seemed.  The only place around was the Llama Tooth.  We weren't hungry but we needed a place to sit for two hours. Long story short, we sheepishly asked if we could dry off in their restaurant, without buying anything.  Hoping they would be gracious enough to allow us.  They did.  And not only did they let us, but they gave us coffee, water, and wheeled a television out so that we could all watch some Kevin Hart standup together.  Granted, not a single customer came in while we were there due to the weather (or so I hope). But because of the awesome people in that little restaurant, our visit to Philidelphia was a good one.   It is an extremely comfortable place with a lot of character and the food smells good so I can't imagine that it would be bad.  Its a great place to take a date and its a great place to run into some truly incredible people.
