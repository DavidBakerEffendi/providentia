Glad we came here for dinner during out NY trip. Compared with all the Korean food I had in the US, this is definitely on the top of my list. Â The food was delicious and authentic, and the atmosphere was very comfortable and great for any occasion. I totally recommend the seafood pancake and the cold noodles, very refreshing for the summer time.
