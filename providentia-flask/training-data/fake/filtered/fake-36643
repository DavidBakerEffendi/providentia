I went to PYT several months back and I'm not typically the kind of person to write a poor review for a restaurant, but after this most recent credit card tip debacle, I will share my PYT horror story as well. We were one of three tables in an entire section assigned to one sever. It took her 30 minutes to even bring water, another 45 minutes for drinks, and I'm not even going to get into how long the wait for food or additional service was. The couple next to us waited almost an hour before they were even given water. The last straw was when our party decided to make things simple and just order PBR's for the table. There were 3 of us, and we waited almost 30 minutes (again, they weren't busy at all) and then our waitress only sets down two beers and walks away quickly while I tried again and again to get her attention. At that point, I went and talked to the manger who acted like a total douche bag and finally said, "I will make this right on your tab I assure you". When we got the tab, he had deducted $3.00 for the missing beer, that's it. At the end of our meal, my girlfriend at the time, who is a GM for a major restaurant, decided that we should let the owner know about how his employees were treating the customers. We asked for the manager's business card and he made us wait 25 minutes at the front desk just to tell us he was out of them. Furthermore, when we asked for his name, HE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL US!!!!! We ended up leaving zero tip for the first times in our lives (we usually tipped EXTREMELY generously, sometimes even 30-40%) but I will tell you what, if they had posted my credit card information and tip, I would have been pissed as well. In closing, poor food, shittier service and a complete refusal to do anything about it. Fuck you PYT, I had the worst service in my entire life when I went to your restaurant and I sincerely hope you close immediately.
