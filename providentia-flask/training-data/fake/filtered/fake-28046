Delicious food, poor service. The four stars are for the sangria, bar area, and the spanish octopus. And while I'd like to cut my stars down to three stars for the service, (the waitress was.....not good, i'll spare you the boring details) the manager was super nice so I kept it at four. He probably figured out how bad the waitress was because he came over to pick up our check himself and saw us going into the bar area for more drinks and dessert, instead of ordering it at the table. All in all, very good tapas place. Â try the octopus and the vegetables.
