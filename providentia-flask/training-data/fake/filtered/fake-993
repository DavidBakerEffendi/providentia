Definitely a great place: fresh, amazing rolls, it's a BYOB but can be a bit cozy, though.   Have only been there once, a saturday night.  We had reservations, but we ended up being 20 minutes late.  We apologized upon arrival (okay, so perhaps we should have called ahead and given them notice) and were greeted with a cold "I have your table booked in 45 minutes, so you better be quick".  The sushi was fresh and delicious, as others have said.  The bill came back resonable as well because it's a BYO.  But the way we were treated by the hostess/waitress was unacceptable.  I'll certainly be going back, and will update my review accordingly afterward.
