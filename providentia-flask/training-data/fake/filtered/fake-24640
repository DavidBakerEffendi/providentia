Two words. Ruby Tuesday. I should've known when my fiance and I ventured out on a Friday night, and we got seated right away that we should've bolted for the door.  I am confused? is it Asian? why are the servers wearing jeans and tacky sneakers you see on chestnut st? and am I in an 80's dive bar with this music? Jeez.  so we sat down, and our rough around the edges jersey boy waiter came over to us.  He suggested we order 6 plates for the two of us. For two people? really? so we ordered 3, much to our servers dismay and some cocktails.  We ordered the rock shrimp tacos, the spicy walnut apple salad, and the Thai chicken wings. The food was fair at best.  Was not tasting the Asian influence AT ALL.  Besides some brightly colored Asian tree wall decor I could've sworn my significant other had taken me to some cheap, fake chicken chain restaurant. I was so confused by the concept of this restaurant that I asked the waiter . His response, " Its just fun". Fun? so is it Asian? " ya its like Asian fun". So i decided to try to give this "Asian fun" restaurant a shot at their dessert. We ordered the pineapple something or other cakes with ice cream. Well Sampan you disappointed em again. It was terrible. Cakes were dry, pineapple was canned. GROSS.   Server was worst of all. Like where did they find these people?  RIFT RAFT!!
