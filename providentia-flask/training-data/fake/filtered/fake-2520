Uva was recommended to me. Lovely all around, and delicious dishes. I would have given it a 4 start...BUT - after spending a total of about $105 in bar and dining for 2, leaving a nice tip, I quickly asked the waiter to get a small piece of dessert with a candle for my friend who was turning 40. The tiramisu came out with way too much whipped cream (we actually couldn't figure out what dessert it was for a while - and it did not look like a regular portion, it was tiny -- like I asked), and then the waiter billed me again - full price... I was going to leave a good tip - for the effort, but after being served with the bill like that, I found it to be a bit disappointing.
