AMAZING! My bridal party took me to Nai Tapas for dinner for my bachelorette party and all of us had the BEST time! The food was DELICIOUS and the sangria was even better!! The flamenco show was the perfect touch and ALL staff was very attentive and polite. I definitely recommend Nai Tapas for a night out in the city if you are looking for fantastic food, great service, and live entertainment!!!!
