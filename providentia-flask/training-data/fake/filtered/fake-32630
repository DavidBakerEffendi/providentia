Delicious food for a decent price. This is a very casual restaurant, perfect for lazy weekend mornings. It is not meant to be a high end restaurant so do not expect it to be. When you come in you seat yourself. The service is very nice and very quick. The unlimited coffee is delicious and waitresses always make sure you have a full cup. The staff is very friendly and welcoming. They make you feel at home and never rush you. Their Eggs Benedict are the best!!!
