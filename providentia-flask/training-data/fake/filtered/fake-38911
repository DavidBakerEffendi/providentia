Going here on my friend's recommendation, I was skeptical to begin with.  My buddy has taste buds that are attracted to dredge.  Well, he's still batting a perfect average.  Not to be snooty, but this is the last time I let a non-indian direct me toward what he considers to be good Indian.  Ekta is far from it.  Case in point, the saag paneer was cooked with a tomato based sauce, which is a blasphemous deviation from the popular punjabi delicacy.  The rice was simply boiled and the accompanying salad was a travesty.  Inconsistencies aside, nothing tasted right.  Ekta, which in these parts is considered to be the Holy Grail of authenticity when it comes to this cuisine is instead a sacrilegious violation of all things Indian.  May the food gods have mercy and offer them salvation.  I, meanwhile, will steer clear of ekta.
