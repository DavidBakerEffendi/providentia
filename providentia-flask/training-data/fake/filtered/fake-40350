Despite the good food, the service is horrendous.   The staff is rude, arrogant, and snarky. Recently a friend and I were on a bike through prospect park and decided to stop in here for some dinner.  Unfortunately we did not have locks for our bikes.  The restaurant was nearly empty, we asked if we could park our bikes in the back and their response was "NO"  We then asked if it would be OK to eat upfront by the bar and  again there response was "no we don't serve food at the bar".  As we were leaving the staff was gathered around the bar snickering at us as we left.   I had been going here for a few years but will never return.  I refuse to go to a place that treats their customers like this.  They need to realize that it is us that pays them and keeps them in business.
