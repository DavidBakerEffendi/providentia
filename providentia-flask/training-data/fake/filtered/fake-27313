The restaurant is small but nice. The staff seem kinda sketchy and really slow for a small place. I came here for the Saturday Brunch and the food was very average. I ordered the Mushroom Pizza and it wasn't hot when it was served. It was kind of disappointing considering its supposed to be wood fired. Also, the mimosas were disgusting since they used canned orange juice. Do NOT order the Mimosas. The bellini's were pretty horrible too (strong but gross)...pretty much tasted liked Hawaiian punch + champagne + peach schnapps. My friend ordered the bloody mary and it came after asking our waiter for the 3rd time and it was weak and just plain tacky. As for my friend's dish, she ordered the 2 tapas with the side dish...again her reaction was that it was just mediocre. I was really looking forward to this place...and place is cute...but sigh..I'm really sad to be so disappointed. But hey the plus is that the tacky, sugary drinks are strong as hell and Â after about 2 drinks, you are good to go. Lastly, the staff really times you so as soon as your 1.5 hours are up, they literally come to your table and start clearing everything away and tell you that no more drinks for you. I dont plan on coming back here ever again...
