I've been a regular to this place ever since it opened in North Brunswick. From that day on wards, on any special occasion, we go there or order food from them. We even rented the party hall a couple of times for Birthday Parties. I have to complement the chef - 10 on 10 marks for him. I have found the service also very good. I just interacted with the Manager a couple of days ago for a take out order and he seemed to be extremely respectful, patient and polite. Believe me, that makes the food taste better in any restaurant. I have been to a number of restaurants in NJ where the Host/Hostess and Waiters have treated us as though they are serving food out of charity. I will definitely recommend Anjappar to anybody who loves spicy South Indian food. It is a one of the kind restaurant in NJ. Keep it up, Anjappar.
