I WOULD not recommend this restaurant.  We scheduled a family party here and the owner quoted us one price and then charged us another once we got there and was done eating.  He charged $31.00 per head which was not bad but made us pay the same amount for 3 seven year olds and a 9 and 11 year old.  When we tried to speak to him about it he denied it and did not compromise with us at all.  He even poked his finger in the chest of my husband.  He stated he sent enough food for 20 people to our table and that is how he rationalized charging us more.  The portions were small and the waitress made comments about how we ate everything brought to us and she never saw that before.  The waitress was not accommodating either.  We asked for another two top table to be added to our table and she would not do it.  I feel like we were taken advantage of and that is very very poor business.  I will never frequent this place again and I suggest you do not either.  No one wants to do business with people who will take advantage of you and are rude.
