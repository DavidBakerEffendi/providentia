Risotteria has rested on its reputation for so long that doesn't care what kind of experience you have there. Hostess is rude -- made us sit at a table for 2 when we are 3 people; refused to sit one person who was alone because their tables are only for 2 or more. Risotto was not as good as in the past. When I told the waitress my child thought her dish didn't taste good and wasn't eating it, she made no effort to help or obtain something else and didn't care. On a previous visit, the waitress took our utensils away when we were still eating, and the place wasn't even full! We exceeded our allotted time sitting there I suppose. The breadsticks are indeed great. But their rudeness has gotten in the way of any enjoyment.
