We went to this place because Tops Diner in East Newark had an incredibly long line and my family and I wanted a plate of food, ASAP. We settled for Arlington Diner. We ordered an entr√©e and the waitress gave us something different from what we had ordered. The manager was brought and he gave us part of what we wanted, on the house. It was nachos. Nice, right? The cheese had to be melted cheese from an aluminum can. You could tell by the texture. The cheese wasn't a vibrant yellow. It was more like a cheese paste. It was so thick and lumpy. Gross. I did have a medium-rare burger, which was a good burger. That was the only highlight. My mother ordered a pastrami sandwich. You didn't even have to eat it to tell that it was the driest sandwich made on Earth. Just by looking at the meat, you could tell it was desert dry - and it was. She ate none of it. We shared my burger. We wanted desert at the end of our meal. The manager also allowed us to have the desert for free, which I thought was extremely generous. I got the STALEST brownie I've ever had in my life. It was cold and hard, like a block of clay. I had to dig my fork into the brownie and wiggle it with a force in order for the fork to hit the bottom of the plate. My mother ordered tiramisu. It tasted absolutely FOUL. I was shocked. It tasted like something you forgot to take out of the fridge weeks after the expiration date. How is this being passed as something edible? Why wasn't the state of the desert checked before it was served? It was old food, people. I'm positive the waitress relayed nothing to her boss about the desert, which we complained to her about after. She was new and I'm guessing she didn't want any issues with the manager. I'm positive we were given all three deserts for free because they weren't selling quick enough. It wasn't a busy night either. The waitress wasn't fully awake, it seemed, and the food was poor. Something tells me that there are some internal problems at Arlington.
