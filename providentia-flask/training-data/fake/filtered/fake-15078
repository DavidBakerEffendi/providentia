10/4/14   Sadly,  they have changed the recipe for their "thin crust"  gluten free pizza and it's extremely disappointing  --- not thin crust at all.  I hope they'll go back to their previous recipe because this isn't at all  what they used to make.   Its heavy and no longer has the crispness that made it the best gluten free pizza in New York.
