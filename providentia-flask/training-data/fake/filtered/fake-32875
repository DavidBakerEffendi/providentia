Although I loved the decor and atmosphere and I was immediately inclined to like this restaurant when I first walked in, my experience was not as good as I expected. The food was nothing memorable but still very good. What really disappointed me was the service: first my boyfriend and I never got a bread basket and we were going to ask for it but the next time we saw our waiter he bringing out our appetizers. Then we saw every other table being served the amuse bouche, and we never got that either and again there was no opportunity to ask for it. I would encourage going to Nougatine instead of Perry Street, the space and food are similar but the experience is reliably much better.
