This place is fantastic! It would get 5 stars if it was in a better area....thats being picky I know...but it is what it is. I had the best veal in the place...2 pieces lumped together with cheese. Wow! Italian bread is awesome. Could use some better wine choices...but it was ok. Overall...wonderful place and authentic. Give it a try!
