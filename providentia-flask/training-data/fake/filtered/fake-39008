Delicious pork dumplings. Tender dough and savory crumbly filling- not compact rubbery/tough. Really tasty with a dash of all 3 sauces- vinegar, siracha and soy. Also had the recommended wheat noodles with peanut butter sauce. Be sure to toss and toss to mix the sauce up and to  bathe and soak the noodles. Dose with sauces to taste or as you wish. This is a tiny Chinatown hole in the wall with no ambiance which is part of the experience. This is not a western restaurant... And I love that. Nobody spoke English except the manager/ owner who was  interested to know how we had found them. Don't leave without buying some frozen dumplings to cook up at home!
