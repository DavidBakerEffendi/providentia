Went last night and was very, very happy with my experience. What a bang for the buck!! A small cafe with excellent, fresh (noticeably fresh) food- and offerings a little more sophisticated and wide ranging than I expected! A lovely staff, casual environment, and bustling with customers. Parking was do-able even though it was a nasty, rainy night! Totally great place- I will be back soon for sure!
