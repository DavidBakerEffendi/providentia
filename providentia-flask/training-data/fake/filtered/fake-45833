Yay im truly a fan! i like the restaurant for being high tech without being too much of it! they serve u rather fast and they have class when it comes to the waitress. the food is ofc splendid!! my absolute favorite is chicken&avocado rolls with sesame-seeds, i would recommend anybody that isn't vegetarian to try this!
