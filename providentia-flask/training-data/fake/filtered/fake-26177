I've been getting delivery orders since May from Three Brothers and have never been disappointed... bold words for delivery food. Their pizza is akin to my favorite NY pizza's in that you gotta fold it to eat it, the cheese is real, dripping little globules of oil, the meats and vegetables all fresh and wonderful. The sandwiches and salads with their homemade house dressing are killer and the toasted meatball sub is the best I've had. They always promise to have the food delivered in 45 minutes to an hour but I don't remember a time when it was more like 30 - 45 minutes. Oh yeah, I forgot... their prices are fair and their portions are huge :)... give these guys a try. It will be worth it.
