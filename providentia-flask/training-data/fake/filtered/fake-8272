This place is a welcome change to Old City. Great food and drinks at a reasonable price without the pretension of the neighborhood. We stopped in when Second Street got to be too much. Â It's in a landmark building, once the legendary Revival, you can't miss it. The decor inside is awesome, the booths are pews and lighting is amazing. We started with mint juleps, which I hadn't had in a million years, perfect on a warm day. I had the Frito Taco Extravaganza and a great burger, my girlfriend had the veggie burger, which she is still talking about. The staff was attentive and friendly, I'll definitely go back. I agree with Matt S., the music was good too. I heard the Minutemen and Wu Tang when we were there, definitely not your typical scene. Some of the hipster crowd, but what do you expect, it's a cheap not crappy place in Old City?! Plenty of space for a group if you get there early.
