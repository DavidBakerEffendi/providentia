This is not my first time here, but rest assured it will be my last.  Service was horrible. I arrived 9:09 on a Saturday and was advised wait time will be 40 minutes. I decided to wait it out.  9:49 I went to them and said hey it's 40 minutes do you know how much longer?  They told me they called my name.. get the heck out of here with that BS.  They advised me they have to "recycle" me and three more people to come before I get seated.  I see them seating new people and many of them.  15 minutes later I asked about how much longer.  "Sir we have 2 more people ahead of you before you get your table"  Long story short, I get seated 10:30.  That is some serious BS, but once they seat us they stick us in the back corner in a booth where our server never showed up for another 30 minutes.  Not even to open the wine.  This place is a joke.  I am sorry I even left a tip  But my tip to all of you is SKIP THIS PLACE.
