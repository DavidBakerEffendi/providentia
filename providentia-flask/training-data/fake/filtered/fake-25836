The food here is absolately AMAZING! Everything we tried is warmly fresh and simple! Everything on the stix was yummy! My favorite was chicken! Greek fries are to die for! Meatballs are also delicious. It's like a mediterranean tapas place:) atmosphere is great. It's hip and comfortable. This place also has a coffee bar unlike other places in nyc...very european! Loved it! Even if you're not hungry, coffee bar will satisfy you with the greatest choices. Hot choclate would be another great choice!
