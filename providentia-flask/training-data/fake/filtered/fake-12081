Hands down, the "Best" happy hour in New York city 4 stars because they changed until 7 pm instead of 8 pm Burgers.only 5 dls and a very tasty Old Fashioned. I always see what i believe are Chefs ( because of the knifes tatooes on the arms) Hanging at the bar. Very crowded and no sign so you looks like a trully back on the time speak easy.
