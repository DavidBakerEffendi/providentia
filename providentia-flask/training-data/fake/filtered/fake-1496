Should be 3.5 stars. Not the best burgers in NYC, but definitely the ones that most taste like they've been cooked on an actual outdoor grill. Nice place when it's not over run by douchebags and tourists. Â Go on a random weekday after work to really enjoy yourself, otherwise they'll have a line out the door.
