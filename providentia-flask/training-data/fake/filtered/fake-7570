Very nice, but a little bit small place. Big choice of tasty paninis. :) Staff is nice. 4 stars for two reasons. First reason: I think prices are a little bit high for some things on the menu. Second reason: they don't really know what comes after what and bring everything together to you table. So while you are eating your soup, you other order ( that has to be hot) is getting cold. But in total the place is nice and probably I will be back.
