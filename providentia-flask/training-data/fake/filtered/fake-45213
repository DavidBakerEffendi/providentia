We came here on a whim, trusting that Garces latest addition wouldn't disappoint...and we were simply stunned by the wonderful experience! Upon arriving, we waited (briefly) for our table while at the bar, and had the most scrumptious cuba libres we've had since our engagement in Costa Rica...their rum list is extensive, but c'mon, it doesn't get better than Flor de Cana (any year will do!).   The biggest and best surprise in store came over to our table and introduced himself: Terry. What an incredible server! He immediately made us feel right at home, and was exceptionally knowledgeable in assisting us in discovering the menu. I must say right away: the bread service will completely FLOOR you. The bread is made from a yuca flour with 2 different cheeses, and is the MOST delectable assembly of savory, chewy, comforting heavenly goodness that I have ever experienced from bread service. And don't forget about the fruity (guava??) dipping sauce. Seriously...this is something worth writing about (and he brought us extra...even though we were stuffed, you cannot stop eating this goodness).  We enjoyed the hamachi ceviche, the marinated octopus, the chicken and the beef empanada, and the crispy beef entree. Of course, for dessert we had the milkshake (trigo?), that tasted exactly like that puffed wheat cereal with the frog that you had as a child (adding a little Flor de Cana was a nice touch, also!).   But by far and away, Terry was the true star of the night.  Personable, warm, and with pacing unmatched by other servers, he ruled the night.  Undoubtedly, we will be very frequent repeat customers, and we will request the personal attention we received in his section.  Of course, we will be sharing the news with all of our friends! This experience is not one you'll want to miss!
