Even though there are so many great places to eat in New York City, Hillstone AKA Houstons I will always have a soft spot for. There spinach dip is absolutely delicious. I personally have three go to's; ribs, burger, fish of the day; usually depends what im in the mood for that day. I have been going to Houstons for years now and can honestly say that pretty much anything on the menu is prepared wonderfully. Even if your not looking to have a big dinner Hillside offers a great atmosphere and they have a great drinks menu from fine wine to beer to martinis. Hillside really does offer a little bit of everything. I just wish there was one closer to my Financial District Apartment
