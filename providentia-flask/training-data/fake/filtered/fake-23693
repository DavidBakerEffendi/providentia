They really shouldn't limit the name to just pig as the beef, chicken, and even mussels are all just as fantastic here. The restaurant has a great charming British pub or cottage feel and even with the large number of tables, expect a long wait. They don't take reservations so get in right at the opening and get your name in. The beer and wine lists are great and have many interesting inclusions. The spotted pig biter was great with the legions of meat.
