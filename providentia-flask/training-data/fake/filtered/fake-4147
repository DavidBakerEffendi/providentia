This place is a gem.  Looking for a nice, community coffee shop, it serves Stumptown coffee and a range of  delicious morning options including a spectacular breakfast sandwich.  Lunch ranges from a truly delicious kale salad to the best BLAT you'll have.  They recently added dinner service, which I enjoyed for the first time tonight.  The creativity is stunning (I can see why the chef was on chopped), we had calamari, a thai tofu miso soup, salmon with pumpernickel dust and a PB&J lava cake to close it out.  Service was excellent and prompt, with extremely helpful recommendations!  Wish it had another one where I live!
