The guacamole with the roasted corn and bacon is to die for! I never thought about putting bacon in gauc. but it really works! It was a huge portion too. I have been craving it since I went in. The mojitos are just right too, not too overly sweet, which can be a problem sometimes I have found in the past when drinking rum drinks. The decor is casual yet funky and fun, and they have a nice big deck out front which I want to come back and try out when its spring as it is contained and raised up as my issue with outside seating in Philly is that you are usually just sitting in the middle of the sidewalk on the street where you have the public walking by staring at your food while you inhale exhaust from the street, but their outdoor seating looks inviting (can you tell I am dreaming of summer while it snows today?) The fajitas were also a big portion that was plenty for me and my friend to share and then still be able to take some home with me.
