A great surprise to find such a good and innovative menu on a rainy Saturday night. Friends who live in the area suggested it. Don't let by walk up the outside stairs or the minimalist decor inside. The food is both nuanced and homey. We each had different small plates and entrees so we each got to taste. The view of the Delaware River is stunning.
