Went there on sunday... looked at buffet, didnt see any dosa item and appetizers except curd vada.. I dont like curd so decided to order instead of going for buffet. After 20 mts of wait the waiter tole me to have buffet and i said i dont want buffet.. he said I cannot order any food except for kids. I said can i wait for some time so that you can prepare it.. he said i have to wait for 2 hours or so. THEY SHOULD PUT A NOTE OUTSIDE ONLY BUFFET IN WEEKENDS. This will avoid unnecessary confusion and time. Very rude staff. Never went there after that.
