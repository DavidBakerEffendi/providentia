I am totally in love with restaurant. I went for the first time on a date and was seated in the corner, it was well lit and the service was amazing. The food was heavenly, the portions were just right as stated before worthy of 5 stars. The staff was helpful and attentive and the bread was.......divine. I was impressed with the scallops but my date loved the pasta. This will be my valentines day 2015 location suggestion.
