A bartender from another place recommended this place as the second stop of several in the Philly area.  When we walked in, we were greeted right away, we liked the atmosphere, and found a nice area to sit by the bar.  A party of 5, we intended on ordering several flights to sample, and then we'd each choose a beer to order a few rounds and some food.  Unfortunately, one of the bartenders ruined that plan for us, as she had zero people skills.  She asked what we wanted and when my father-in-law tried to explain that he wanted to do a a flight of 4 particular beers on the sheet, she snapped back, "which ones, I don't know the menu.." So he leaned over to start showing her the ones he was referring to, and without letting him finish, she straight up ripped the paper out of his hand, rolled her eyes, and proceeded to get the beer. We could not believe it! Then she just goes- cash or tab?  No question of what else she could get for the rest of us, etc.... I am not one to complain, because everyone has their off days, but really, what a rude person- clearly should not be in the hospitality business.  Long story short- we paid and did not stick around.  They lost out on a lot of money, as we bought several rounds at the next place that we could have potentially bought here.  Very sad- will not be returning here.
