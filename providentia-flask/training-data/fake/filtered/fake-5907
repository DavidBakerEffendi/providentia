Yes yes yes!  $2.50 for excellant falafel that's fast and yummy.  Better than the other place right across the street (bigger, fuller sandwiches).  I got the hot sause, and that sause is not joking around - it's HOT!  Slightly too hot for me, but if you like spicy, go for it.   I'll take mine without next time!  Definitely be back!
