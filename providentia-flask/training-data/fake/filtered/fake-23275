Doesn't even deserve a star. We literally did not have a waiter so the manager had to sort of take care of us.  Absolutely no service like didn't even take an order or welcome us, but our waiter had time to drop a check... Food was awful they handed us two crayons for a three year old (yellow and gray) and so not kid friendly with hot chicken tenders that were huge and mashed potatoes.  Not good from start to finish. We were in there for an hour and a half for a couple of sandwiches... Took us a half hour to get milk for the kid.  Doesn't take much to at least acknowledge a table or something.  Better off at Friendly's.
