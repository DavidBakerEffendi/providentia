A friend and I came here for dinner on a random Monday evening.  We were a little apprehensive because our initial impression was that the atmosphere would be a bit pretentious, but we couldn't have been more wrong.   The waiter was friendly and answered our questions about the extensive wine list and which appetizer he recommended.  The actual atmosphere was cozy, quiet, and even a little romantic with that Paris feel that you're going for. We started with the tomato tart and escargot which were both buttery and delicious; the waiter recommended the tomato tart and we are glad he did!  It was our first time trying escargot, and we fell in love. I had the halibut in a corn fricassee (which is pretty much just butter and heavy cream) which was exceptionally good.  The halibut was cooked perfectly.  My friend enjoyed the steak frites which she ordered medium well and came a little too rare for her taste.  The frites were crispy and delicious.   For dessert we shared the salted caramel ice cream which was creamy and homemade, and the perfect ender. All in all, it was a bit pricey and you will definitely break your diet with the amount of butter they use, but it's worth every calorie!  I would highly recommend for a special occasion or romantic night out.
