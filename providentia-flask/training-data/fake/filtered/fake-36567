Great food and great service.  I was in PA for a convention and had a craving for some good BBQ.   I was first greeted by the hostess Anya who was very polite and inviting.  After being sat, water was immediately served and the server appeared shortly thereafter.  While waiting for my meal, I noticed that the GM (Jesse) was making his rounds speaking with customers. This was nice to see. I had the beef brisket, collard greens and to finish the key lime pie.  I wouldn't have changed a thing.  The beef brisket was moist and flavorful and every slice was a good slice.  They offer 3 sauces that vary in heat and are just tangy enough to work with the smoked meat with a good consistency.  The collard greens had a small amount of heat to them that complimented the dish well.  The key lime pie was tart and a perfect choice to end a very good meal.  I will return the next time I am in town.
