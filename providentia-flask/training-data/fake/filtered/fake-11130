Superb. A classic cavern of Irish pub authenticity. Being an Ireland native who came to the states 17 years ago, Liffeys has been here as long as I have. This place is the real bloody deal. The staff is surly irish guys, and young, attractive hipster waitresses without the pretentiousness you can expect from dive gem craft brew haunts. The prices are what youd expect- and the aura is 1000% true to emerald form. the city's other pubs feel more like a Buffalo Wild Wings with an irish theme than "real". not so here. The food is exceptional. Best fish and chips in the states. sport events are amazing here, esp. soccer as the yanks call it. world cup is an event, and the premier league saturday am is something u must witness in all its jersey wearing, chanting, bangers and rashers eating glory. liverpool fans will feel at home here, as the owner is a LFC die hard and Liffeys is the biggest LFC fan pub in CT. overall liffeys is a gem that feels like your own discovery.
