Great location at first sight, especially for families with kids because of the airport, but that's about it; had a lousy experience; three of the 8 dishes ordered were not available; the bar (drink) menu is limited; the waitress was clumsy, rude and acted stupid; the manager got involved, with the result that the orders got messed up; to tip it off, Â they added a 23% gratuity to our check and insisted that it's a 18% gratuity the computer automatically adds to a party that's larger than 6 people; they kept on insisting that their math was correct; the food was okay, nothing to write home about or to recommend. Sorry, but have nothing good to say about this place, don't waist your time and money there, it's not worth a penny!!!!!
