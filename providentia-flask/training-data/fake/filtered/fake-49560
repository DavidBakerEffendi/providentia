When reservations at another Japanese restaurant fell through last minute, I turned to online reviews to help me select another location.  Zen happened to be one of those better rated restaurants, so I decided to pay the restaurant a visit.  Julie, the manager, was very understanding of my situation and was able to squeeze our group of 25 on a Saturday night.  She assured me my group will be taken care of and to leave everything to her.  Boy, was she right!  She had far exceeded our expectations with an impressive menu.  There was something for everyone including the non-sushi eaters.  The miso soup was very tasty, the seaweed salad had chunks of tuna delicately infused in it, the spicy mussels were minced finely with a hint of spice and the Japanese eggplant had a crunchy exterior with a melt-in-your mouth center.  If our tastebuds were not already in overload, we were promptly served with delectable plates of sushi.  The specialty rolls were mouth watering and her selection of sashimi were very fresh.  Even the less adventurous found themselves trying (and liking) the exotic that evening.  Julie, thanks for going all out for us, we really appreciate it.  We look forward to another outing at Zen very soon!
