Every single dish here I've tried has been excellent!  My boyfriend and I made it a mission to eat here midst a "monsoon" that hit Brooklyn suddenly during August.  Even though we were drenched down to our socks, we enjoyed every single bite.  Next time I'll have to try their cocktails. I agree with other Yelpers that the crowd and atmosphere is a good one... mixed and relaxed.
