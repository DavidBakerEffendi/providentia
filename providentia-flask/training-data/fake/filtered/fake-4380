I am currently traveling around North America testing out poutines at every restaurant I can, and when I heard that this restaurant had some great poutine, I had to try. As a poutine enthusiast, I have tried the best of the best, and I will say that although Canada does it much better, this place was pretty good. The fries were perfectly crispy and they even used cheese curds! They could do some work on the gravy, but overall it was a solid poutine. If you're not able to get to Canada to satisfy your craving for poutine, this is the next best thing.
