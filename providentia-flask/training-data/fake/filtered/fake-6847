The food is uniquely presented: like the fish & chips-the fish is the whole fish, upright on the plate with a bright orange fish roe mohawk :) Its so good!!- the pop of the sweet roe with the succulent fish- YUM!! We loved the interesting food combinations: like foie gras & grape jelly inside a doughnut!! And best of all, every thing we ate was melt in your mouth delicious!!! That doughnut? i could have eaten several- the doughnut is slightly crispy on the outside with puffy yummy doughnut on the inside & the combo of the creamy foie gras with the jelly? HEAVEN!!! i also highly recommend the fried deviled eggs- i want to try making them for my next party!!! and the fatty lamb with fried eggs over easy & greens with vinaigrette dressing -perfect!!! Will definitely go back!!
