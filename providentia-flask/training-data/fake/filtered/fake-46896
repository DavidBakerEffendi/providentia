Great local, fresh food. If your going to a chain restaurant, don't do it. This place has gr8 pizza, all pasta and salads are made fresh. Saturday night a table for two is ready in minutes. Appitizers to share, a taste of meatballs, eggplant, tuscan-style wings, mozzarella in carrozza, plus two full entrees w/side salad or soup, one beer and one excellent martini, all for $53.00 including the tip. Doggie bag to take home cause the portions were so huge. May look like a typical strip mall from outside but they are great with serving excellent fresh homemade foods. Skip Chilles and Fridays and go for better quality here.
