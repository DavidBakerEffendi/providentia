I've been to The Pines a few times and it's always been great. The food is outstanding and so creative. The staff are super friendly and nice and can answer any questions you have about the menus. The bar is a nice spot to sit and eat or get a drink. The atmosphere is chill and casual and the decor is perfectly Brooklyn. I love that you can see the kitchen. I would definitely recommend!
