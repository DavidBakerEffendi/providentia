Mixed review: Clearly a great "hole-in-the-wall" with good food at low prices. My soup was redolent with porkiness but the broth was slightly oily. The steamed pork and cabbage dumplings were not cooked through and required an additional nuke in the microwave when I got home with my take out order. Tsk. Tasty once cooked, but a potentially deadly flaw for a restaurant to serve undercooked pork.
