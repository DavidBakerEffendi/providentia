Okay, I've tried, I really have.  I wanted to love this place because it's a neighborhood spot we could frequent but I have been disappointed in the food all three times I have gone.  For Pete's Sake is not "bad" by any means, maybe we just had too high expectations because it really does have a great reputation.  People have raved to us about it.  The beer selection is great but the food has been disappointing in every single instance.  We enjoy other options in the neighborhood much more.  We'll still pop in to For Pete's Sake for drinks but we won't be eating there any longer.
