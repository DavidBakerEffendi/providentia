Rude staff. Bad food and will never go back again.  The staff is very unfriendly and not pleasant at all. You feel like you are a burden to them if you go in there to order food. They roll their eyes at you and do not even greet you when you walk in. Forget trying to order ice cream at 8 pm because you have to give your order then go inside to pay then go back outside to wait back in line to get your ice cream made.  To top if off the young girl who was working was wearing shorts that are considered underwear with her shirt tied up.  Not a place to bring a family and certainly the manager should have sent her home if she came to work in that outfit! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE place.  If you want to eat your pizza as well and look at the missing screens and bugs and dirt everywhere be my guest. DONT GO TO ROCKYS.  They should take more pride in there restaurant and fix it up and provide better customer service
