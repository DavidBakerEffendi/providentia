I've ordered lunch here several times, and was impressed at first. However, the quality quickly went down and I don't think I'll be stopping by again. The lunch price was pretty nice but it didn't make up for the messy, squishy rolls. My spicy tuna smelled VERY noticeably "fishy" the last time which really bothered me, because it doesn't usually. I wasn't thrilled. However the fancy roll (Mercer roll maybe?) I had for a sit down lunch was fairly good. Â Nothing to scream about. Do they skimp on the quality when they know you won't complain because you've already left? Not cool. They do offer a somewhat interesting menu though, and the roll that came lit on fire was pretty hilarious.
