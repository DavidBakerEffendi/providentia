I am extremely pleased with New Haven Pizza, and continue to order with them. Â After my first experience with them, New Haven Pizza is my new favorite place to order from. When I called to place my order, I spoke directly to one of the owners, who was very friendly and accommodating. The pizza was delivered to my house quickly, and the delivery man was nice, wishing me a good night. Not only is the pizza delicious and by far the best in the city, but it is a fair price and the staff was so friendly.
