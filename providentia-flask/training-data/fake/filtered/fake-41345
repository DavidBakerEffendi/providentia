I was looking for a place to take my staff of 9 for a nice casual holiday dinner.  One of my friends had mentioned a new restaurant on 5th & 29th that she had been to, so we decided to try it out.  One word to describe it is fabulous.  What we loved about it was the portions are small, almost appetizer size.  What worked great for us is we just ordered a bunch of different items and everyone picked from each plate. We practically ordered one of everything and figured we'd order our favorites for round 2, but everything was so good we couldn't eliminate anything.  It really created a fun group experience and we can't wait to go back.
