I used to come here a lot during the summer of 2013 an I always had a great time. The service was sometimes a little slow, but always kind, knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. Thursday night my friend and I went and sat at the bar. After being greeted by the arrogant bartender, we waited about 10 minutes for the dinner menus was asked for. The bar was crowded at the time, so I let it go. He came back to get our drink order, and pursed his lips when I asked him for a sample of a draft. He was also outwardly annoyed with us when my friend wasn't ready to order (craft beer is new to him). So eventually we get our drinks and our food order in. The food was good, and the food runner was nice, and we ate until we were stuffed! I ordered another beer and asked for the check a few minutes after that. At this point there were maybe 7 people total at the bar. We wait about 10 minutes for our check, and finally we see him come over with a check presenter. Only to give it to the people next to us whom he had been chatting with all night. So my friend asked for our check a second time, and the bartender again, pursed his lips and gave us an annoyed "o-KAY". So we wait another 10 minutes. And FINALLY we get our check. I would come back, but only on a night that this guy isn't working.
