I have been going to Adolfs for years.  It was created by a German immigrant who operated it for years.  He produced the finest German sausages, cold cuts and meats.   a few years back he decided to retire and sold the business to current owner Jozef Gorski a Polish immigrant, who has not only kept the variety of German sausages and meats but added Polish Kielbasas, Pierogis etc.  The market is also  smokehouse.  (Try the Black Forest Ham at the Deli) While the clientele seems to be mostly Polish (except for me) it is interesting to go there and see the cultures come together.  English is spoken here also.  Fortunately Jozef has kept and improved a local tradition I don't think you will find a better German/Polish market in the Hartford/ Springfield/ New Haven area.
