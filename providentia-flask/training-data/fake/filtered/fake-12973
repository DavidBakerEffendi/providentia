We have been here about five times and although the decor is great, the food isn't.  I have tried something different each time hoping to find a great dish.  The best I can say is the food is "ok". The sauce (gravy) isn't really that great and Im unsure if I will try it again.  The bakery falls a distant second to Sorrentos in East Hanover. Sorrentos not only kills Calandras in quality and freshness, the breads and pastries actually cost less!  Maybe this is what happens when you are spread too thin with multiple locations.  Not the Calandras of 20-30 years ago that's for sure.
