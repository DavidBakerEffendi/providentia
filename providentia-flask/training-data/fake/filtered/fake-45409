I really had a great time at this restaurant.  The people are very friendly and the staff are very attentive.  I got to meet and talk with the chef for some time, as well.  I intended to try a meal and leave.  However, 4 hours later, I was still there talking with new people and trying other dishes, drinks, and appetizers.  I would definitely go back whenever I'm in the area.  It's a real gem of a find and  with a really cool vibe.
