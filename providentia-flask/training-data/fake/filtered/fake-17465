I ate here with a friend for the first time about a month ago. The hour-long wait was well worth it! I had the Akamaru Modern Ramen and I must say the broth was so rich and flavorful. It's the perfect comfort food for those cold nights. Will definitely come back for more! Wish they offered take out!
