Whenever we go to Jose's we get burritos and the chips and queso. The portions are more than enough for the price and the service is pretty fast. The place is very small, atmosphere is kind of drab, and it's EXTREMELY hot in there on hot days so I recommend calling ahead and getting your food to go. Not the best with custom orders-it's best to stick with what's listed on the menu.
