My girlfriend's family held a Repass there this afternoon. It is quite possibly the worst restaurant in NJ. Not only was the service terrible ,the staff was smug and looked annoyed to have to work. The bread was horrible. IT was crust with no actual bread part...Not sure how they made that happen. The salad just tasted like old olive oil. Absolutely no flavor except an overpowering offensive flavor of old olives. The pasta served was bland. The Italian Cheesecake for dinner was disgusting. It looked burnt on the outside but watery on the inside. If you happened to order the Chicken Parm or Veal Marsala you were treated to a relatively flavorless meal. If you ordered the Salmon it tasted like there was melted plastic in it. If you ordered the Pork it literally tasted like it was marinated in lighter fluid. If it was up to me I literally would have refused to pay them. It's pathetic to know that after saying goodbye to a husband, father, brother, grandfather, and great grandfather...that we were treated to such a 100% horrible and disgusting experience. Avoid this restaurant as if your life depended on it. Or at least the life of your taste buds.
