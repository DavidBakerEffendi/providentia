The burger was burnt on the outside and dry on the inside. Totally tasteless unless you like a mouthful of salt. Their fries were burnt on the outside and raw on the inside dripping with peanut oil that it leaked thru the bag. Really do not know what the rave is about, much rather go to a diner where the burgers are much bigger, flamebroiled,tasty and about the same price. Not going back!
