Delicious!!  The chef infuses a very interesting blend of spices and cooked each dish to perfection.  The sauces were yummy.  I loved the mango drink and the cheesecake dessert, which I tried to resist but was very glad I didn't.  Creamy and hand made by the owner herself! The atmosphere was modern and inviting and the service attentive and professional.   Very impressed and will go back again and again!
