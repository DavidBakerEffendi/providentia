At Leone's you are in for a real treat.  A hearty italian fare.  From rich pasta sauces, traditional soups, as well as dishes on the lighter side with delicate creamy lemon sauce.  The restaurant is also known for its vegetables...the best sauteed broccoli rabe in jersey.  Once you taste the brickoven pizza, you can never look back.  Price? surprisingly reasonable.  Overall a great family and fun environment.
