Great for a loud evening with friends. Plan for a night when you don't mind waiting in line. It's nearly inevitable. The pizza is great, of course--NY style thin crust. The service is fine. I love that the owner greets customers. I usually get the classic margarite pizza, but I branched out and got pepperoni last time and REALLY liked it. The place is loud and very crowded, but it's a lot of fun. And it's close by to great ice cream by the water.
