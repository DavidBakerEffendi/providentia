I don't know the owners; I don't even watch Top Chef.  I just live in the neighborhood, and after coming here twice, I created a Yelp profile just to write this review.  This place is awesome.  Delicious brunch and dinner, great NZ wine selection, and really lovely staff--some of the nicest waitstaff I've ever seen.  The place has a warm, down-to-earth feel, and good music.  The Kiwi burger is highly recommended, as are the eggs Benedict.  Next time I'm trying the fried chicken.
