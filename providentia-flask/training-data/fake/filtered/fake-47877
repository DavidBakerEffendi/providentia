Best I can say is that it tastes like my mother used to make! Can anyone say more than that?   Yes, I am of Magyar extraction. It is simple food with great flavor.  This is one of those little storefronts that will surprise the heck out of you.  Nothing fancy here but the taste.  Great place for a tasty lunch.
