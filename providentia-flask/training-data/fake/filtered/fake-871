This plce is amazing.  My crew from work heads there on Fridays for lunch.  The food is delicious (the hot dogs and the accompanying fries), the portions are sizable, the prices are cheap, and the service is quick.  What else do you want in a hot dog joint??  The staff themselves are very nice, helpful and are always polite.  If I had to force myself to say anything negative, I would say the location is a little tiny so seating is limited.  However, the amazing food more than makes up for it.  Highly reccomend the Warsaw Packed!
