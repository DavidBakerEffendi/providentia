I want with my little sister to check out " the best soul food of New york" please it not! I not gonna lie, the chicken and waffle was real good! Umm! But being from the islands and wanted to try soul food 1st time, I was dissapointed. When we walk in, I was shock. The enviroment wasn't as I image it to be. It small and not alive. If u go their JUST get the chicken and waffles. The Food sucks, unless u can't cook!!!
