I lived a few blocks away as a child -this was my first taste of pizza ever- it was 15 cents (6 cents more for a coke) Now praised in New York Magazine and by the Zagat mavens of dreck- this shop is in disrepair - looks like they never redid the upholestery since the 1950s-greasy smell-tiny, cramped shop- Ok -he uses goat milk for the mozzarella and it has a pleasant woodsy taste but I prefer my pizza tomato sauce to be seasoned not just breathed on by someone with garlic breath -And to separate the hype from the product and the childhood memories from the reality of taste today -I have to be a naysayer -and $4.00 a slice-The best pizza in brooklyn- give me a break- the tastiest pizza in brooklyn (or the 5 boroughs) is Del Mar on Sheepshead Bay Road (and I say this not because if you google a map of this place you will see Leif Ericson Drive and I am Les Ericson - but because the tomato sauce is heavily seasoned with garlic, oregano and basil before being spooned over the pie-order it well-done and you will be in heaven-As for Di Fara (which although one of my daughters bears the name Fara-) it is more like Di Hunger -or from hunger
