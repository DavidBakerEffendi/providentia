My heart gets just as full as my tummy , we are at home when we go to Bruno's I've only been to the Hylan blvd cafe and bonded with the staff so much that we are always offered the same table because they know we like it .The food is always fresh and the chef always puts such interesting dishes on the menu real NYC feel a happy feel place :) I finally tried the Briose with hazelnut Gelato ....... I haven't gotten back to Earth yet mmmmmmm
