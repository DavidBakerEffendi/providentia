It's been a while since I stepped foot into Sam I Am Bagles and I see the changes between the rude service from years ago to the more efficient and professional service recently.  I bought a chicken sandwich and disappointed in the lack of chicken in it. No seriously, only half the sandwich had chicken in it while the other half I was chewing on bread with cheese, wth it's not like I was paying with a groupon.  Quality not like it use to be. Disappointed but if there is a next time hoping, I don't experience the same.
