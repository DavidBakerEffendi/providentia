I was at the yellow plum last Friday and I had a fabulous experience. We tried the lobster bologenese and the skirt steak. Both were amazing! Our server Veronica was wonderful. The speciaialty cocktails ( yellow plum & highland high noon) we had were delicious! Everyone has to try yellow plum! It was one of the best fine dining experiences we have had in the Bloomfield area. We will be making this our regular dining spot!
