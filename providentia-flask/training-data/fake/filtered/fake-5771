I'm not a New York native, so when I visit Little Italy, it's a bit of a hit or miss when choosing a restaurant.  Benito One was luckily a fantastic choice! My family went there for lunch, and the lunch special consisted of a salad, pasta platter, and entree for a very reasonable price. I had the chicken parmigiana, a salad and linguine with red sauce. I loved it! My sisters got the chicken francese and rigatoni bolognese and enjoyed it as well. The wait staff was really attentive and personable.   Highly recommend Benito One!!
