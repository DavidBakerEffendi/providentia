Small place, great vibe. Walking in we instantly knew we were in the right place. Had roasted chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach. The chicken was cooked perfectly; browned to tasty perfection. Spinach was delicious and the bibb salad that I had as an appetizer had the right amount of cheese along with the sweetness of the apples. Great meal and the staff were super nice. Crowded but obviously popular. Can't wait to go back.
