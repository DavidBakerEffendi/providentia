I have passed by this place for years and after reading the great reviews plus Pho Bang was packed I thought I should finally give this place a try. And what a disappointment it was. Came here with Dad for lunch. I have to try the Nasi Lemak after how everyone talks about this "amazing" dish. Dad had the Nasi Itik Halia. Both portions were small, bland to the point of tasteless and for the price definitely not worth it. The curry chicken had no taste to it like the potatoes that came with it. The anchovies sambal was good but it was an extremely small portion. Tried a piece of beef of Dad's Nasi Itik Halia and it was rough and the scallions were just as terrible. I really wish I could give high points and a good review to this place. For some real tasty Malaysian cuisine I must say better to book that one week trip to Singapore/Malaysia. Have to go to the source!
