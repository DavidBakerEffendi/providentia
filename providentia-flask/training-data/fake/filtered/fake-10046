Food was delicious, though not the best I've everhad in Manhattan, however, service was appalling at every chance we gave them to redeem themselves, the staff was consistently offputting, short with our party of six, rude, inattentive, especially the young black gentleman wearing the hat whose job it was to seat us. Our waitress with her mohawk was more interested in projecting a high school version of coolness, and the  alleged "manager" ( who we asked to come over to our table after repeated rude interactions with the man with the hat throughout our dining experience) a woman with long dark hair and red lipstick who looked like Morticia Adams was also unresponsive to our customer service feedback, definitely not who I would want managing my customer experiences if I was an owner of this place.  There are many other places in the West Village and throughout Manhattan much more deserving of your money and patronage. On top of all this, after the worst service I've been shown around the globe in decades, they tried to give us a check with a 20% gratuity  (on top of 3 bottles of wine included) already included in the bill. Instead we paid for the full value of the delicous meal and wrote a note on the check explaining why no gratuity was deserved.  Extra Virgin needs to revisit custoimer service 101
