Best Greek food I've had in NYC. The food has a modern twist, but still has the great simple flavors of Mediterranean food. You can order a number of smaller dishes to share, and they have a good selection of Greek wine (not usually my favorite region for wine, can be very heavy). The service is efficient and not overly intrusive. My one complaint (and the reason I took off a star) is that they don't honor your reservation and will call you on your phone when your table is ready. This took 35mins. Otherwise great experience.
