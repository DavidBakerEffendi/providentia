I registered a Yelp account just to post a review for this place.. I started with a chicken 65 appetizer and it was (like the past 2 times I've been here) great!! The chicken was extremely soft and it tasted amazing! For the main course, I got a butter chicken (of course ;)), garlic naan & an iSpice Chicken Curry. All were delicious! The wait staff was great too and took care of us without being overbearing. I can't believe this place wasn't packed on a Friday night!! If you want to have great tasting Indian food, then GO HERE!!!
