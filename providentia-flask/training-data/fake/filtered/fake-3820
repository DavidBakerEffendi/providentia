I can not say enough about this restaurant.  The food, the service, the atmosphere all amazing!!  This is my second time here and the food was just as great if not better.  You are never rushed so you can enjoy the food.  the portion are huge (left overs for the next two nights), and the staff and owner are personable, knowledgeable, and friendly.  If you go no where else in Bloomfield go here.  You will not be disappointed.
