Very nice looking place, very clean, new, nice people, etc., but what really matters, THE PIZZA!! Disappointed!!. Too dry, all burnt, too thin, too mushy crust, skimpy topping, too expensive for what you get. If they don't get it right with what really matters, I'm not sure if they last. Sorry. Honestly!!
