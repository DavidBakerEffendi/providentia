I'm in love. My favorite Thai place is in Massachusetts near where I went to college and I always said to get good Thai food I needed to drive two hours. Not anymore! I'm so excited; this food is so delicious. I had mock duck with green curry, tofu with Rama and edamame. If I had switched and gotten mock duck with Rama it would have been exactly like my favorite dish from the Mass Thai place. Yum! We ordered take away, but I can't wait to eat-in here!
