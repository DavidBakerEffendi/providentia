Our second visit to MLC was not as fantastic as the first - but mostly due to slow service. Food and drink were still top notch and creative, but inexplicably slow, and the staff was not really providing explanations or apologies. Our dining consisted exclusively of their small plates, so we were somewhat bemused as to why it was taking so long (especially since one was a cold dish not requiring any cooking) - nor did we request that they come out in any special order. The same held true for drinks - a beer took 15 minutes to arrive - and the first round of drink arrived after the first few small plates. The only acknowledgment we got from our server was a sacrificial donut special - which was a bit odd to get a sweet dessert item in the middle of arrival of our dinner plates. We'll gladly come and give them another shot and hope that this visit was just a fluke - but they should be on their toes, as there appears to be some good competition opening up down the street.
