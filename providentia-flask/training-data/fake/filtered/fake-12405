Best Macarons I've ever had! Seriously so good. I chose the box of 6 for $24.00. You pick your own box, which is a little work of art to hold the delicious macaroons. I selected: Fleur de Sal Caramel Coconut Lemon Verbena Pistachio Chocolate Almond Cherry The shop itself is adorable. The interior design is adorably classic Parisian pastels, black and gold. The shop girls are quick and try to keep the line moving, so be prepared to be ushered through the process rather quickly.
