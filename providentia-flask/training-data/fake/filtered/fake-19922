Friends and I ordered the Mac and Cheese and Country Fried Steak.  Both dishes were good.  My friends ordered drinks which looked really cheesy because the glasses were a joke.  But they liked it anyway.  Overall the atmosphere was good and the waitress was good until the end when she handed our leftovers by just plopping it on the table as she walked by, which was a confusing moment.
