Overall we were happy with the pizza, though we probably wouldn't wait in line for 45 minutes to eat at the restaurant (we did take-out). The pepperoni pizza was a little bit salty but the sauce was very tasty. The fresh tomato pizza (a summer offering) had fresh basil and big chunks of tomatoes on it. For a brick oven cooked pizza, the consistency of the crust was very good.
