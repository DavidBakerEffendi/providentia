Rude waiteresses - hit or miss place . You take your chances if your getting a good meal. Sometimes you get a full dish of food and other time you get half what you normally get. The food is good but you don't get your hard working monies worth at this place. Â It's a shame this place used to be good but has gone downhill the last year or so .
