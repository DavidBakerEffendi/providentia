A new restaurant in Greenpoint that is actually new! Despite chef's resume including such local establishments as Diner and Reynards, you won't find a burger or fries anywhere on this menu. Not your typical Williamsburg fare. Refreshing and delicious. In addition, there is PLENTY of space, which is a bonus for those with infants or children.
