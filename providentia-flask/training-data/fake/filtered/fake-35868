Dinner was quick, food was fresh, and inexpensive.  I am not quite sure if this is truly nepalese cuisine or fusion, but what we ordered was very tasty.  The beef shapta has lots of flavor.  The fried chicken dumplings come with a nice zingy fresh cilantro salsa.  There are lots of vegetarian options and healthy fruit smoothies.  It's a real hole in the wall place, i.e. no atmosphere whatsoever, but the server was working hard to take care of all the tables, and what looks like a family owned restaurant is the sort of place I like to come back to...and I will.
