This place is good for classic ramen. The place was really crowded when we came in, I heard the hostess tell a guest for two it might be an hour and a half wait. I came in when it opened to make reservations for 7 at 6:30, arrived promptly at the reserved time, and was seated in less than 10 minutes. Akamaru modern has a fantastic deep broth flavor, the Kagashi Shoyu ramen was a little too salty for my taste. The regular pork was decent in tenderness and fat content. The braised pork belly was more tender and much much more fatty. Soft boiled egg was cooked well and the noodles, although thin to my liking, were good in texture and consistency. Pork buns were the highlight of the meal; fatty pork and interesting mayo sauce. Overall, welldone.
