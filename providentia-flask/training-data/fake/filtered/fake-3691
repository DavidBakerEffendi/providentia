Our office is in the same building as this restaurant. We eat here regularly for business lunches. The prices are very reasonable, the service is great, and the food is fantastic.  You know what you are going to get when you eat here, it's very reliable.  You can bring your own wine/alcohol if you want. I know the people who work here, I see them because we work in the same building, and I know their number one goal is to provide great service, and food. East Hanover has many restaurants, and we can go to any one we want, but we choose this place because we know what we are going to get, and we know they appreciate our patronage. No one asked me to write this review, and I've been eating here for years. Try their home made soup its great!
