My wife wanted to go, and I had not been to the Khyber since back in the day, for punk shows.   Music was blasting in the bar area, a short gruff grunt greeting by an server, we waited a bit to be seated.   The services was....  rushed, non-attentive, very poor. I got up and went to the bar to get a beer,  since the waitress never stopped by our table, after taking our order.   She did smile when she gave us the check.      Really disappointed and will not go back.
