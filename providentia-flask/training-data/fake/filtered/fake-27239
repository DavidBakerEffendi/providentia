DO NOT GO HERE!! This place is absolutely terrible and expensive.  Two co-workers and I waited for over 40 minutes for them to make our food and there is no room to stand anywhere because of the layout.  None of our orders were correct and we paid for missing ingredients.  This is not stir fry, it is boiled raamen noodles and then all of the ingredients are clumsily dumped into an awkward container.  The noodles were all stuck together, the beef was dry and fatty, and the vegetables were under cooked.  And expect to pay over $11 for a salad or "stir fry".  Several employees there handling food had no gloves on.  My order # was 80 something and I got called up before people with #'s in the 50's.  Not one customer was happy in this entire place.  People were returning their wrong orders and just walking out even after they already paid.  You've been warned.  Philly has way too many options for this place to survive.
