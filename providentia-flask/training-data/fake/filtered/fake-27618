I have heard that the pizza here was "sooooo delicious" from a few friends of mine and finally decided it was time to go check it out! When I say delicious, I mean delicious!!!!!  I immediately got hooked on their Sicilian slices (ate 3) :D It has to be the best in Brooklyn!  I could not believe how tasty it was. The prices here are very affordable and you get this warm and welcoming feel.  The service is great.  I especially liked how the waiter checked on me from time to time and I received my food and drink very quick. I am definitely going back to experiment the Baked Ziti dish that they have!
