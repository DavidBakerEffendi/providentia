I have eaten at Green Eggs quite a few times. The decor is inviting. The food is delicious and the portions are plentiful. I have brought parties of 2, 4, 7, and 8 into this establishment. The food was served quickly with each party and the bill was ridiculously small. For a party of 8 the bill was $89; my party of 7 Â had a bill of $76. We even order a first course to share. They do take reservations for large parties- which helps because on the weekend there seems to be a wait. You can bring in your own drinks and depending on the menu (if it is special) you can order a COMPLIMENTARY Mimosa or a Bloody Mary. You do have to pay for the OJ or tomato juice, but hey, the liquor is free! I did have the pay for a Togo container ( I forget if it was 25 or 50 cents), but I was informed that these ecoconscious containers are pricy and I'd rather pay for a biodegradable product than get Styrofoam or plastic. Their green concept is brilliant. From composting, to no plastic bottles and filtered water, local product and recycling (yea- I read up on the place) there is no competition. The chef makes a dynamite biscuit with gravy, salmon omelet, and eggs Benedict. Everything I have tried has been delicious.I am not really a sweets eater, but my friends raved about their pancakes and french toast- especially the creme brulee. Like any new place they need to work out the kinks, but I would recommend Green Eggs to anyone who is ecoconscious and hungry!!!
