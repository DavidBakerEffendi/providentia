Not only is the food delicious, but the service was wonderful. Patrick, the General Manager, goes above and beyond to ensure a pleasant experience. The menu is intricate, but he took an extensive amount of time to provide answers, guidance and recommendations. The atmosphere is lively and fun. Boqueria is such a great spot!
