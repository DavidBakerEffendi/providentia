I hate this bar. The layout is bland and lack luster, the food is average, the beer selection is good, but so are other places with way more character Â (and so close by). The only good thing about this bar is it's name, unfortunately it doesn't live up to it's allure. It should be called: Where boring drunks go to watch sports, and be boring.
