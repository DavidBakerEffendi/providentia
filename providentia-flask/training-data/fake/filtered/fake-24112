Visiting Philadelphia from Beijing with a colleague who is from Xi'an.  She was delighted by the menu and we truly enjoyed the traditional famous Xi'an dishes.  We sampled many items from the menu that are traditionally Chinese but did not sample from the American favorites (general tso's, etc).  We also enjoyed the Ma La Tang.  If you're looking for authentic flavors of Xi'an, this is a great place to do it:  great food, great service!
