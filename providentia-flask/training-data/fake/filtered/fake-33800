The big "EAT" sign says it all. This place has some of the best  Ameri-Mexican food this side of the boarder. If you arrive any time after opening be ready to wait (and wait, and wait).  I would guess the average wait time ranges from 45 minutes to 120 minutes.  but don't let that deter you. They provide generous helpings of chips and "salsa sauce" for all to enjoy, and a nice selection of beers both (imported and domestic). Once seated, the service i s AWESOME  and the non-alcoholic drinks are huge. Their menu offers a wide variety of choices. Some of my favorites are: The Cadillac fajitas, it comes with your choice of Chicken, beef or a combo servers on a sizzling hot plate. The Blackened cat fish is a delight, a bit on the  spicy side, but delicious.   The El Pueblo- another variety of fajita My suggestion is eat, laugh and enjoy! One last thing- be prepared to walk out smelling like a fajita !
