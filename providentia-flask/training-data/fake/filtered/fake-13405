We went there for dinner.  The food was just mediocre for the price.  Pad Thai with chicken was terrible.  Service was nothing to rave about.  Their mark up on wine is too much.  Their chocolate sampler dessert for $7 was a rip off.  It had four very small pieces, each twice the size of a jellybean.  The waitress could not even properly name the flavors.  I will never go back.
