Had a great sandwich by an outstanding cook named Walter, and outstanding service from feek who handed me my burger. other than a lightskinned girl screaming and laughing at the top of her lungs. the service and food was outstanding. Great, great , service and food from these two workers who deserve a raise for there attitude and guest service abilities. Those two are great. I'll be back especially to get Walter's cooking and feeks customer service. They were amazing. Keep the lightskinned girl who screams as if she's in the street out of the kitchen. Tell her this is not the Ghetto, grow up she is a representative of burger fi and she should act like it. She is at wok not in the street. Other than that I will be back. Just keep the screaming girl out of the kitchen. I ONLY HEARD HER VOICE. GROW UP CHILD YOUR AT WORK. Don't be the downfall of this great restaurant. Hope to see Walter and Feek soon. I will tell all my friends.
