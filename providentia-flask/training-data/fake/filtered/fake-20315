First time at this restaurant, food look good, service was the problem.  My daughter made a reservation two days ahead for my birthday, and when we got there, no one was at the front,or room for the habashi  table, that was the reservation for, finally after 10 or 15 minutes wait a person shows  up, and took us in, I was so exited it was right in front the habashi, wrong. My food got prepared by the cook farther away, I didn't  enjoy the show at all .  Maybe too many celebrations that day, or they need more personal to work on  weekends. We just stand up and went to another restaurant, where we had a good time.
