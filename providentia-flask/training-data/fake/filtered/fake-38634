I had my sister's bridal shower at Fin this afternoon and it was absolutely AMAZING!!!  The food was delicious and the staff was UNBELIEVABLE!!!  They went above and beyond to make everything perfect!!!  Jennifer, the manager, was so helpful and sweet  and all of the waiters and waitresses were extremely attentive to all of the guests .   Everyone that attended the shower could not stop raving about the staff and food!!  The decor and atmoshere was perfect!!   I will definetly be back and highly recommend Fin for any type of event!!!
