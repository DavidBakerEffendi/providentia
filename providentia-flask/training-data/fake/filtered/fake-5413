We have been regulars at Cafe Matisse for more than 5 years. This is a very special dining experience. The decor is very nice and the service is top notch. However, you must try the monkfish. It is by far the best I have ever had. Everything on the menu is quite good, but the monkfish is the star. If you try this restaurant once, I am confident you will return.
