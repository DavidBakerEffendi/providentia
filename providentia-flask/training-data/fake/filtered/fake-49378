Usually I can't seem to get enough El Vez. Typically when ordering out with coworkers, the first that comes to mind is El Vez, as their Mexican chopped salad and guac are extremely amazing. However this being said, I have to give a one star rating, and let me explain why.... Twice now, I have ordered the guac and Mexican chopped salad. I ate the guac and saved the salad for the next day's lunch. I have gotten food poisoning twice from the guac in a 2 month period. This is extremely disappointing and sad, because now I will never order El Vez again. It is really hard for me to imagine how this happens, but I do hope that this review will not be taken lightly, and the chefs understand that you have to wash ALL food prior to preparing. This is something that cannot go over looked, how do you not wash food before preparing? This is the only thing that I can think of that occurred, how else would you get food poisoning from only eating guac and chips? Our company uses El Vez for catering to clients, and I am going to have to advise against us ever ordering from El Vez again. I am extremely furious that this has happened not once, but twice now. Being sick from food for 24 hours, is simply not worth it. I will have to report this to BBB, only to save this from happening to someone else. I hope someone sees this and learns the basics of preparing food. I would think that this is something you learn when going to school to be a chef, however I am starting to think this isn't the case.
