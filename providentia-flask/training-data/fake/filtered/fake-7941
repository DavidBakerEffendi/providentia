went here last night on the spur of. I've been going here a couple of times now and even went to their restaurant when it was still on franklin ave in hartford. i love love their eggplant with yogurt sauce on top and pumpkin puree. i usually get a lamb dish and spinach rice with the entree but last night i wanted to have their trout again. i was so looking forward to having the trout since i remember it being light, fresh with lemon and spices but sadly they were out of it last night. very disappointed especially we came when there were only three other people having dinner that night (we came around 6 pm) so I was surprised that they were already out. hmm...anyways had the chicken kebab instead and that was good. shared the plate with a friend and it was enough to fill me up. definitely if you also get an appetizer. im definitely still a fan but i hope next time i come, they don't run out of the stuff im looking forward to having. try it!
