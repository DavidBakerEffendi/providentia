Over rated and the people who go here are entitled pigs.  The behavior of some of the other diners and their self importance, it is a really disgusting vibe.  Food is great but the people and their sense of self importance at this place is one place to avoid unless you are thinking you are sooooooooooo fabulous..... Yuch, lots of girls with expensive handbags who think it fills the gigantic hole in their soul lacking compassion.  Avoid if you are over age 30
