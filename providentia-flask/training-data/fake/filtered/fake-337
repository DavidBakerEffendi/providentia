Went out of my way on vacation just to stop at Geno's for a Philly cheese steak. The steak itself was bland and while the taste with the wiz was just OK, I was real disappointed with the lack of steak in the sandwich. Went there expecting a great sandwich and left there looking for something else to eat.
