The Chef/Owner Ricardo is as great a host that you could hope for.  On a typical night, he'll visit each table and sample various Tequilas.  The pulled pork is some of the best I've ever eaten and the KARMA Margaritas are amazing.  When you visit, make sure you try both and you'll see for yourself.  Ask the bartender, Hugo about KARMA Tequila and from his facial expression you'll see how much he likes pouring this ultra premium tequila which is poured at a Silver price.  Half the cost of the downtown bars.
