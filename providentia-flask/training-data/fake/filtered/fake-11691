Poor Henry's is the best pub for craft beer in Morris County. They always have a great selection of brews from everywhere in the country, from Yards to Troegs, Six Point to Blue Point, their bottle and Draft selection can't be beat. And what better way to enjoy a fine beer than with delicious, melt-in-your-mouth Prime Rib! Poor Henry's has THE BEST prime rib I have ever had, anywhere (just writing this review makes my mouth water). If you live anywhere in Morris County, its time to revisite this local gem and grab a beer and meet your new "old friends".
