I was new to this whole scene, until my sister in law was talking about them over the weekend.   When I went there, there was a line out the door, I was initially discouraged, but waited patiently and it moved fast.  I bought 6, they were gone in a day.  They were really delicious, and now I know a great place to buy a gift for others and for me.
