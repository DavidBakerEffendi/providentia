Went here on 6/21/2013..we arrived  between 830-9 pm.. Group of 7 .. Celebrating a friends birthday.the wait for a table was 1/12 hours at first.. Only to be brought upstairs to wait another 1/2 hour for a table. By the time we was seated it was about 11 pm. We ordered I ordered a Cesar salad with grilled shrimp ..  One friend didn't eat fish so she ordered fries!! Everyone else ordered like a shrimp platter .. The food is overpriced n my shrimp were frozen and raw no seasoning one slice of lettuce n old looking croutons!!! I sent it back !! And ordered more water!! The waitress never asked me was there anything else she could get me or nothing!! the shrimp thick with batter n rather large in size but they weren't cooked underneath no type of seasoning !!! Plain white once u take the breaking off of it!!! One if my friends meal came after everyone else had already ate !! The place was very  noisey not from the diners but from the staff !! Less horseplay and more professionalism!! I gave a 1 star for location n view ..
