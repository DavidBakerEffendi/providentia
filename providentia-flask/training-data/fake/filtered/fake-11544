My family and I have been going to the Asian Grill since they opened.  Their food is always excellent...freshly prepared, and plentiful! If we need to make adjustments to a dish (example: no peppers/onions, easy on the spice, etc.) they are very accommodating! The staff/waiters/waitresses are friendly and are always checking to make sure everything is to our liking!  We have been spoiled by the excellent food served at Asian Grill! My family loves their Sushi too.  Also, try their specials...they are DE-LISH!
