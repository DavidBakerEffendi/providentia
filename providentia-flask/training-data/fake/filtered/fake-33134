All I can say is WOW. The spinach gnocchi was divine, and I don't even like cream sauces! Our friend who is vegetarian and has very specific dietary restrictions found many options here and the kitchen staff was very accommodating with all our requests. The place is very homey and a neighborhood spot. I would call ahead in order to see what the wait time is since they do not accept reservations.
