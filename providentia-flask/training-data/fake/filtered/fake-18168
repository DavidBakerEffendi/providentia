My favorite bar in Philly! Still remember the first time I had the Good Dog Burger. I took a huge bite and ended up with hot, melty cheese all over my face. Thinking about that just got me hungry. Anyways, love the casual atmosphere, the beer selection, and the pool table upstairs. My usual: Good Dog Burger with fries and a pint of Yards Philly Pale Ale. Holler!
