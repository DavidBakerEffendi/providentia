Rude and nasty staff! We went to dinner there last night. We stood there for 20 minutes while they waited to seat us, all the while staring at two empty tables! Then they told us the kitchen was about to close so we should order before we were even seated! What kind of Korean place closes their kitchen at 9:30 pm? So, we finally get seated and start to get comfortable when the guy comes back and asks us to move to another table I admit, the food is good, but the service is HORRIBLE AND RUDE With so many good Korean places now, do I really want to get treated this way?
