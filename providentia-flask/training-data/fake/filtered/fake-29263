I know this food pretty well from travels. This place is authentic and serves up a great lamb. The variety of sides is expansive. With the lamb I'd suggest adding tahini, chopped salad and hot sauce. Keep it simple. Pickles if you want some sweet with the savory. Not much room to sit so plan on it being to-go.
