this place is a gem!! they have the CUTEST backyard!!! im more upset that they just opened up and summer is almost over... The owners came over and introduced themselves and made sure we were doing well - its cozy, and feels like home - and the food is good... what more can you ask for? things you MUST order: 1.fried green tomatoes... SERIOUSLY ... beyond delicious... I thought fried green tomatoes was an urban myth.... comes with a creamy garlic dipping sauce... 2.mac and cheese balls- AMAZE-BALLS!!! also comes with some yummy dipping sauce but they are just pure perfection- we loved them so much we had 3 orders of them... 3. hush puppies - theres nothing quiet about these puppies- they are so bold in flavor - perfectly seasoned and cooked... 4. tuna tartar- WHAT? SERIOUSLY? so random- we were more interested in what we were gonna be served.. well, im happy to report, it was a five star tar-tar!! so fresh - a few ingredients that I wasn't expecting in a tartar like an egg, but the flavors fused perfectly!!
