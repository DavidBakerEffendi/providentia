This is a fantastic restaurant - has everything - great service-oriented staff, delicious and creative menu and food presentation, boutique winelist w sustainably farmed options to compliment, and perfect ambiance, complete with local flavor and truly warm, neighborhood feel. Say Hi to Ras when you go, he's the best.
