I had visited this restaurant in Somerville many times and decided to try this location too when around in Princeton. I should say the food tastes great. The menu is much bigger than the Somerville location and so is the space. We started with some starters like Drums of heaven and chicken 65....very good taste......our main course included goat masala, indian breads and biryani....loved it..... I would definitely come back again here to try some chat snacks as many of my friends recommend. All in all, satisfied with the food quality! Keep it up Hurry Chutney!
