Place is always packed, and for good reason. Sofia Wine Bar & Cafe is the perfect blend of tasty food and bubbly. The staff are good looking Italian men with easy smiles to complement their easy going personalities. I enjoy coming here whenever my friends want to meet up for drinks or to chill out and relax over a delicious dinner. If you find you like this place, it will soon become a go-to spot on your default list of where to go when you want to go out.
