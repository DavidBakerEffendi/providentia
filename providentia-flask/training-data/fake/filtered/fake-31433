I would have liked to review this restaurant, but even though the sign says they serve lunch until 3pm, when I walked in at 2:50, the rude woman near the counter said the kitchen was closed. Come back around 4:15. I won't be back. I will not go back to a place I was obviously not good enough for. Â I guess they only serve certain types of people. I'm only speculating, but they just handed someone a take out order, and they were serving another table.
