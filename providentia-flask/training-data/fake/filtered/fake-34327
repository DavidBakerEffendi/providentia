Absolute best sushi anywhere, anytime. Simple but with simple touches that make each piece mouthwatering that makes your mouth have a spectacular experience. The chef varies between friendly and annoyed if you want more omakase than he determined you needed (you're paying for it) and it is sad but true that there is a heavy pressure to keep people moving out. The service people need lessons in politeness and if you sit at the bar they don't do much more than pick up your chopsticks if you drop them. But the sushi is unforgettable. I want some right now!
