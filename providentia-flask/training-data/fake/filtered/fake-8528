I placed a GrubHub order at 11:45am, was told food would arrive by 12:45pm. (I live 5 miles from the restaurant). Food arrived at 1:45pm and was incomplete (Forgot a 2 liter of soda). Upon closer inspection, the food was soggy from the condensation in the packaging and was very cold. The "Chicken Gyro" was just grilled chicken smothered in sour cream, not "Cucumber Sauce" and it was extremely bland. The "Kids Cheeseburger" was way overcooked and the piece of cheese was 1/2 the size of the burger. I do not recommend this restaurant.
