Terrible Service! I went there for the first time with 5 other friends and they were busy and could not seat us together.  We understood and agreed to split into 4-2, but they seated other people ahead of us even though we put our names down on the reservation!  After waiting even longer they finally took our order.  All was fine, until we saw the bill.  They managed to put us all on the same bill, even though we had to split up.  And automatically charge a gratuity.  I feel like it would be a simple fix once we told them what wasn't our order, but the waitress couldn't comprehend simple math.  Then to make matters worse the manager refused to talk to us, they sent the BUSBOY.  Who pretended he was the manager, yet had no authority to make the minor change. Long story short, I would not recommend eating here, there are a bunch of better empanada places to eat.
