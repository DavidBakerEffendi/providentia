We hadn't been to the Country Girl Diner in years but recently stopped in after it had been renovated, just on a fluke. We are so glad we did.  One of us had the Meatloaf Burger Special and the rest had cheeseburgers.  The service was wonderful, the food was delicious and Kate, the owner was delightful.  We are so happy we have been reacquainted with the fantastic, nostalgic diner.  It was a wonderful experience and we look forward to stopping in again to or from our home in VT.
