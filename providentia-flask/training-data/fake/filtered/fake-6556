Two visits and both were excellent. House margarita is great as is the coconut mojito! Split a small tray both times, which is plenty of food for two. Deena was our waitress on patio, she was so much fun and extremely knowledgable! Sat at bar with one of my girlfriends for lunch and had a blonde bartender (male) kind of a dud but sweet and friendly none the less. Food is very very fresh, the entire place is spotless, and a perfect location! Def one of my new regular spots in the center.
