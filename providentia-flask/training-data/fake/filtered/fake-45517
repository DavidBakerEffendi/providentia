I ,too, was there opening night.  there were so many employees it was amazing they weren't tripping on each other.  I agree with rater #1, the prices are very, very steep, but that was our only complaint.  We had their signature martini, the Stoli Doli.  Fabulous.  We shared the calamari appetizer, and were also treated to mozzarella in prosciutto by the chef.  Both amazingly fresh tasting.  We all had scrod or sea bass entrees, also fresh and tasty.  While we had no room after that, we had to try a dessert, so we shared the coconut cream pie.  Light, fluffy, delightful.
