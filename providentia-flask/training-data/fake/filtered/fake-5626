I had a most satisfactory lunch here. No problem with service as other reviewers have complained. I asked for a table away from the outside door and the request was graciously handled by seating me in a sheltered corner at a table far larger than needed for a solitary diner. The pasta was heated through (no microwave here) and my salad was crisp and fresh. Certainly Max Brenner is more expensive than the Appleby's across the street but this food was far better than standard Appleby's fare. Â I picked up one or two of their chocolate bon-bons to bring back to the office and they were lovely. Kept me alert during a conference call!
