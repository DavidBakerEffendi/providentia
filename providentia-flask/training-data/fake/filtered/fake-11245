Nice bar scene, but this place doesn't have a clue about great brunch! The food is pricey, lame and sloppy! Drinks are ok and service is mediocre. Don't take your friends here because they'll be very disappointed. NYC has many other great places to hang out, enjoy a tasty meal and have a fair check for brunch.
