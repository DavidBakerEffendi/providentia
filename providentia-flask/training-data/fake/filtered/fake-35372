I had lunch at McLadden's, and my friends ordered the brunch.  Overall, McLadden's was disappointing.  The outdoor seating on LaSalle Road was nice, but the decorative wrought iron table created an uneven surface for our drink glasses.  A friend put her water glass down on the table, and it fell into an open space and spilled everywhere.  Because the table had such openings, the water spilled all over our feet.  In retrospect, this problem could easily be solved if the wait staff just put coasters under every glass.  The steak and cheese sandwich was greasy, lacking mushrooms and, for $13, overpriced.  As another reviewer said, McLadden's definitely fills a pub void in West Hartford center, but if you want much better (and cheaper) food and a solid Irish Pub atmosphere, I would recommend the Half Door in Hartford.  Sisson Avenue isn't LaSalle, for sure, but the $3 Guiness during happy hour more than makes up for it.
