I'm going to put it out there that my brother works there, but that has no influence on my review. Every now and then he would bring home some pizza but never any for me...I have been wanting to try it for the entire 6+ months he's been working there! I got a slice of the artichoke and that's when I realized what all the buzz was about this place.  It was the best slice I have ever had in my life.  Being italian, that's a big statement.   It was so rich, and the crust was perfect.  I honestly felt bad after eating it that I didn't have to pay for it!   BEST SLICE IN NEW YORK CITY! Best, Rich
