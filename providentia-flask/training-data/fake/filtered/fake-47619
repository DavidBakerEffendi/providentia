I have never been here to eat and I have lived in Brooklyn my whole life. I have always tried to get in to eat here but was seriously turned off by the lines. But I was lucky enough to go to Brooklyn Bridge Park for a free movie night they have during the summer, And I decided to see if the place was at reasonable wait time. I was ECSTATIC to see that their was no line... I placed an order and was told to come back in a half an hour. I ordered the white pizza since my daughter isnt a sauce lover. The pizza was amazing cooked to perfection and not to heavy. Â You can taste the smokiness and cripsness without it tasting like it was burnt..It was perfect for a hot summer day. I would have given it 5 stars but I am only giving it four stars because I havent actually ate at the restaraunt and It was a fluke that I didnt have to wait on that horrendous line lol
