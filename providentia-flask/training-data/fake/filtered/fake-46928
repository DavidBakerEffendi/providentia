My home away from home is the Four Seasons Philly. I do a lot of meetings at the Four Seasons and at The Fountain and they never disappoint. Service is impeccable. I am not much of a fine food aficionado in regards to fine dining but food is always right on. It is from a bar menu but sometimes you can get them to get you the cheese steak egg roll appetizer which is awesome. Their french onion soup is the best I have had.
