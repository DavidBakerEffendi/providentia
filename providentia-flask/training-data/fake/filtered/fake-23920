The bagel box has solid bagels that are chewy on the outside and doughy on the inside.  The pumpernickel is particularly flavorful.   I'm surprised that this place hasn't won any local awards.  Most of the other local bagel joints in Essex county have soft bagels that lack a chewy exterior.  Overall, The Bagel Box's bagels not as good as the best in Manhattan, but are still a solid, delicious, and closer option.
