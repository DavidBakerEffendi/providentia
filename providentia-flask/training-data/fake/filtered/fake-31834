I'll admit that I was very disappointed when I received pizza delivery from this place.  I ordered a large pie to share.  Their large is only 12".  The menu didn't offer this information.  Given that i was thin crust, it was not enough to share (for me, a guy, expecting to share a standard large pie that's 18".)   It was unexpected, forced portion control.   Having said that, the pizza itself was very tasty (gourmet) and of quality ingredients.  I note that I had ordered extra cheese, but it didn't seem like it had that.     If you can get past portion size, the pizza really is very good.  I would order from them again, on the right night, but taking this into account.
