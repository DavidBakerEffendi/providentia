Came here for a nice dinner with the girlfriend. The wine was really good and the assortment of bread was none like I've seen. There was sourdough, white, wheat, and even sandwich type things with prosciutto in them. The assortment of food we ordered was interesting. We each decided to go with one of the chefs specialty dishes. They were both pretty good. I ordered a baby goat type dish which was good but the taste was so new that I was taken back at first. I know there is another Scarpetta in the Fountainbleu in Miami (owned by the same person) so if you have the opportunity I would definitely try one of these out
