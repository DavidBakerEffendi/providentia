What a great Italian restaurant. The food was divine and the wine was spectacular. Service was also very friendly and attentive.  Started with the torchon which was creamy and really good.  They paired it with some dried fruit and nuts, and puréed something...it all meshed very well together.  Then had the Trofie Nero dish. This will be on my list of places to come back to when I'm back in NY.
