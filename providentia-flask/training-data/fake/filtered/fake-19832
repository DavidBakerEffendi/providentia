If your expecting anything special except over priced wanna be microwaved Cajun food...then keep waking. We told the waitress that the crawfish macaroni and cheese had two pieces of crawfish and  was extremely dry and uneditibe...she brought the check back and said...sorry the macaroni and cheese was not to your liking...that's it!  Unreal..we will never visit this place again. We  ordered an appetizer of deviled eggs..they brought us 2 extra small eggs with a imitation crab on it for 9 dollars. And the so called fried seafood platter had popcorn shrimp, a few clams and one soggy piece of catfish for $29 dollars! Way over priced and horrible horrible food. Don't waste your money. Hi Michelle..I appreciate your comment, however, I have no reason or no time to sit here and write "fake reviews"  We  were in your restaurant on Sunday the 17th in the late afternoon, we did sit at the first table  in the  front, we did order your seafood platter & Mac and cheese with a sweet tea and one beer.. We also payed in cash .. Check your receipts again ,along with your food. Quit trying to cover up bad service and bad food, it just looks really bad.
