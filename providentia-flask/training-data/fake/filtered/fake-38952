I love French food, and I was excited to try this tiny French cafe in the West Village.  I was pretty disappointed. I didn't mind the small space, little leg room, or cash-only factors because none of that matters if you get great food.  I found all of my food to be pretty sub-par.  I ordered Bouche a la Reine (a French chicken pot pie), but it was seriously underseasoned.  It's a comfort food dish, and the cream was definitely there, but that was pretty much all I tasted.  My friend's French Onion Soup was also underseasoned - and that's a basic!  Even the baguette they served while we were waiting was barely a baguette, and the butter was unsalted.  The dessert was delicious, but not enough to make up for the food that preceded it. The service was also an issue.  I think the waiter was new, but that doesn't excuse the fact that he pointed to "steak au poivre" and said "the steak I can't pronounce".  That may make me sound like a snob, but restaurants that are NOT French often have Steak au Poivre on the menu - it's a pretty common dish. And for a French restaurant in the West Village - I honestly expected my waiter to BE French. There are too many other great restaurants in the West Village to go back here.  I've heard good things about the brunch - that's all that might tempt me.
