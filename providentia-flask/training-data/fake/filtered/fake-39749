We were downtown and randomly chose to try this place out, having a two year old with you you never know how you are going to be treated at nicer restaurants but everyone was warm and welcoming. Our server was very attentive and friendly and the food was amazing. We can't wait to go back once restaurant week is over and they have there full menu.
