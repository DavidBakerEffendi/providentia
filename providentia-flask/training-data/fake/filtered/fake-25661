We had a gathering of 5 couples, husbands and wives, who are foodies and picky about the minutiae of fine dining in NYC. All of us were taken by this wonderful restaurant -- brilliant and thoughtful service, inventive and delicious appetizers and entrees, and relaxing and inviting ambiance. This was a memorable dining experience that we will share with others. The pricing is very reasonable, the variety of offerings on the menu are vast even though truth be told it isn't a long list and the decor transports one to another time (James Bond film from the 60's?). Go!
