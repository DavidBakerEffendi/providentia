The food here leaves much to be desired. The owners obviously put a lot of time and effort into the ambiance and decor (which are top notch). But the food leaves much to be desired. I had the "vegetable" risotto complete with 5 pieces Â of zucchini and a few bits of carrot. It was served much too hot and the consistency was completely off the mark, gluey and tasteless. I would come back for drinks and dine elsewhere.
