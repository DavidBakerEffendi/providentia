I didnt understand all the great reviews.  I actually came here because of the abnormally high ratings.  I had the sausages as a starter and that was probably the highlight of the show but things declined.  We didnt get any of the star attractions as we wanted to experience something a little different.  Star attraction here I would believe is the shredded pork stew in a tomato base and perhaps the Paella.  Instead we had liver with onions, lol.  I dont expect liver and onions to cause any sort of rave but it came out dry and dreary.  Liver is boring enough but when they dont pay attention to detail and overcook it it becomes a sad dish.  I only ate this dish because of the strong Iron content in liver that might be left after its brutal scorching or perhaps it was just reheated the 5th time, who knows.  Had the roast pork and it was perhaps mistreated the same way as the liver.  Also had the chicken that was drowned in garlic sauce,  the chicken was also mistreated as it was severley overcooked.  It was drowning in an uber concentrated garlic sauce that was the only thing that I was able to taste as the chicken breast chunks naturally lacks flavor then overcooked.  Plaintains were good, platanos will always be platanos.  Sangria was nice but I'm an alcoholic and need a little more booze to feel it.  I didnt feel anything.  The service was attentive.  The area does not lack awesome food.  A rotisserie chicken dinner would of been much cheaper and enjoyable.
