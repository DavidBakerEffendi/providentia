Dirty deli counters. Spectacularly rude staff (maybe that's their shtick?). Fantastic selection of European goods, albeit priced 30-50% higher than at Wegmans. This place looks the part, but falls very short once you look close at the filthy counter glass and flies in the meat section. The wheels really fall off when the guys behind the counter open their mouths. I can't get over how they talk to people.
