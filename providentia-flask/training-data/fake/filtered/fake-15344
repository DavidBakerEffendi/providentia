I've been to Dudleys a few times now - and it's definitely a go to neighbourhood joint! Their cocktail list is delicious - gin,watermelon and pepper-mmmm!! The food has enough variety to keep me coming back and the servers are cute and efficient. The decor and design is really cool - big fan of the exposed brick - and jar feature wall..like an arrow to my heart! I actually had a friend's farewell there which turned into a great night - really lively and open til late! All good points in my book!
