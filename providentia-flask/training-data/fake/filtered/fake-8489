Food is quite tasteless, couldn't believe it , the chef needs to taste dishes before serving and add much needed salt and seasonings . There's a lot of mixed reviews about the food at different times, I guess it depends on who cooked .... I saw  they were using ''cheap labor'' in the back so some of  the food is not authentic,   Dinning out should be an experience, the food should be a treat . When I get a craving for the islands I  just have to get to Liberty Ave, so much variety, much cheaper and the food is never mediocre..
