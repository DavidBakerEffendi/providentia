I went there a few nights back with some friends from work expecting just another bar. But this place wasn't just another bar, it looked like a real high class restaurant. I didn't have dinner there but I did try the desserts. Yum! The flour-less chocolate cake was to die for, it was so so good. I also really liked the service, my glass was never empty for long. I can't wait to go back again. Mulberry Street A+
