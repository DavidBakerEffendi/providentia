This restaurant is overrated with poor customer service. While dishes boast an array of interesting flavors and combinations, that doesn't mean that they will sit well with your palette. I went here once after watching Food Network Star and tried at least 5 dishes with a friend, and then was dragged kicking and screaming for a second time weeks later by other friends who live nearby. This restaurant is surviving on hype and that is all. Save your money for Bar Americain if you want to taste real Food Network Star food. Or hell, just head on down Dekalb towards Fort Greene to taste some well-made, intriguing food.
