I totally agree with Jonathan G.  Went there today for a pastrami sandwich based on the positive review in Wednesday's NY Times.  The sandwich was tasty, but the pastrami was skimpy (by new york city deli standards).  Counter service was friendly and efficient, but with a small crowd, it took way too long for the cooks to deliver a simple sandwich.  Also, I expected a pickle on the side, but alas there was none.  It was very annoying that most of the tables were filled with computer users (I counted 6 laptops) who were sprawled out with empty coffee cups sitting next to them.  Apparently it's a great place to buy a cup of espresso and spend a few hours using free wifi.  All the while the lunch crowd was jostling around trying to find two seats together.  I'll give them another try (the cortado looked yummy) but if the same issues are encountered, I'll go somewhere else.
