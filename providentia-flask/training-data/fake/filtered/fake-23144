Staff friendly but management is deplorable and food is the worst in the area - regardless of the comparison (diner, fast food, or another steakhouse such as Arthur's).  If I was starving - I might eat here but would have to consider my options first.  Save yourself time money and frustration and go somewhere else. This place used to be good - don't know what happened - disappointment abound.  Used to rave about their burgers.  Won't refer business anymore.  Sad day for food.
