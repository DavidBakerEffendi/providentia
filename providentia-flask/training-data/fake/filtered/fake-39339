My husband and I had seen the documentary about the making of this restaurant, which we enjoyed very much.  It made us root for Café Moto's success as we  experienced, along with them, the challenges of such venture.  So when we were in the area, we invited a family member to accompany us to the restaurant for dinner.  I recognized one of the owners from the doc, but didn't approach him as dinner traffic was just starting to filter in (very lightly) and I thought he would be busy greeting his guests.  Wrong.  He sat down at the bar, spoke only to the bartender, and did not acknowledge a single guest.  When I mentioned to the waitress why we had come in, I asked her to convey the message to the owner.  I saw her speak to him - it's easy to track anyone's moves as the place is so small.  He did not even cast a glance in our direction, let alone come by the table to express his appreciation for the business.  He turned what might have been a pleasant meal into something kind of frightful.  Our waitress was not well trained, the food was nothing more than adequate, and we felt unwelcome as a result of the owner's snub.  This is a TINY place.  There is more than enough time to exchange a couple of words with every person eating or drinking there, with just the merest interruption of a conversation with the bartender.  Our guest, who lives close by, will certainly never re-visit or recommend the place.  My husband and I will never return or recommend.  I am an hotelier and know the importance of hospitality.  Guests so appreciate a little nod from the proprietor and an expression of appreciation.  New York is filled with restaurants.  This little drop in the bucket could have scored a homerun with our table for three, but instead chose to ignore the fact that we had chosen to spend our money at Café Moto as opposed to some other restaurant in the area where our patronage might have been appreciated.  I am actually surprised they remain open.
