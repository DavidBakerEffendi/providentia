Two Petes is 2 blocks from my house. I can't say I love this place. For some reason, when I think about the food, I never think of is it as all that tasty. Some things I've tried have been pretty good: Banana Pancakes included a nice portion and Cream Chipped Beef was mediocre. The overall thing that bothers me is why both Two Peters and The New Ewing Diner on the other side of town exceed what I consider normal diner prices. I understand that the insides are renovated but it surprises me that these diners, located in low to middle class areas, charge 12 dollars for typical breakfast meals. Also, the waitress we had kept calling me "Amish" because I was wearing suspenders and was just annoying throughout the meal. Wish I had a more lovable diner around the corner from my house...
