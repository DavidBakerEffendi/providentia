After waited for 15 minutes the waiter let me shared a table with another customer. We were seated on the back where I could smell a hint of toilet odors (pissy, damp, and bleached). Oh well, it was quickly masked by the aromatic smoky wafts from charsius. I had Chicken Paitan ramen. First sip was "WOW!!!" Definitely a payback for me who walked 5 avenues and 6 blocks , went MIA for almost 2 hours around office lunch time. The thick chicken broth tastes delicious, homey and healthy--I believe they use hormon free chicken. The onion and green onions add sweetness to the soup; the chicken chunk is lightly marinated with soy sauce and sake; all make the broth savory. The soup base is the breadwinner of the bowl. The noodle was springy and chewy--love it. The charsius were disappointingly tough and dry, but the burnt smoky fat helped me finish them. The second time I came here again with my friend, I had the spicy ramen. I liked it a lot. The charsius were much better--tender and juicy. We also tried the sea urchin don. It was creamy, with delicate burnt, on a top of fresh cucumber and lightly seasoned seaweed--delicious! I definitely will come back for more, and would like to try the extreme spicy ramen.
