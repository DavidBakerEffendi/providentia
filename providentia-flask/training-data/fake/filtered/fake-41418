i have nothing good to say about this place, except for the waiters, they were prompt and polite, however the valet parkers were reckless in how they delivered my car and did not look qualified for the job. the managers were the worst i have ever seen, very rude and arrogant they yelled and tried to remove some children playing in the lobby, like he has any real power, maybe he should get a real job. hated the place would not recommend for anyone! there are plenty of other places to host your weddings/communion.
