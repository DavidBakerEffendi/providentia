One of our favorites! My daughter loves their Roti Canai, Hubby loves their Kari Ayam & Garlic Chicken. I love 'em all! Most favorites: House Special Prawns, Indian Mee Goreng, Tamarind Whole Fish & Crispy Squid. You should also try their Pineapple Fried Rice. If you are planning on trying this place, be forwarned, they don't accept credit cards. ONLY CASH! So you better hit the atm's before you head out.
