Originally from Ethiopia.. I was craving for an authentic taste that could taste like home and after going to many Ethiopian restaurants ....for the first time i found it at "Injera". in NY..my favorite dish (and couldn't stop eating) was the Kitfo (tartar) which was seasoned and spiced perfectly---found home away from home...so happy to find such a place...oh and the honey wine to just to die for!!! Really worth checking out....
