Fun place and delicious food.  Had a great raspberry chocolate shake and delicious burgers and fries.  Staff was friendly and efficient except for one rude Asian waitress who was unfriendly and couldn't be bothered to treat us like paying customers.  Overall a great place and I would definitely return.
