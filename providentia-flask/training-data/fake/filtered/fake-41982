I've been eating at the "Choo Choo Train" for well over 15 years, and always return every now and then. They are always busy which just goes to show how great of a restuarant they are. All of the dishes are affordable and delicious. I've brought many friends and family here over the years, and it has become their favorite place too. I also bring alot of out of towners here (even large parties -- they have space upstairs), who aren't very impressed at first with the small space, but quickly find that the food more than makes up for it. The Avacado smoothie and Rainbow Ice are one of my faves! Check this place out, you'll definately leave full and satisfied.
