I agree with other posters that using the Chipotle style "customer creates dish as they go" didn't work here. I want to be able to order a falafel sandwich and get one. But when I did get one it was the most bland falafel I've ever had. It's possible it was bland because I don't know how to make a falafel sandwich. I had such high hopes for this place too.
