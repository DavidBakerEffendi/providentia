After reading the previous posts, I'd say they've worked out the bugs. Atmosphere was great, music in the background, not too loud, could hear and have a conversation. Tables had room between them. Food, drinks, and service were all good. Had dinner there on Friday by chance, going back for lunch today. Highly recommend!!
