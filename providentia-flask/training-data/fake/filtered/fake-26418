The YARDLEY INN     The  BAR - A   Uber cool vibe - 30 + crowd - not cheap - strong pours     The FOOD  - B+  Like most places not everything is great but a number ( more than a few) are very good ( much more than adequate for 30+ bar crowd ). The SERVICE - B Pleasant and competent but can be a bit chatty MY CONCLUSION - If you are 30+ and not  heading  to Philadelphia then forget driving along the river and wasting gas because you won't find a better place in Bucks County.
