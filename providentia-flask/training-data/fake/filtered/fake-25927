This place has a large beer selection from all over the world and a pretty good $3 Bloody Mary on their weekend brunch menu. I didn't eat since I had had a large cheesesteak a couple hours before but my friends had the parfait and the sweet potato duck hash, both of which they found delicious. Â We sat outside and although it took a little while to get our drinks right in the beginning, after that our server was attentive and pleasant. I enjoyed my visit!
