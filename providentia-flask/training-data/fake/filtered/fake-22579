For a cheap $8 you can fill up on a beef noodle soup and the best damn dumplings in Chinatown. Every other dumpling spot skimps out on the filling and screws you over with thick dumpling skin. Lam Zhou stays true to itself by making sure its dumplings are packed with flavor and tastiness that will make you over rule the competition and make this your go-to dumpling spot. Be sure to load up on the frozen bags of dumplings, because the location can get a bit annoying to get to.
