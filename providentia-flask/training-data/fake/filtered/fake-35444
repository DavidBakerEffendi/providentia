i travel from westchester to astoria to eat here about once a month. i have lived in manhattan and have spent a lot of time on the east side and tribeca and know most of the restaurants in these locations.. i eat frequently on arthur avenue and spend  time in bergen county and dine there frequently. of all these places i find myself returning to astoria because of the simple but delicious food, the friendly atmosphere and the fact that they treat me like family. i always request the same table and they always have it ready for me. i am italian and although i am disappointed that the entire staff is not italian in nationality, they are italian in heart and that is what is important. the list of specials is endless but this is their signature and it is fun to hear them. the service is prompt and they will do whatever they can to make your experience memorable. most importantly, it is a great place for taking your wife and kids. unlike some other special places (for example,scaliini fedeli in tribeca, a great place), even children can feel comfortable here. the prices are a fraction of an eqivalent manhattan place and although it is not inexpensive, is a great value. it is not my mother's cooking, but is  the next best thing at a place that makes every effort to make you comfortable. i recommend a visit on a weekday eve to avoid the crowd so you can comfortably linger over a cup of expresso.
