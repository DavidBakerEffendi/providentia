what a find! I'd eat here all the time if i worked nearby. It's evident that the owner has a love for cooking with the best ingredients.  every part of the meal was fabulous right down to the fresh bread and tasty butter. Great service too. Most restaurants charge double the price for average quality.  Can't wait to have the soup and meatballs again!
