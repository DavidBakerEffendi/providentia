So stoked on this new addition to greenpoint. Unbelievable food. Do not miss the flakey bread and amazing labne. Lamb croquettes were delicious, as was the steak. Hen of the wood was absolutely delicious. Only complaint was that my beet salad ha peaches in it, which I'm allergic to, and I don't remember them listed on my menu. Loved this place...definitely going back!
