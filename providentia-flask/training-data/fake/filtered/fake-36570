I was so excited to have this place open in our neighborhood! It's a great looking space. The place has potential, but needs a few major tweaks in order to garner repeat biz in this hood. 1) No beer specials even during the happy hour window. When we asked if anything was on special, the bartender brushed us off saying, "No. We don't discount." We were the only people seated at the bar, so it's not like he was in the weeds. Â The draft prices were higher than other beer bars in the city and the list was very light on the local stuff. 2) Portions are insanely small for the price. If you go the small plates route, over order. The food quality seemed good, but the portion size was almost laughable. On the plus side, the burger was one of the better ones that I've had lately. And the staff - socially awkward bartender aside - could not have been nicer.
