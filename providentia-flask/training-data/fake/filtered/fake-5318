Barrio Chino deserves the excellent reviews that it receives.  The dishes provide a delicious alternative to standard Mexican fare in New York-- e.g. especially the cazuela de mariscos and nopales-- and are served hot and quickly, even on a busy night.  Service, even during busy hours, is prompt and friendly. The small space can become a little loud when busy, but no louder than any other similar establishment. Be prepared to provide a cell phone number and wait a bit if you come without a reservation on a busy night, but you can happily use the opportunity to get a pre-dinner drink at one of the excellent bars in the neighborhood.
