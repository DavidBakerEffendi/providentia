Thanksgiving out is always a crap shoot.  Too often timed settings impinge on usual quality. Yesterday a group of nine of us headed to Northern Spy for the first time and were far more than pleasantly surprised.  Turkey was moist and tasty served with a wild rice and parsnip dressing, sides were a crisp stuffing, whipped potatoes and a cranberry relish.  Dessert was a pumpkin bread pudding topped with a dollop of ice cream for two if us, everyone else opted for the apple pie. Eating out on Thanksgiving means no leftovers the next day but we took home memories of a great meal. We will be back!
