The burgers were ok nothing that great. They could use some more seats, like 5 - 10 & yes they do have the room to add seating. You place your order and then get a number. Once you find a seat if your lucky you sit down and they bring your food out to you. Also you don't have private tables so not only do you have to talk over other people next to you, but you have no privacy at all.
