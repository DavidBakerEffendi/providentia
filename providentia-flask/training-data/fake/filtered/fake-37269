I'm trying to figure out who the hell would give this place a decent rating.  My speculation is management...keep in mind anyone can rate their own place.  How do you rate a place with excellent quality of food, presentation, and service to stand behind it when you give THIS place 4-5 stars? This restaurant serves tasteless slop on a plate. I swore I'd never go back after my first experience, but some friends dragged me in...only because they allow you to bring in your own tequila (which is illegal in Montclair by the way).  In Montclair, you can only bring in wine or beer by law.  The tables are so close together and the floors are really sticky.  A taco kit in a box is better than what this place serves.  Still...my vote is Mexicali Rose or Senorita's over this place.  The food at Senorita's is so much better.
