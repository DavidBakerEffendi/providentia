Over the weekend, I tried this talked about place Ippudo. Waited for 35 minutes at the bar, until we got seated. You can also order food at the bar along with a nice selection of sake and imported beers. Had Kogashi Miso Ramen which beyond delicious. The place had a great vibe, with nice looking and attractive crow. Will def be back.
