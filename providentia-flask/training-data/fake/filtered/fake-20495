The food was excellent and the service was excexceptional.  We went with the Taste of Zahav and it gives an array of dishes to try. Drinks were good, I had the smoke on water and my girl had the watermelon cocktail, mine was spicy as in peppery and went straight to my head  YAY!!!!!! the wtermelon cocktail was also very refreshing.Nce atmoshphere although just a tad on the chilly side at our table for my fiance, that may just be placement (bring a sweater ladies).  We would definitely come to this place again.
