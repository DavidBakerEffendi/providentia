I start by saying the food we ate was very good.  However, our overall experience was lacking to say the least.  I went to Eataly with a small group of friends last weekend.  We planned to have wine and snack downstairs and then proceed to the rooftop for dinner.  We had wine and cheese & meat platters downstairs to the tune of $400.  The food and wine was good.  We proceeded to the greeter to take the elevator upstairs.  The "greeter" was less than friendly to say the least.  We finally got upstairs and were informed we would need to wait 45 minutes for a table (we had a reservation by the way for the time we arrived).  We went to the bar and spent another $400 on wine for our group.  When we got to the table and started to order dinner a couple of people only wanted a salad and were planning to also get dessert.  Our server promptly informed us we had to leave.  What?  We were impolitely told everyone was required to order an entrée or we would need to leave.  Yet again, What?  She finally told us we had ordered enough food to stay.  Nice!  Thank you for making us feel so welcome. The food was fine, but it couldn't get rid of the bad taste of being treated so poorly.  When we finished dinner our server threw our check on the table and stomped off.  Needless to say we promptly paid and left. ( We had dessert at a lovely little place down the street.  Wow, I think they were happy we were there just to have cake and coffee.) After dropping over $2000 at Eataly and leaving feeling unwelcome I'll never go back.  It's obvious the owners think a little too highly of themselves.  They need to remember they are in a service industry.
