This restaurant needs to start separating "large groups" such as bachelor parties, etc. from the regular patrons trying to have a nice meal.  It's nearly impossible to talk with the people on your own table when various "groups/parties" are SO LOUD!  Another suggestion would be to keep the TV's in the bar area and not in the dining rooms.  The prices of the meals and some drinks seem to be high for what you are getting.  We didn't even stay for coffee and dessert recently because our ears were ringing from the noise.  We probably won't be coming back for a while until we hear that there has been some improvement with our concerns, because this wasn't the first time that we have been in various rooms and a large group came in and it was just impossible to talk and finish a meal; much too disruptive.  Unfortunately it's a nice local place but some of these items need to be addressed.
