This was our second time at the Firebox...First time was great with the restaurant fulfilling their advertisement about impeccable service but the second time was horrible.  The wait staff was overloaded and the manager I believe his name was Spiro did the service no justice either.  They missed one of our entre orders for our party of four and when approached took a hugely defensive posture and was very confrontational and rude.  There are much better places to dine in Hartford without all the drama that the Firebox and its Managemnt serves up....My advice stay away!
