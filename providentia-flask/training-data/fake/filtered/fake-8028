Busy place on Christmas night.  Restaurant was VERY crowded, but we managed to squeeze into a corner.  It was one of the only places in Tribeca we found to be open.  I enjoyed my salad and house rigatoni with short ribs.  My date is a vegetarian and her options were quite limited on the menu.  We notified the waiter who suggested that she order a few side dishes.  She got the mac-n-cheese which was great and very rich (with Gruyere cheese--making the texture just a bit gritty), but the portion was tiny, as was the asparagus side.  Kind of a disappointment for a vegetarian.  A talented chef could whip something special up for a vegetarian besides the side dishes, or a talented server could make some better suggestions.  The service was not great overall; we had to ask for bread a few times.
