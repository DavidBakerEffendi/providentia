I work in the area and this is one of my favorite spots for a leisurely lunch on those not-so-busy days. I usually get one of the salads, like lemon shrimp or the roasted chicken, both of which are excellent, though sometimes if I'm extra hungry I'll opt for a sandwich, like the fried fish or roasted ribeye. One day I'm going to come back on Saturday for lunch -- I hear they have a delicious burger special.
