Spent a couple of hours there on a cold rainy day with my IPad and felt so cozy and comfortable, nibbling on my food and sipping my coffee. Their hush cabbage with potatoes and wild miushrooms is quite unique but not too exotic, rather a refreshing combo of known ingredients with just right texture and proportion. If you are not very much into healthy food (like me) this dish can be a good start for conversion. I was nicely surprised with the price and also got a doggy bag (the portion was huge), got to recharge my phone and went away completely satisfied and ready for my long working day. I am looking forward to visit again and it can become a habit. It felt so zen and the table settings are full of little charming details (candles and decor in general). I will share my future experience. It also seems like a cute place to chat up with a friend before or after a stroll or shopping, it feels very intimate.
