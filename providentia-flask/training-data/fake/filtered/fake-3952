I try not to write negative reviews, especially when it comes to service in NY restaurants.  It's really old news, BUT the service at the place was so lousy last night, it virtually ruined my experience of the food.  The food is fabulous. I wish I had a chance to eat more of it. Unfortunately, we were presented with a lovely board of bread and olives that was whisked away from our table after literally 2 minutes. If the waitress could have taken the bread from my hand as I was putting it into my mouth, I believe she would have.  It was so weird, we didn't even know what was happening, until it was too late. Apparently our first course, the soup, was ready to come out, but she did not feel that our table was large enough for us to have both the soup and the bread. We thought she was simply moving our bread to the sideboard next to our table, but low and behold, she took it away.  I had just applied the garlic infused butter to my piece of lightly toasted bread, and taken one bite before it was gone. Might have gone very well with the soup.  The soup, and a delicious salad of mushrooms distracted me from the bizarre incident long enough to enjoy my main course [well-prepared roast chicken].  After so much great food, I was a little stuffed and asked to have most of my chicken wrapped up.  But alas, apparently there was a misunderstanding, and that too was tossed. My advice, eat fast.  The waitstaff is very friendly [in a strange seedy manner] but clueless.
