All I can say is DELICIOUS.  Went without a reservation on a Sunday night.  Were offered bar seats or a 40 minute wait.  We were hungry so we sat at bar.  The bar & serving staff were very friendly and the whole experience was very pleasant.  Not too loud; not too crowded (as in tables too close).  And then there was the food. We had the special Baruta (sp?) salad with roasted winter veg and arugula, two entrees: one of short ribs, the other, grilled octopus and calamari and finally shared a salted caramel budino.  Each item was superb - fresh, tasty and seasoned 'just right'.  I had an Austrian wine I'd never heard of - Grüner Veldliner - which was perfectly described as crisp and spicy.  Very good with the meal choices.  I'll return to Barbuzzo any time I'm in Philadelphia - or even go there just to eat at the restaurant!
