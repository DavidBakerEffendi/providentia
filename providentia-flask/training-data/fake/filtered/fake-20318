What can I say...Such a MAJOR disappointment with this establishment. I will NEVER return there! We had a reservation for 6 pm for 6 people, we did not get seated until 7pm. Not only did we wait a long time for our reserved seating at the Hibachi, the service was terrible. The staff was removing our food right from under us without asking if we were done with our food. They rushed us, took our food without asking and then had the audacity to ask if we would move to a booth so they could get more customers in our spot. Very rude and poorly managed. Nor did they ask if we wanted dessert or additional drinks. So very disappointed.
