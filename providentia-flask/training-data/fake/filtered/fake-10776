Visited here 7/21/2013. My party of 3 ordered a double SmokeShack, a double Shack a hot dog and order of fries. The fries won the day hands down. We fought over them. The SmokeShack suffered from an abundance of Cherry pepper which hid the flavor of the burger due to the added vinegar. Sadly, I could not detect the Niman Ranch which i was really looking forward to. The Shack burger was greasy and bland, but on the other hand, the hotdog was bursting with flavor, like a Nathans x5, which makes more a sausage than hot dog. Customer service was fantastic. I just think you could get a better, more consistently tasty burger from FiveGuys around the corner.
