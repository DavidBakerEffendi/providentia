AMAZING!  This is by far my (and my Girlfriend's) favorite restaurant in the city.  The food is fresh, authentic, healthy, and most importantly completely delicious and immensely satisfying.   The owners of the restaurant are incredibly friendly, welcoming, and very accommodating to special dietary needs.     I would recommend Sazon to ANYONE!
