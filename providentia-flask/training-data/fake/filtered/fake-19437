Its funny the reviews that are posted are all good, but if you read all the way down there are 24 reviews that are not posted and they are 90% bad reviews. At first I read all the good reviews that they posted, and thought maybe my experience was isolated, and maybe I caught the owner on a bad day the 2 times that I have been there. I don't usually post reviews but my experience at Jimmy G's (twice) was not a good one and I wanted to share. Recently I went in for lunch with a couple co workers. I was reluctant to go because my husband and I went there when they first opened and did not like the food or the chef, who we found out later is the owner. OMG, the food is still overpriced and soggy and the owner still has a loud foul mouth. What a shame for the legacy, Casino Tony Goes, this place is erasing a lot of fond memories. I am surprised (if the owner really is related to the casino family) that the family of the Casino allows him to use their name and reputation.
