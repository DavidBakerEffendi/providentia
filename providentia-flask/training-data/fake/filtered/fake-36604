I have gotten takeout from many different locations in the burlington area and I am very unsatisfied with Big Daddy's. Not only was the food unsatisfactory, but it was very over priced. I paid $20 for 4 chicken tenders and garlic bread and there was supposed to be approx 8 chicken tenders. I called to ask why I only received 4 chicken tenders and the customer service was almost nonexistent. Will not be ordering food from there again.
