I had a really bad experienced, arrived at 6:30 on a Sunday evening. It took the wait person about 20 minutes to take our drink order. That in its self is not a problem. Ordered an appetizer to share before we had our  entres. Entres came out 1 at a time with about 10 minutes in  between. The wait person forgot the appetizer and we waited about another 30 minutes for that after we finished out meals.  I had a living social coupon and we were charged twice for the dinners, once the full price and a second time with the discounted price. Never again.
