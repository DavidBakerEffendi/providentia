Great atmosphere and food! I highly suggest the mussels. We shucked out the mussels and let it sit in the sauce, and it was amazing. Everything was beautiful and cooked perfectly. It's a perfect casual dining experience. We were also engaged here! See you next year for that awesome anniversary Landmarc!
