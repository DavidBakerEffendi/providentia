I was visiting New York for the third time this year and i went to this italian restaurant in Nolita strongly suggested from a friend of mine. I don't usually go to italian restaurant abroad since i'm italian myself but i have to say this was one of our best italian meal ever,i was really impressed,the thin crust pizza cooked in a wood burn oven was deliciuos,we had grill calamari and zucchine cake amazing. Tiramisu at the end is a must. Great service and rustic ambience. Best place visited in NY so far. 5 stars
