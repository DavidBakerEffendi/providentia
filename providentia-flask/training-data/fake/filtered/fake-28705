I'd heard so many great things about the Chinatown outpost of SAKURA, but never really made it down there. From some of the reviews at yelp.We had a work lunch there today, and it did not disappoint. We ordered the soup dumplings, as recommended by a vast majority of the Yelpers who've reviewed this place. They were amazing! The broth was so rich and flavorful. And the service was really attentive,a lot better than most of Chinatown restaurant we were recommended some dishes from out waiter Christ,Braised Pork Shoulder, Chinese Clam with Basil,Fish Filllet with house spicy sauce,Angry Dragon Roll ,everything Â was so fantastic,except for the fish fillet with house special sauce was a little bit too spicy. It's really good meal for us only cost us 45 bucks for 4 of us. And we were so stuffed at the end. we will recommend this for out family and friends.
