Expensive Restaurant making fool of others -  I had their mutton do pyaza  which was pathetic , entire dish was full of onions with rare pieces of mutton . I come from a family who has real sense of cooking non veg and I know Do pyaza means with lot of onions but that does not definitely means you will give only onions in name of Non veg. Also their was lots of food colour been added to it which had no requirement their.  Also dishes are overly priced , I would not recommend going their, I am not someone who frequently writes reviews but I am so much dissapointed by their preparation that my conscious forced me to do this so that I can save others from wasting their money at this place. Though I havent tasted too many things their and chicken pakoda and Mutton do pyaza are only two things I know about them so far and both were extremely dissapointing specially for the price they charge.
