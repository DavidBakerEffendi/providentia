I really want to like Cariño. It's a nice spot, the decor is fine, and the concept is right. But it is obscenely overpriced for what it is. So much so that I left there feeling still hungry and just plain taken for a ride. The guacamole is $7. This would be fine if you got some guacamole. We got less than half a small avocado's worth, with about 15 chips. And it was served in a nice looking, but horribly impractical rough bowl that breaks chips when they scrape it. And it was too salty. Even outstanding guac in this quantity should cost no more than $4. Or go ahead and charge 7, but give me something reasonable for that. Avocados are not *that* expensive. Next the tacos. They are small, unfilling, and come with nothing on the side. And they charge an average of $8 and sell them as a main. If you want something on the side, get ready to get gouged. a side of rice and beans - I repeat, rice and beans - is 5 dollars. For that, you get about 3 tablespoons of rice and maybe 4 tbsps of beans. Seriously. If you were thinking of ordering it for the table to split, think again. Me están tomando el pelo??  Si quieren clientes, hay que darles razón para volver. Y es tan fácil cuando la materia prima es tan barata como arroz y frijoles!! I will be sad if cariño goes away, but as long as they continue to treat their clientele like fools (esp. when there are so many other options around), they won't get very far.
