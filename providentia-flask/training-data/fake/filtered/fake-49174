I was genuinely excited to try this place for the sushi and Asian fusion food. The exterior and interior atmosphere is really nice. We were seated quickly and the wait staff was very nice. We got sushi as an appetizer and it was okay. Nothing special. However, the entree was downright awful. The dishes we got tasted like a mix between frozen precooked meals and mall Chinese food. The chicken was covered with heavy sauce. Both our meals were of the same quality and we were both dissatisfied. To add insult to injury the bill broke down to about $30-$40 a person. The food is clearly of poor quality so that hurt. I do not intend on returning and would not recommend this place.
