As good as it gets its like stepping back in time the food is all good the bread is the best. This is a weekly shopping stop for the wife and I and the go to place when we need something good and fast. I have also used the catering for business and family events and all first rate. It reminds me a market I used to go to as a kid in Newark great people great food.
