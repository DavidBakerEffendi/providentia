Just returned from our first visit to Oaxaca Kitchen. Can't wait to return! Really enjoyed the dining room, decor, the attentive waitstaff and the food! Wow. Tonight, we shared four appetizers...A very delicious lobster enchilda, wonderful flavorful fish tacos, one of the best crab cakes this diner has ever eaten and a fun, fruity ceviche which was the star of the show. Four apps was the perfect portion for the two of us the share. The drinks/wine also top notch. Highly recommended!
