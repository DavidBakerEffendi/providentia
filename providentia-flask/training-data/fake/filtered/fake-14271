I read all the reviews. I was cynical about the hype & cautious about the warnings. Went here last night ? and absolutely loved it. The people who said, this is a bit old school, a place for the locals ? they were spot on ( i strongly consider that a good thing!!). The food was great, the fried calamari was done well, we also had a fried shrimp pie, which was divine with the most authentic crispy crust I have yet experience. The people who praised the food were not lying. The service was basic and good ( not indifferent in anyway at all). I have no complaints really. It was crowded, but only because it is so good i guess, but it did not in anyway hinder my experience. Cant wait to go back and try more pies. Be tolerant with parking though, its not easy to find space on the weekends because its a small neighborhood without much street space.
