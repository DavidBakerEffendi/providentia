I've been here a few times and the food is usually good. However, after tonight, I shall never return. I ordered the General Tso's chicken. Such a basic dish for a Chinese restaurant. It came out and the chicken was so fried it was completely inedible. They looked like square bricks of breading. I showed the manager and told her it was over-cooked. She looked at me funny as if she didn't understand. It took a little while to express that this was inedible, overcooked and she needed to take it back. I'm so disappointed.
