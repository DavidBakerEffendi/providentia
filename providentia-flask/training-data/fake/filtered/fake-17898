The food was good, but not worth the attitude of the staff, we were put at a table much larger than our party needed, and when we asked to move to another table the hostess gave us every reason not to move us, she  finally said it was because the next reservation was for  a party of 10 people, that's fine so adjust the table after we leave, also after 90 minutes the hostess started walking by our table and kept looking at her watch which was very rude, she has absolutely no personality. Our dinner plates started getting cleared  from the table before everyone's meal was done. Bottom line the food was good but the service was not and I don't want to be rushed out of a restaurant . Too many other good restaurants where the service  and personality of the staff is better.
