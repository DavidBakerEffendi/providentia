Used to be a huge fan of chucko and basically have taken all our guests who visited there. Had a terrible meal with worse service and attitude. We went for lunch that is very empty and even with tables that were paying up we were seated on stools with a baby. Waiter had no clue what it would be like to eat half standing with a stroller. Food has gone down and attitude has gone up. I think our last meal for a while. Finally when the bill came we didn't get change and were rushed to leave with a baby and when I called back again no recollection from the staff. Â Too many good options in the area to return.
