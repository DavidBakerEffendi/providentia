Yeah I like nice people, food and shag carpets! Sure I enjoy delicious drinks and  service with a smile while I dine on potato pancakes and think about life.  The vibe is so right I might just ask to pay rent and set up a little camp site by the fireplace. I'll wear flannel pjs and order expensive scotch drinks from the bar.
