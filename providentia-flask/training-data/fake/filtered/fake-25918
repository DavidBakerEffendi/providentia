I Love Love Love this place. I eat here about 2 to 3 times a week. Its so cheap, filling and delicious. Â I don't eat pork or shellfish so it does limit the menu a lil, but who cares I'm there for the pho ga(chicken), or the vermicelli with grilled chicken. The broth is perfect I don't bother putting sriracha or hoisin just jalapenos and basil so I don't compromise the subtle flavors in the broth. I have eaten pho all over Philly and some in Cali an this is my favorite so far.
