I'm hardly a connoisseur of fried pickles, but I know enough to say that their fried pickles are incredible.  They're doughy (in a Pillsbury Dough Boy good way), delicious and come with a fantastic remoulade with a kick.  I've never eaten anything else here as the rest of the menu is rather lacking. Decent beer selection (mostly American craft beers), good cocktails (the oatmeal concoction they serve at brunch is incredible) and good happy hour deals.  Dark ambiance that makes you wish it was full of leather couches that you can sink into while nursing your drink. Can get crowded which makes it difficult to grab a drink and push your way to the bathroom.  Quite honestly, if I see there are no seats available I typically walk right back out the door.  Overall though I like it.
