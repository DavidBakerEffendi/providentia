Such a fan.  Strolled down 51st and came across this place with my husband, who I might add, isn't that adventurous; but we gave it a try!  WOW -  we've been back 3 times since.  Now all he wants is Karaka-men-which is great.  But their Hakat pork buns - AMAZING!  They offer a variety of Ramen and the waiters/waitresses are very polite and patient explaining the various flavors and seasonings.  We tend to go with the hot and spicy - not too spicy. Love the Karaka-men  It's a quick meal and always delicious. You have to eat it all - no doggie bags nor take out.  Don't worry, you'll eat it all! Two people are generally set at the U-shaped serving bar which is a great way to see the food prepared. Larger groups are seated in the other parts of the restaurants.  If you get there by 6/6:30p for dinner you can enjoy the happy hour and maybe wait 10/15 minutes.  But we noticed by 7:30pm it's really packed at the bar - which has no stools and no waiting area to sit.  Very small.
