don't believe the hype ! this pizza is horrible. the crust is so thick and tasteless , no wait, it does have a taste -- dry and stale bread. so dry it tastes like stale focaccia bread. you need that big gulp of Budweiser [how can this place that serves 2 kinds of Bud be called a brewery ?] to wash this heavy bread [i can't even call it crust] down. the artichoke topping wasn't bad , tasting like heated creamy artichoke dip , but compared to DiFarra's artichoke pizza it doesn't stand a chance. people , this is NYC not middle America , we should know what a good pizza tastes like.... and this isn't it. when i asked the pizza maker if making a special order thinner crust would be possible he said no. saying the topping is too heavy and needs that thick bread. dude, have you ever seen a Sicilian slice before ? a Sicilian is thick crust that actually tastes like pizza dough. make the trek out to midwood for DiFara's gourmet pizza .... or Arthur Ave or anywhere but this place. one star is still too generous for this atrocity.
