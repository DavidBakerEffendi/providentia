Rainy day in NYC, had just spent 2 hours standing in freezing weather at the TKTS stand in seaport to score memphis tickets, so we had a hankerin' for a hot bowl o' noodles. Came in a bit skeptical, despite rave reviews from family and friends, but coming from California, we had tasted some of the best, including Daikokuya, Santouka, and Shin-sen-gumi.  We were first impressed with the beautiful decor but really, who cares about decor, its all about the ramen.  And it didnt disappoint.  Kevin got the Hakata Ramen Lunch Set C, which comes with a bowl of fried spicy chicken and a salad, while Shuinn got the Karaka Men.  Both were outstanding, and were happy to say that it was the BEST ramen either of us have ever had.  (except in Japan).  The finishing touch was a nice complimentary cup of green tea at the end of the meal to cleanse the palate and soak up the delicious ramen juices.  We look forward to coming back whenever we're in town.
