i've been there for couple of times, place is nice and cozy and they have nice back yard but it is not enough. Food was ok but serverice was horrible, servers can't speak english and very slow. there was a middle age waitress, she was so rude and she doesn't know anything about restaurant, I think. She didn't change silvers for main course and she never stopped the table for asking about aNything!!! Â Never go back again!!!
