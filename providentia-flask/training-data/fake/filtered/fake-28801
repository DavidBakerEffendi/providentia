I went int to Briciola to have a glass of wine and make a reservation in person.  I did this for a few reasons, I had read Rosie C.'s Yelp Review and wanted to avoid any miscommunication at all.  I sat with a woman and her reservation book and discussed details.  I asked if I could put down 8-12 and confirm closer to the date.  She said that was fine, just make sure I called the Friday before.  Just call the day before.  She made a point to say several times that everyone would need to eat dinner and I assured her that would not be an issue.   I tried calling a few days and couldn't get through on the phone.  I intended to go in Thursday night to confirm that we would be 12 for dinner but they called me before I could get there.  The same woman who took my reservation told me that she needed to cancel it and wouldn't give me any explanation.  I tried to get her to work with me since she was leaving me with no place to host 12 people two days from now and she just kept repeating, "I know.  I'm sorry.  I can't."   What a nightmare.  I can't believe how unprofessionally they handled both taking the reservation, (repeatedly harassing me about everyone ordering dinner,) and canceling the reservation with very little notice and absolutely no explanation.
