It's some of the best grilled chicken I've ever had--I kind of didn't know it could be this good and that's before you've even gotten to the sauces which run the gamut from sweet and tangy to spicy and creamy.  The macaroni and cheese is out of control too.  My wife's a vegetarian and loves the salads.  I too enjoy them when I steal a bite of hers but it's all about that bird.
