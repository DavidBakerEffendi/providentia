Joey's is a welcome and long overdue addition to Morris Cove. It doesn't aim to be the next boutique incarnation of pizza as it was prepared and served in 1925, nor should it be judged on that criteria. Joey D's will earn its merit in the spirit of those who grew up Italian in the near yesterday, not as a depression-era émigré or protégé. Joey's may be the only place in New Haven where you will enjoy generous toppings on consciously crafted specialty pizzas (not apizza, read the sign) which are nearly overwhelming in the portions Joey calls "Small". New Haveners: The next time you visit Lighthouse Point, skip the trip back downtown and eat your Joey's at the beach.
