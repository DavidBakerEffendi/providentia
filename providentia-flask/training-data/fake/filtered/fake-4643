Finally, a different kind of Spanish restaurant! Unlike other Spanish restaurants that repeat the same old cliches, Salinas has several tapas and main dishes drawn from the food from the Balearic Islands. I've eaten at Salinas three times and every time I went, the food was impressively consistent and the place reminds me of a resort on Majorca Island in Spain. By the way, the picture doesn't do justice since it doesn't show the beautiful garden with a fireplace. If I want to impress anyone from foodie friends to colleagues or go on a date, I'd take them to Salinas without a doubt. "Crujiente" Â and "coles and coliflor" are ones that I'd recommend for those who aren't familiar with the Balearic cuisine. Also, try "torrija" for dessert - it'll please all your senses.
