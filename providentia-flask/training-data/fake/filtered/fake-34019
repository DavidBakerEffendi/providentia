What a fabulous restaurant!!! We had Â WONDERFUL vegetarian food that was seasoned to absolute perfection. The food had a slight hint of a Caribbean influence which made me savor each and every bite. The staff was so welcoming and nice. I loved it from the moment I walked in and was served water with lemon and cucumber in a ball jar. The food is very reasonably priced and it is a BYOB. I could tell they put much heart and soul into every detail of the dining experience. The live music only added to the great laid back ambiance. I also loved hearing some Bob Marley tunes when the live music was done for the evening. I highly recommend this new place in town!!!! Peace, love and Vital! PS- Can't wait to go back!!!
