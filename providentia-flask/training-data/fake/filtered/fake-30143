Love this place and I'm fortunate it's in my neck of the woods. Unfortunately the pollo pesto panini I ordered the first time stuck with me-It was so good I haven't gotten tired of ordering it time and again each and every time. The bread really does it for me. The problem is that it doesn't make for a very well rounded review but if you want a great panini in Queens this is undoubtedly your first stop. I'm guilty of not trying the pizza, with Rosas nearby I never felt the need and made this my panini destination. Price ? Well for around 8 bucks a panini with tax I would say that is more than reasonable. You'd probably pay slightly more at a more trendy place on Bedford ave if that's your cup of organic tea. I just like my fresh bread top stuffed with chicken and mozzarella.
