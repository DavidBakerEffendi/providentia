What a great find! The menu is limited, but everything that we ordered was absolutely fantastic. So fresh and flavorful; we'll absolutely return. They accommodated our party of 10 with ease and gave great service. The pasta dishes run small, but we ordered appetizers to share so the main meal ended up being the perfect size and left us feeling satisfied. Can't say enough good things about the wine either! We ordered the Montepulciano and Pinot Grigio to have a variety for the group, and they were outstanding. Prices are more than reasonable, with dishes starting at just $10!!
