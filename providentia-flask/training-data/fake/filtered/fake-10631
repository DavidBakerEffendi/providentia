Very cheap and super tasty! 6bucks gets you a huge plate of rice, veggies, and gyro or chicken with white sauce/hot sauce on the side for you to apply just the right amount. The hot sauce is like the hottest thing I've tasted and Ive eaten peppers off of a trees. Right now they just have a cart on 2nd and 14th, NE side of the street but it looks like they'll have a store soon so WATCH OUT! It was so much food I ended up carrying it home. *burp!
