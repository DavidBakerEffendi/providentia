while the food is good, the service is AWFUL!!  if you have an hour to wait AFTER you have placed your order then you will like it.  It would be far better if they told yoy when taking your order that it will be at least an hour before you see you food!   I certainly will not go back. NOT worth waiting that long. If is that busy then they need to have more cooks, burners to process orders in a timely fashion.  They are Crepes for goodness sakes!!  That should certainly be quick to prepare!!  maybe they have too many options and the poor chefs can't think straight. Service times need to improve drastically.
