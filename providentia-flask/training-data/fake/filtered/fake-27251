Don't go here ever!!! The owners mother is a heartless bitch, straight up. She's there all the time and she is  honestly the coldest person I've ever met. She's overtly nice on the surface, but I wouldn't trust her further than I could throw her.  Forget Le Barricou. Please do not support these people! These fashionable imposters are the epitome of the gentrification of Williamsburg. There goes the neighborhood and it all starts with these heartless imperialists.
