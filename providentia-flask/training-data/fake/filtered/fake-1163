This place... The things I could write about this place! What an amazing experience. The food, the service, the flowers, the atmosphere. I'm in love. Loved my dining experience here. I liked it here so much more than Le Bernadine actually. The venue and very pretty with a touch of coziness. Their theme is very elegant with a hint of shabby chic. The good was spectacular. I highly recommend their tasting menu for lunch. Only $58! Their most amazing tasting was his lobster salad. It was not your traditional salad at all. The staff was so wonderful!  What a wonderful way to start off my birthday!  Thank-you Gramercy Tavern - you guys rock!
