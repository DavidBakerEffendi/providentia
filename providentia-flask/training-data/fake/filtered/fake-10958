Visited them yesterday for the first time for take out. Ordered the steak and shrimp, and fettucine and shrimp. Both were quite good. A very unexpected bonus was that I ordered a separate order of french fries, and I must tell you, they were virtually indistinguishable from McDonald's fries, and we all know that McDonald's has the best fries on planet Earth, regardless of what you might think of them or fast food in general. So, that really surprised me. The also have Coca-Cola in the tall neck green glass bottles. Bottled in Mexico, its much better than the Coke you find in stores because its made with cane sugar. Coke bottled in the US is made with corn syrup. You can taste the difference. They have a lot of shrimp dishes and the menu is extensive. Its a small, out-of-the-way place, but definitely worth a visit.
