Their cheesesteaks are the BEST! My wife and I had our wedding reception here -- about 150 guests. They could not have been more cordial or responsive to what we wanted. We were having problems with our florist the day of the event -- they went out to the football field across the street and picked daisies with only minutes to go! Always get wiz, wit -- if you didn't know that already!
