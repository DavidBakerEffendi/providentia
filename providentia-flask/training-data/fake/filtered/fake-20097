VERY DISAPPOINTED - I have had breakfast there before and it has always been great.  I had lunch there on 11/17 and it was SO disappointing.  I ordered chicken pot pie - it came as chicken soup, no gravy - broth instead, no pastry crust and only THREE tiny pieces of shreded chicken. The roll tasted like it came from a pack you would get at the supermarket and the cole slaw was average. They gave me a fork and knife to eat the chicken pot pie with.  The waitress was less than helpful - seemed like she was doing me a favor to acknowledge my presence.
