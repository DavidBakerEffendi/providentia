Definitely one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The food is amazing, everything I've ordered here (after several visits spanning 3 years) has been delicious and satisfying. The portions are great (lots of left overs) and the price is perfect. Not the cheapest, but definitely fair and totally worth it. It can get crowded on weekend nights (though I've never had to wait), the building is beautifully old and well kept, and the garden is one of the sweetest, most relaxing places to eat. I haven't been to the lower level where they have live music, but I've heard it from the garden and it's a great soundtrack for a wonderful meal. The owners are also very nice and very Italian (read: boisterously hospitable), and the service is always quick and friendly.
