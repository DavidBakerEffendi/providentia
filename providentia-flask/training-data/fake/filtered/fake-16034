That was one of the highest points of our visit of NY! We are Russian living in Ohio but rarely do we enjoy going to any Russian places in the US. This restaurant was a unique  and  special place that made us think of our time there for days to come. From a very warm and hospitable environment to a very great authentic food - this is where you can experience Ukraine + Russia in all its best form! Thank you for making it really great!
