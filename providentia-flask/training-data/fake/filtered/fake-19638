$55.00 for pizza, drinks, salad bar and games, no big deal if the following didn't occur. Pizza was delivered to table after we asked for it 2x it took 1.5 hours it was cold and hard 50% of games were not working, ones that did didn't give kids tickets. Staff was HORRIBLE! Bathrooms were filthy chuck e cheese tripped knocked husbands salad into my hair, management LAUGHED chuck e cheese TOUCHED our son even after he was visibly scared and crying they did not utilize kid check system. Drive the extra distance and go to Bridgewater THEY ROCK!!!
