Awful experience. Wanted to spend some quality time with a team of folks, but they would'nt seat us because couple of the folks out of a large group of people were stuck in traffic and running late. The customer service was extremely rude!! Everybody from the reception folks to the "so-called" manager were rude. Even after repeated requests they would refuse to seat us. When they agreed to just seat the folks that were there, they changed our table to a corner which can only fit the folks there exactly and told us no-one can join the party later.. Very unpleasent experience. Never go with a group as they dont take reservations and are very inconsiderate.
