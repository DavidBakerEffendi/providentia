First time here. Went for Philly science week. Place is pretty large and has a nice outdoor area with fire pits. They also have a pingpong table and a ton of Jenga brick sets. They have large tables for 8-10 and smaller ones for 4. I saw a lot of people playing boardgames and having a blast. The beers are 7/14 for a half/liter for the most part. Good selection of beer and pretty solid food choices. I was surprised on how full this place was on an early Saturday afternoon, but its got the space for it. Food came out fast, I ordered a the frankfurt sausage? (beef one) it came with a good portion of sauerkraut and really good mustard. Got a Hofbrau and had a solid meal. Really want to come back for a happy hour and see what that's like. Hopefully on a less full stomach to try some more beers and food out.
