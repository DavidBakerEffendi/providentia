The pizzeria was very nice. A group of friends and I went there for lunch the other day and didn't think that it would be as nice as it was. When you walk in there are two large, well decorated - Victorian style - dining rooms. Â Very beautiful. Unfortunately, the service didn't match the decor. We were the only customers there for majority of the time we were there. After that two other couples came in. The waitress was no where to be found anytime we wanted to order. We had to wait at least 10 minutes before she would come around. She never smiled, actually she was very snappy and rude from the moment she came to take our drinks order. She served my friends and I in old plastic cups and we noticed that she served the other guests in nice glasses. Her overall service was below awful. The prices of the food were pretty expensive and the descriptions in the menu were incorrect. "Grilled Portabello Mushroom" isn't the same as HALF of a mushroom on salad. We didn't understand how how bill came up to almost $80 when we ordered 2 pizzas and two pitchers of sprite. I understand that there was 7 of us, but we didn't order that much. The food was okay, but I've had better. I definitely wouldn't pay that much for mediocre food and sub par service. I would never recommend this pizzeria to anyone.
