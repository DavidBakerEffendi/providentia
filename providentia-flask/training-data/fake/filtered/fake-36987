This tour is certainly one of the best things to do if you are in New York. Â Before booking this tour, it is important to know that it involves a lot of walking. However, we enjoyed every bit of it because we were a group of pizza lovers. A small downside is that it is not easy find a place to eat inside the pizza spots. However, one can certainly stand outside and have his/her pizza. The best thing about this tour is the quality of the tour guides. They are not only knowledgeable about pizza and its history, but also very friendly. We were extremely happy to learn a lot about pizza and hope to take this tour again sometime in the future.
