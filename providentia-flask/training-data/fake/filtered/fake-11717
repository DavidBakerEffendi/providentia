Always the place i go with family and friends for Sushi. Always get the all you can eat sushi! For the price, its a steal.  The sushi is always fresh and they have a special roll added to the menu everyday.  The only setback you may have is the language barrier with the waiters and it may interfere with service but that may only result in you getting your drink 5 minutes late.
