I am a New Yorker! Have been to many places to have Chicken Teriyaki and Spicy Tuna Roll, but not as good as the ones I had in Sakura Japan. They had always been consistent with the quality of their food. That is why everytime I am in the Newark area...I make sure that I swing by to get my favorite Chicken Teriyaki and Spicy Tuna....Yummy! Now I feel hungry...lol.
