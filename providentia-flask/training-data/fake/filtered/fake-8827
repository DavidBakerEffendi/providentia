My wife and I have systematically tried every pizza place in the Caldwells and for some reason we can't get away from Pizza Barn! Now, there are a few shops in town that make different kinds of pizza better i.e. the more gourmet specialty type pies. And if that's what we're in the mood for we'll go to the other places. But for an standby that will never let you down time after time, we haven't found anywhere better. The owner and co-workers are always very friendly and the service/wait times have always been good to excellent. Cheers!
