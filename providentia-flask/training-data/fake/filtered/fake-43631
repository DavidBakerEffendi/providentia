I was excited to eat here and went for dinner tonight and the food was not particularly good.  The food was mediocre at best.  To top off the mediocre experience, (which was not cheap), the waitress was rather rude.  It was as if she thought I was in the hippest  place in town but it definitely is not that.  She seriously needed a reality check and I mean seriously!  :) The restaurant / breakfast joint is lucky that there is currently a limited choice in the neighborhood. I will not be returning for dinner and do not recommend eating here. PS  truffle fries are not good for you!  ;)
