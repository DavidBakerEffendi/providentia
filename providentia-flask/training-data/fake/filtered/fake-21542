Terrible! Terrible! Terrible! Why does this always seem to happen? A relatively good vegetarian restaurant gradually comes to serve dishes that look as if they were made by an overeager recently-converted to vegetarianism undergrad. Too many ingredients all mushed together to produce something way below average and totally unprofessional. Everything is so busy and overly flavored and extra large. My veggie burger came cold, had no taste and was overall unimpressive. The homemade bread tasted like dough. It was dry and seems to have been made by someone who clearly does not know how to use the bread machine.The pasta salad was terrible. I felt like I was eating my roommate's leftover pasta from a couple of days ago that he made in the middle of exam week. The only reason I can think of that makes this place popular is because it must still be cool to eat in alternative "vegetarian/vegan" "local" spots with extra large desserts. Oh, and I came with a large party and we all feel the same way. Sorry Claire, but unless you radically change something, I cannot give you anything but one star.
