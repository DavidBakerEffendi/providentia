We have been coming to Zorbas for years now, and often take any guests visiting us in Philly here! Its definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots! Let me just say that the grilled octopus is some of the best in this city! I have to get it every time I go. The grilled charcoal sampler is awesome and what I get most often. The lamb dishes are very well prepared and juicy. Very authentic and flavorful! The staff is wonderful and lively! AND its BYOB!!! Always a great place to go, even with groups! I'd recommend reservations on weekends now/.
