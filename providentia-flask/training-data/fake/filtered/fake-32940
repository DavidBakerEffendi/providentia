I am biased I guess, I'm a local.  I am acquainted with the proprietors peripherally from having occasionally bought stuff at the radio deli, which is a nice comfortable place that they also run. The food is basically well done american basic breakfasts and dinnerish foods at a very reasonable price in a very nice setting.   To be completely fair if I went to this place in some other city, I'd probably knock off a star for having the *only* tea selection be lipton.  People who want tea don't frickin' want limpton. But, I the place is great.  Veggie benedict is amazing.  Cheesburger with fries is an outrageously good deal.
