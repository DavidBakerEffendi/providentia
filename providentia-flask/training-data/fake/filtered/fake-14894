The food tasted alright, but was drowned in MSG. The only reason we came to this restaurant was because our shuttle driver suggested it. Turns out he suggests this place to everyone and is most likely making some kind of referral commission! I had the beef noodle stew and fried pork potstickers. The beef noodle stew was fine, except that the MSG gave me the worst stomachache. As for service, it was mediocre. Could have been better, but by the time we had to pay I was feeling nauseous from all the MSG so I didn't really care.
