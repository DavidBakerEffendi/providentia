I accidentally stumbled upon this place late on valentines day. My bf at the time didn't even want to go inside, he said it reminded him of a nursing-home. I guess it was because most couples there were over 50 w/a few exceptions. I dragged him anyway. He was right in a sense, there is nothing glam, trendy or pretentious about this establishment. Instead, it is an old-fashioned french classic, warm, cozy and welcoming. We both walked out most impressed. Food is fantastic, regardless of your preference. It's been 7 years and I don't think I've ever had a bad meal. The owner/manager always greets us with a smile. I tend to see familiar faces every time I'm there and staff has not changed much, that says a lot about the way they run their business. Good bartender as well. Some of my favorites are; monk fish, mushroom or carrot/ginger soup, lobster risotto, tuna steak and seared scallops. The flour-less chocolate cake w/hazelnut ice cream takes about 20min but totally worth it. One of my favorite restaurants. I will continue coming here with my family and friends.
