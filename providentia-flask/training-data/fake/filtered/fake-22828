I went to the CiCis of North Brunswick for the first time on 7/16/13. I have frequented one back in PA. Since it's $5 dinner buffet for July I decided to try it out once more. The reason I am giving it two stars is very simple, not enough variety. The CiCis website advertises 28 varieties of pizza, ranging from lighter veggies pizzas to hearty meat pizzas. This location had probably 7 varieties out for the time I was there, and not only just 7, but they were mainly veggie-based pizzas and weren't nearly diverse enough. Frankly, I am not going to a pizza buffet for the wide array of vegetables. Thankfully the desserts salvaged the experience. I would NOT go back to the North Brunswick location. However, if you just want to gorge on unlimited amounts of low quality pizza (Which I did), have at it.
