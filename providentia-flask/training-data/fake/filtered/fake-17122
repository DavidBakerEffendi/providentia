I went here a few weeks ago and it was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had!  The service and food was excellent and the atmosphere was warm and relaxing.  I actually proposed to my girlfriend there and the planning and execution was flawless!  It was everything I could have asked for and more.  From top to bottom I was extremely impressed with everything!  A definite must for people looking for a top notch restaurant in the city.
