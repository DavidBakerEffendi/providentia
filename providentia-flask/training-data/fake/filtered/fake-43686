I've been to Five Leaves several times and have always had a great experience here.  Even Sunday brunch (when I had to wait for a table for about 20-30 mins and had a drink at their bar across the street)! Consistently delicious food.  Love the black kale salad, bacon wrapped dates, BLAT with egg, and lamb they had a while back.
