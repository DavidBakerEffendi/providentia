TLDR: strong sangria, amazing short ribs, get the pulpo ceviche. Went on a Friday night around 8, had a reservation but probably didn't need one at that time. Waitresses were nice, didn't hover over us. Music was super weird but entertaining (glee soundtrack?). Not a big fan of the tvs in the restaurant. The space is really skinny, but it makes everything seem cozy -- the people next to us were chatting with us throughout the night. We got a pitcher of sangria, which was a good deal and sneaky strong. The chips+corn they give you (free!) were great, especially with that green sauce. We ordered the ceviche sampler with the mixed, octopus, and mussel ceviche. It came out kind of late, but the waitress was really nice about it. The octopus one was in the most delicious, smoky, creamy sauce - I kept dipping the other fish in it. For tapas, we had fish tacos, which were very fresh and crispy. But the ribs really were the best part - falling off the bone, covered in a savory brown sauce, and sooo tender. Get them. I was very impressed, and liked the chill vibe. Would definitely come back.
