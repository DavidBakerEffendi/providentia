Bubbys for thanksgiving.... Let me start out by saying that I commend Bubbys for the idea.  A "pay what you want" charity dinner is amazing in theory.  Just lacking on the execution.  I heard it was going to be great - but I have to say I was more than a bit disappointed. First - In their defense - our reservation was for 8:30pm and since they started at 3 I had my doubts about how much food would be left on the table for us latecomers.  However - they shouldn't have invited us to diner if they weren't going to feel like giving us any food.  What we got was leftovers on a cold buffet served by a staff that was clearly tired and ready to go home. I was looking forward to the high-quality and tasty food that Bubbys is known for but instead we got watery cranberry sauce, butchered turkey bits and overcooked ham. We stayed because at that point we were starving for thanksgiving and since it was for charity we figured we should do our part.  Our table staff was actually cheery and helpful and seemed like they felt a bit guilty what was on our plates. In general the place was homey and local and probably would have been much nicer at breakfast where we would have ordered off the menu and received fresh food. Perhaps I would consider giving Bubbys another try on another day - but for all of you who at at home with your actual Bubby on this holiday - give thanks that you weren't with us.
