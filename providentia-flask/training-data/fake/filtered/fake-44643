This was the best brunch I've ever had.  We shared the zucchini frittata, polenta waffles with mascarpone and strawberries and the hazelnut crusted french toast and they were all AMAZING.  The service was wonderful, the atmosphere was great - a perfect blend of rustic and elegant, and the bathrooms were huge and beautiful.  I will go back any time I'm in NYC.  YUM!
