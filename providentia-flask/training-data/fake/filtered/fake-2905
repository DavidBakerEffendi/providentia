I did not get to eat the food at Cuban Pete's. On Saturday, July 3, our party of five walked in for dinner at around 9:15 pm. The two hostesses (both young) were indifferent and told us to stand on the stairs and wait until they seated us. Oddly, the hostess stand (also the check-out terminal) is right in the passage between the two sections of the restaurant. Since no one was paying us any attention, I turned to the harried manager and said, "We'd like to eat here, but are feeling neglected." To which he responded, "Then perhaps you should find another place to eat." Wow. Too arrogant by half. On our way out, I turned back and said, "Sir, there are blogs where one can let others know about such experiences." "Have a good night!" he retorted. So, I'm letting you know. There are enough other good restaurants in Montclair, NJ. Avoid this one. They don't deserve your business.
