If you're a company DO NOT order from this place.  They were absolutely rude when placing the order and during the delivery, if you could even call it that.  The women at my job were referred to as pigs, due to the amount that was ordered (there are more men working here) and the delivery guy refused to come upstairs.  We had to go outside to pick up the food ourselves because he wouldn't even come into the lobby.  Luckily it wasn't raining.  I will absolutely never be ordering from this place again.
