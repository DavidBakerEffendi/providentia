One star in terms of customer service. As other reviewers have said, the people there literally stand and stare and whisper to each other in taiwanese, and the one girl who worked there yelled at my friend and I when we tried to eat a sandwich, even though she said it was okay to eat there while we had the boba drinks we bought from them. Clearly she misunderstood my question and exploded (unprofessional). My advice, if there's no one in there, there's a reason.
