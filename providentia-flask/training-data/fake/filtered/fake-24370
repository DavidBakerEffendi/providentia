I have been to Sawatdee more times than I can count. When we go with friends, we always order the appetizer sampler. It is amazing. You get egg rolls (or spring rolls), cream cheese wontons, and the sarong special. It is the perfect amount for four hungry adults. My husband always enjoys the pad thai as do I. You can order based on your heat preference, but the amount of heat you get depends on the chef that night. There are times when I can handle four peppers and where other times four becomes a nightmare. I recently discovered the Sri Racha Seafood with shrimp. I found it to be really good and quite spicy. The shrimp were perfectly cooked and vegetables were fresh. We have always had very good service. The server is attentive but not overbearing, and the food always comes out quick.
