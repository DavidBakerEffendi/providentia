The sake bombs here are THE TRUTH! If you go here for dollar taco night AND happy hour, its the perfect storm of happiness. The food is really quality and very unique, great beer selection & margaritas, good prices. It's not super cheap, but its not as expensive as it should be. But the thing that got me loco was the sake! I saw the sign on the marquee saying "Ask us about the Sake" so naturally my friends and I tried it. Our server brought us this HANDLE of warm sake and a bunch of hand made ceramic shot glasses that were beautiful! We dunked our shots and our night was off the a phenomenal start. We had a blast eating and drinking, even the servers were getting down and taking shots with us! Seriously, thank you Loco Pez for that amazing night, it was much needed. If there's one thing I learned is to ALWAYS "ask about the sake" at Loco Pez, every. damn. time. ~ Steve and Yousef
