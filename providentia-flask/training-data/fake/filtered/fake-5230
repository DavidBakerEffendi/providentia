As a Child of Montclair, now in my Golden Years, who has traveled the world, I am one of those people that keeps coming back "like a song" to that sweet used to be when it comes to Marzullos. There is something delightfully absurd, in this day and age of fast food, mall food courts and pizza stands, to find such an exquisite establishment as Marzullo's Restaurant & Cafe.  Whenever I think of wanting that special dish I know if it is not on the menu the Owners will go out of the way to make something I crave. There is a panache and a joi de vivre from the moment I walk through the door. Whether I am choosing to eat in the deli side of the restaurant and begin to salivate going right up to the counter or stepping into a dinning room that transports me to Rome, Naples or Florence. I'm going to be satisfied. I remember when they reopened and had this state-of-the art new dining room, I rented a white stretched limousine for my friend's birthday, to take 8 friends for lunch.  The service and the appetizers. the main course and the deserts were to die for to say the least.  Reservations were made so we had exactly the table I wanted for the event.   I have been there for brunch, lunch and dinner...even a repast for over 30 people with the same exquisite service and food. I am a wana-be-Italian and my friends all love to go to this place. It's like coming home.  Nobody does it better in the Suburban Essex area...and I know.
