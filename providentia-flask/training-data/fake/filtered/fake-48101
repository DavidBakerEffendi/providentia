I was in a mood for some Corned Beef Hash and Eggs for breaskfast so I called and ordered for my coworkers and myself from Los Papi's. What a disappiontment, they sent us old Hash (being a lover of Hash, I know the difference) and wheat toast that seemed to be stale (no bread delivery this morning?) We should have sent it all back, instead we tossed it out and ordered from somewhere else.            Papi What Happened?! This isn't the like you, Getting the orders wrong 9 out of 10 times I can deal with, but old food.........No Good!
