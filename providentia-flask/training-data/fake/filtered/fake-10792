Being a burger fan I really wanted to try 500 degrees.  I was in Center City for class and decided to grab a quick lunch.  I ordered a regular cheeseburger medium well with fries and a soda and what did I get when the guy behind the counter handed me my bag?  Probably one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  The burger itself looks small, but is really filling the fries were good too.  I think they make their own buns which are really tasty and are a nice alternative to the regular buns you get at other places.  The service was fast and friendly. Pros: Great burgers. good service, clean store Cons: A little pricey
