We had a rehearsal dinner at Laviola Ouest and were very pleased.  We sent the following email: Gerta, and the entire staff, Your food and service were incredible!  People could not say enough about how delicious it was.  They were also pleased and impressed by so many wonderful menu choices.  I especially appreciate how accommodating you were to me, personally!  It worked quite well that the bridal party/parents were the last to be served, because I changed my mind about both the salad and entree.  The staff was very willing to allow me to do so.  Please thank the kitchen for me, too, as I know serving our party of 60 and the outer party of 50 is quite a feat. The desserts were also a hit.  Again, thank you for the choices and for the exceptional quality.  I know that the bride's family and friends will recommend the restaurant.  When we come back, you will be our first stop.  We have already recommended you to our friends as a definite destination not to miss in Philly.
