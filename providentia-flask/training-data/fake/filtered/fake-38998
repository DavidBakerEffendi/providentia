I love this restaurant! I have been here multiple times and it is consistenly great.  The pasta is all homemade (my favorite is the risotto special with the sausage ragu) - their house wine is fantastic.  The prices are very reasonable as well. They have a nice outdoor seating area when the weather is nice. Love!
