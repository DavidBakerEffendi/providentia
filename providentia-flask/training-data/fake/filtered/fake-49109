Stopped here for lunch one afternoon, I was pleasantly surprised. Appealing and fairly vast lunch menu selections at reasonable prices for the quality of food. I had the penne a la vodka with chicken which was very good. The chicken was a bit overcooked and tough but the pasta was well done and the sauce was light and creamy. Really nice ambience when you sit near the window facing the main street. Service was extremely and unreasonably slow given the restaurant was not busy, Basically felt like we were seated and just left there on our own, and this accounts for much of the lower rating here. Much room for improvement with the staff. Appeared the two managers were walking around basically doing nothing when glasses were empty on tables. Don't understand this. Otherwise enjoyable
