I love Sanford's. This is my favorite restaurant in Queens (and I have tried quite a few). The list of reasons that I love Sanford's is long, but here's a few: I have been coming to Sanford's since before the renovation, when it was a low key, no frills, 10-page menu typical NYC diner with great food and a friendly waitstaff who quickly learned our names. Post-renovation, the decor is lovely, the food remains delicious, the prices are reasonable, the staff remains friendly and they haven't fallen into the trap of upscaling and adopting a pretentious attitude. I think they are a prime example of what I have always loved about NYC (and is very hard to find now). The food is delicious. With rare exception (because no place is perfect), I have tried most of the dishes on the menu and you really can't go wrong. Their brunch is legendary and, what many people miss out on, is their weekday breakfast, where you can get a hot meal and a coffee for under $5 in a mellow environment - beats the bagel place down the street! Open 24 hours = a BBQ pulled pork sandwich on demand! Mmmmmmm..! Forget greasy fried eggs for your hangover cure! The waitstaff are lovely to customers both older and younger (always kind to my 4 year old nephew's antics and I very often see young parents eating there will kids of all ages). They play deep house at exactly the right volume. Com'on, what restaurant gets that right?? My only complaint is that now other people know about my favorite... er... 'secret' spot and occasionally you may have to wait a few minutes for a table. I often wonder when they are going to open an extension...
