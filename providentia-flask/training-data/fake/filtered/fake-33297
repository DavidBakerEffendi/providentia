Went there for the first time I had the ox tails my boyfriend had the jerk chicken. The ox tails were delicious, the chicken was very good, we decided to go again the next day. I had the escovitch fish which was wonderful, my boyfriend had the jerk pork I had a taste of his pork and it was delicious. It takes a little while to get your food but when you get it its worth the wait. We will definitely go back and recommend it.
