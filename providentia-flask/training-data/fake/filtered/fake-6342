I went here for drinks with a couple of friends who love whiskey.  I do not drink whiskey, but must say I loved this place! The decor is great, we kept saying we were in a period piece because the jazzy music and decor are not of this time.  The bartender was super friendly and the appetizers that we ordered were truly phenomenal! Though I had a delicious glass of wine, my friends loved their whiskey. I will definitely be back!
