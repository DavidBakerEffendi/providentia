We drove past Mamma Rosa's for quite some time before giving it a chance, and i'm glad we did.  Although we've never dined at the location (which is small and tight, and offers outdoor seating), we take out food often and the quality is excellent. Always a lot of food, piping hot and made with fresh ingredients.   The lasagna rivals my grandmother's recipe, and we've tried their baked ziti, rigatoni with vodka sauce, tortellini with meat, meatball sub, chicken cutlet sandwich, pizza, etc.  We've never been disappointed.  Their meatballs are the best we've had around - you can tell they're not frozen/reheated, and they're a larger size than competitors in the area.  They use fresh herbs in their dishes which make all the difference.   Each entree comes with soup or salad, and I absolutely recommend their SOUP!  The take out salad is small and nothing to write home about, but each time we order they offer a different option (spinach egg drop, cream of mushroom, cream of potato with bacon & horseradish, seafood bisque, pasta fagiole, etc.  We have never been disappointed with their soup.  They also provide bread with the entrees Give it a chance and you'll see - Mamma Rosa's food is excellent!
