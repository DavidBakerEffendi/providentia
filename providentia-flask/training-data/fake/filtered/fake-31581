Been there a few times now and each time the food and service has been great. The arepas are fantastic and the drink specials on weeknights (Happy Hour all night Mondays, 2 for 1 mojitos on Tuesdays, $15 sangria pitchers on Wednesdays) are a nice bonus. The manager came by to check in, which was a nice personal touch, and our waitress Alexis was especially attentive, friendly, and fun. Her recommendations were great, and we'll definitely be back again soon. The huge windows looking out onto the East River and the Manhattan skyline make the setting even better!
