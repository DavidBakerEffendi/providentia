AMAZING!! For a quick bite, I would definitely recommend Mac Attack. The staff is incredibly friendly. They made sure that everything in our order was perfect and we were satisfied. I recommend the Reuben Mac and the Smoked Chicken Mac. If you're looking for grilled cheese, the Manchego and Apple was super tasty. I will definitely be back!!
