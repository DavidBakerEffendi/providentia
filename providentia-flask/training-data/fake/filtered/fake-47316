We heard so many things about the place in past few weeks. Some so so reviews and others who like the place. We have been in for both lunch & dinner 3 times and have found our visits exteramly good. The crab cakes are so good I hade them as a dinner entree for lunch today. Beer selection is greatn and they now offer Â " Flights of Beers" which consists of 4- 5ounce sampling of any draft for $7. , Burgers are huge, great and juicy. Service at lunch was quick and efficient. We were in and out in no time at all. We are fans.
