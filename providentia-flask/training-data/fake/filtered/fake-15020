I have one major complaint about Angelos Family Restaurant and Pizza, which means I cannot recommend eating there. The complaint is based on the fact 'the customer is always right', and they should make the pricing on the menu clear. The extra money we paid is irrelevant.   Although the food was good, I felt cheated when I got the bill. My wife and I each had a salad and we shared a Margherita Pizza. The waitress took our order and we told her we wanted a pizza that was on the dinner menu. The only price we saw on the dinner menu for a Margherita Pizza was $12.95. When she brought the pizza it was good but it was not worth $19.00, which we found out was the price when we got the bill. The owners wife explained to me we had gotten the large pizza that they sell for $17 for take out orders only & she promplty showed me a take out pizza price for $17. The waitress never let us know we were going to pay much more for the margherita pizza she recommended on the menu.   I asked Mrs. owner why $19 nto $17 - she replied we ate the pizza with the rest of our meal in the dining room. I should have known the pizza pricing I was payng was not on the menu. I told her why should I pay the extra $6 dollars. She promptly said have a nice evening.
