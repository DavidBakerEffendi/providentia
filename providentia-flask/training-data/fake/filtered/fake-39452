The best part about this place is the happy hour. The nachos are only 4$ dollars, and thats about what they're worth. At night things get a little hairier... Make sure you lie to the person taking people's names for tables. They have a ridiculous policy where they'll refuse to seat you if you have an "incomplete" party. They'll let anyone come in and sit ahead of you, regardless of how busy they are. You can walk in and put your name in for a table, seeing that one is open right in front of you, but if you foolishly admit you're waiting for another, they'll sit the next two people who come in. This applies to any group size. If you are a party of three and they ask if you're waiting for someone and you say yes, they'll seat the next three people who come in after you, at the table that has been sitting there open for several minutes, because they are a "complete" party. There are plenty of other mexican restaurants with better food in the area and if you're looking for dollar tacos, Interstate 95 has them on the same night, and you can sit wherever you want without having to deal with a bitchy manager.
