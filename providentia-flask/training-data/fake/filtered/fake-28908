Think Cheers. It is the oldest bar in Philadelphia and one of the most popular. It also is where hotels reccomend out of towners go for a taste of Ohiladelphia. PBR pitcher is only $6.50! The staff and management is super nice and goes out of their way to make sure you have a good time. Sunday and Wednesday is Karaoke and always a good time. Between Chesnut and Walnut on a small street, Drury, off of 13th. Street. Five stars!!!!
