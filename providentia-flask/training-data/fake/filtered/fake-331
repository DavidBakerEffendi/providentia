Pat's is the famous cheesesteak place in Philly, across the street from Geno's. I usually grab one from each place then share with a friend. One has better meat, one has better cheese. I always forgot which! However, it's not about the cheese, it's the experience. The service is awesome & like one of those old TV shows where the whole gang gets in on the act. Love the old photos & memorabilia lining the storefront!
