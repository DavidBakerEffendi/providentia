Ok one major problem with this place is the price.  Its pricey as hell - if you're looking for beach-side bungalo pricing, wrong place.  If you put in perspective you're getting New England-type seafood delivered to Brooklyn, then you're more ok about having to pay the premium to get your seafood fix.   We ordered: Little neck clams (deliciously awesome but only 6 for $11 is the downer),  crabcakes (awesome), clam chowder(awesome), and peel n eat shrimp (awesome). For the Mains we opted for the a la carte ordering instead of the preset buckets they offer, first time there so we splurged.  1 Order of 11/2 lb king crab, 6 blue crabs, mac n cheese, and 2 orders of corn.   For $48 bucks alone the King crab should've come with more than 3 medium sized legs... maybe we're wrong but felt very-not worth it, still slightly cold even though should've been served hot.  Blue crabs were sweet but definitely on the small spectrum if you went down the Baltimore right now.   All in all, expect to pay more than what you get.  Everything was great, fresh delicious but all a matter if you're willing to pay for your fresh seafood fix.  That is all.
