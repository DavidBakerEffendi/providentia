The pizza is good, but the owner's attitude sucks!  I was rushing tonight and when i left the restaurant I  forgot my pie.  We went shopping and when I called back he said he had just thrown it out.  I asked for another and he told me to forget about it!  I fussed and then he agreed to give me singles that he had lying around.  He tossed loose singles in a dirty pizza box and threw slices of cold pepperoni on the slices.   We will never go back!  I will suggest that our school orders pizza from someone else and with all of the good pizzerias in Jersey, you need to have an owner with a positive attitude.
