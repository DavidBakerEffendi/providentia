It's more like 3 1/2 stars sometimes 4 on a good day.  I've been here 4 times in the last 3 weeks and tried a different dish each time.  Friday I had some great spanish style tilapia with a side of rice and beans which was really good.  Other days I had the beef stew and chicken where the meat fell off the bone.  I've yet to try it but my co-worker who used to work across the street says he loved their oatmeal.  i definitely want to try their breakfast some morning.
