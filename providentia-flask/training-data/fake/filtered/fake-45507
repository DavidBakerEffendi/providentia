Andrew K. went to a Chinese restauarant and expected to get good Thai food?!!  It's like complaining about the hamburgers at a seafood restaurant... I find the Chinese food to be more than adequate, less spiked with undesirables, and very tasty.  This restaurant is comparable to T. S. Ma in Montclair but has a much cheaper lunch special at $5.99 for takeout ($6.99 for dine-in).  Best of all, any dish in the menu can be made into a lunch special.  You can't beat that! Only negative is parking (street only).  There are meters along Bloomfield Ave as well as 3 municipal spots in the nearby bank.  West-bound eaters will have to do a u-turn somewhere quiet to get back on Bloomfield Ave.
