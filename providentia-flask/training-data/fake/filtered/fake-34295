Yes, the fellow who takes your reservation over the phone comes off as rude and as if he is doing you a favor. That's one of the quirks of Sushi Yasuda. Don't let it put you off... I don't think it is intentional. This is the best sushi in NYC unless you want to shell out big bucks for Masa or Kuruma zushi. Sit at the bar. Get the omakase. Expect to pay about $125-$150 per person if you're a big eater like me. Enjoy!
