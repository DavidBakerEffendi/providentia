We were seated upstairs and right next to a party of 20.  It was extremely loud.  The servers and service was great, fast and friendly.  Highlight was the house salad and homemade cheesecake.  Husband dissappointed in mozzerella app and his pasta entree.  I loved my 1/2 portion of gnocchi and and salmon entree.  Would suggest the oil on the table for the bread be seasoned as it was bland.
