Because I am on a diet, these days I tried to eat healthier. Mr. Lee, the friendly owner, suggested the vegetarian cheese steak. It sounded healthy so I decided to order it. I was never a fan of vegetables, but, I did eat it from time to time to feel healthier. While I was waiting for my vegetarian cheese steak, I was able to talk to the owner and the employees who were very down to earth people. When my steak came out, it was steaming and colorful from all the different vegetables that it consisted of. Then I went to the counter to look for a sauce that met my taste requirements.(they had about 10 different sauces). I decided to put the sweet chilli sauce mixed with the spicy dijon sauce on my steak. Every single bite made me take another look at the steak because i was in disbelief that what I was eating were actually vegetables. Best of all, after I ate the steak, I felt good about myself eating something that was as healthy, cheap, and tasteful as Lee's deli's vegetarian cheese steak was. Then as I finished my steak, I saw the famous carrot cakes on the counter. I decided to eat it even though my stomach was stuffed. The Carrot cakes were perfect for topping off a great meal. I pity those who have not tried Lee's Deli's vegetarian cheese steak or their carrot cakes.
