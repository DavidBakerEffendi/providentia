Myself and a few colleagues decided last minute we would work through lunch to complete a project we were working on so we ordered takeout at the new JG Domestic located in the lobby.  Well,  what a mistake, a few of us ordered burgers only to have them prepared all wrong and with only the bottom bun.  I was the only one who decided to take my burger back and have it prepared the way it was ordered.  It was prepared wrong again and the manager's short anwsers and negative body languge said it all.  After waiting another half hour they finally got it right and the burger turned out to be excellent.  However, when I checked the burger before leaving I asked the manger about the fries and he said if you think I need to change them then I will.  This is the comment that cemented my experience and caused me to write this review.  In closing, everybody else was professional and gracious, but the beauty about money is it doesn't go bad and they never have to worry about my patronage again!!!!!
