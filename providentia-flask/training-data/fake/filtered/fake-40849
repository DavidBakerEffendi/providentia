This is a PIZZA pie! Lovely coal oven made crust, slightly sweet tomato sauce, salty mozzarella cheese, and a sprinkle of freshly chopped basil. Classic! The homemade Caesar salad with thin shavings of pecorino cheese and crunchy croutons was fabulous. Â  I've been a patron of this place for years. The atmosphere is homey with no frills. The service is family, tourist, and local yokel friendly.
