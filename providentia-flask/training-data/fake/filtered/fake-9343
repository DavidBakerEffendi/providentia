Awesome service. Our waitress was sweet and helpful. Restaurant was clean with very cute decor. I only ordered the halo halo (because I ate my dinner at Elvie's - BTW, no good. That's why I went to Grill 21 for dessert because I did not want to waste any more time or money on Elvie's). Halo halo was a huge serving and delicious. From what I saw of the food being ordered by other tables, it looked delicious! Nice presentation and all... I'll be back for more dinners at Grill 21.
