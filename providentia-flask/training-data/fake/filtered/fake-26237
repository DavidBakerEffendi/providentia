My name is Phillip Gilmour. I am one of the 3 owners of momo sushi shack. One of the the other 2 owns Bozu. And like David B. who recently gave us 1 star, this is my first review. He refers to me twice as debu guy. Debu means fat in Japanese... He seems like some sort of modern day Oscar Wilde and I am honored to be insulted by him.
