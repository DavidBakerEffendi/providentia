Overall, we really enjoyed our experience at Jeepney this evening.  The staff was very courteous and the food was great!  First time eating filipino food and will definitely go back again.  I would recommend the fried red snapper, Lumpiang Shanghai and the Bicol Express.  A cool new restaurant to try.
