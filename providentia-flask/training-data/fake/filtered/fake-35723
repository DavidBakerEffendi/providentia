I went to Panevino about 2 weeks ago with a friend for dinner with great expectations. I've driven by a few times and the parking lot is always packed so I've always thought that this place must be good. We get seated on the enclosed patio which is a nice atmosphere but the heat must have been up to 80. I thought I was going to melt. Its winter guys. I'm wearing boots and a sweater! It was uncomfortable to say the least. It took about 5 minutes for our server Emily to come greet us, bring us bread and take out drink order. We order our dinner a few minutes later. I had the aroncini (delicious) and the sole (also pretty tasty). My friend ordered the mixed seafood (unimpressive).  After our food came our server never came to check on us or refill my drink.  Every time I tried to get her attention she seemed too consumed in an argument with another male server. Very frustrating. Also when I walked through the restaurant the woman who seated me was standing in the middle of the restaurant eating yogurt. I thought this was very weird. I've worked in the restaurant industry for years when I was younger and it was never appropriate to eat in the dining room in front of customers. The service here left something to be desired and if it weren't for that I would definitely come back because the food was pretty tasty.
