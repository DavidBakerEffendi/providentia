Ate there last night. first time.  Overpriced and over crowded. Saturday night is a busy night for most restaurants, but they cram people in. Yes it's a business, but when you take away from the dining experience that will hurt your business. I went with my family of four and we were seated at the same size square table that were used for two. Ok if you like eating with your elbows tucked in. The waitor was trying to do a good job, but with that noise level we could not here the long list of specials he had to memorize. Just add a printed page to the main menu.   Food was adequate , but again pricey. With 2 deserts (apple something-not tasty at all) ,no salad and our own wine, we spent approx. $120. Place probably OK for a younger crowd not familiar with, or don't care about a pleasant dining experience, but in the Rutherford, Lyndhurst area there many other restaurants to choose from where you can walk out with a smile on your face even if the price is higher. Not recommended for a family
