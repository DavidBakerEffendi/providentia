I don't understand why people rave about this place so much, I did not have much of a good experience with their service and food in my first two  visit. I decided to try my luck for one last time so I  ordered the massamam curry, it was nice in the beginning of a few spoonful bite after that  but boy! so much salt and sugary taste that my tongue was numbed, No more going to this restaurant .
