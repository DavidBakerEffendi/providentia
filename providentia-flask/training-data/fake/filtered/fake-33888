I ordered a whole bronzino fish. It was set down in front of me, whole, with head and tail, in a very hot skillet, very unattractive, with nothing else in the pan - not even a simple sprig of parsley. ($28).  OK, but I asked if someone could filet it for me, which has been done many other times I have ordered it in a restaurant.  I was told, "The chef doesn't do that."  The waitress finally agreed to do it - after arguing with me that this is the way it is - and it came back full of bones (it's very dark in this place) and every forkful had bones in it no matter how many I tried to seek out and remove.  I complained and the waitress told me, again, "The chef doesn't DO that, and I only tried to help you as a courtesy!" - rather upset at me.  I have NEVER had a problem asking a restaurant which served fish whole, to debone it for customers!  And here I was made to feel I was asking for the inappropriate, and bothering the waitress!  The pumpkin risotto I ordered as a side dish was really horrible tasting.  So I spent almost $50 on a meal I could not eat.  I asked the waitress to share my complaint with the chef which she said she would.  Who knows if she did?  I will NEVER go back nor recommend this place to anyone.
