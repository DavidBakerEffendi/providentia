Idk what happened between last year and now. I was anticipating my trip to Geno's, I was already nearby for the annual Flower show. I was disappointed!! The taste was sooo off...the attitude I got from the overly made up lady behind the counter, the stiff fries....I won't be going back there...ever!! Â Geno's fell off BIG TIME!!!
