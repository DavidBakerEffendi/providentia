Its all been said. Johny is a great business owner-certainly makes you feel appreciate and welcome as a customer- the guys who work for him have pride in what they do, and the food is exactly what you want: tasty. Â SMALL-- like, too small for your jacket in the winter-- but if you go at the off hours, youll have the place to yourself. My personal favorite: Egg white omelette with spinach tomato and am cheese-- uses a little butter, but overall a healthy breakfast-- some whole wheat toast, unlimited coffee.. good potatoes. Life is good.
