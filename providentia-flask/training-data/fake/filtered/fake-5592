Yum... spent three days in Philly and spent ridiculous amounts of money of prior meals that were only so-so, until we walked in to this Noodle House. Great prices ($5-6 for a huge soupy noodle bowl) and just absolutely tasty noodles and broth. I got the roast duck noodle soup and my husband got a side of fried dumplings. Both were flavorful, piping hot, and not at all overcooked/rubbery. I actually went in here just to sneak to the loo (quite clean by the way), but we ended up taking a seat because I felt guilty. So glad we did! I will definitely make every effort to visit this place every time we're in Philadelphia. There's also a bakery a block up on 10th street that has the most delicious buns and pastries (lemon, chestnut, meat filled, you name it) for good prices.
