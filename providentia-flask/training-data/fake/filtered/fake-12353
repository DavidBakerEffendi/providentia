Wow, bad service,,,, I called to place an order for dinner, The girls said 1 min. puts the phone down and does not pick up for 11mins (according to my cell) I thought maybe they were busy being it is fathers day, so i keep the line open and drive over. they disconnect me just as i pull up to the storefront i walked in and saw there were not even half full. I walk up to the counter to order (no one in line) and was ignored, even by the man i believe is the owner. I finally said screw it and left.
