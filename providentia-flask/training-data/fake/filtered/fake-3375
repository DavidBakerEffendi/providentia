OK, with the NYC pizza renaissance over the past couple years, there are thankfully many 5 star pizza places in NY now, and Roberta's is certainly one of them. I've only ever been here on "off" lunch-ish times, so thankfully I've never had to deal with crazy crowds or anything. First, the salads here are amazing, especially the kale salad.  Second, the crust on the pizza is near perfect.  That's all I really need to say I think, because if you have near perfect crust it's nearly impossible to screw up the pizza if you are putting quality ingredients on top. Don't be afraid to come here from Manhattan either.  It's right around the corner from the Morgan L stop, so it's super easy to get to.
