We went to Casa Mono on Saturday, I gave the reservation name and the hostess looked at the computer screen and said, "I`m sorry we cannot accommodate your party".  I also looked at the screen there was our reservation printed clearly on the monitor.  Umm sorry??  She then proceeded to be increasingly rude as I tried to figure out what she was talking about.  Now, my friend was coming in from out of town and I had to call her and until she arrived wait out in the cold with my husband and my 9 month old infant.  The restaurant wasn`t even full.  Truly a bad experience!!
