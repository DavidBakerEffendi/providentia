We ducked in late afternoon for a snack and ended up sitting in the bar area at an impossibly small table in an atmosphere that felt incredibly French in the most wonderful way! We ordered a plate of oysters and then sat back to soak in the atmosphere, it was ripe for people-watching. The oysters were amazing, clean-tasting and complemented perfectly by the mignionette. What a great place to stop for a refresher!
