Took my mother and sister-in-law here from out of town on a recommendation of a friend.  We went on a Tuesday afternoon around 1:00pm and while business was brisk, was not too crowded.  I can understand some of the frustration by other posters about too many people but this is NYC, people. If you don't like crowds, I have a nice cabin in NH that I can rent to you. People that complain about crowds in NYC remind me of people that buy a house next to a railroad track and then bitch about the horns of the trains We ate at Manzo, without a reservation, waiting about 3 minutes for a table.  The waiter, hostess, wine steward, EVERYONE, could not have been nicer.  Not speaking Italian, we depended on their expertise and they were terrific.  Eating first gave us the knowledge of what we might want to buy when we ventured out into the store. All in all it was a fantastic experience.   I can't wait to go back.
