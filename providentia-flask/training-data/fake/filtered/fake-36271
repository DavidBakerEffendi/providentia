I don't know what was going on the other night, but it makes me never want to go back. I never write reviews, but my friends and I were seriuosly disappointed... I've been there twice before (one of those times for my bday) and the food and service was excellent. When we went for my friend's bday last week the entire experience was the complete opposite. The female bartender upstairs was incredible rude, wasn't sure how to make the drinks and gave me serious attitude whenI asked her if I could pay with a card. I came later in the night so I only ordered 2 drinks nd some food, and you would have thought I was asking for the world. A guy came up to ask her a question while she was making my drinks and she totally stopped what she was doing to talk to him as I waited.  She even came over to my seat and asked where her tip was. The waitress that my friends had at the back table of the upstairs bar was honestly just straight up rude.  We were by no meand a rowdy, impolite group and we were being treated like garbage. She took it upon herself to open a tab even though we askednher not to, rolled her eyes, ignored people when they would talk to her and wouldn't put their song tickets in. The karaoke dj was a pompus jerk who acted like he didn't want to be bothered. He sang a bunch of songs nd gave comps to his friends while we were waiting forever for one of ours to come up. We didn't make a stink because it was our friend's bday and we didn't want her to feel bad, but being required to pay 18% gratuity to be treated like shit is a raw deal. There was a snob factor that I am not a fan of, which is disapponting because I used to love it there.
