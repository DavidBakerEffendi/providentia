Great experience once again. I have been enjoying the delicious food at the Revere for more than 12 years. Wonderful, polite, and friendly service. Bacon dusted calamari is a must every visit absolutely delicious. Entree was the slizzing 18oz new york strip steak which I requested rare and was cooked perfectly with and very entertaining presentation. Great people, good food, classic music played while you enjoy your food. Perfect night to relax and have a good time and great food. A few weeks ago was a very unsettling experience due to customers that were absolutely obnoxious and had no class what so ever. A group of about 6 women whom ordered the unlimited crab legs and took unlimited to another level. After about 7 dishes EACH of crab legs along with ago customers eating them to, the restaurant unfortunately ran out which is very capable of happening because of the "unlimited" part. These women made a scene when trying to order the 8th dish of crab legs and was informed theu had sold out. They started making fun of their gay waiter who is AWESOME gay or not. Calling him a fairy and etc. I could have smacked them right in the face. The owner being the good man that he is offered dessert on the house and percentage off the bill. They continued to act like classless ghetto hood rats left the restaurant bitching like little children shorted the waiter on the check and no tip. Thank god they choose to get rid of the crab legs on Thursdays because now those type of uneducated, immature women do not come back. Take yourself to a Chinese buffet and stop giving this restaurant a bad name. Anyway love the revere thanks for all the good times.
