I've been lunching at Johnny Salami's for many years now and can honestly say this: 1.  This review is long past due. 2.  I've never had a bad meal and this establishment. Please try the Shepherd's Pie, the Mac and Cheese and the Dirty Rice.  You will not be disappointed.  Don't forget to check out the list of daily specials!  It is over the top!
