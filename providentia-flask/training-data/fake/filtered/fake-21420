i have been to  many buffets in NJ but the true taste of Indian food is at tandoori bite indian cuisine..Recently i went their with my family on new years eve. Food is realy outstanding -we had Tandoori chaat,Mix Grill,Veg Kabab,Chicken Tikah Masala,Fish malabari,Lamb Roghan josh and,Gralic naans.They made exactly the same spicy level as we wanted.Their Kulchas like veg ,onion and parathas are ausumn.You get enough portion of rice with your meals.Their service was really good and quick.I will also recommend their lunch buffet to every indian food lover.They have over 16 different varieties.Their tandoori chicken is very soft and warm.The y have four vegetables items ,i really liked the Veg Korma and paneer saagwala.The cubes of cottage cheese in saag was very delicious.They have some excellent desert as well like,Gulaab jaman,Kheer(Rice pudding) and Gjar halwa.    Above all they have a special discount of 10 %  for Princeton students.I will give them 5 stars,not only for the good food and hospitality,but also for their price which is just  $ 9.99.
