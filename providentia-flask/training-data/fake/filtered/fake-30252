Went there the other day for the first time and beautiful decor. My brother in law had an scrambler with side corned beef hash and he loved it. Me and my boyfriend  had the chicken pesto and what can I say one was beyond amazing and one was not. I sent mines back and the deli guy there "who we later found out made our good sandwich"  was very plight and had our meal back to the table in no time. I get back in line after our meal to get few pastry      and when it came to my turn the lady at the register  walked away and ignored me. She walked by twice and totally ignored me i go to the deli kid and ask to see a manager and the same lady who ignored me was the manager. But beside that it was pretty alright.
