I went here on a date. Atmosphere was a bit loud and there was a 15 minute wait. Both were worth it as my order of Pesto Turkey Meatballs w/Parmesan Cheese and Garlic Bread melted in my mouth! The ordering system is unique as you mark what your ordering in different columns. I will definitely go back for more!!
