the food was delicious.  I had a make your own salad- it was large and had a lot of chicken in it.  the salad dressing (green goddess) was amazing! However- I went at 12.  I didn't need to wait long to place my order- about 5 minutes- BUT then i had to wait 40 minutes FOR A SALAD!!!.  it seemed like the stir-frys were coming out much much faster.  I think they have experienced people working the stir fry lin e(former short order cooks?) but the girls working the salad line were king of pathetic.
