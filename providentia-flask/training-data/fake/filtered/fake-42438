One thing I can't deny is that this place has great food. My family and I would order from them at least once (possibly twice) a week. Guaranteed though, they mess up at least one part to your order. Last night, when we picked up our order and brought it home we ended up with fried pickles instead of mozzarella sticks and a white wrap instead of a whole wheat wrap. No biggy, we called back to ask them to correct our order, which they agreed to do, but asked for the food back. EW, to think they could possibly serve these items to someone else. They arrived 45mins later (a time too long for the food ordered), took the food back and all was well. However, when I woke up this morning and left the house to my surprise I saw the Pizza One boxes we had returned to the driver sprawled out in the road across from my neighbors house. The driver must have tossed the food out the window as he drove away. I guess on the bright side they didn't serve it to anyone else. But I can tell you I won't be ordering from there again.
