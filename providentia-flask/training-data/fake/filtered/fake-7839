I came here last night with my boyfriend and it was fantastic! I had called a couple nights before to try to get reservations before- but they said they were full! But the hostess also mentioned that they take limited reservations, so there would probably be seating if we just called ahead. We had just been walking around Burlington when we decided to grab dinner and there was no wait at all! The decor is a bit fancy- but casual clothing is welcome! We had such a nice server! Her name was Emily and when I asked her about the couscous on the salmon, she said that if I didn't like she could easily grab something else for me! It was great service! The food! It was SO yummy! The salmon was salt and pepper crusted and the couscous came with a red pepper sauce-that I thought was going to be spicy but it was refreshing and cool-delicious! It was a lovely experience! Will be back again!
