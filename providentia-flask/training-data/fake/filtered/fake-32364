This really is a great place. When you walk in you will be surprised by the pleaseant decor and welcoming environment. Ok, so let's get to the good stuff...the food! I came here for breakfast and it was great. It truely is the little things...my omlette was perfectly even with its contents. Not greasy like most places. And I know this may seem trivial...but they gave me perfectly toasted toast with my breakfast. I wouldn't say it if it were not true. Â Everything I tasted great...and was perfectly done. The staff is super friendly too. This is truely Morrisvilles best kept secret...yet it deserves to be known by all.
