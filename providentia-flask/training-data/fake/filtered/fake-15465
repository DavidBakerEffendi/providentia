The Shake Shack is good.  A friend told me about it and said to come by this place.  There burgers and fries are great with a compliment of a shake, of course.  The line is short, its good customer service, and fast food.  They give you a sensor key and when your order is ready, it will beep.  I think myself had a Shackburger and it was very flavorful.  Depending on their hours its good to go right before a night on the town.  I think I even have a pic of the burger and drink I had one day.  I'd recommend going to Shake Shack if your into traditional burgers, fries, chili cheese dogs, and milkshakes.
