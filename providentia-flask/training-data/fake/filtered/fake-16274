Cafeteria really gives you a unique NYC experience! Went there with friends had AMAZING time!  The food's "down home" but the style and service is first class.  We started with a pitcher or Wild Berry Mojitos, OMG it was like a party in a glass!!  I had seared tuna appetizer followed by Mahi Mahi & it was scrumptious!  For dessert I died and went to Oreo Heaven, with 2 fried oreos, a scoop of ice cream & a "shot" of chocolate milk shake! LOVED IT and WILL BE BACK FOR MORE!!!
