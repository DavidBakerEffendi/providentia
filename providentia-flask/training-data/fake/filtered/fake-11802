after ordering takeout and paying for the order I asked for a small cup of honey mustard sauce to go with the food. I was told it would cost an additional .53cents, I had paid with a credit card and was not going to swipe it again to get some honey mustard sauce with my food. I was told that it is a dressing and not free. Complete nonsense, Do they also charge for every squirt of ketchup you use?
