Hmmm many things I could say about this joint... My friends and I were looking for a new spot in the city to try for brunch, so we decided on Jones due to its down-home menu and Stephen Starr-studded proprietorship. We walked in and were immediately taken by the restaurant's 50s style decor, despite the fact that an absent-minded mother allowed her children to aimlessly weave in, out and into me and my group of friends (not the fault of Jones but perhaps the first sign of danger within the restaurant). We were seated on the upper deck of the restaurant, which seemed to me like a cozy and private elevated area (loved the shag carpet), but later proved to be the land of forgotten patrons. Our waitress took the drink order promptly, and I was quite impressed with the customizable Bloody Mary menu. Anxiously awaiting the arrival of said beverages, my friends and I waited and waited on an order of drinks, which seemed par for the course in regards to the rest of the meal. Our waitress, though kind, was complicit in the slow service on which Jones appears to operate. I'm all for a leisurely brunch, but let's pick up the pace. As for the food, it was simply eh, which is incredibly disappointing when the banana maple walnut pancakes are advertised as though you'll never taste anything better. I would love to try Jones again for another meal, in part because I'm enthralled with the fact that it looks like a set of Mad Men, but I think I'd rather stick with diner food, which is a no doubt safer (and cheaper) bet. Oh and their coffee is FOUR dollars. Even Starbucks ain't that pretentious.
