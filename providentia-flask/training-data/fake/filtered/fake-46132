Got custard cups and nutella cups from here not impressed..have eaten name custard cups before..these looked pale on top..burnt on bottom..nutella ones were burning to brag about..thought I give it another try..asked for the toasted ones on top..again not impressed..Jane had better custard cups in the irounbound bakeries
