This is one of the best restaurants I've been to in the last 5 years.  We had 4 courses, each excellent...  Though the food hit all the high notes, the service here is impeccable as well.  In fact it was so good, I asked for the name of the wait captain.  Edward Easton is discerning, warm, and knowledgeable - just a delightful individual. He treated us as though we had been coming for years despite this having been our first visit.
