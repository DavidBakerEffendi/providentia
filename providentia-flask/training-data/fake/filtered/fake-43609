if you are looking for an upbeat atmosphere and food with a super hospitable staff while visiting princeton, witherspoon grille is the place.   great seafood (love choosing oysters on half shell) and rocking comfort food side dishes.  from the time you walk in until the time you walk out, the staff will make you feel comfortable and ALWAYS  with a smile....
