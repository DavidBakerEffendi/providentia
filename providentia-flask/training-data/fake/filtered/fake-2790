Tried Pete's for a third visit. I have to say our first visit was awesome - first date night and the atmosphere was terrific and the food was pretty good. Second visit, a group of 8 sat on the patio and while we made it a fun night, the manager acted like he was doing us a favor by seating us and the servers must have bumped into someone at our table at least 5 times - the place is obviously too cramped for effective service and I don't think that adds to the atmosphere - that's about lousy management decisions (go on a busy night and you'll see what I mean). Fast forward 2 years and 10 of us want to go out for a birthday celebration. Granted, not the easiest thing to get a large table on a Saturday night, but we called ahead and person that answered said to come early, put our name in, and they could accommodate. We did just that - 2 of us drove 45 minutes to get there early, put our name in and was told they could accommodate us in 1 hour. We asked if it was cool for us to leave and get wine for the Sangria (the place is BYOB). No problem, we're told. Back in an hour with our entire group and the manager says it will be another 90 minutes. When we simply said, why the change, why would we have been told an hour - he specifically said, "These girls didn't say that - let's ask them... 'turns to 17 year old girl who says nothing (poor kid should get out of hostess business)' ...they didn't say it" My reply, "I get that you're busy, but is it wise to give your customers inaccurate information and then call them liars; perhaps find a better way to reply or accommodate?" Silence led to me turning to walk way and his final words, "Let them go - good riddance" Pete's has great atmosphere - thank God they hired someone great for the construction - but I'd suggest that they follow these words, oddly ripped right from their website, "Here's hoping the service kinks get worked out, fast." Seriously funny, that's from their 'About Cuban Pete's' page.
