Best Take Out in Kearny! My fiance and I ordered a burrito, enchiladas and Nachos. Boy were we pleasantly surprised. The portions came in half trays! Super delicious, super fresh, and you can tell a lot of love went into the preparation of the food. It is simply a gem in Kearny. I wish we discovered this Â place sooner! 4 thumbs up!
