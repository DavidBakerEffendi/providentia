Best Indian in all of NYC! No kidding. So here's how I describe it since I'm sure what's going through your head right now has a tune along the lines of "yeah but everyone has such different opinions about what makes good indian food". Ghandi tastes the way authentic Indian food would taste IF it tasted like I imagined it should. That's about the best compliment I could give seeing as how I actually like Indian food. Since I discovered this place I have gone once a week without fail. I eat there in person every time (so I can't say how it tastes delivered but that's ok, get off your a$$ and eat out for a change Brooklyn!) and and it's divine. I've taken friends and they all agree. I've taken the most worldly of people and they TOO agree. Of course, I know we all have different opinions of what makes good Indian Â food, right? So, here's my final testament. My roommate finally went on my recommendation and he's from Mumbai. He came home and what he had to say about it was that it was just like home cooked Indian food. Homestyle I guess you could say. And his Indian friends who were with him agreed and commented that they felt like they were being served by their parents back in Indian since it was so uncanny. That's that. Try it. You won't regret it.
