i can understand why people complain so much about price.... you get what you pay for! This place is truly one of a kind, from the moment i walk in to the moment i am walking out the staff is attentive and wonderful. The first thing you get when you sit down is complimentary cheese, peppers, eggplant and different types of bread you can choose from. this place is truly high class and you can not get that around the financial district anymore that's why i love this place. The food is so fresh and is full of taste along with elegant preparations. My favorite dishes are the rigatoni bolanese which is fresh grounded veal (not like other places that give you frozen beef that was bought at the supermarket next door), the shrimp scampi is so good and fresh, the shrimp are a wonderful size for the price, the porterhouse steak for two is truly enough for me and my fiancee to eat and we love to eat. i have to add the chicken parmigiana Â which is sooooo good i cant believe how big the portion is, and the chicken Marsala (mmmmm) The waiter always recommends a wonderful bottle of wine to go along with my dish at the time and he hits it right on the spot every time (we also get complimentary grapa). you have to go there yourself to experience it honestly. LOVE LOVE LOVE ANCORA!
