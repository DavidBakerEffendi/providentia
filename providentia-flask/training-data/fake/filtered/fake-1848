Have kept coming back for the good bagels. . .however that is at an end- I don't know if it because Â of a lousy computer order system, or the young workers simply never listen- but they have screwed up my orders for the last 4 times- and today, in addition to having to unwrap a bagel sandwich to add requested ingredients, they simply did not make an egg order. As I stood like a fool and the cashier looking at me, nothing was said or done- finally I asked where my order was- and I got a blank stare, no apology and asked if I wanted a refund. Careful patrons- no listening skills and no customer service. . .. . . . . hungry in Pennington
