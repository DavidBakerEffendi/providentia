I just went to EGG the other night and thought it was lovely and warm. Really nice staff, good bartender, and the food was great. Had the salad since it was one of the only vegetarian offerings and loved the fresh lettuce that wasn't too cold and the big blocks of cheese. Delicious. Though I stuck with coffee to stay warm, I can't wait to come back and have a beer. The draft list seems well-selected and there are some interesting ones on there. EGG's a great addition to the neighborhood - welcome! Can't wait for the grand opening!
