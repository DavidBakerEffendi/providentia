If you're hoping for Chipotle you'll be disappointed. Boloco really isn't Tex-Mex, and their only real burrito option (The Classic) isn't very good, but if you're looking for hot wraps, not burritos, you'll probably really like Boloco. If you're hungry, opt for the bigger size, because their regulars have gotten pretty small lately. Also, I really didn't like the breakfast burrito I had there once, but it was the egg and cheese, so maybe their fancier ones are better.
