BEST greek food in Queens or maybe NYC, the wait can be long but is worth it...great service from the moment you arrive, the hostess is attentive and will even offer wine while you wait..try the Kyclades special dish for about $30 brings a little bit of everything with lemon potatoes and the free dessert at the end just great.
