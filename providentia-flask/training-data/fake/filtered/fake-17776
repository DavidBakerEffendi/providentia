I love Toby's. I live in the neighborhood and go here about once a month. Most of the staff is friendly and the food is fresh and amazing. However, I give it 3 stars for a few reasons... 1. the prices are ridiculous! Especially in this economy! They NEED to offer at least one pizza that's somewhat cheap. How about a plain pizza? Help me out, Toby's! This isn't the upper east side, this is south brooklyn. Most people that live in this neighborhood probably aren't millionaires, so they should really consider lowering their prices slightly. Clearly, people still come here b/c it's always packed, but they should really consider making their loyal customers happy by giving them a break on the bill! 2. The Cash only policy is really insane and annoying, especially in this day and age. I never carry cash on me for security reasons, and they need to start accepting credit cards. ATMs charge fees and so do banks. I know some companies like to cheat the government, but don't cheat your customers! 3. The minimum $15 per person to sit at a table is absurd. Enough said. 4. As I said, I live right in the neighborhood and frequent this place a lot, especially in the summer time. 99% of the staff know me and my roommate/friends by name and are always very nice and accommodating. However, the one waitress with short hair has a huge attitude problem and is always extremely rude and un-attentive and even charges us for soda! Who charges for soda these days?? Really?? Every time we come in and she's working, our whole dining experience is ruined and we just want to eat and get out. She knows who I am, but never says hello, even when every other employee in the place is talking to us. She needs to adjust the 'tude. Overall - good food, bad prices, good service - minus the mean waitress.
