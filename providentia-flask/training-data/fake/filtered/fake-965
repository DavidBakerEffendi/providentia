R.B. ARE YOU KIDDING!!!  You must have little dining experience in the area if you don't realize that JO JO's is WAY under estimated and under-valued.  We have been empty nesters for many years and go out most every night to eat.  Everything from RATS to taco bell; from the Grotto in Newtown to Havanna's in New Hope; from POD or Morton's in Philly to Tavern on the green in NYC.  We have met people at the bar that drove from NYC to have pizza at Jo Jo's because it was so good - truth!!  The fish is always fresh and perfectly cooked.  The vodka rigatoni is BEYOND COMPARE - nothing even comes close!!  The mussels are meaty and never sandy. Simple things like their mini tacos are awesome.  Try a chicken parmigiana sandwich or their eggplant parmigiana sandwich (without the bread - my preference) is like my mother cooked.  Jo Jo's special chicken is just AMAZING!!! Their desserts - well their desserts are --- fantastic - try the brownie Sunday - enough for 4 people.   Their drinks are well worth it!!  Not a 1/2 shot like other area bars.  Mary Ellen has been a bartender in the area for quite a while, can handle any number of patrons, and makes a fantastic drink!!  Even the entertainment is fun (though I don't like the Karaoke czar and his groupies on Wednesdays).  The ONLY area where they could improve is their beef purveyor.  It is good but not a Ruth Chris / Marsha Brown / KC Prime.  I prefer thick cuts.   SO I must assume that you enjoy Applebees or Charlie Brown's routinely or else you would realize that Jo JO's is central Jersey's secret hot spot. Our 2 cents, M&M
