I've been to the Princetonian Diner several times before in college and thought it was pretty good, so imagine my surprise when I experienced the breakfast outing from hell this morning. I ordered a ranchero breakfast plate (eggs with home fries) and pancakes on the side. The pancakes were bland bland bland (I really have no idea how you can screw up pancakes) and had HAIR in it. As in SEVERAL STRANDS OF HAIR in it. I immediately set aside the pancakes, figured it was a fluke, and then started on the ranchero plate. I'll admit, the ranchero plate is my usual go-to (I'm a sucker for any meal that encourages you to eat it with an English muffin), and it's not something they've ever screwed up. Once again though, HAIR HAIR HAIR. DARK CURLY DISGUSTING STRANDS OF HAIR in it. That's PLURAL. When we notified the waitress, she took our plates into the kitchen and apparently had a talk with the manager and the cook. What did we get in return? Nothing. No apologies, just the bill. On the receipt it simply said 'HEALTH CODE VIOLATION' at the bottom. I don't expect to get a free meal or anything, but seriously? At least you can apologize for what happened! My group paid the bill and split it between cash and card; some of the tip was going onto the cards, and our lone cash payer was leaving cash tip on the table. Our waitress, again not at all apologetic for what had happened, looked at the cash amount on the table and said "WHAT, ONLY 2 DOLLARS?" as if she deserved more for her super-awesome-waitressing that morning. I am so sorry that I tipped her an additional amount on my card - we should have left her with nothing. Never going back again.
