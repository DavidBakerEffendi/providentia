Excellent, Excellent, Excellent..... What more can I say but make every effort to go there and try the pizza. Weather it be Round or Square ( Sicilian) you cannot go wrong. I have been going to L&B since the 1970's and it is still the same delicious food. They say pizza was first discovered in Naples but I think naples came to brooklyn and is residing at L&B Spumoni Gardens. Oh and the spumoni is the tops and you should try the restaurant. You will wait for a table but the long wait will reward you palate. Before the hearse drops you off at your final resting place tell the driver you want to stop at L&B for your last meal.
