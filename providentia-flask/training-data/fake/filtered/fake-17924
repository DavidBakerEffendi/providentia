My husband and I visit Samba quite often for lunch and never are disappointed. The food is always fresh and to the highest quality. We are always welcomed by the owner with the warmest of greetings followed by friendly attentive staff. Whoever decorated this restaurant needs to visit my house. Love love this place!
