one of those 'i've never written a review before.' and i haven't. because nothing in the world is worth a review except for these damn tacos. do i bring my first dates here, absolutely. have i brought my grandmother here, no, because rest her soul she passed away 10 years ago, but would i have brought her, absolutely. am i going to have five tacos cater to my first wedding, yes. my words can't do the flavor justice so i wont even try. get the taco, put the sauces on, eat it, then get another. then go out, drink, hit on girls and fail, but when you come back later for a nightcap taco you'll forget she existed. see you there tonight.
