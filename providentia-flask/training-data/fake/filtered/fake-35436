I, cannot say enough good things about Trattoria L'incontro The food was phenomenal, the service excellent and very friendly.  L'incontro totally and completely lived up to "great restaurant" expectations. L'incontro came completely and totally recommended by every chef I know. I am a picky eater and I ate everything on my plates including some from my wife's. We had an amazing time and everyone who ever wants to visit a famous chef's restaurant should try L'incontro. The food and service was beyond expectation. It is highly recommended!  The food, service and ambiance are all incredible. Excellent wine list too. Absolutely love it. Oh, there is not a detail missed. The highest praise goes to the Manager and their staff for being mind readers. Thank you so much!!!!
