Every time I stop into PJ's for lunch, I am surprised to see it as full as it is, given how overpriced it is for what you get, even by Princeton standards. Pancakes are horrible.  Texture is more akin to eating a wet sponge than the light fluffy cakes I can get elsewhere.  Bland, too, also like a wet sponge. Omelets were thin, oily, filled with bad-tasting cheese (also there's a chance you'll get cheese if you don't order it). Everything I have had on the lunch menu is mediocre, as well. Fried mashed hash browns are pretty good, though, and the twofer is a decent deal compared to their other stuff. I have yet to try the deep dish tomato pie they offer, but I'm unsure as to whether I'll ever be back. Service could use some work, servers don't really care about refilling your water or bringing your drinks in a timely fashion.  In fact, they seem downright apathetic. In closing, PJ's pancake house touts itself as "the way things used to taste."  If this is true, then I thank god for being born into the present, and having other, tastier options in Princeton.
