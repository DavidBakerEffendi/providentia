Lots of reviews have covered Pio Pio's chicken - incredible and one of the best deals around. Make sure to order extra green sauce, as they usually only give you one small container with the chicken. For a dollar you'll get three more. If you're in the mood for something different (and not on a tight budget), they offer some amazing seafood dishes. I love love love the Palta Rellena con Camarones appetizer (avocado stuffed with shrimp, corn and tomatoes) and the Camarones Cuzco (shrimp with rice in an INSANELY GOOD yellow sauce. I would drink it by the gallon). The only miss I've had was the Cebiche Mixto. It was fishy like I was licking a wharf.
