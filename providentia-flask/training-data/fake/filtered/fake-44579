Our reservations were at 9; we were seated at 10 pm.  We ate at Locanda Verde on Dec. 30, a visit I had been anticipating for a long time.  Am a big fan of Andrew Carmellini through his cookbook.  Our reservation was for 9 pm and from the start we were told by the hostess that they were just waiting for a party to pay the check.  This went on for an hour and during the entire time we were standing by the hostess podium because the bar was filled to overflowing.  They did give us complimentary glasses of prosecco about half way through the ordeal, but when we were finally seated we were so hungry (and angry) that my comments wouldn't do justice to the food.  Some of the items we ordered were the lamb sliders, the burrata, sea bass, pumpkin ravioli, brussel sprouts.  By the time we were able to eat we were just shoveling down the food to quell our hunger.  I don't know how unusual our experience was but I would be hard pressed to return.  I have eaten at lots of NY hotspots including Babbo's and Blue Hill at Stone Barns and I have never experienced anything like this.  Once at a DC restaurant, Taberna del Alabardero, we had to wait 20 minutes for a reserved table and they seated us at the bar, brought, complimentary, 3 or 4 tapas and cava to tide us over, and apologized profusely for what was a minor delay.  At Locanda Verde their attitude was "it's not our fault....people lingered at the table."
