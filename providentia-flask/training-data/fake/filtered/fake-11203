I chose 2 stars because the text for 3 stars said "a-ok" and it really wasn't, although I'd go back. Problems: 1) No "flow".  The market juts out in weird directions instead of having a circular feel to it like, say, a Stew Leonards. Which means while you are trying to get to the pasta section, a stroller and oh yeah a restaurant are in your way and people are going in both directions and back and forth and standing still.  All your pet peeves in one place. 2) My sopressata panini is way too salty. 3) Not enough ways to get food to eat right there.  I was alone and starving and didn't really want to sit at a restaurant or wait in line for an hour, so I just got the sandwich, which was fine but I was hoping for more ways to eat "to-go" food.  Don't go there hungry.  No samples to eat. 4)  There really isn't that much to buy here overall.  I've seen more selection at other markets. 5) Go to Mike's Deli on Arthur Avenue and maybe an Italian restaurant there instead.  Mike's mozzarella is just as tasty and it's a better environment. 6) I thought it would be a LOT bigger.  To navigate that many restaurants in such a small place is frustrating to say the least.
