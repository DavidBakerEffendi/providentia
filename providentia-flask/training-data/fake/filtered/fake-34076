This is my new favorite Chinese restaurant. The large portions of our meal were excellently flavored and delicious. We had the Ma La Lamb, pork fried rice, egg rolls, and boneless spare ribs. I think the lamb may be a new favorite dish,well balanced between the richness of the sauce with the spiciness. So glad we needed delivery, we looked for a new place and found it. Delivery was fast and the food was piping hot!
