What more can i say about this place! i read a couple of the reviews and atfirst i was apprehensive about coming! But i can tell you that I am glad i took the chance. The feel of soco alone was enough to make me come back. It was totally Brooklyn Chic..I tried the famous chicken and waffles which was good, but the Pecan Crusted Pork Chop was soo good. I enjoyed the texture and the different flavors, it was a new feel but one that felt oh so good! I must admit im in love..we tried the mac and cheese and that alone shouldve had its own menu! It was delicious, with a nice crust and soft on the inside. Rob (the server) suggested that i try the mardi gras which tasted like a rum punch from the south!! Where do they do that at?? SoCO thats where! I love this place and would definitely come back with my business partners at first chance!! Brooklyn we have a gem!!
