I had the 3 cheese grille cheese with bacon, the crispy goat, spicy tomato soup, french fries, sweet potato tater tots, and to top it off the sweet grilled cheese with mascarpone, bananas, and nutella with ice cream. Service was awesome, owner is cool as hell. This is by far the best grilled cheese I have ever eaten. Sorry grandma. If your around check it best bang for your buck around here you won't be sorry!
