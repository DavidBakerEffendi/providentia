Giving this place five stars would be an understatement. Probably my go-to place when I am having a bad day or need a sugar pick-me-up. Their prices are not catered to everyone, but the quality of the macaroons is well worth it. Nice little neighborhood, super nice staff, and most importantly, heavenly macaroons.
