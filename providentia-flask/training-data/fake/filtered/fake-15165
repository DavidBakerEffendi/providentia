I disagree with some yelpers about this place. This is an ok place but there is nothing really to brag about. I went there once and now I don't even remember what I got there. That means it wasn't really that great. I believe it was a lamb dish. But one thing I remember was that stupid soda filled my stomach with gas. I couldn't stop burping for the next couple of hours. oh gosh!!! that drink was crazy.
