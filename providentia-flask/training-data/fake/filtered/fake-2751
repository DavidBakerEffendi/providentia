I went to Cuban Pete's to celebrate my cousin's birthday.  I would not recommend this place to anyone and I am NEVER going back again.  We waited 1 1/2 hours to finally be seated and the manager was very rude.  He actually had us wait by the bathroom to be seated at this table where there were people still finishing their meal, telling us that we would be seated there as soon as they were done eating which was not only rude to us, but also rude to the people who could hardly enjoy their meal because they were rushing them so that they could give us their table.  I asked the manager if he could have us wait somewhere else because it was a big inconveniences to us and also to his waiter staff because we were constantly being told to step aside so that they could get by and he was so rude to me saying that he would put me out and if I didn't like it, I could get out and also He could have me wait two hours if he wanted to.  I only stayed because my cousin really likes this place and I did not want to ruin it for her so I didn't even mention what he said to me.  I have eaten there a couple of times before and even if they service was good, I would not recommend it, the food is terrible.
