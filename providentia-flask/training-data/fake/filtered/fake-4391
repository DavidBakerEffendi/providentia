The Bluebird Tavern changed my life... I started out as a lowly cubicle jockey, my job was monotonous, I couldn't find a girlfriend, and my car got 7 miles to the gallon on a good day, but that was before I started eating at the tavern... The second I took my first bite of rabbit "saddle" I could feel my mind expanding and taking in experiences I never before dreamed possible. I could see the whole cosmos laid out before me, nebula and galaxies spun before my vision. When I came to I was sitting in my garage looking at my car. The hood was open and all of my power tools lay scattered on the floor, when I sat in the driver's seat I noticed that my car is now a paddle shifter and now a week later I have yet to need to fill up on gas. Since that day, I have eaten the tavern's rabbit "saddle" everyday and my salary has increased by two orders of magnitude, I have a penthouse office in a fortune 500 company, and I go helli-skiing on the weekends... I still can't find a girlfriend, but hey I make enough to eat rabbit saddle at every meal now so I'm sure I don't have long to wait.
