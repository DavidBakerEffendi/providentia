The food was delicious and the wait staff was efficient and friendly.  My complaint would be in how the owner treated people.  A couple in front of us had reservations for more people and some cancelled on them, the owner yelled and said there is a big difference between a table of 5 and a table of 3.  A few people cancelled on our reservation and he was nasty and said "you know, I could have sold more tables!"
