My husband and I love this place. If you go the tater tots with bacon aioli is to die for. The Cobb salad is a steal. I actually take half home for lunch tomorrow. The pork chop there is my favorite go to and I return at least 2x a month to get it. Hubby likes shrimp fra diablo and roasted chicken. Vodka rigatoni is great and the new short rib flat bread is delicious. Great place, nice atmosphere. Ask for Jen she is our favorite server ( fri and sat only)
