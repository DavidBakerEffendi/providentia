Food was good. I did not have a bad experience whatsoever.. But I hope everyone takes my fair warning that you are scammed here. If you leave a cash tip instead of a tip on a credit they input a different amount in the computer and charge you more! For example my bill was about $63 and I left an $11 cash tip. I look at my statement and i have a charge of $77. They claim it's an"problem with their system" . Ive learned many others have had a similar experience with JUST this place. after going to restaurants all over the country I have never heard of this before. The owner that you speak with is shady and foreign. Fair warning-they purposely rip people off. The food was good but not good enough to deal with this nonsense.
