I visited The Kitchen Table last night nervously after reading the reviews on here.  I had a $50 gift certificate and seriously considered giving it away rather than take the chance of eating here. My friend and I decided after having a glass of wine that we would stay and eat.  They offer a pre-fixe dinner on Wednesdays for $24. It was a limited offering with only two offerings for each course (app, entree, dessert) so we got one of each. The appetizers were a zucchini fritter of some sort and a tomato tart.  The tart was dry, but the zucchini dish was really good.  For dinner, I had lemon roasted chicken with vegetables and potatoes. The chicken was cooked to perfection and the potatoes were tasty.  I didn't eat any of the vegetables (trying to save room for dessert).  My friend had the risotto with scallops.  The scallops were not large (and I didn't try them) but the risotto itself was really good.  So far, I was pleasantly surprised.  For dessert, we had creme brulee (but they called it something else) and vanilla custard with fresh peaches.  They were both fine - nothing out of this world, but not bad either. As rings true through the other reviews, the service was great and the waiter very friendly.  We were, however, one of two parties in the place.  They also pour a solid glass of wine. So, while I wouldn't rush back here, I'll definitely consider visiting on a night when their full menu is available.
