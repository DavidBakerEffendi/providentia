Use to love this place but recently it has gone downhill.. Two friends and I went last night (7-13-13) and the wait wasn't a problem jus about 15 min. But when we got seated outside we sat down and it took about 20 min for someone to come over to our table and asked what we wanted for drinks.. So we ordered a blood orange margarita frozen pitcher than ordered our food... In the meantime they are supposed to bring chips and salsa to your table, yea right we didn't get anything so about 20 min later our pitcher finally came.. Still No chips.. Finally our food came out about 45 min later (we only ordered 2 little things) and it took so long.. Once they brought our food I said can we have chip and she said oh they didn't being them out.. After and hour went by.. She said someone will be right out with them.. (Yea right) we were pissed at this point... We ate our food had our drinks than asked for the check which took another 20 min to get an it wasn't even packer there.. We had to hunt the lady down to get it because she really came to our table to begin with I think 2 times that's it... Anyways I just wanted to say I definitely don't recommend this plaw at all!!! Maybe 3 years ago but not anymore..     Poor service, horrible food that looked like road kill, and very high on prices!!      Pitcher of Blood Orange Margarita $23.. $2.00 for being frozen $7.00 for being blood orange.. Unbelievable.. $32 for a pitcher.. Crazy     Ill go to adobe next time I herd they are cheaper and better! It's right down the street.      Oh and one more thing... We left the lady a $1.00 tip.. Wanted to leave nothing but I think a $1.00 was enough for the two times she came to our table!!
