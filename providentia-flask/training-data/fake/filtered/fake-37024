My wife and I had the pleasure of getting a private tour with Scott when we were in New York for her birthday this past February.  It was fantastic!  Scott displays a true love for pizza - not only for the food itself, but also for the history behind it, and shares that love with you throughout the tour.  Not only did he take us to a few great pizzerias where we were able to gain a new appreciation for REAL pizza, but we also got to see a part of NYC that we probably never would have encountered otherwise, or at least not in such an appetizing way!  Our tour with Scott's Pizza Tours was the highlight of our weekend.  We highly recommend it for anyone who loves pizza and wants to experience a slice of New York history.
