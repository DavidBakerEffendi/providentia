It's really always a hit or miss with Sanford's...usually a miss. The only thing I've consistently enjoyed was the truffle fries. Everything else is just very bland. And the atmosphere is just very strange. Dark lighting (not always a bad thing), loud music (not always a bad thing), waiters/waitresses that disappear (never a good thing). Oh, well. I guess I could just use them for my truffle fry fix.
