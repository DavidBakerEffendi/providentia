I walked into la sirene and was warmly greeted by the hostess. The food was AMAZING!! The filet mignon was to die for!!! Probably the best on the island. The French male waiter took a while to bring our food, however, and I think I know why: he reeked of alcohol and cigarettes!! In an establishment of this caliber, to witness an employee with such bad employment etiquette is a shocker. There's a time and place for everything.
