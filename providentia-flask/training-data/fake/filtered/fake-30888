Everything about this cafe is outstanding and I really can not stress enough how good I feel when I step foot through that door. You are always greeted with a smile and a friendly hello not to mention the amazing smell of freshly prepared food.  The attention to detail is breathtaking.....it almost feels like you've taken a step back in time when life was much more simple yet elegant. The cafe has the feel of a family heirloom located on the streets of France. The food is prepared with such love and it's a  beautiful thing to know that all of the items on the menu are family recipes and QUALITY ingredients.  If your looking for mediocre, sub-par food for the same price as lets say Panera Bread then you have this place ALL wrong.  This is a classy establishment built and run with with the utmost care.  Overall I would have to say that Le Salbuen is in a league of its own.
