I've been to this tiny little Italian nook twice. Once for drinks on a Saturday and another time for a lite dinner . Both times it was practically empty. The decor is pretty chic,very lounge yet comfortable. Very Italian vibe. Not quite "Godfather" but not" Staten Island/Jersey Shore" either. I had the sangria and long island, lets just say I've had better. The chicken pesto panini with a arugula salad was excellent. Even though its not the most difficult thing to mess up, I would have it again. We also had the cured beef. My BF loved it and said it was flavorful and had a good consistency not tough at all, like he expected. He would definitely have it again. The menu was small just like the place. The service was great. As well as the decor. This is a great place for a date or a lite dinner before a night out. This place is too small to host a dinner party at and they charge an 18% gratuity to parties of 4 or more, which is ridiculous considering its more of a nite bistro feel than anything else because the open at 4pm. Also, they only have happy hour Mon.Weds. and Fri. Great atmosphere for a date nite =)
