Eco Bean & Juice is hands down the best coffee, fresh juice and smoothie spot in Burlington.  FINALLY - some where I can walk into and know that absolutely everything is organic.  This surprisingly just does not exist anywhere else around here.  It's very frustrating when you order food from a place that you think uses local, organic ingredients, yet it is served with Heinz Ketchup - third ingredient, high fructose corn syrup - NO THANKS!!!! I have asked almost every coffee shop in Burlington if they use almond milk and the answer was no at every single one, except Eco Bean & Juice - and to go many steps above that they make their almond milk fresh on a daily basis from unpasteurized, organic almonds from Sicily!!!!  The mocha latte with almond milk is to die for.  They also make organic coconut milk fresh daily.  There really is no other place that even compares to Eco Bean - their smoothies and juices are super fresh, creative and amazing. I truly hope this is just the beginning of what we will see from Eco Bean & Juice.
