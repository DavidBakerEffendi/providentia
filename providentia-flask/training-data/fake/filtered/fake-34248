I wanted to treat my husband to some serious sushi and this was it. This was some of the best sushi he has ever eaten he said!  The staff was super nice and I was surprised how reasonable the prices were especially the omakase.   The grilled eel sushi was amazing and I like how everything was bite sized.  We will most def be back and often.
