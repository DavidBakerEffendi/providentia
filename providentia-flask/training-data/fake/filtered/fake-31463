You won't find better food anywhere in the Newark area.  Lawyers, Feds, and business types alike frequent this Restaurant regularly.  But don't feel out of place if you're not wearing a suit since there is no official dress code and the owner Gus is just a really wonderful guy; he personally welcomed my party to his restaurant and gave us complimentary desserts simply because I expressed a curiosity about what the carrot cake tasted like (it looked really good in the display).  The portions are huge, the food tastes wonderful (I had the lasagna special with greek salad, my husband had the lamb steak special with steak fries) and the place was spotless clean.  Even if you only come here once, it is an experience you won't forget; you will be greeted by people who truly do appreciate your business and seem to authentically care about whether or not you are enjoying your meal.  Food was cooked to our specification, service was top notch, free refills on our sodas was an unexpected but very much welcomed plus, Management was superb in taking care of all of our needs and making us feel at home.  I really do love this place as does my husband and our four kids.  The only qualm I have with this place is its hours; they should really be open for dinner (unfortunately, they are only open for breakfast and lunch and close at 5pm not to mention not being open on the weekends).
