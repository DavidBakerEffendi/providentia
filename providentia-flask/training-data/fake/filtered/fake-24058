I love this spot for a bunch of reasons: 1. The people who run it are super nice, and are part of the community in the area so the patrons and owners are often chatting and joking. 2. The food is great - I love the pepper steak and the breakfast porridge 3. It's affordable - buy a medium for like 8$ comes with entree, cabbage, and rice and is enough for two modest meals
