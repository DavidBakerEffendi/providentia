I have eaten in many Indian restaurants in many places and have friends and families who are excellent chefs. I found this food to be flavorful, your mouth will get watery as soon as you take a bite of the food. The service has always been very good and the atmosphere is mar boules. I would never hesitate to take a guest or friend here.
