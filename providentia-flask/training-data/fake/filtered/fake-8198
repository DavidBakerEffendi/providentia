I had a fantastic time at Yuca!  EXCELLENT SERVICE, LOUD CROWD,YUMMY FOOD,AMAZING DRINKS AND FUN MUSIC!  I went this past saturday night and even though it was really busy, i was able to get a table. The moqueca was amazing but the bowl it came in was very hot. I also tried the guacamole, which was also amazing. The service: Our waitress Carline was phenomenal and nice enough to conversate for a little while with of all of us The manager: He was really nice and got us a table faster than we were told. The hostess: The place is crazy but unlike hostesses at other places she remained calm and easy and nice to everyone. Drinks: I had a mojito... and then another! SO delicious, yet very strong. My cousin tried the caiprina and really liked it but wanted there to be more in the glass. I went on the night of my birthday not really expecting to celebrate much but the night was very pleasing and I will return very soon.  Ive heard great things about Yuca Bar's brunch as well.
