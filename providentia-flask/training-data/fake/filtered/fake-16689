This hole-in-the-wall has the best jerk chicken and fish sandwich i have ever tasted. simple. As a side order, the fried macaroni & cheese balls are terrific, but, really, anything on the menu is absolutely worth the pilgrimage. This is simple, good food at it's best. Order and pick up. Life-long member, here!
