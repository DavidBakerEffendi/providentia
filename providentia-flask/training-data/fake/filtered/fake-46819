The noise in this place was unbelievable. I could not even appreciate or enjoy the food it was that bad. I went with my wife and we couldn't even have a conversation. The restaurant is very tiny and there is a bar with the TV on. Not sure if the acoustics are the problem but if you want your ears to bleed while you're eating this is the place to go.
