Huge portions, and decently good food. We went for breakfast and I ordered the banana pancakes and tofu scramble. The pancakes were a little too rich for breakfast even though they were very good, and the tofu scramble was too mushy and floppy which is disappointing because it tasted okay. Another lady in my party really enjoyed the granola, and another said the burrito was good but he barely finished it in two sittings because it was so huge and rich (although big portions aren't really a problem!) Our waitress was pretty awful. When we went to pay, she made it very clear that our asking to split the bill was a huge inconvenience for her, and rather than taking the tip from our change like we asked, she told us to "figure it out" ourselves, and then proceeded to give back the wrong change. Maybe she was new but she must have been poorly trained and horrible at math to get that frustrated. The music selection was great and I would probably go back.
