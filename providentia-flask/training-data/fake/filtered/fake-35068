Delicious, homey and a cool vibe. A friend of mine who recently moved to LA was in town and we checked this spot out for dinner. We did a la carte plates, but the stuff coming out for the full tables looked pretty freakin delicious. I had the shrimp and grits...delicious. Our server was polite and helpful about wine, and it was generally a great time. If you go, go with an appetite!
