What sets this bar apart from most is that the bartenders are really friendly and interactive with the customers. It means a lot when you go back to the place, they remember you, they remember your name, and greet you with a handshake and a smile. The place is very nice and the doors in front open up to let the nice cool air in (which is a nice little perk if you have a bar seat by those doors -- and yes, the place has air-conditioning if you don't :) Just a very nice experience all around the couple of times I've been there. I'll def. be going back.
