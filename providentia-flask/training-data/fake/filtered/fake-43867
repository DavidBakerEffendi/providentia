An awful food experience. Where shall I begin. Well, let me start off by saying that I had ordered a lamb gyro platter. Gave the guy on the till the ten dollars. Ten minutes had passed, I was stunned when the waitress had brought me a chicken gyro platter. I told her that I ordered lamb and this was the wrong order, the guy on the till ( a guy with a goatee, if ever you have the misfortune of being there) got angry. He packed the lamb gyro in a take away box and 'threw' a piece of bread in the paper bag. He was boiling with rage. How can you treat customers in such a way. Presuming that the customers should accept what they get even though its not what they wanted is rather strange. After such a horrid experience, allow me to describe the meat. In one word 'oily'. The bag that contained the 'oily beast meat' was     full of oily splodges! The meat was lying on the top of a salad, which may I add became drenched in a sea of oil. In short, if you want to experience true Turkish cuisine, do yourself a favour and steer away from this dreadful excuse for a restaraunt!
