Someone put our review under filter, which proves my point that the competition or someone with an ax to grind, is very unfair to this great restaurant. Here is the review in its entirety: We eat here almost every week.  I could not believe the people that gave this great restaurant a bad review, I think they are competitors or related to their competition. They go out of their way to please every diner and have never had a bad meal here in several years of eating here.   We come here with family and friends and my wife is picky and the wait staff accomoodates her with her combiniation dishes.  The owner and his staff are truly outstanding.  No, I am not related to anyone here, but appreciate good food and good people!
