Open door is by far my favorite spot in L.I.C. The food is always excellent, I love the meatloaf, and the sliders always seem to hit the spot. All servers and bartenders are kind and friendly, and are all excellent at what they do (Billy and Thomas are great behind the bar, Hayden is a great, knowledgeable waitress. even the chef/owner Nick, is a super nice guy!) I have never had anything less than a delicious meal here, my number one choice, anytime I'm anywhere near by. Keep it up, guys!! You're the best!
