i just got back from a trip to new haven. we knew we wanted good food. just took a chance on tony and lucille's. after we were seated,  i thought i remembered being there oh soo many years ago with my husband. but today i was looking for a great experience for my two grand daughters. and boy did we get it. fabulous food. no i mean really nice fresh, well cooked!!! as it was meant to be , a great day to remember; all about good food and good company. today was the best!! the waitress did not have a problem with a few changes, and we left with a few meals in the bag.    go again? you bet!
