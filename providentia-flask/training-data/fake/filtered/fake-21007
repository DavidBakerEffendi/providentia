We ordered food via DiningIn.com and were not disappointed!  I had the penne vodka with chicken.  The pasta was cooked perfectly!  There was a delicate ratio of pasta to sauce, which balanced the meal perfectly.  Another member of my party had the crab crusted tilapia. It was real crab meat, very little filler, the fish tasted fresh and was cooked superbly!  It was accompanied by fresh, crunchy asparagus and roasted red potatoes.  I cannot speak for the recurring bread problems listed by other reviews, ours came delivery.  It was fresh and soft on the inside with a delightful crusty outside.   I would like to visit the restaurant and try more dishes.  We will definitely return!
