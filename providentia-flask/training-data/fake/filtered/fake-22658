The staff here is so friendly - the hostess, bartenders, servers - all of them!   You can see their camaraderie and knack for hospitality shine through in the way they treat both the patrons and each other.   The food, every single item, was incredible. I have to recommend the mussels and clams linguini because I devoured them both. The oysters and uni totally worth the wait. Will be back soon.
