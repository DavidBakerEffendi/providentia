Wife and I went a week ago for dinner. This was my third time at Amis and it was outstanding, as were the first two visits. The food was delicious: special pork loin appetizer, Roman tripe stew -- don't shy away from this -- fazzoletti (handkerchief shaped) pasta with hen ragu. Yummy! Try the granita drink if you haven't. The service is always good, but I have to tell you that Brendan was exceptionally attentive, friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that Amis is very, very loud. Cacophonous. But, who cares? I love this place.
