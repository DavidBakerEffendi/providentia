Bad service liars, do not patronize "Fresh Tortillas & Taco"! I recently moved to Staten Island and received a menu for this restaurant and it says "Grand Opening". I thought this was a new establishment. A couple weeks ago was my first time ordering and it took well over an hour to get to my house. A few nights ago I ordered again it 2 hours for my food to arrive. I called to complain and a woman with a heavy Chinese accents said that it would be there soon and she would give a free soda for the delay. The delivery guy said that his car had broken down. By the time the food got to my house we were so hungry we just paid without thinking ripped open the packaging to discover that we had received the wrong order and it was way more expensive than the dish that we had wanted in the first place. I called the restaurant to complain once again and she said that the next time we order she will give us a discount. So, the following day we called back to receive our discount and the woman refused to give us any sort of discount and just kept screaming over the telephone "I give you free soda!!!!", and hung up. Please read this complaint as well. complaintsboard.com/compâ€¦
