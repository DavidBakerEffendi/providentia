We've eaten at the Yardley Inn several times. The service is always good and they have an interesting menu but... I always seem to order the most bland thing on the menu. This time I had the Griggstown Chicken Breast. It was a little dry and flavorless. The side veggies were good, especially the broccoli rabe. I'm sure we will be back but next time I'm going to have a burger. Hopefully I can't go wrong with that. (famous last words)
