This place was delicious and much needed in our 19125 hood. The woman (owner?) behind the counter was very friendly and had no problem accommodating my no dairy needs. The food was fresh and tasty. I had a falafel sandwich which was moist and delicious. And they deliver within a two mile radius! She told me they take their last order at 8 pm week days and 9 pm on weekends. This is not really a place to dine, they only have three 2-tops but perfect for take out and delivery. I'm really hoping they do enough business to stick around!
