Had my first date and he took me to Tony's. What an amazing meal. No reservation, but we were seated promptly on a Sunday afternoon. We had the shrimp and chicken special and was the best thing I ever put in my mouth (almost!). So flavorful and more than the two of us could eat, and we tried. We did have to order dessert and had the Tiramisu. OMG! The most delicous desert ever!! Can't wait to come back to NYC and eat at Tony's again. Will make reservations just to make SURE we get a table.
