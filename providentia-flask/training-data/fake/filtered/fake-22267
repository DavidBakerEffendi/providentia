Phenomenal food and service. My wife and I stopped hee in our honeymoon and Jake, who I presume to be the owner, was outstanding. He spent ten minutes drafting up a guide of local craft breweries and attractions for us while we were in Burlington. The food was amazing and they were able to accommodate to my wife's gluten allergy. Five stars is not enough!
