I have been here quite a few times.  I consider this definitely top 10 in Manhattan and the boroughs for Italian.  Good restaurant, no doubt, but occasionally slightly snobby service if some of their 'regulars' are there and they then don't have time for you.  This though is more sicillian italian with out any of the northern italian flair, and for that I don't believe it deserves the #1 given this year by the Zagat.  The food though I agree would be a 4.5 if I could score it.  They do have the best chicken stracciatella soup I have ever had, and have really great meals (meats, the pastas) that are hard to beat and is worth the trip by those Manhattanites who believe they might melt when they cross the river.  And, as a side note, their wine bar has one of the best italian wine lists around, probably only beaten by Babbo.  Good eating.
