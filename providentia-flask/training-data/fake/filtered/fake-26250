Wow....happened to drop in on my 51st birthday....3rd day of my return to New York after 20 years absent.    SO, I have to say as a " foodie"  from Portland, OR....this was one of my MOST  favorite meals in my entire life.   All about the. " busting" my taste buds with complex flavors and texture.... Seriously!   And ya'll want to know what the surprise was after an over the top selection of food creations....it was the dessert.   So, Philip (one of the owners) comes up and says, "I dreamed this freakin dessert last night....woke up and wrote it down...you have to try it"   I won't even try to describe it.   Just ask Philip for his "Dream Fricken Dessert".....! Note:  I did not read ANY reviews by anyonebefore writing the  above.  I guess my experience was on the side of ......this place was fuckin great!
