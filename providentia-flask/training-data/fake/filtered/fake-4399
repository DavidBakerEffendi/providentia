I am a college student in the area and I must say that the food here is definitely within my prince range. A few friends and I went for brunch at the Bluebird Tavern (as it was recommended for brunch) and it definitely made our trip up to Burlington! Firstly, the service was great. We did not have to wait at all before we got seated at a table -- and we got the best table in the house! We had a nice view and we were pretty secluded from the main dining area so it was nice and quiet. I ordered a salad with bee pollen as my appetiser, as this was the most unique dish I saw on the menu. For my main, I shared the seafood boil for two with my bestfriend Nugget, and we finished it within 10 minutes. Coming from Asia, where seafood is a delicacy, we were pleasantly surprised that a small restaurant in Vermont was able to please our stomachs. I am definitely going to come back again during my next trip to Burlington! Definitely recommend the Bluebird Tavern to everyone passing through.
