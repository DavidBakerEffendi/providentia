I'VE BEEN GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT FOR YEARS AND NEVER EXPERIENCED WHAT I EXPERIENCED TONIGHT! We were approached by the manager thinking he was asking how the service was, only to find out WE made an honest mistake on the tip! Not only was I embarrassed that we made the honest mistake but also the rudeness and loudness of the INCOMPETENT manager.  Besides the fact that the food was terrible, I will NOT return back to the restaurant nor will I encourage others to dine there! WHAT A DISGRACE this place is.  AND LASTLY, I've never been to a restaurant that waiters and the manager drink (shots) during their shift.
