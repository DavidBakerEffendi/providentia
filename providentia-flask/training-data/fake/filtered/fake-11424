Me and my friend had dinner at Ssam bar. All of food we had was so satisfying. Usually I prefer entire traditional food to fusion which is like combining little bit of Korean and little bit of something else, But this place is exceptional. Food at Saam bar is very tasty well made fusion rather than experimental random taste of fusion. We had santa barbara uni, pork belly steamed buns, roasted duck. and market greens with ox sauce. Pork belly was very yummy. The best of the best was "Santa Barbara Uni" though. The fresh Uni with seaweed, piece of pear, and tofu whipping cream was just fabulous combination of flavor. On the day I saw lots of people had spicy pork sausage & rice cakes. Assume that it's popular menu there. This place is stunning. - I would recommend anyone who haven't been to this place yet.
