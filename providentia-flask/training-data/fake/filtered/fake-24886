Went to cafe Habana tonight bec Bianca around the corner had a 45 min wait. The yelp reviews were great and I love cuban/mexican food and caprinias on a Friday evening looked like a winner. We were a party of three and got seated immediately in a corner table in the back. Great table (way better then the two top they have placed directly in front if the beaded curtain for the bathroom ew). In short service was slow, food was mediocre, great drinks, and automatic 20% tip for party of 3. My friends and I ordered our drinks and food at the same time as we had been waiting for approx 12 mins before anyone approached. Our drinks and dinner were served together after a noticeably long wait. Ok service for the dinner... Really late for the drinks. Since we missed cocktail chat and it was raining out we got another round and a flan to split after. Also after asking for water a third time we finally got it... 30 mins later after dinner. The server apologized... but still a ridiculous long wait for water. As we were finishing up the drinks we got our check and there was an automatic 20% tip added (not cool). We paid in full and then were immediately asked by two different servers to leave... Nail in coffin never going back and recommend you don't try it as well! It you want the corn go to a street fair! Also, their wall fan sounds like a dying lawn mover that may fall off the wall and chop off your head at any second. Great convo with my friends- bad place. Two stars for their drinks! And that my umbrella wasn't stolen after they requested we leave them on the stoop outside!
