The first time I ate here I was favorably impressed. The salad dressing was excellent and the coconut chicken delicious. The service wasn't great, but it was adequate. The second time was only a few weeks later. This time the salad dressing was so disgusting it ruined the salad and the coconut chicken was so greasy, overfried and heavy I got serious indigestion from it. Did they change their chef? It was just awful. But worst of all was the amazingly stupid and incompetent young waitress who couldn't properly take an order for two that was exactly the same for both people and had us wait a half hour for the chicken she forgot to order after all the other food was served. She was rude, un-attentive and un-apologetic. She even had a helper she was training...God only knows how...since she needed training herself. Mind you the place was not even crowded but she never once came to the table to see if we were alright or wanted dessert or needed the check. Never once apologized for ruining the meal by forgetting to order the chicken. Saying it would take 2 minutes to get it and it took a half hour and then was annoyed we were asking where it was. Then she charged more than the menu price for the same item I ordered the last time I was there and when I pointed it out to her she said the other waitress was wrong. When I asked for the manager she said there was none. I guess that explains everything. Whoever owns this restaurant..this waitress will ruin your reputation as will your sunday night cook. It was abominable. I'll never eat here again. The absolute worst. Stay away.
