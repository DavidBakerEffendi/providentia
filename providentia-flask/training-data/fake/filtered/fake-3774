One star barely. This place used to be good, it was my favorite. One year ago I would stop every morning before my work, to take a coffee and ham egg and cheese breakfast sandwich. Bagels used to be dense and hearty, but not anymore. I stopped the other day and I bought a coffee and a bagel sandwich and I paid $ 6.11. Their small coffee cups are minuscule now not small. My bagel had literally one thin slice of ham, a little bit of egg and almost none cheese. I was very upset. Why good places after they have some reputation, start disappoint their customers. I don't want to pay for reputation of the place, but for the food I order. $ 4.50 its way too much for a bagel with "nothing" in between.
