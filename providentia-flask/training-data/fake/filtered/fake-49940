Went years ago as a child.  Brought my children and it has like eating in someones musty dirty basement.   Cannot tell you how the food was only had two bites before the waitress coughed all over a table.  The waitress was a mess, threw the menus,  told the table across from us "Not to come back".  Tried to make conversation with her and she told us "that she was a hermit and did not like to talk to  people" WOW think she is in the wrong business?  Childhood memories were shattered.   Would never return to this dirty dirty place.
