There are so many great reasons to go to Sea Witch.  The backyard, the beer selection, the food. The clam roll was delicious. It went beyond just your typical clam on bun sandwich.  The beer selection is great.  They have Dogfish Head and Old Speckled Hen and some Brooklyn standards like MGD.  They're open late which is an added bonus.  Throw in the wonderful garden and it becomes one of my favorite spots in South Slope.
