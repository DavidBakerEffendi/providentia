If I could only rate the food, it would be 5 stars. I cant bring myself to eat any other burger since I sunk my teeth into the deliciously mammoth sized "Cheese Bacon" burger Â topped with crunchy potato sticks. All at a very reasonable price of $5.50. HOWEVER, Ever since they hired new staff, the Kearny Ave. location has completely lost its charm. Overall, the staff is rude, careless, and unsanitary. On Multiple visits I've seen numerous staff members engaging in ass pinching and nose picking prior to the handling and delivery of my food. I also seriously doubt the freshness of their pastries on certain days of the week, having been delivered stale food on multiple occasions. What really did it for me was receiving a receipt attached to my delivery bag which read: "Diarrhea", instead of "Ria." Personally, I would pick a different Hamburgao location to go to. Hamburgao is great, but the Kearny location is probably the worst of all three locations
