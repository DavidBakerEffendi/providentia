We had a reservation for an early Sunday dinner. We arrived on time, and were promptly sent to the bar. The overpriced cocktail was just OK. The bartender seemed like she could care less and directed her attention elsewhere. There were two obnoxiously loud groups in the dining room; one of which was right smack in the center of the room. Romantic dinner plans foiled. We thought the flavors were good, though the apps and entrees we had were tiny and overpriced. There's a good reason they have unlimited bread and butter (the salted butter was good). The beet salad was good. The potato truffle ravioli filling was thin and runny, but it had a burst of cream and truffle flavor so I went with it. My companion loved the scallop entree but was also still hungry afterwards. The generous, homey and playful desserts seemed gargantuan in comparison, and seemed to fit the decor better but didn't match the dinner. Not a seamless meal.
