We heard so much about this place for so long... so we made it a destination on a sunday morning for lunch...first they have a sitting policy that is not fair... if you are a star...you get wisked off to your table upstairs... regular folk just have to wait at the bar and spend some money while you wait and wait... the food was good but overrated, the liver and toast reminded me of my grand ma, the beer on tap ...expensive for what it is...the deviled eggs where great but $3 each, one swallow and they where gone...finally sat Â by the window got stuck with the 16 inch high stool...felt uncomfortable and had the urge to just eat and go...i guess that is the idea...felt like i was somewhere in europe , not because of the decor or charm of the room which is shavy but trying to be authentic but misses by a mile, but because it was full of foreign tourist trapped at a quaint restaurant with what they think is great american food..the side of fries...huge... crispy and aromatic and the burger, a bit bland but served well on a toasty bun... where good but we won't be coming back ...the pig was spotty.
