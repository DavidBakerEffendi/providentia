As owner of Tres Chic Events, a wedding and event planning company, I worked closely with Cathy Amarante at Firebox for my client's wedding rehearsal dinner this past December. Â Cathy was an absolute pleasure to work with, handling last minute changes with the upmost professionalism and ease. The entire staff at Firebox made my client's evening even more special by paying close attention to the table setting details, ensuring all guests were served a cocktail upon arrival and letting everyone enjoy their evening. I will be highly recommending Cathy and Firebox to all of my clients. They were amazing! Stephanie Carmody Owner, Tres Chic Events
