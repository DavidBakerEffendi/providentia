Great spot for a first date!  Between the energetic atmosphere, delicious frozen drinks and flavor-filled entrees, El Vez has something for everybody.  Be prepared to drop anywhere between $75-125 for a dinner for two, but you'll spend that at almost any nice restaurant in Philadelphia.   I highly suggest the Blood Orange Frozen Margarita - a pitcher of which definitely sets the tone for the dinner.  The guacamole is some of the best I've ever had - don't skip out on it.  I've had the opportunity to taste a few of the entrees and the Chilean Sea Bass tacos are the real deal - probably my favorite item on the menu. Give El Vez a shot, you won't regret it.
