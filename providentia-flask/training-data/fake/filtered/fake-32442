I went to Murphy's for lunch and I really enjoyed it. We sat at the bar and I really didn't see their back dinning room, but I loved their decor and the feel of the bar area. I had one of their tappas, dumplings, and they were amazing. My sister had the vegetable eggs benedict and ate it before anyone could ask to try it. They also have a pretty good selection of local beers on tap, more than Molly's if I remember correctly. Great service too, I would definetly go back if I was in the area!
