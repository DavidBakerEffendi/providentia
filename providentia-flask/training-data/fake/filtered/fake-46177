After waiting over an hour and shelling out over $70 for two people for a couple appetizers, two iced teas, and two sub-par ramen bowls (tip not included), I can confidently say that this place is completely overrated by Yelp users and it should not deserve a 4 to 5 star rating. Pros: Friendly and good service, modern and fun environment, and delicious appetizers. We got the pork/chicken buns and a deep-fried lotus and shrimp special appetizer, which was definitely the best part about our meal and I highly recommend. Cons: Oolong iced teas were good, but not great and the amount served was only about 6 to 8 ounces (after the ice), and refills are not free, which was something that our server failed to mention. I got the Tori Ramen and was disappointed not only in the very salty broth and little amount of food, but the lack of ingredients that came with the noodles and soup. My girlfriend got the Wasabi Shoyu Ramen, which was not only very salty, but very sweet, and eating the tofu that was completely soaked in the broth was like eating candy. Both of us love authentic noodle soups and it's rare that we leave even a single drop of broth, but in this case, half of our bowls were still full of the broth because we did not find it eatable/drinkable. In conclusion, we left disappointed, unsatisfied, and feeling a bit ripped off. The ramens that we ordered were not only small in size and limited in ingredients, but they lacked a full and flavorful broth, which in my opinion is the best part about any noodle soup. I don't mind paying a lot for good food, but $17 for a bowl of crappy ramen is not what I expected on a Saturday night out with the girlfriend, especially at a place tauted as one of the best ramens in New York City.
