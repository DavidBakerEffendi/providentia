We have been trying to find a good Korean restaurant in CT since we left Hawaii 10 years ago. This place is it!  We had reservations and upon arrival we were immediately seated. Our initial waiter was good, but virtually all of the wait staff goes around the restaurant to attending to all patrons, which was great.  The food....oh my goodness, it was so good.  My only "complaint" would be that it wasn't spicy enough for me.  We had the boneless kalbi and seasoned pork belly to grill at our table.  The 14 little plates of vegetables were delicious (although not spicy enough).  I asked for some steamed egg and was pleasantly surprised when it was made and brought to our table..delicious!  It's not on the menu though.  We didn't know that it was BYOB so next time we will bring our own.  We were pleasantly surprised and extremely happy with the food (plenty of choices on the menu), the wait staff, and the owners.  This is great place to eat...even if it took us over an hour to drive there!  I would have enjoyed a refreshing cold cinnamon drink at the end of the meal.  Perhaps they will add that to the menu!  We will definitely go back....soon!
