I visit New York ofen and always make a point to eat at Becco.  Every time I go to Becco I am never disappointed.  The Seafood selections are light, and heavy with flavor.  We have especially enjoyed their Halibut and Scallop entrees.  The atmosphere is comfortable and clean.  Their service is excellent but not "pushy".  Good selection of bottles of wines that are reasonably priced and their dessert platter is the best.  Oh yes, the breadbox and Olives are also delicious Recommend to make reservations.
