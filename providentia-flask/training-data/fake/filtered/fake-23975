My son told us about this restaurant in Philadelphia that he heard was good.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't great either.  My wife ordered the chicken and asked if it was all white meat.  The waiter answered yes but when the dish arrived it was all dark meat. I made her send it back and then she ordered a pasta dish and asked the waiter if it could be prepared without hot peppers which it said on the menu it was prepared with.  He replied yes and ...you guessed it hot peppers.  By that time she was starving so she picked thru it and we left.  3 people 180.00...appetizers and a 44.00 bottle of wine.  Not terrible for the money but waiters should listen.  I've eaten in many recommended restaurants in Philly and would save my $ with this one.
