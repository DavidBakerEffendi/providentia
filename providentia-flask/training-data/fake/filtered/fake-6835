Their food was okay in my opinion. We ordered a pitcher of both red and white sangria. Although both tasted watered down, I preferred the white over red. The Warm Feta, Tomato, Caper, Anchovy, Pepper, Olive, Pita Bread and calamaris were good starters for the table. The chicken pita was good but needed more tzatziki so we ordered a side of it. Â Great food and the price is right.
