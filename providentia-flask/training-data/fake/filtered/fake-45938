This place is a 10 minutes walk away from my work. I go there once a week. Line here sometimes can be long enough to get you scared, but moves pretty fast. The food is good. The rolls and subs are okay, but the meet is great. I usually have chicken cutlet or buffalo chicken, but also tried turkey and sea food. Staff is friendly. Most of the people take out, so never had a problem finding a seat.
