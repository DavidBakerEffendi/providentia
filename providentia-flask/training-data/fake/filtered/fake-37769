Had a remarkably good dinner there recently.  WIll go back again.  Terrific service -- attentive, friendly and informative.  Sauces on our dishes were so good that we asked our waiter to pack what was left of the sauces (since we ate everything solid) for us.  He joked that we could dip french fries in them, and we noted that the french fry experience would be greatly elevated by doing that. A deceptively simple-looking menu offers multiple choices -- including some choices I had never seem before: ginger naan for example. a tandoor-seared stuffed calamari, etc.  Curries are many and varied.
