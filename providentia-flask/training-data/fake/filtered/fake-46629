Boloco simply has the best burritos in Burlington. Walking in, the atmosphere is good, but the food is amazing! My two favorites are the Thai and Buffalo burritos, but there are so many different combinations. I like this place better than Bueno y Sano and much better than New World Tortilla, and the service is much better here than either of those places. As long as Boloco keeps making great burritos I will remain a loyal customer!
