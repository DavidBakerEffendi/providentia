We did delivery, and it was a disappointment. We ordered eggplant parmesean, a salad, and lasagne. The sauce was very sweet, but otherwise ok, and both the lasagne and the eggplant were fine (just "fine"). Nothing more flavorful or stand-out than a mall chain Italian joint. The three disappointments were the salad, which didn't arrive, the lack of parmesan cheese for the side of spaghetti, and the burned-beyond-recognition garlic bread. I'm not sure if this is because we were a delivery, and someone was rushed, or if this is consistent. I might be willing to try again in the restaurant, but I will definitely not order delivery from them again.
