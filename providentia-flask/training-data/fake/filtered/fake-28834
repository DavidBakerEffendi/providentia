Small, family-run spot perfect for a quiet brunch. Visited for the first time and all three of us left happy. The "Elvis" waffles were fantastic. Crunchy fresh bacon pieces atop waffles with peanut butter, maple syrup and powdered sugar. The veggie omelette was a nice surprise. Chef included collards and pickled onions which gave it a twist and made it stand out. Fresh-pressed coffee rounded brunch out nicely. It's a tiny place (10 seats) and very laid back. Service wasn't fast or as attentive as you might find elsewhere, but it didn't detract too much from the experience. We'll look forward to going again.
