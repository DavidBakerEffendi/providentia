I have been literally hundreds of times since they have been the last 5 yrs, the best solid good food in Brooklyn Heights. Very consistent good food, the service used to be bad but has greatly improved and now is actually great. The owner is nice. The atmosphere is nice too, the music is perfect, not to loud. The only draw back if I had to pick one the deserts take to long and are to cake'y. The ice cream is always creative though.
