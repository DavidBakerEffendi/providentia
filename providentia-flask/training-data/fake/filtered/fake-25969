Stopped in over the weekend.  My husband and I were very disappointed.  We both had subs amd the rolls especially the ends were hard and stale.  I asked for lettuce and oil and vinegar on mine and got neither.  To make it even worse I think I was overcharged but can't be sure cause I wasn't given a receipt but $22 for 2 subs 2 drinks and a small bag of chips seems a little much. Used to love this place ...in my book its gone downhill
