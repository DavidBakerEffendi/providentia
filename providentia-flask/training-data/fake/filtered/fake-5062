I'm from NY and this is better than any pizza I've ever had in NY.  I also love that it's BYOB.   The place is ridiculously busy though.  They don't take reservations,and you're always looking at a wait.  But definitely worth the wait.  I've waited longer in the winter-time for worse.   Service is also excellent.  And the location is beautiful- it is in the Robbinsville Town Center.
