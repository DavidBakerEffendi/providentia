We went on 8-9 ,Friday. First thing couldn't make my wife's advertised maple martini- then waited 20 minutes for a glass of wine- 20 minutes to just take the order - 40 minutes later we got cold pizza and no plates. Large pizza ($19) that had only 13 pieces of pepperoni, gratuity was 1 penny- will not be back! We eat out twice a week and this was terrible service.
