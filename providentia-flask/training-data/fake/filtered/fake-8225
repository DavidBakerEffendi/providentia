We has reservations for 12 at 5 Â pm. Our orders were very slow coming and screwed up. Everyone had their dinner but one person, the waitress walked up and said that she was sorry but they were out of the item ordered after 11 of the 12 had their dinner in front of them on the table. Our orders has been in for almost an hour. Why did it take so long for the staff to figure out that one item was not available. Don't waste your time here the food may be great according some but the staff leaves much to be desired! Another order was totally wrong but the person accepted it because they didn't want to wait. To add insult to our party the mandatory tip was added to our bill even with the poor service and the orders that were put in wrong by the server were still charged on the bill. Even the persons order that they were out of they charged us for their salad. When asked why we were being charged for the full mandatory tip with the poor service we were told that's how it is for a large party, " ITS OUR POLICY" . What a sad place. If you chose to dine here I hope you are treated better than we were.
