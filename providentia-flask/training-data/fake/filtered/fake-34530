Excellent Thai food and lovely service. The crazy noodles (drunken noodles or kee mao at other Thai restaurants) are fantastic with any type of protein. Spicy level goes from 1 - 5; I love spicy food and grew up eating a lot of Thai food outside DC. The 5 here was appropriately intense. Great portions. The thai spring rolls are a nice appetizer, also tried the beef satay and it was great. Thai ice tea wasn't the best I've ever had, but decent. For an affordable price this is a great choice!
