we go there often and we love the food. its a small family owned restaurant. they make everything fresh, which Â makes my lunch and dinner so much better and tastier. there are 2 brothers running the restaurant and their dad is in the kitchen as a chef really nice people and they work hard to satisfy the customers. i love that place,the food, the service, and the people that work there. definetly suggest everyone to try it.
