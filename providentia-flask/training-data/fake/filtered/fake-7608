Went here for the first time. I had the artichoke app which was very good. For dinner had the veal picatta which was also good. Service was also very good. Food was a little pricey but I don't mind if the food is good. Only downside when we received our bill there was a $10 corking fee which was added because they have their own bar and we brought wine. Don't mind paying just wish I was told up front about it. Otherwise nice place. Will def be back
