Really?  A 4.5 rating?!  C'mon Yelpers.  There's better pizza in NY than Lucali for sure.   For the crust, I wasn't impressed.  I'm a big fan of thin-crust pizza but it had too much of a charcoal/burnt taste for me.  You're probably saying, "Yeah, it's cooked in wood-fired brick oven."  But that doesn't mean I want charcoal flavor on my pizza!   Also, I feel like they take too much time getting the pie to you after it's taken out of the oven.  I swear they spend 5 minutes sprinkling stuff on it after it's done...I prefer the pizza to be piping hot right out the gate.   From a devoted pizza fan, I would recommend Grimaldi's or Lombardi's over Lucali if you're looking for a good NYC pie.   And if you're ever in Los Angeles, check out Pizzeria Mozza, probably the best pizza I've ever tasted.
