By far the best pizzeria in north Jersey. The staff is friendly and very attentive. Their appetizers are delicious. Love the fiesta bold poppers! They have a great variety of slices, wraps, and speciality sandwiches. There's always something new to try. I highly recommend this place to all my friends and family.
