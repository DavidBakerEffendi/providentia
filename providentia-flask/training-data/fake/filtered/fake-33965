Met up with friends in New Haven, and being all from out of town, we checked yelp.  First went to pepe's which was rated higher, but the wait was too long.  Turns out sallys was probably longer. Pizza was pretty good, but i dont care how good the pizza was, nothing was worth a 2 hours 30 min wait in the dining room for our food.  Just wanted to grab a quick bite and get out, ended up waiting the longest ive ever waited for food.
