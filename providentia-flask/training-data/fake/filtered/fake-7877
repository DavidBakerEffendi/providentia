Oh My! Sandra's Next Generation is the real deal. My family is from Manchester, Georgia and let's just say my aunts and uncles were serious about their fried chicken, collard greens, black eyed peas, corn bread, fried okra, banana pudding and sweet tea. Very serious. After many years of trying, I had begun to despair that I would ever find food that could compare to the dinners and suppers my Aunt Edith used to turn out every time we dropped in - even if unannounced. What a gift to discover Sandra's. Her Next Generation not only serves up amazing soul food/southern cooking, she and her daughters serve it up with characteristic warmth and hospitality. Worth a pilgrimage!
