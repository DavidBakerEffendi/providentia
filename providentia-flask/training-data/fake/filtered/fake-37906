We were in town for a conference and were unimpressed with Hartford eats.... until we came to the Firebox. I had essentially the same meal as Anthony P - and the opposite response. The Farmer's egg was magical, with the slow poached egg having a creamy texture I never new possible. The chocolate cherry dessert layered one interesting component on top of another. The first bite got me the whipped cream and the salted, roasted nuts; the second added the chocolate mousse (sweet, but not too sweet). Finally my spoon dug deep into the mason jar to add the delicious cherry compote at the bottom. In between those two courses, the Lamb Ravioli was scrumptious, although in comparison to the other dishes it a bit less extraordinary. The wait staff was incredibly attentive and friendly and the atmosphere created a perfect setting for a divine meal.
