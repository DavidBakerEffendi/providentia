A good time and a beautiful spot. A few things wrong with Eataly's rooftop bar: -A rooftop with no real view. Even asked the staff about this and they were all equally puzzled by the fact. -Every beer and glass of wine I ordered came in a hot glass. At best, I occasionally received a warm glass. It was 89 degrees outside.     -The hall on the way in was filled with LOTS of beer kegs, at least three kegs high. Other customers complained about this as well. -For some reason, the changing/locker station is located in the hall - in full view and fully accessible to diners - beside the ladies room. I witnessed a few women sitting in shock horror.
