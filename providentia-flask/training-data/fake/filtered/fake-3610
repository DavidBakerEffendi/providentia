Hands down always a great meal.  I ordered half the menu the first time I went and everything was exceptional.  The duck meatloaf is consistently my favorite with a rotating presentation.  Start off with some of the inexpensive snacks like maple bacon almonds or if you're feeling frisky the oysters are dynamite as well. Buttermilk gets real busy at brunch so get there early or the wait is an hour plus.  Dinner is also busy so call over before you head out. The atmosphere is cozy so stick around for drinks and try the Senandoah Fizz with Aperol and sparking wine.   This place should be high on your list in Brooklyn!
