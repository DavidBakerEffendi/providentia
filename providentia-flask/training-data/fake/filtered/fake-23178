We bought a great groupon deal from Liverpool, England before we arrived in NY. As we were staying uptown, we were keen to try a meal somewhere different one evening. We couldn't fault the service; iced water for all on arrival, constantly refilled throughout, warm crusty bread and salad before some great entrees. The macaroni cheese with salmon and asparagus was outstanding - it was just a shame I was too full to finish it. Â In fact, we were all so full, we had to take our 2 desserts to go (again, no problem at all). We thought it was friendly with great customer service and of course good food at a reasonable price. Next time we visit, we'll be sure we can finish it all!
