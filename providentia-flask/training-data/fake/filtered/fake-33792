It's a Tuesday night. You and some friends and/or your significant other and/or yourself get hit with an overwhelming craving for Mexican food. Unfortunately, on this night, Taco Bell just wont do. Â So, you get in the car and head for Jose Tejas. Upon your arrival, you are shocked to see that the parking lot is almost completely full. After you open the front doors and see the massive crowd, you double check to make sure it is actually a Tuesday night. Yes it is my friend. But don't turn back now..this place is defintely worth the wait! From the decor to the music to the food, this place hits every nail on the head. For a minute you forget that you are right off a major highway in NJ and not in Tijauana or Texas. Chips and salsa are served at every table and at the bar with a drink purchase. The menu has a nice variety of Tex-mex, Creole and Cajun meals. The fajitas are to die for and the creole meals (especially the gumbo and jumbalaya) could rival anything out of Louisiana. For food this good, you would expect to spend quite a bit of dough, but that is not the case here. Your stomach as well as your wallet will be satasfied when you leave. The only negative I can think of is that, as I mentioned earlier, Jose Tejas will have a large crowd every night of the week. That is 98% gauranteed. I once had an hour wait on a Tuesday night. But believe me, it is worth it. Wait it out. Give them your name, get a little buzzer thing. hit the bar, get a drink and some free chips and then prepare for a TexMex meal that will have you asking yourself, "Am I in New Jersey?"
