We went to PYT for the first time last week. We anticipated a great experience after reading reviews, admiring the cool decor, and being greeted by the charming and charismatic owner. As we we were seated for lunch on a late monday afternoon, we were  greeted by a lovely server who was also the bartender. She was delightful. It was all downhill from there. We ordered the lobster and crabcake sandwich and the veggie burger. Both were DRENCHED with an aoli mayonnaise dressing. The veggie burger was bland with no taste and the lobster crabcake sandwich tasted wierd....like the lobstre and or the crab was frozen for a long time or something like that.  Also ordered onion rings and they came out cold. It would have been better if the server offered us a choice of dressing on the side. We had to send it back. The onion rings came back out hot but greasy and the lobster crab sandwich and veggie burger were so - so. Nothing to write home about. We were EXTREMELY  disappointed. Then the server offered me a drink on her. I expressed my disappointment to the owner and he basically could care less. I paid my bill reluctantly, expecting him to say " the next time you come by, it's on us, but he offered us nothing except his apology. And on top of that, we both got a stomach ache from the greasy onion rings and the tasteless, bland food. I will never frequent this establishment again. One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever encountered. The old saying is true......"Never trust a book by it's cover."  and for that matter , never judge a restaurant by decor and great food photography online. They probably had a professional photographer take the pictures. C'est la Vie. What a waste of my hard- earned money..
