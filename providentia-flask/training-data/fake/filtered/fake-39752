On May 27th we went to Talula's Garden for our 32nd anniversary.  We were thrilled that Aimee Olexy was back in the neighborhood (my husband was her first customer at Django.)  Our high expectations from many wonderful meals at Django were met and exceeded.  The space is exciting and the service is attentive but not suffocating.   I had the sturgeon terrine and the marinated halibut and my husband had the stuffed squash blossoms and the roast chicken (although it is a crime to call it just roast chicken.).  The food was luscious.  As expected the baked goods served at the beginning of the meal and crackers for cheese at the end were wonderful.  Flavor and freshness prevailed.  The portions were generous and we found it hard to finish our main course.   It wasn't hard to decide to end with one of Aimee's cheese plates-a selection of blue cheeses with a glass of sherry.  We were impressed with the wine list in general and thoroughly enjoyed the wine we chose for our meal. Even though it's a much larger restaurant this time, Aimee has managed to convey a personal and welcoming touch in every facet of the meal. Ron and Barbara B.
