We have been here twice and I love it!  The staff is extremely friendly and outgoing.  They make you feel very relaxed and like family.  Both times, we got the grilled calamari appetizer, which was wonderful!  It really tasted grilled, and the calamari was tender, not chewy.  It was in a perfectly light lemony olive oil dressing.  Everything was really well-balanced.  My husband said while we were eating it that he was already craving it for next time! Last time I had the lobster ravioli, which I would highly recommend.  Soooo good!   This time I got the crab cakes.  They were good, but I was wishing I had the lobster ravioli.  My husband got the veal parmesan.  The sauce was basic and delicious and the veal was crisp, not greasy.  The pasta was really yummy too. I would definitely recommend this place.  It's pretty small and looks like a whole in the wall, but it has great ambiance and authentic, wonderful food.
