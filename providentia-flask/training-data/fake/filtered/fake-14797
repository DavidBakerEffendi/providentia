I came down to Robbinsville from the New York City area to visit my daughter and stopped in at Centro Grill to have dinner this past Memorial Day weekend. My family and I had a wonderful time here and we will be visiting frequently because of the service we received from our waitress. I am unsure of her name (possibly along the lines of Alessa), but she was a tall, young girl, looked like she could have been 19-20 years old, with long, dark hair. She was terrific to say the least. She was personable and respectful. Being from the NYC area, my family and I have been frequent diners at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse as well as Morton's Steakhouse, and have never had a waitress or waiter on the level that Alessa is at. She really knows how to treat customers of all ages and clearly knows what she is doing. Thank you Alessa, for making our dining experience pleasurable!
