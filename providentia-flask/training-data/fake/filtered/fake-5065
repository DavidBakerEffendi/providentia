Good food but lousy service and very expensive. Roti Canai is not good....four chick peas in a bowl of oily curry and cold roti. Did I mention bad service? How can they charge 20% tip for a party of 4 without even mentioning on their menu? Is it legal? Did not want to create a scene, so paid it. Will not go again.
