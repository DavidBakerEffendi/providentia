Great Great Great. The atmosphere is New England chic meets DJ funky meets hipster/babiesville. Â The food is delicious (if not overpriced)...The Crunchy French Toast is fabulous, as is the hot chocolate, the matzo ball soup and the banana walnut pancakes. Bubby's breakfast is just your normal fare of eggs etc....the grits are ok.....but the best part is the service. Expect to wait for a looooong time on the weekends so, if you're curious, check it out on the weekdays when you can actually get seated right away...
