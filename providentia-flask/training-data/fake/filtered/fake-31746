By far the worst Indian food I have ever had.Perhaps being  a Brit. I' m use to  better quality. I have never written a review before but this was just bad . First no beer! Ok try water with  meal not bad,bit like bud lite. The popadams,stale Samosa ,greasy Chicken vindalo,the chunks of potatoe,old ,tasted like left over buffetFrom a week ago. Chicken also had That warmed up taste,sauce bright red,very tomato based, Kemam  Nan ,rank. I guess we ate. 30% and left the rest,rice clumped together. Always take left overs home not this time. Best curry in that area, brick lane curry house in Montclair. Spice Grill  bad curry.hope this help.
