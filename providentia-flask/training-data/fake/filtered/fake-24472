I went to Joe's Shanghai with eight of my friends, we were all starving so we ordered the crab and pork dumplings as a starter with the idea of ordering more dishes afterwords. It was early afternoon, not really a busy time, we were seated right away and the dumplings came very quickly as well. I picked up a dumpling, put it on my plate, sat the plate in front of myself, and then stared at it for a good minute because there was a COOKED COCKROACH stuck to my dumpling. Sorry Joe's, I won't be eating at your place any time ever.
