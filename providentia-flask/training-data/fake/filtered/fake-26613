I've been going to Stone Park Cafe once or twice per year for ages but doubt I'll be back. The music was very noisy at 7:15pm on Friday, July 26 and my co-eaters and I asked that it be turned down. We tried first with the host and then with the waiter. Neither of our requests registered. After 5 minutes we got up and left, in full view of the host. Stone Park want to either keep their wait staff happy or are just aiming for an under 40 crowd. If you are over 50 there are many other very good eateries within a couple of blocks on 5th Avenue.
