I haven't had the chance to dine in the restaurant yet.  Typically, I order take out but am really looking forward to eating there because they decorated the place SO cute. The food is DELICIOUS.  They have really good pizzas.  My favorite meal is the gnocchi.  I've also had several of their pasta dishes and haven't had a bad meal yet.   If you are craving really good Italian - give this place a try!
