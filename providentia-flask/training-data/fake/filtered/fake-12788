I've been to Samudra over a dozen times and love their food.  I've tried nearly every kind of dosa on their menu and give them excellent reviews.  The staff are always courteous and welcoming.  They are also probably the cleanest Indian restaurant in Jackson Heights. Definitely best dosa experience in Jackson Heights.
