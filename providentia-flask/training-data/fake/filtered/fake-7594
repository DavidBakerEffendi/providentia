Give this a go. I've done dine-in and takeout and the meals have been fantastic. I've had several of their dishes but most appreciate the stark coolness from the bean sprouts juxtaposing a hot/warm Pad Thai. Hmm actually I think I appreciate even more that a request for medium spicy is genuinely a delicious level of spicy. It is in a great location on bloomfield avenue and is not far from parking (I would do the lot in glenridge avenue) even if you don't want to park directly on bloomfield avenue. The service is kind, respectful and attentive, and the decor is inviting and fits the cultural theme. I was melancholy from traipsing around slushy snow in the cold wind and dining here made it all better. Will be back for more!
