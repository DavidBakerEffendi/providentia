Avoid Prosperity Dumpling and go to Vanessa's Dumpling House up the street instead. PROS: + very reasonable prices + good taste and quality of food + good portion sizes NEUTRAL: lack of ambiance and decor decent wait time for your food CONS: - limited seating and EXTREMELY cramped space - rude staff - restaurant has a VERY unclean feel - dumplings here are very dry, compared to Vanessa's moist dumplings (that sounds kinky, but you get what I mean) RATING: Solid 2 (weak 2.5, only because the prices are incredibly low) SPECIAL NOTES: Cash only
