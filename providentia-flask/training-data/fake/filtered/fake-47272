I stopped into Luca's Ristorante this afternoon for lunch. From that one visit, I've decided to make it my food destination whenever I'm in the area. Firstly, the table service was very prompt and enjoyable. The waiter was pretty funny and personable. I'll be sure to ask for him the next time. There were a few other tables near us that seemed quite happy with his service, as well. Next, I ordered the Penne Bolognese because I like to go with something pretty common on the first visit. However, there wasn't anything common about it. I've had the dish countless times, and I can't remember the last time I enjoyed it in a significant way. The meat was great, the pasta was cooked very well, and the sauce was the perfect consistency. Overall, the experience was very pleasant, and priced pretty fairly. It's not cheap, but the food was totally worth it, and I was glad to leave a nice tip for great service. I definitely look forward to returning there any day, anytime.
