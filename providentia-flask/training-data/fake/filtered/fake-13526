If you are a Western NYer and you need your anchor bar or duffs fix then this is the place.  They proudly display a bills helmet over the top of the cooler and you can get Labatt blue and Genny Screamers.  Only problem is they always run out of cold Labatts too quickly.  Only thing I have ever had to eat here has been the wings.  They are authentic Buffalo wings.  Big wings served with blue cheese and carrots and celery.   GO BILLS
