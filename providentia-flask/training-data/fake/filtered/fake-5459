I like going to this spot, however I was there a few nights ago with a group of friends and there was an asian waitress who was rude as hell. She had a very nasty attitude and kept telling people to stay out of her way because she needed the space to work. Its a bar not a restaurant or hall, people are going to be standing and talking. Ive been a waiter myself and as a waiter you need to politely ask people to move and kind of find your way around the crowd, don't like it? Then don't wait on tables, simple.
