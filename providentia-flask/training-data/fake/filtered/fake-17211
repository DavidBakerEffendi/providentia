Went to Delizia's for the second time tonight. The last time was about one year ago and nothing has changed much,unfortunately. The pizza was undercooked and very doughy and thick. I mean c'mon this is Jersey you have got to do better than that. I ordered the fried Calamari for an appetizer. It was overly breaded and chewy. Something you would expect at TGI fridays. The chicken Murphy was in a watery sauce with  increadibly white chicken added on with too few peppers and onions. My  3 kids were more interested in my side dishes of pasta which wasn't too bad, hence the second star. So I had to tell my kids before we left the restaraunt, "Take a good look around"  which means that daddy and mommy will not be bringing them back.
