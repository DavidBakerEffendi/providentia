Ate here a few days after they opened. Great space, very clean and nicely decorated. As the name suggests, the soup dumplings are the star of the show. Super thin wrapper skin, and very flavorful soup. The meat is not dense at all. I prefer the classic pork filling, but my more adventurous friends liked the super spicy and wasabi flavored ones. Saw some other people ordering the entrees, and they looked good too. Also, the wait staff was very friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back!
