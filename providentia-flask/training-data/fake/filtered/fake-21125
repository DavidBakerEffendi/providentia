This is a fantastic restaurant for food. If you want decor or good service (we had an inattentive server possibly not indicative of Montville Inn), this is not the right place for you, but if you want the best meal either my wife or I could remember in the last 25 years, then this is it. Chef John Livera has been trained in top restaurants elsewhere and he brings a joie de vivre and incredible flavors to his food. He is as great a chef as any of the Top Chef Masters I have been watching on BRAVO. Here is what we ordered: My Wife - Beef Wellington (with an innovative approach to the "Wellington" on the side) with included spinach in a delicious sauce and mushrooms in a different sauce. The beef was simply the best ever. I am sure it was 24 to 32 ounces and every morsel was fabulous. A side of broccoli had very good broccoli but a weird sauce (the single disappointment of all the food). She also had Stella Artois and coffee. Me - an Easter (that was the day we were there but it's normally on the menu) special of fabulous Duck Breast (the best I have ever eaten) in a delectable sauce, the best side dish ever (creamed polenta) and a very tasty and unusual Bosc pear frisee. We split an appetizer of short rib ravioli highly recommended by the reservationist and excellent but a little overpriced at $11.95 due to limited quantity. We also split another recommendation, the bread pudding which was super and a great value at $6.50. the beef was $28.95, the duck was $26.00, the broccoli $4.50 and beverages totaled $7.45. With 15% (if it were up to me it would have been lower), the total meal was $105, the best value meal I have ever had. I can recommend this to any gourmets who are willing to overlook service deficiencies which the management should fix ASAP. We will go back there many times in the future.
