My boyfriend and I went there last Saturday. We had no idea how packed it was going to be. We had to wait for ~ 1 hour and 15 minutes. The wait went by quickly because we had delicious white wine sangria at the bar. The red wine sangria wasn't too bad either! We ordered the pork and fish tacos. The fish tacos were AMAZING. Cooked perfectly and served with two very yummy dips. The service and staff were very friendly and always checked in to see if we needed anything. Overall, 4 stars! Also, there is very cute outdoor seating in the back. Great for a date night or girls night out!
