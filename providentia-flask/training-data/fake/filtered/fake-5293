So after wandering around the E. Village looking for some place with great sliders a friend raved about the night before, we gave up and chose Cafe Orlin. Delicious food (had the burger, friend had pasta and the other friend had the salmon sandwich) We sat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the weather and people watch - amazing - and split a bottle of extremely reasonably priced wine. Would definitely go again and try the chocolate martini
