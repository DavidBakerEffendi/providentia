Great little place (with dessert next door at Insomnia!) that provided us with a very fresh lunch - loved the spicy noodles with crunchy veggies - a true find that fits that special niche of quality, service and top value for your money. Definitely will go back again and adds to my "where to go for a good quick meal without being in a national chain". Â  Next time - salads!
