The food probably deserves a 4 or 5 star rating.  However the noise and service bring it down.  The Service was friendly and helpful but it took 1 hour from order to table and that was without any appetizers.  I will give them benefit of doubt on that one as they have only been open about a week (10/17/2012).  The food was over salted so order without any additional seasoning.  The noise was just oppressive you could hear the conversation of tables across the room.  They need to hire a sound engineer to come in and deaden that noise.  The food however was very good and locally sourced where ever they could.  I will be back in 4 to 6 weeks and give them another try and hope they have worked out the kinks.
