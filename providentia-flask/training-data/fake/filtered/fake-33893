We visited the Orange Squirrel o 8/17/2012 in the evening, with reservations for 3 at 6:30.  There was only one other party of 4, and a while later another party of 2 arrived. While I like to have a little bread and butter to munch while waiting for the dinner, we were advised that the establishment does not serve any bread. We ordered a house salad to share, to be followed by scallops, filet mignon and smoked tuna respectively with two side-dishes, potato salad and a zucchini/carrot preparation.  It took quite a while to get the salad, but meanwhile we got a delicious "amuse-bouche" . The wait for the main food, after about 20 minutes for the salad, was about 1/2 our or more, and when it came it was side  dishes first then the main dishes.  I want to point out that the quality of every dish was first class, no complaints there, but the size of the dishes, especially the  sides was almost comically small.  We topped it off with a "seasonal fruit tarte" which looked like a mini creme brulee with a garnish of one halved blueberry.  We were not hungry when we left but this was due to a fairly substantial earlier lunch rather than the "mini" dinner.
