My husband and I were very excited to eat at Candelas because we had heard so much about it!  The whole restaurant is nothing short of top notch.  The food was delicious, served hot and fresh.  The waitstaff was fun and professional.  The owners were delightful, they stopped by making sure everything was perfect, and it was!!!!  We can't stop talking about how great it was.  We can't wait to go back!!!!
