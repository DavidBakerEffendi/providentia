I like Claire's desserts and that's about it. I'm a vegan, and it's hard to find yummy vegan desserts, but Claire's makes them well. Now for the other food...I've tried it a couple times, and it's not that great and the smoothies are disgusting. But I know to go there just for desserts, which are great, which is why I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars.
