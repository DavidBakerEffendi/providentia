Been there 3 times and enjoyed every visit. First I came by myself and was so impressed that next time I invited my family and than couple of our friends. Here is my normal breakdown of my rating: -Food: so far we tried falafels, beef gyro, chicken shawarma, taboon, hummus, salads, Spanish eggplants, Moroccan beans, bourekas and dessert. Everything is handmade to order, so fresh, taste health and delicious. I love home made pitas and laffas, hot and tasty. Every time I bought extra to bring them home for my household enjoyment. Food is very fresh and consistent. I think they have best hummus and shawarma in town. -DÃ©cor: very tasteful, cozy, clean and charming. Great inviting atmosphere. It was a real pleasure to have our meal there. -Service: efficient and very hospitable. People are helpful and the manager kept checking up if everything is OK. I found great energy at this new place. -Price point: price is cheap for this variety and quality of food, especially in the city. On behalf of myself, my friends and my family I want to say Thank you, 'Hummus and Pita Co'. Great job! I would recommend going to this restaurant hands down. It is authentic, nice, has fresh, healthy food, grate selection of Mediterranean dishes and every aspect to become one of the most popular places in Chelsea. Try their baklava and almond cookies! I'll be back soon. Anna from New York.
