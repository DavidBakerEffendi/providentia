Overall delicious! We order 2 pies, the margherita and buffalo chicken, and french fries. The pies were warm, flavorful and just great. The downside was the fries, which by the time we got them were a bit soft and not as crispy as they should be. However, that won't prevent us from getting pizza pies from them again. They're a good place to grab a slice, or in our case a pie.
