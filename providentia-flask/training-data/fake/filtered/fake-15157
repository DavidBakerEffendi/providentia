Not awful, however, I don't think I will be a returning customer. I ordered the three roll lunch special and the "tod" specialty roll for take out. Here is a breakdown of why I can only give kansai three stars. The three roll special was mediocre. Three standard maki rolls, cut into six pieces each. Pretty standard deal. The quantity of fish to rice left me feeling cheated. Not as bad as Vic sushi bar in center city (which fills every roll with an insane amount of cucumber), however, no where near as good as Momiji which in my opinion serves up the best three roll combo in the city. Kansai's problems, 1) Bad avocado, two of my rolls contained it and I couldn't even finish my meal. First of all there was way too much of it and secondly it tasted way too ripe. The texture was total mush and it made the unagi and ebi taste of nothing but old guacamole. (and it takes a seriously bad piece of fruit to overwhelm eel sauce). 2) The spicy tuna was bland. This has been a problem at almost every mid range sushi bar I've visited in philly. With the exception of Izumi on east Passyunk (the best is my opinion) and momiji which at least has some flavor. This spicy tuna had nothing going for it. No flavor, not the freshest taste or texture and to make matters worse it was served with a crunchy filling component.
