This place is the real deal !! It's a true sports bar, not a wanna~be !! Place was packed and the service was top notch ! had to wait to sit but it was well worth the wait. Fries, wings, muscles all amazing !!! The waitress was on her game as well. Didn't have to wait for drinks (which is a big deal for me). Everyone seemed to know what they doing and did it well ! Great job mgmt team, you connected with your workers !!! Simply love this place.
