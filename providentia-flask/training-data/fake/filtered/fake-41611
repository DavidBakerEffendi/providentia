I stopped by 116 Crown because I was drawn in by the glowing bar. When I walked in a was pleasantly pleased with the hip decor and and lively atmosphere. I end up sitting sitting in this lounge type area that had cast-concrete tables. Very cool. I had a very delicious drink. It was very expensive but very good. I didn't have any food, so I can't comment on that, but this is a great place to stop by and have a drink with friends.
