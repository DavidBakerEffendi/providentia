They need to do something about the acoustics in the place.  You will not be able to hear your dining companions. Do not understand raves at all!  for a so-called 'must go place'. Small portions that are expensive and so-so by any measure. Just because everyone goes there does not mean that the restaurant is worth your time or money.   Personally, I will not frequent this establishment again.  Any raves must  have been written by adolescents rather than a true 'foodie'.
