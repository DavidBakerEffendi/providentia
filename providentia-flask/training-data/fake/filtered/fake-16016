Couple of days ago I was about to write my review on this place but noticed that some people did it already. But today when I come back to check out how many other people was disappointed by this place I noticed that there reviews is gone. I guess corruption exist not only in Russia but in USA too , or it spread from Russia to USA. I hope my review will stay and will not be removed by  this side. What I noticed other reviews which is probably written by employes or by there friends is still stay on the side -too bad. I always  thought that Yelp is always watching for this things ,but after what I experience in this place  and other people who's reviews was removed too. I loose my respect to them. In short I'm Ukrainian and know how Ukrainian food should test and look. By  putting Ukrainian name on the food it will not change it test. The quality of the food similar to the food you can buy on the street or in the fast food restaurant which is OK-but not for the price they are charging .In any store on Brighton Beach in russian community you can get better quality and better test for the same food they do .The problem, not every one want to go there .But there is Veselka restaurant where food test much better and the service definitely much better,  than in Taras Bulba .And I agree with the person whose review was removed .To build restaurant in NY is not build it in Moscow . We don't need restaurants like this one in NY , And keep corruption in Russia don't bring it in US. In the end I want to say : I wish I could leave them without stars but yelp don't allowed it.
