Pizza is expensive and not great as expected.  long lines, long wait, small serving, and dirty place. It's probably didnt even pass inspection.  I lived in this neighborhood for over 20yrs, never liked their pizza even before they got famous...loved their Zeppoles, and italian ices...but they stop making those since it's not their money makers anymore. the reason they charge $5/slice so to manipulate customers to buy a pie for $25...=S I understand why people like Mr.Difara, like how can you say it tasted bad to your pops, rite?  and it's your obligation to support him when he got older...I'm just saying
