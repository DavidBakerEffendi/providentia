I decided one day to experience Korean food in the Big Apple and I was throughly disappointed to say the least. The inside of the restaurant is lovely. Service was excellent and very friendly. In the restaurant I was the only non-Korean person. So I was hoping for great food. Even though I am of Korean heritage I just don't look like it so to be fair I will say I'm an undercover Korean. I did get some curious looks from people but I am used to it. The panchan I got right away and they were fantastic. So I ate them all really quickly LOL. I ordered my fave dish the Bulgogi and I was shocked when I tasted it. It was very bland and the rice was so mushy, it was just gross. This was the second time I had Bulgogi and the rice cooked in the same pot and I flat out did not like that. I realize every Korean restuarant prepares Bugolgi differently, but I just don't have an explanation for the the lack of flavor. it was quite expensive for food I didn't enjoy. I dont live in NY but if I did this would be one restaurant I would never go back to.
