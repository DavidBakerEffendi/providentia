it was on Sunday morning, me and my friends who came to visit me where looking for a place to eat stakes and  finish our bottle of southern comfort left over from the night before, a Latina Chick that was with us said let go to Sazon they have a nice steak for brunch and the are BYOB so we went , i had and steak with grilled onions smashed potatoes and broccoli, it was Delicious, my friends had  chicken patacon,  beef patacon and the other have a stake with eggs and fries from their brunch menu, we order fresh Passion fruit juice to mix with the alcohol. it was awesome, the food was not that cheap but it was right for the quality and the taste. plus those patacon thing are huge and come with rice, my friends where impressed about the place and I'm glad we went there this is my joint now.
