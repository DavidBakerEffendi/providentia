I found this place by accident pulling into the neighboring Wendy's! So glad I didn't have a burger for lunch that time! The food is delicious although some might complain that the pitas are small, they are great size for some of my co workers that prefer something smaller. Â Get an entree if you want something more filling. Call ahead if you want to save some time at lunch. I love Lamb Kebab.
