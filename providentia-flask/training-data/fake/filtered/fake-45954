Quit cooking your damn cup of noodles and check this place out. The ramen is like no other. The service is on point, but don't expect to get a table immediately. People wait on line for this Japanese goodness, and if you're not a patient kind of dude, you're better off getting that $1 pizza slice from 2 Bros, nah mean? But if you're trying to treat your lady to some good Japanese food, you need to bring her here. She'll thank you and ask for your hand in marriage once you're done.
