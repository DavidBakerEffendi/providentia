By far one of the BEST places to get a weekend brunch menu.  Very busy, but worth the wait on Saturday and Sunday.  You order off the brunch menu and there are always lots of special dishes to order as well as the usual breakfast fare.  Great coffee, great food and great service - Try it...you'll like it!
