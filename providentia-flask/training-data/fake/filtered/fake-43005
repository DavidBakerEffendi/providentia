Not too bad but a little bit over hyped. I've had a few different kinds of pizza's over there's now and unless I tell them I want the pizza half baked I end up getting pizza with burnt crust which is apparently how it normally is. oddly enough I found that their pizza cold is in fact the best cold pizza I've ever had. The price though isn't really worth it as everything cost almost double what you'd pay anywhere else even if you get just cheese.
