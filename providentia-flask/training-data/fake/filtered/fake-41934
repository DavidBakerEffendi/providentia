I went here last week with a group of friends and had an interesting experience. The guacamole was to die for and our server was absolutely adorable so sweet. HOWEVER my friend ordered a Chardonnay the first time and asked for a second glass which was definitely not the same drink (and it had lipstick on the glass and none of us were wearing lipstick) but we didn't want to make a big deal so she just asked if she could get another glass because maybe they were mistaken. He bartender then proceeds to come to the table to show her bottles and make her try them to prove her wrong. It made us extremely uncomfortable like we were wrong. She never ended up getting the correct drink, we just pretended we did so he would stop walking over (he did it again). Â All four of us tried them so we know it wasn't the same thing. It's just a shame he handled it that way and made her feel so uncomfortable for just wanting the drink she had the first time she really liked. Even after that we tipped the server 20% because it wasn't her fault and we still remained in good spirit. Maybe a tip for the bartender is don't be so defensive and try to make the customers more comfortable. We weren't saying we were wine experts or questioning your capabilities. We were actually being as nice as possible..
