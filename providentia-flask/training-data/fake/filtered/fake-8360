I heard big changes are coming to Laetus. Word of mouth is they are doing a relaunch to change there ways to better customer service. I hope so the food is great there and the decor is unique being a downtown Hartford establishment. But when you go in it doesn't feel like it. It's almost if I'm in Miami beach. I love this place I want to see them do good..
