I have been to this location a few times. It always takes a little while for the food to come out. Far longer than it should. But on 6/24 it was especially long. I arrived before the lunch rush only to watch people who ordered 15 minutes after me get their food. When I inquired, I received a "deer in the headlights" response. Then a few minutes later I asked again. Then after a cook looked around, he produced a bag of food. He didn't fill it, it was filled and sitting there. When I asked the cashier about it and pointed out that it must have been ready and sitting back there, more "deer in the headlights". Food was of tepid temperature. Service just sucks there. I wrote a note on their corporate website that same day. No one reached out to me. They obviously don't care. Never going back...
