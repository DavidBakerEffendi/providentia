It's so weird to read some of the bad reviews on here because I've had nothing but great experiences at this restaurant. Burlington has some great restaurants in general, and many of them are in the busy Church Street area, but there are several things that set this restaurant apart from them: 1. Its historic charm, 2. The gorgeous views of Lake Champlain and the Adirondack Mountains, 3. Its own private parking lot so you can park with no hassle in no time, and 4. It's not crowded and loud! The food was amazing. I'm a vegetarian and especially love the french onion soup, roasted beet salad (I crave this one frequently!), and the eggplant towers! My boyfriend is a seafood lover and raves about the Fra Diavlo. We both love micro beers and they have some wonderful local options such as the lighter Long Trail Blackbeary Wheat and the hoppier Alchemist Heady Topper (and Beer Advocate gave the latter, double IPA, a 100% rating!). If you're looking for an all around quality experience, from celebrations to University visits to a nice dinner out, this is a great choice!
