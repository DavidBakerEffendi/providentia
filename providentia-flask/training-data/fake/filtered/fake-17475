I love this place.I have bought on separate occasions squid ink for paella, and a wonderful olive oil that tasted like bananas. Today I  had the pintxo navarrico,  a thin slice of crusty bread with cheese, red pepper and thin sausages, I drizzled the olive oil , sherry vinegar and sea salt they had for sampling at the  communal table and to drink I had a spanish hot chocolate, very thick  and rich.Spanish music was playing ,spanish food magazines are available for perusing and with the housewares items on display for sale and the friendly service it is a nice place to pop in and decompress for a quickbite .
