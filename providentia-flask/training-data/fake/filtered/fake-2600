Place is a little beat up, but the pizza is great! We got a pepperoni pie. The crust was thin and crispy, the pepperoni was cooked to the point that it curled up on the ends and the sauce was great. Â The only reason I will not give it 5 stars is because it took me a while to get the black stuff from the oven off of my hands after we ate there, but that is what you get with coal oven pizza.
