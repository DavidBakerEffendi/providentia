If the people at the front desk weren't unbelievable c#ntsausages and the waiting area a zoo - it'd be 5 stars. The food is good, but holy cow on a crap cracker are the employees rude. I've had 2 terrible experiences here. Once they skipped our group on the wait list. When my friend politely asked to make sure we weren't forgotten, this sloppy blonde manager lady literally howled in his face without provocation as if she were powering up for a cow pasture. Maybe her pants were stuck in her a$$. We left. The food is good, so we forgave the actions of 1 employee. We came back the next month. Another lady got snarky with us when we asked if there were free space at the bar. She acted like we were stupid for asking what a chair was rather than asking if it was taken by a party. I guess they are snooty about their super important minimum wage job. Awesome. Again, we left. That was the last time we went here. Their never ending cycle of rude people is just beyond belief. They know their food is good, and don't seem to care about being civil most of the time.
