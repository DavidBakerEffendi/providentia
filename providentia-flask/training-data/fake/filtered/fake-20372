I am a native of Montclair andI have to agree with the other reviewers. This restaurant started strong like a year ago similar to most thnic restaurants on Bloomfield avenue. However these restaurants start creeping up the prices slowly and steadily and compromising on the quality, for example having two chicken dishes versus one chicken and one lamb dish (lamb is a specialty of Indiana and Mediterranean cuisine). Â Unfortunately Mausam is no exception. I would urge the hotel management to roll back the price of their lunch buffet to $10 and also not increase their ala carte menu prices as well. Keep customers coming as it is best in the long run!
