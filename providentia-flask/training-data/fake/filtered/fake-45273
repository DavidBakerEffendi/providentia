I've had two good experiences at Ice House, so when I planned to go back the third time I was very excited. I was looking forward to getting the avocado and shrimp salad. The shrimp (normally excellent!) was terrible, a strange texture... flaky and tough at the same time... I mentioned it to the waitress and she gave me a sad face and sad "oh that sucks, I love that salad!" and walked away. We assumed she had left to let someone know. When no one came over and she didn't return, we figured she would just take something off the bill. She didn't. I mentioned it to the manager and he gave me $4 off. So i ate a $15 bowl of avocado and lettuce. :(
