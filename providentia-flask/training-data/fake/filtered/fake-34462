Awesome savory cake this morning!! A golden-brown plate-plus-full of tender, tasty (not spicy) pancake, embracing a comfortably loaded center of melty vermont cheddar, garden-fresh scallions bits, and succulent dices of deli-grade ham, shimmering under a dewy coverlet of local syrup & butter . . . all which harmonized to absolutely rock the casbah of my palate. Said before, I'll say it here now: You can always trust a Country Girl!
