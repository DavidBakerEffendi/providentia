The food here is really really good. Some highlights... Dan Dan Noodles Green Beans with Pork Garlic Shrimp Three Cup Chicken I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order here. The service is also fast and friendly. The space/ambiance is just ok...usually very loud, very casual, but i think they are expanding soon.
