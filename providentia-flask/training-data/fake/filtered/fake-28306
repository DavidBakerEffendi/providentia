I love Taverna Kyclades very much.  I just went there for dinner for Valentine's Day.  The pan-fried greek cheese is out of this world delicious!  I get it every time I go and every time it's better than before. For my main entree, I wanted to try something new so I ordered the T bone steak.  It was awful!  About 3/4 of the steak was complete FAT! I couldn't even cut through it to get to the good parts because of the fat and my steak knife was dull.  The waitress never came over to see how our meal was.  However, when we finally got her attention and explained how awful my meal was; she comped my entree out of the bill. This just further solidifies my love for Taverna.  They are so kind to their customers and are willing to make them happy.  Even though I had one bad experience (on a holiday I wish it would have been amazing), their loyalty to their customers is amazing.  By far, the BEST greek restaurant in Astoria; just don't order the T-bone steak.
