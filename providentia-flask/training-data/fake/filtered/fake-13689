Cuba was exactly what it is named! From the original Cuban paintings on the wall, to the great tasting mojitos and Â the fantastic food , right down to the currency on the wall with the image of Camilo Cienfuegos, Cuba made me feel like I was in Cuba! I had the churrasco with chimi churi sauce , yuca frita and the cerviche , all of which were amazing with great taste! The ultimate mojitos , made with 8yr baccardi rum, were fantastic and made to perfection! The atmosphere was very cozy and to end my night , I was treated to a hand made cigar! What more can you ask for??
