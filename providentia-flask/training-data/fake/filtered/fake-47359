I just need to google words that are describing words for negative.  My boss sprung for lunch, and typically that means he it going to take me to some great place.  On occasions, they are places that define a style.  The Rib House did the same thing, but was a example of what not to do.  It was chosen as a shot from the hip. I had the baby backs, he had the St. Louis Ribs.  The BBQ sauce was corn syrup mixed with ketchup I believe, and something was maybe mixed in from a bottle that had a white label with the words BBQ spice on the side. It was filling is about all you can say, and Oh the service was alright are maybe the only positives.
