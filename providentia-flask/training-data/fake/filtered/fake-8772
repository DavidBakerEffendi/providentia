The worst experience ever. Last night my wife and I went to Blue Ribbon in park slope. We arrived in New York 2 days ago and expected to have a nice bite and some easy ambiance. We weren't looking for the best food or service just a decent place for a pregnant woman and her husband. We set at the bar, our favorite spot and I ordered beer from "Adam" that was quite friendly; Then we ordered food. We wanted to start with some appetizers before checking on the king crab as Adam recommended. The beetroot salad was flavorless and had 3 cubes of tomato on top. The asparagus were blanched (cooked) probably at the same time we landed at JFK and the ribs, a plastic like dry pieces marinated and braised in an artificial flavor sauce were simply bad. The highlight of our night was a drunken guy named Brian. The village fool of Blue ribbon in Brooklyn. Apparently this guy is a usual at the bar. He set next to us and started talking to my wife. We were friendly until he became rude and obnoxious. Â (Asking my wife what was she doing with an "ugly guy" referring to me). We tried to be polite and Adam tried to get rid of this guy and was apologizing repeatedly. When he failed to get rid of this drunken fool he sent us OUR CHECK as if he wanted us out. The manager that was at the end of the bar babbling with some waiters did nothing. We decided to take off leaving the free desert that was sent to us at the bar. Don't go there! The food is less than average and the bar is a neighborhood spot for older, aggressive drunk locals.
