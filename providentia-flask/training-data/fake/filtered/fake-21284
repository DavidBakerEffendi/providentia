I live in Park Slope and order often from Bogota. I went in the restaurant on Saturday evening with some friends and the hostess was rude. We waited over an hour for seating when we were told only 20mins, had it not been freezing I certainly would have taken my business elsewhere. On the other hand the food was great as always and so was the server. Bogota -Get a better hostess
