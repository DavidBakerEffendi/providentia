I havent been here in a while, it is very good a little expensive but it is what you should expect to go out to dinner and enjoy a good meal. I normally would rather frequent a mom and pop kinda place but you cant go wrong here. Everything is very good, clean and fresh. The service was great as well. Expect to wait a little when i went they had a pretty good wait. It is worth it though
