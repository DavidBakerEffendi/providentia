I'M VENEZUELAN, THEREFORE I SHOULD KNOW WHAT'S GOOD SO READ ON... Ok this place is good, it's tiny but pretty. Sometime they have live music, it's fun, but at times a little too loud because the place is very small.   The cook unfortunately is not Venezuelan, therefore not everything tastes Venezuelan... so, what's good there?  Almost everything on the Appetizer menu.. or as the menu says "Antojitos" to be more specific the items below are delicious: MIni Cachapas: Sweet fresh corn pancake with Venezuelan melted cheese Tequeños: Deep fried white cheese sticks wrapped in wheat flour dough MY FAVORITE: Mini Empanadas:Cheese, shredded beef, chicken, baby shark House Salad Mini Arepas con Nata: bite-size crispy arepas with venezuelan sour cream. The rest of the stuff (rice, steak and other dishes) are not all that, some don't even taste Venezuelan, so not worth it. The big arepas are ok, they take out the extra inner "dough" so you feel like you are eating a crunchy tortilla and that's not traditional of Venezuela.  But they are ok... just don't think that's how it's done in Venezuela. The traditional Venezuelan drinks are good, like the Chicha, a little bit too thick for my taste but not bad in flavor. I'd recommended to my friends, but only if they've got the munchies, not for dinner or anything like that.
