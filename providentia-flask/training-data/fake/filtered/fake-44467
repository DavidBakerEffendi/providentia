Its been a long time since I've ventured into McLadden's, once a regular to the West Hartford scene, I tend to stay away especially after eleven for obvious reasons.  I usta love this place!  A couple days ago a group of us stopped in for a late afternoon beer.  I was surprised by the overwhelming selection of beers.  Our bartender Steve was great!  He was very knowledge of the beers and helped us narrow our choices.  The bar defiantly draws a young crowd, but I'll be back that is for Happy hour....
