Breakfast at this place was my welcome back to New Haven treat from my host, and I certainly was not disappointed. I had a large cinnamon pancake with extra strawberries and maple, and it totally distracted the people from the other tables; one lady literally turned towards me and asked: "I am sorry, but what is THAT?" I almost killed it, but I had to give up and take home what was left. It was simply delicious, and the extra strawberries were worth at least three times what I paid for them. The tea was good but nothing special, which does not say too much, because I am really fancy about my tea, as almost everyone living in London. The waitress was really nice, and tried to advice us that we were ordering too much food, but we did not listen, which was a good choice, since you can have what you do not eat to take away. I hope I will have time to go back before I leave New Haven!
