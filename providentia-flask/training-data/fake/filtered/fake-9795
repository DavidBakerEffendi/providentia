We stopped here last night, since TGI Fridays was jammed and there were some police cars outside. We had our granddaughters with us and were quickly seated in a nice booth. Our waiter was very attentive and was patient with the kids as they took a while to order. The person who seated us had provided the appropriate crayons and place mats to keep the girls entertained. The food was delivered promptly and there was more than enough to satisfy our appetites. The burgers were excellent and mine was seated in three cheeses on a delicious Kaiser roll. Very tasty. The waiter wrapped the leftovers and also provided the desserts for the girls to go. Â All in all, a pleasant experience at a fair price. We would definitely come back.
