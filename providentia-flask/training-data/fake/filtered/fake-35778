I was very very disappointed with the service at this establishment upon receiving my dinner , the food was dry and was obviously prepared at some point in the morning or the night before and was in no shape or form deemed fit to be served to someone and by no means have that person charged for it for that matter. And not to mention the Unprofessionalism  , I can understand some people are not in a position to own a business and be able to pay for a child care service , but if you have to have your children at your place of business then at least keep them off the counter and not sleeping on the chairs in the waiting area ,and not for nothing i I don't think it's morally proper let alone legal to have CHILDREN preparing food for customers , that seams as tho it could pose serious health code violations in my mind, plus the kids are playing on the surfaces that the food is prepared on! I personally watched the same person take the trash out and walk in and was handed my food and packaged it for me and didn't even rinse their hands let alone wash them properly. In my opinion your taking a chance eating here , I hate to get Into details but the rest room was my best friend for atleast a day and a half after eating there. The business was highly unprofessional and the food was I hate to say but terrible , it's poorly prepared it's dry and flavorless , and not for nothing it's served to you like some old timey fish market " crudely wrapped in aluminum foil" , this will be the last time I ever eat there , I was so strongly disgusted  I felt it was only appropriate to share my experience.
