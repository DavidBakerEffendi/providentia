My family (hubby and 15 year old twins, boy/girl) had to do our yearly comparison on our way back to Pittsburgh from Ocean City.  This year is was Sonny's vs Campo's.  Both places had a little bit of a wait, both had a variety of cheeses and toppings as desired, but Sonny's also had burgers and french fries/onion rings.  Well, we stuck with the usual, 2 steaks from each, both with Whiz, and one wit/one wit-out.  BY FAR Sonny's had the most flavor, right amount of Whiz, and onions were perfect, meat was well seasoned and cooked.  Campo's was soaked in Whiz, and though I like cheese, it was toooo  much.  Our only complaint....didn't notice the Parking Kiosk, and found a parking ticket on our "free" spot lol!.  No complaints on service at either place.
