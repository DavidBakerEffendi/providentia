I just loved the Shanty on the Shore.  Great atmosphere, Service was very personable, and the food delicious.  We ordered the Atlantic Salmon and the Crab Cake Dinner both were fresh, hot and satisfying.  The desserts were all homemade... our favorite was the Key Lime Pie. We will visit often.  Thank you.
