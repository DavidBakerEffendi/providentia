My wife and I had our wedding in August, 2013 in Burlington. Afterward, we had dinner for 20 at Logan's on their patio. What a treat! The menu was fabulous, as good as it gets any place.  Our guests, to the person, loved the food. Those appetizers were outstanding! The service provided by Logan's was exemplary.  A need never went untended, from lemonade to silverware to a clean plate.   The wedding cake was Logan's signature carrot cake which delighted everyone - even now my wife and I take out food from Logan's and never fail to get the carrot cake. The Logan's and staff are welcoming, warm, professional and sincere, with a lot of experience. We recommend Logan's to locals and visitors alike.
