The food gets better and better and they make a great effort to offer local fare. PLUS the setting is beautiful (the place's decor and lighting make for a welcoming environment) and the music selection, is fun and diverse.  Tabare is definitely a must place for any fun evening with friends.  One of my fave's in the neighborhood.   Come in enjoy the food and say hello to the friendly staff.  They are a great set.
