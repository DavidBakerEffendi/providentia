Have had decent experience there when just having a beer or two.   Was very dissapointed when I dined there last night.  Ordered a burger med rare and was served a burger med well, with the bun burnt as well.  Was offered a 'half burger' as compensation since I had taken a bite out of the burger that was on the plate.  Thanks but no thanks.  Last time there that is for sure.
