Took the opportunity to head out for brunch during Thanksgiving weekend.  Got a table by the door, facing the street.  Nice, but a little chilly given the movement in and out of the door.  A little slow getting menus, and even slower taking our order.  When the food finally came (we commented on the delay being more than expected), my order (a special) was correct; my husband had ordered the veggie sandwich and pointed to it on the menu when he placed his order.  What arrived was a veggie omelet.  My husband noted the mistake and was told that the waitress thought she had heard veggie omelet (not sure where she got that from - my husband does not even like eggs).  She said she would correct the mistake.  Came back a few minutes later to say my husband's sandwich was on it's way, and asked me if I wanted to have my food kept warm so we could eat together.  You'd think she could have (1) asked that when she took my husband's incorrect order away, or (2) offered to redo my order as well so that we could eat fresh food together.  The meals ended up being good, but service was sub-par.  I asked for a final re-fill of water, which the waitress acknowledged, when she came by to ask if we were ready for the check - thank goodness I was not that thirsty since the refill never came.  We would go back again - maybe.
