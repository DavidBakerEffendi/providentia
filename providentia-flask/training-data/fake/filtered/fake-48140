My friend took me here for my birthday lunch on 12/28.  The place is in a small and ancient space in the SOHO area of Manhattan, with exposed beams in the ceiling and lots of brick and woodwork.  The interior exudes an ambiance of rustic comfort, but it's the aroma of the food that comes out of the kitchen that hooks you immediately.  I had the Zuppa Rustica (soup) and the pasta with wild boar sauce. The soup was very flavorful with hints of garlic in the broth, and the barley and vegetable were cooked ,but not to the point of being mushy. The pasta was fresh, and the wild boar tasted exactly as it should have -- much more flavor and a slight gaminess that distinguishes it from pork like a good steak is to hamburger.  These excellent dishes reminded me of the food I have had in the Emilia-Romagna area in Italy, it was that good.  The drinks (Limonata) the waiter brought over to start with were a heavenly concoction of good vodka, mint, lemon and blood orange syrup -- truly divine (I had 2 of them).  It isn't often that you find an Italian restaurant with the same quality of food that is found in Italy -- this is one of those places.
