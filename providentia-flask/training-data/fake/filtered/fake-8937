After reading several reviews, I was looking forward to trying this place out. Arrived at 10PM on a Saturday night. Surly bouncer at the door asked if we had reservations. When I said no, he laughed and said "Well, we are only taking reservations tonight." Interesting as there were already three girls standing in line, one of whom muttered "Not for the bar..." I then called up the bartender who informed me, as I suspected, that no reservations are needed and that the bar was in fact not yet full! Wow. If you need to try this hard to look popular, that is an ominous sign for the business. Unfortunately, such a blatant display of rudeness, albeit mildly amusing in its transparency, equates more with sheer ineptitude than it does with coolness or class, so we spent a wonderful evening at two nearby locations, Aria Wine Bar and The Otherroom (both fantastic). Unfortunately if the name of the bar is any indication, this is not a place where I would have wanted to spend my evening. Too bad I didn't get to try the drinks, but the sour taste in my mouth after this encounter likely would have colored my perception.
