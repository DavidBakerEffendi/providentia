This has to be one of, if not the best restaurant I have ever been a patron of. As soon as you arrive in the Village you feel like you just warped into Italy. The decor is uber modern but with a touch of classic Italian. Definitely a nice place to go on a first date or anniversary . We started with the fried calamari and hands down that was best calamari i ever had. Jumbo sized and a huge portion. I literally could have ate the whole thing by myself. That's how good it was. Next we had the Mediterranean pizza and again, the best pizza i ever ate. Â The only drawback was our server was not as timely as I would have liked but based on the food and atmosphere, I am still giving 5 stars!!
