Recently we were in town and came across this lovely little bistro right in the heart of Philadelphia's Fishtown neighborhood!  It was so quaint and charming, and made for a perfectly romantic setting for a double date with the in laws! My father in law is hard of hearing so we are often cautious of dining out in the city.  No problems here! It was busy but the ambiance was soft and soothing, without all the distractions of loud music or background noise.  We were able to chit chat, and once dinner came we had plenty to talk about! Their house made Charcuterie is top notch! Every course was complex and delicate, in that special way that only French food can be. I highly recommend the fois gras or the house-made pasta. The menu featured a lot of local produce and house made items, and we were thrilled how beautiful everything was.   It was definitely a steal! This quality fare could go for double or even triple the price down town!  Located right on the re-invented Frankford Avenue, it's definitely worth an extra couple minutes to get there, and when we arrived there was plenty of free on street parking! We can't wait to go back!
