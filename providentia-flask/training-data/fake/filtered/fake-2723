This was a great place to see a show if you're into small venues - intimate atmosphere, bar attached, bands hanging out in the parking lot before and after the shows.  Plus it's really easy to get there from Center City - definitely walking distance, just a stone's throw from the Art Museum.  I'd definitely go back again!
