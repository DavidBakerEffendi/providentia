We decided to have our engagement party of 150 people at Forsgate Country Club. The place is very pretty but the service and the help from Kelly is impeccable. I speak to her and follow up with emails about things I forgot after our conversations because I am all over the place and she quickly responds always with an answer that pleases me and accommodates us. I told her about my family needing to have 16 people at one table and in 20 minutes I had a new floor plan in my email. I could continue to give examples if needed but I would recommend any bride to look at this place for a party or wedding.
