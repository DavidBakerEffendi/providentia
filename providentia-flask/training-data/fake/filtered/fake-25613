I almost want to give these guys 4 stars for what they do well, but the majority of their menu forbids it!  I haven't had everything, but they tend to overcook their meats to the point of being dry and hard; I haven't had lamb from there that I can really tolerate.  Also, the falafel is tasty, but dry.  To note, I've only had the meals as delivery, so it might be better in the restaurant. On a good note, their pizza is great, and their grape leaves are great - both important things!!  Having spent a lot of time in New Haven, I've had trouble finding good pizza in the Hartford area, but here is a place that delivers at all hours and has a fine selection of very tasty pizzas. Bottom line positives; great pizza, grape leaves, availability negatives: mediocre meals and overcooked/dry meats (delivery) If you're coming by late nite, it's a great place to grab a snack and a slice or two, and if you're ordering delivery in the area, I highly recomend their pizza and a side of grape leaves.
