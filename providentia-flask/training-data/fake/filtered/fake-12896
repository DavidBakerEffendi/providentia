I grew up eating homemade Mexican food thanks to my stepmom and I must say, this is Amazing food. We live outside the delivery area, so we treck up there for the delicious food. Outside of Mexican food in Jackson Heights, this really is One of the best MX eateries in Manhattan. The immediate area is a bit sketchy, but totally worth it. Don't let that fool you (and if it does, youre not worthy ;)). Also seems pretty clean, the service was pretty good as well. There was a bit of a delay when I needed salt and when we wanted our check because they weren't paying attention to us (you know, I waited 1 min instead of the standard 15sec), but service is very friendly. Cute inside! The only thing is, it's small, so be okay with that. The only reason i said not good for kids is because its small- big strollers, crying not happening. Also, bathroom clean (extra plus!!).
