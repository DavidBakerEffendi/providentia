I have been going to Buttermilk Channel for week nights' dinners for about two years.  The quality remains consistently high.  The food is fresh, the menu is just the right length and you always feel great afterwards -  a testament of the great products they use.  I particularly like the their fish dishes and the sea bass among them. The reservations always seem to be a little tricky for small parties but I have not had a problem as I get there kind of late.
