I just had a business luncheon at Park and Orchard and it was fabulous!. I had heard excellent things about the food and venue and was really delighted with both! Had a delicious, incredibly rich lentil soup followed by a salad that had the sweetest, most tender shrimp on it! Loved the dressing too. Service was excellent.... will definitely be heading back again!!!
