Visited two Saturday's ago for lunch, our party of 4 was seated promptly, we ordered and waited almost 45 minutes for the food that arrived cold not even close to hot. The manager stopped by to ask how everything was, told her about the slow service and the cold food, she said she would check on it - we never saw her again.....this was my first time visit. Maybe it's a good bar - but it's lacking in good food.
