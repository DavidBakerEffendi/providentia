This place is absolutely wonderful. We had some time to get dinner before a concert at the Bowery and Yelped a restaurant nearby and found this place. The portions are filling and delicious and decently priced. Happy hour is a good deal. A great place for dinner or some appetizers and a bottle of wine. The staff is friendly and attentive. Came back a second time and was not disappointed! The interior is dark and romantic and there is a small lounge area in the back to sit if you are with a larger group of people. Love it!!
