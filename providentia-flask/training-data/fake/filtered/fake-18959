Hands down some of the best Frites I've had in NYC. Pommes Frites isn't the kind of place that you'd sit down and eat (although you can between the busy times), but rather a place to pick up and go somewhere else to enjoy (for me that's the benches in front of the Church about a block or two away). I don't know what their business hours are, but they're open pretty late, so you often see people coming out of the local bars on line. The place is pretty small and unless you know what you're looking for (or just a random line of people) you'll find it. They twice cook their frites and serve them with some of the most delicious sauces that I've tasted! The Vietnamese pineapple sauce is incredible, the mango chutney, the peanut satay, the black peppercorn, I mean I could go on forever. They're generous with the frites and stuff the bag with about 4 potatoes worth of frites, so unless you're committing "carbicide" I wouldn't suggest getting larger than a single; besides, the frites don't taste the same reheated anyways. All in all, I'd give them a four out of five stars. While the size, lines, and crowd of people may seem intolerable at times, those crispy golden frites with their delicious sauces make it all worth the while.
