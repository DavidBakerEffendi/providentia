My boyfriend took me here for our anniversary.  The food was passable.  I had the veal - medium rare - and he had the New York Strip - medium well done - and his food was even bloodier than mine!  That was a turn off right there.  Worst part of our experience was the service.  Neither of us got a steak knife and when asked, the waiter only brought one out for him.  Was I supposed to cut my veal with the butter knife??  My boyfriend graciously offered to cut my meal up for me instead of waiting a half hour for the waiter to come back so we can ask for another knife.  The service was shoddy and it wasn't even a busy night!  Worse part was that we didn't even get bread!  At first I was going to let it go thinking that maybe for all the money we're dishing out, this place didn't provide bread....BUT as people left and more people came...they all got bread so it was just us.  O, and in case it helps we're Asian so it might be a race thing.   I read another review for Moshulu saying how their one waiter was racist maybe my boyfriend and I got the same waiter....it's like winning the lottery!  I would not go back there again.
