Food is pretty good, but unless you get what I'll call the "shipyard special" - two slices of pizza and a can of soda for $5 - prepare to open your wallet a little wider. A converted shipyard workshop, "the Frog" has some old-time hard work feel, that's overwhelmed by the fashionista/hipster feel of URBN (cranes hanging over a koi pond and bizarre modern art.  Good place to people-watch because of the mix of workmen, government and city employees, and URBN designers in odd outfits (such as turtlenecks and ugg boots in the middle of summer, and sandals and miniskirts in winter) Expect interesting combinations of fresh ingredients, but a lack of spice in any of the "ethnic" fare.  The dessert table is right of front and very tempting, but can be disappointing.  The food and seating brings in three stars, but the old aircraft carrier outside and workshop tables/cranes give it an extra.
