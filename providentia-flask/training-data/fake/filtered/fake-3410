Abner's is the BEST!!!   My brother and I would go to Abner's every week during the 80's.   It was great eating.   Then I left Philly and didn't return until about 2002.     Since my return I have visited Abner's every week usually with my son and daughter.   And now that a  nephew of mine has started Temple and a niece has started Jefferson Medical School, the two of them join me and my and go to Abner's every Saturday or Sunday.   By far Abner's is the best place in all of Philly for hoagies, wraps, waffle criss-cross french fries, and pizza.   The inside of Abner's is outstanding.  The food delicious and reasonably priced.   And the owner and all the  workers the best.  Enjoy a meal at Abner's and dazzle any out-of-towners who want to remember the best of Philly eating.
