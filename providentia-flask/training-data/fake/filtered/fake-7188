I was told it was hard to eat at a horrible Italian restaurant in New York... Testo proved them right. From the fresh ingredients and tasty pasta, everything was right with this place. The only reason I didn't rate this place 5 stars is because I saw hair on the table... wasn't on the food, but it kinda grossed me out for a bit. Maybe I'll be nice and give them 5 stars next time. Anyway, I highly recommend this restaurant.
