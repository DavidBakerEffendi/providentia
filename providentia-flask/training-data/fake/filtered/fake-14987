Awesome owners, they asked me what I thought of the food and actually listened to my opinion. I had the So Champignon the first time, and I liked it a lot! The sauce had a pleasant aftertaste, and though I was skeptical of the cube-shaped pieces of ham, it all ended up blending together very well. I've also had the So Dog--SO GOOD but not enough sauerkraut! The next time I went I had the So French, which was just as good as the first two. I came here most recently for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, and I felt bad for taking her there--we enjoyed the food immensely, especially the "So Amour," but the service was  definitely sub-par.  This wasn't the first time--I've been here before on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and since there is only one waitress and the place is filled to capacity, it's impossible for her to give the customers the attention they expect and, honestly, deserve as paying patrons of any restaurant. It's ridiculous not even to have food runners, or someone just to help get drinks out. It took us 15 minutes just to get glasses for the wine we brought. The server was very kind; it's not her fault. We'll be back, but I hope to see better customer service in the future.
