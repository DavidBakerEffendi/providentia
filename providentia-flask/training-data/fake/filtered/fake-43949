I would recommend FOND to everyone and anyone who loves great food. I would eat here every night if I could. Last week I started with the fresh homemade bread then for main course I had the scallops with yellow raisins and truffled celery root velout√©. They were cooked perfectly and nice crisp top not over done at all....so delicious! You cannot go wrong with any of the desserts! Atmosphere is lovely and the staff is super nice! I cannot wait to go back!
