All I have to say is you pay for cheap food, for cheap service. I literally waitied 30 min!!! 30 MINUETS waiting at the bar for 2 orders of dumplings!!! They dont have any type of order, their customer service skills????, and just plain unsanitary. While I was waiting I saw one of the workers cutting a sesame pancake. then open a box of cookies, then back to cutting the pancake. I then went to the cashier and asked for a refund. And walked out of there. NEVER AGAIN!!!!
