VERY overpriced. Sandwich was JUST bread. If each slice of bread is going to be an inch thick, it would behoove you to add at LEAST that much filling. Had a "warmed" (read toasted - not what I wanted) pastrami and swiss with mustard. All I could taste was bread and mustard. I am a bread lover but this bread did nothing for me and I ordered a SANDWICH (which involves some filling). I give this place NO stars but the app won't let me.
