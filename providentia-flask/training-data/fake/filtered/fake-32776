Living in the area, I went to this place a few times. What I loved about this place is the extremely good service, compared to what you normally get at Asian restaurants. During all the times that I went, I was seated immediately and given water quickly. The servers were extremely attentive. I remember one time when I dropped a pair of chopsticks on the floor, I was given another pair of chopsticks before I even picked up the pair that I dropped. The mango chicken was one of my favorite dishes along with the Thai basil noodles. I highly recommend this restaurant for its service and quality of food. It beats Penang by lightyears in both areas.
