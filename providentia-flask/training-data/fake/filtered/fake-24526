Their famous soup dumplings is ok. The waiting is crazy long and you cant reserve in advance. I suggest going to other Shanghai Restaurants near mott street / elizabeth street if you dont want to wait. Btw, service sucks. they seat you with other strangers. A true cultural experience in a chinese restaurant :P
