How happy was I to discover this new Indian restaurant that opened a few blocks away from my house. It is one of the first in our Lefferts Garden/Flatbush neighborhood.  I have ordered from there nearly every weekend since it opened.  The food is incredibly good and fresh and is filled with spices and herbs.  The prices are reasonable.  You can have your food delivered (very fast) or dine in.  The staff is very friendly.  I have ordered the shrimp tikka masala, chana aloo and the chana masala.  My husband loves the lamb and chicken masala. They are all magnificent and the portions are large. The samosas and nans are also great.  My husband and I usually eat the left overs for lunch the next day because there's so much food.  They have lunch and dinner specials too. I would highly recommend this restaurant.  Let's help keep this restaurant in our neighborhood.
