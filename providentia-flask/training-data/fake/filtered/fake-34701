Wow!! I recently moved back to Astoria and I am shocked at Sanftord's transition. I remember when it was that little luncheonette. Now, it became this trendy upscale restaurant. First, I really like the decor and ambiance. Second, the food is just as sophisticated as it's decor. I had the tricolor salad salad, but I substituted the goat cheese for feta cheese-at no extra charge! The salad was tasty and the dressing (balsamic vinaigrette) was yummy also. I also really liked the grilled apples In it. I added a piece of salmon and although it was tasty It seems they may be using frozen salmon filets. My waitress was attentive. My water glass was never empty! I will definately return to this place. As I walked out I noticed someone was eating what looked like broiled chicken. I think next time I'll try that.
