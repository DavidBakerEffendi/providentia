This has long been my go-to coffee shop in the gayborhood (since its Brew Ha Ha days) and it remains so for now.  But I have to say, service and the furnishings are both becoming pretty worn.  The furniture has not been changed since it was purchased new for Brew Ha Ha, and it shows.  Many of the leather chairs are just skanky now, ripped and falling apart.  The buttons on the couch have all fallen off.  As for the service it gets really frustrating having to repeat your order several times because the staff can't remember what you said a few seconds earlier.  Or having to explain that the milk goes in the iced latte first, then the espresso (otherwise, the ice melts).  Or having to remind the staff that your bagel has been sitting in the toaster for 10 minutes and they've forgotten about it.  The staff is nice, but they desperately need to get it together or they'll start to lose business.
