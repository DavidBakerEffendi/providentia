Mice!  Disgusting.  Poor old guy probably doesn't even see them.  This place is filthy. Not to mention the old fella's daughter, who left some young guy waiting for more than twenty minutes for a slice, as she served what seemed like regular male customers, who came in one after the next minutes after the young man.  He quietly decided to leave.  But, she didn't care.  She just kept flirting with the "regulars" and checked her texts.  She was more disgusting than the mice!   I didn't stick around to eat for obvious reasons, but also because she already left a bitter taste before the burnt blackened pizzas would have.  Must be nice to do nothing and constantly collect other peoples hard earned cash.  Disgusting of her and disrespectful.
