I wanted to like this place a lot more then I did.  Full disclaimer, I'm not a fried chicken fanatic.   I ordered the chicken bucket (obvi) with mac and cheese as the side. It came with 2 drumsticks and a thigh.  The thigh was huge, meaty and juicy.  The drumsticks were eh.  Kinda dry, seemed kind of underseasoned when compared to the thigh.   The mac and cheese was GROSS!!  It comes covered in vinegary hot sauce.  The mac and cheese itself is pretty bland, and gets all it's flavor from the hot sauce.  Not my thing. My dining companion had the brisket and hush puppies, which were both very good. Service was GREAT.  Our waitress made us feel like we were eating in her own kitchen. Pretty good bang for the buck, although I'd pass if the wait is longer than a half hour.
