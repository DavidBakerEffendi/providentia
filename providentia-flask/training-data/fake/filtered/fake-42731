Our first time there --but it wont be the last !! The food is amazing because  Jane, Skip & Chef Chad let NO detail go without their full attention. It's a 25 mile ride for us; but its worth the ride AND well worth the price of a cab just to be able to enjoy the Martinis by Keith !! You would be hard pressed to find a  comparable value in the upper valley. Rich & Gail Scalesse
