I ate at this restaurant about 2 months ago. The food tasted good. The server packaged the left overs for us, and I ate them the following day at work. As I was eating the leftovers, still in the take out box, I began to choke on something. I had to pull out the object from my throat as I could not cough it up and it was very sharp and painful. I found that a 4" piece of steel wool had been in the food, and this is what I choked on. After going to the hospital to have the cuts in my throat examined, I went back to the restaurant and spoke with both the owner and the manager about the incident. I just wanted them to provide me with their insurance information, I did not ask for any money what so ever. I was treated extremely poorly and was told that since the incident did not happen at their restaurant, they were in no way to blame because I "clearly put the metal there". I was appalled at their accusation that I would try to set them up. I contacted the Department of Health, who did not fine them, as well as a lawyer. Unfortunately, the cost of the lawyer was too much, so I was unable to resolve this issue. I warn everyone, that this may happen to you. Had the restaurant apologized and even offered to pay for the meal, I would have been satisfied, but their blatant disrespect was not called for.
