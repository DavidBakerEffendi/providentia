I signed up for Yelp just to write this review and warn people about this place!  There are few really great eats in the area if you know where to look, but this is definitely NOT one of them.  The SERVICE is LOUSY!  The bartender looks and acts like he is a few weeks away from a drug overdose.  He throws the menu at you, doesn't make any beer or food suggestions, and ignores the hell out of you even if the place is empty.  Much more interested in going out for a smoke than providing service.  They make a big deal about separating the bar check from the table check, even though the place is so tiny and they are cash only.  The place looks cute from the outside but the looks are deceiving.  Stay away!!!
