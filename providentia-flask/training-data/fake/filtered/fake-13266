How do you spell over-priced, mediocre food? T-w-o-P-e-t-e-r-s-D-i-n-e-r. Tell you what ....Take out some cash from your wallet right now. Set it on fire. That is more satisfying than eating dinner at this diner. I've also tried breakfast and lunch, both were equally disappointing. The food isn't horrible. It's just plain, bland, and lackluster. Most of all, it is simply not worth the inflated prices they charge. You could get a much better tasting meal for the same cost at a franchise restaurant and much better service, too!! The hostesses and servers are not that friendly. Some appear very abrasive. It took years for this diner to replace the old Parkside Diner. It was not worth the wait. I should have known better because it's identical to their Ewing Diner Â and I stopped going there years ago.
