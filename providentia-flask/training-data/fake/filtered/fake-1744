this review is for their service because i didnt get to try their food. first off the hostess was rude. i came in, smiled and said hi. nothing. "Can I get a table for 1?" she grabs menus and starts walking. 'come" I get seated at the bar and when i go back to the hostess to ask for a table, she gives me attitude because apparently there are no tables for that level and she wants to put me downstairs, which was fine but y did she give me attitude for that? when i finally get seated, i dont even get water until about 10 minutes later. No waiter/waitress comes so I have to ask the guy with the water pitcher when he's walking by if someone is going to help me. 5 minutes later, a waitress comes and i didnt get to try the food because by that time, i had to leave in half an hour and she said the food would not be ready by then. its a shame, i really wanted to try the food becuase i heard such great things but on a sunday afternoon, the service really sucked. I can't imagine how it is when it's actually busy.
