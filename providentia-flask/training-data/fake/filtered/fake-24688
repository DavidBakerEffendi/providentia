I was very excited about the opening of this place. My friends and I are huge fans of the prime 16 in new haven. My biggest draw is the laid back environment. It's not too bright or too dark. It's busy but not busy to where your conversation gets drowned I the noise. Those use of darker color and building materials keep the restaurant cozy and relaxing. The service was amazing! The waiter was friendly, concerned and not overbearing. The food was fantastic just wished my Cajun fries weren't as greasy. I will definitely be spreading good word about prime 16 orange and will be a regular.
