Si te gusta los tacos tan ricos te pones las manos arribas!   A friend of mine took me here a couple of years ago for breakfast.  I had never heard of chiliquiles before then and now I am hooked  Tortillas with salsa verde and an egg cook perfectly on top yum :P  I'm just sad they don't serve breakfast all day. They have a great authentic menu with creative specials.  The service is excellent and the new outside seating area is pleasant as long as you know how to ward off hungry mosquitoes. Taco Riendo is an affordable and tasty BYOB with a great atmosphere that I recommend to anyone.   Also don't forget to try the flan. Delicioso-
