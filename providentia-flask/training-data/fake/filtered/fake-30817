If you want to be surrounded by transplant hipster morons who spend their days blogging, walking dogs, and cashing their unemployment checks, then this is the place for you. Â  If you like ugly women with tattoos, "men" with stupid mustaches, and brain-dead wanna be hippies, come on down. Many patrons here have downed a few too many and wound up getting their asses kicked by actual men who prefer Farrell's across the street.
