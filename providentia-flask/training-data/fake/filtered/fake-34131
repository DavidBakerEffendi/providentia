Went for lunch again today.  Top notch service.  Claudio and Leonardo truly want you to have an amazing experience and do their best.  Such a relaxing meal and quite yummy. Today I was spoiled by being offered several samples of wine by the glass as they were concerned that I got what I liked.  Had eggplant with house made mozzarella. Tapa and stuffed piquillo pepper tapa. Portions large and layered with flavor. Mother had three course prix fixe menu with roasted beet salad, the best lobster ravioli ive tasted and vanilla panacotta for dessert. Great job and can't wait to go back. They have a wine dinner next thursday that sounds great. Always my first choice place to dine on a day off. Ellen from Milford
