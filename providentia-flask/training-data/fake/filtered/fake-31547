First time there and all I can say is AMAZING. Me and my bestfriend went at night and just the view itself is breath taking. Our waitress was amazing! She always made sure we were okay and that everything was fine and she took our orders quick. The food came really fast and tasted delicious! The vibe was just perfect. The music wasn't so loud nor low, it was just right. I recommend everyone to try this place. I enjoyed it for my first time and I would definitely return!
