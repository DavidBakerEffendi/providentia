What a stellar addition to the burlington food scene- Pizzeria Verita is fantastic!   As a true New york Italian I can definitly vouch for it's authenticity.  The pizza is simple, fresh and not overwhelmed by too many toppings-just as you'd find it in Italy.  The dough is simply perfect! The bar is alive and fun and the drinks are very original.  If you're visiting VT from NYC or the surrounding areas (as I was) you MUST try Verita. You'll be thrilled to find true neapolitan pizza made with all fresh and/or local Vermont ingredients...what could be better?
