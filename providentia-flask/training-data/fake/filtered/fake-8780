I have always had a great time at this NY institution. The food is big and supposedly family size, but it's so good I can pretty much polish off a plate solo. You may feel lost in the crowd, and it's a big buzzing place and being in the theater district, it's a little pricier than it's sister locations but this is the original and best.
