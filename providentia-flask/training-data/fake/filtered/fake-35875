Cafe Himalaya is the best!  Affordable, exotic, quick, healthy, and tastes so good!  I love the fact that you can see into the kitchen from the dining area.  Everything is homemade from scratch.  Reminds me of my grandmother's kitchen. Himalaya is tiny, but I've never had to wait for a table.  Service is friendly, and the Tibetan prayer flags hanging outside are welcoming. Most entrees are an affordable $7.50, and served in a soup or on a plate with noodles, veggies, and a choice of shrimp or chicken.  Tofu dishes are even less $.  They make incredible smoothies with fresh fruit, juice, and yogurt.  I recommend the darjeeling tea with milk, and the pan fried noodles with shrimp.  My son swears by the sauteed noodles with tofu.  They adjust the spice for him, as Nepali food can get really spicy.  He has tried just about every smoothie, most recently the mango.  Way healthier and tastier smoothies than Robeks and half the price.  My wife says the Chai tea is the best she's ever had.  Cafe Himalaya isn't fancy.  This place is about the food.  Enjoy!
