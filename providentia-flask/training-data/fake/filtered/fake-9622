Best in the area + they deliver! I highly recommend their signature Tuna Dumplings and fusion inspired rolls - some are sweet, especially those that include mango. "Dena S. New Brunswick, NJ", must have mistaken the tempura sauce for soy; I understand why she didn't like her food!!! Â (They use regular soy sauce @ Mizu.)
