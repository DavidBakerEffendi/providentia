it's entirely possible that patrons of Bea who AREN'T dining pre-theatre will have a better experience than we did.  Unfortunately, our experience was pretty poor.  Had a 5:45PM rez with the idea of eating and departing by 7:00PM for the walk to the theatre.  We told the hostess as well as both our waiters (Yes.  That's right.  Our first waiter disappeared and we were assigned a second server.)  Drinks?  That took over half an hour.  Bread?  Asked twice.  Still waiting.  Dinner?   Finally arrive prox 6:30PM/6:40PM.  Had to eat so fast we could barely taste, much less enjoy, what we ordered.  Recommendation?  Try it, if you will, when you've got plenty of time and no post-dinner plans.
