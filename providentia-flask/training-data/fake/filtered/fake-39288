I came here over the weekend with my girls and we loved it. This place does NOT disappoint. Everything about this place was wonderful. So I am a big fan of wings and theres are amazing. My friend and I shared some wings then we ordered our dinners. I got the ribs, mac n cheese and fries . Everything was tasty and it came right away. You guys really need to get a location in Long Island think about it so its closer for us.
