I have been a regular for quite a few years and just wanted to comment on my love for Hell's - my home away from home. I wasn't friends with anyone before I became a regular but the whole staff [loyal with very little turnover] turned me into family; think the "darkside of Cheers" ;-) I've yet to have a bad experience, food is always consistent [I have an addiction to their Jamaican Jerk Wings, dry rubbed, spicy, and DELICIOUS! and they have, hands down, THE best veggie burger. Ever. and if you're feeling crazy do the Hard Hat Burger but you HAVE to put all the fixins' plus bacon - holyy molyy!] Great brunch options with inexpensive drink deals, BTW perks for menu options for the non-carnivorous, which is rare in this part of town. Hell's is definitely a bar/restaurant you would not expect in the Ironbound, with it's eclectic pin-up decor, but it is a breath of fresh air for the rapidly growing alternative scene, a place where you can put on your fanciest dress and highest heels and feel just as comfortable as the girl dressed in sweats and a T-Shirt. Crowd is pretty varied as they have different "theme nights" such as Tuesday game nights [gotta love Jenga or Connect 4 sitting at the tables when you come in] and Thursday night Burlesque is something everyone passing through Newark should experience, it's like you walked right into a revamped NYC Speak-Easy - so much fun! Daytime you'll see everyone from upscale business folk to families to teachers to hipsters and everyone in between! Overall, this is the "go-to" spot for a no-fuss good time in this part of NJ.. great prices, amazing staff, and so much more! If you've never been, DO IT! You'll definitely have a few new friends, and a new "chill spot" by the time your visit is over! CHEERS!!
