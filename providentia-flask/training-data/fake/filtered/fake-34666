Not sure people like this place. I have had 2 bad meals here. After the first time, I thought is was a one off, but no! Order British burger,  ask for chedder instead of swiss, got swiss. English muffin not toasted at all. Burger raw!!!!!!! Asked for med well.  Fries white!  Not golden! Call and complained. Sent new order, meat still not cooked and muffin still not toasted just warmed on grill!  People ar happy to eat here because the pancakes are warm when they reach the table? Please!  They are supposed too be!!!!!  Or give them a 5 and complain about the stale bread and soggy risotto?
