Our daughter had her wedding reception here last weekend.   After visiting numerous venues with our daughter as possible locations for her wedding reception, she chose Park Avenue Club as soon as she made her initial visit and we did not regret the decision.  All the staff members were very attentive and professional - including the valets, servers, receptionist, beverage manager (who worked with her to create the perfect "signature" cocktail) and of course, Michael, our coordinator who promptly responded to her emails and patiently answered all our questions during our meetings.  The cocktail hour was superb-the numerous hors d'oevres were beautifully presented, delicious and plentiful.    The ambiance of the facility was exactly what my daughter was looking for.  Our guests have raved about the outstanding selection and quality of the food and the beauty of the rooms and gardens.   The exceptional staff, gorgeous setting and delicious high quality food all contributed to a truly memorable event!
