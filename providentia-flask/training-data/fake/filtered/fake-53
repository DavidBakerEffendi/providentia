This place will always be special to me since it was the first fine dining restaurant I ever tried in New York City and it blew me away a few years ago. It's hard to give it 4 stars but I'm edging my way over there since I'm getting spoiled by some nicer restaurants that have been popping up lately. Still, it's very reliable and the spicy duck meatballs never disappoint. I took a first date there this past Saturday night and it was great. A little awkward (mostly for her since I don't have the embarassment gene) since the tables are very close together so our neighbors could hear pretty much everything we talked about. I'm sure the eavesdropping didn't last long as my toilet humor probably wasn't that interesting to listen to I'm sure. As always, I'll be back in a few months to check on things. Harold's still got it.
