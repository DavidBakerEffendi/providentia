I've been going to Ernie's since it opened. This takes me back to 1971, when I was in junior high school. Eventually it became simply "Ernie's". Excellent pizza, always friendly and pleasant folks who enjoyed their work and enjoyed their customers. Family-owned since the beginning. If you like casual, pleasant, clean and traditional, try them. They recently went from cash-only to credit cards accepted, and started offering wheat crusts and gluten-free pizza. This is a big change for them---they've always run the business on a simple, clutter-free basis, and now they're becoming more with the times! Also, they've always only been only a pizza place (no subs or spaghetti or calzones), but what they do, they do really, really well, and they love doing it. Their pizza is on the oily side, which I love. If you don't like an oily pizza, stay away. It's not for you. I have been a vegetarian since 1992, and before that time, I used to love their bacon and pepperoni pizzas. A true fest for the lover of those flavors. And yes, the bacon was always on the underdone side, rather than crispy. They ALWAYS did it that way, ensuring that it had the most flavor. (Responding to an earlier reviewer who complained the bacon on their pizza wasn't crispy.)
