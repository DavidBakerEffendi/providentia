Ok so my mom ordered a grilled chicken salad. And they gave her a ceaser salad. Then she took it back and the nexst salad she got had a french fry in it. I recommend you not to go there. Plus the seating was so uncordinated and so small. Service was horrible. Plus don't get biscuits there it tasted funny. Thanks for your time.
