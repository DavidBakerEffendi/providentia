Now living in Brooklyn, I think I just found my new local dining fave!  I went with a group of 6 last night and once again, the food was fresh, the service thoughtful and the prices gentle.  From the delicious crostini to the amazing broccoli rabe and sausage sandwich, this is a must when visiting Carroll Gardens!
