Great food! Delicious wine,.  Awesome place -- so perfectly designed to be comfortable, yet refined. You can eat and drink from a wide array of foods, wine and cocktails.  My faves (so far) are the homemade ricotta and the Swinechop -- but I'm sure that will change the more I try new things.  I also LOVE the rose on tap. This is my new go-to in the West Village.
