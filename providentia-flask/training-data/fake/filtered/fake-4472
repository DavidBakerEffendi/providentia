I loved eating here and all of the food was delicious. Really great atmosphere, authentic mexican food, all that good stuff. I would rate this a 5 star in a heartbeat but something absolutely terrible happened there last night. THEY COMPLETELY CHANGED HOW THEY COOK THEIR MEAT! It had an unbearably disguting scent and taste that I couldn't get out of my mouth for hours. I brushed my teeth and used mouth wash 5 times and it didn't help. One of the worst nights of my life. The lady taking our orders claimed the recipe was the same as it's ever been, but I HAD their quesadilla de pollo the first time I went and it was delicious. But this time it happened to be the worst thing I ever tasted.....
