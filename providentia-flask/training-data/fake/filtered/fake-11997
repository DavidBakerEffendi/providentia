I want to give 1 star so fewer people go. This is always my first attempt at food when doing what I call the West Village Wander, and my intro to the West Village for friends coming to visit.  It is small, but every table has a good view of 4th St, and despite the close quarters, it feels intimate and private.  The steals are the game meat tapas on the specials menu and the paella (which is almost a meal on its own). Everything is well made with attention to detail, and I've never had anything here that was a half-a**ed attempt at food, although a there have been a few dishes that didn't suit my palate. Last time I was here, I asked the manager for a flight of wines for tasting, and she obliged (even though it wasn't on the menu).
