This review is meant to help a good buisness that has made a couple of misdecisions which in my opinion has reduced the quality of service. This morning my wife and I went to Bella's for their great breakfast/brunch meal. (which has become a Sunday routine for us) However over the last 4 weeks we have noticed a high turnover in staff. As a result the quality of service has severly declined. Most noticable is with the Hostess, who seems disorganized and scattered resulting in frustrated customers. In addition I had ordered the Salmon omlette, which up until this point was my first and favorite meal since dining at Bella's. However on this experience my meal was brought to me cold, half cooked and with a different bread than what was requested. When I asked for the omlette to be fully cooked it came back luke warm at best with the excuse that raw/partially cooked salmon is the way this meal is prepared. My frustration is that this type of service and quality is becoming routine and standard, something we did not experience when first dining here. Bella's PLEASE look into this I would hate to have to change my favorite Sunday treat.
