Wife and I are there Sat March 1st. Service was excellent - our appetizers arrived in about 8 minutes. The Edamame wasn't as good as it could have been but the Irene Roll was awesome. Nice ambience and the staff made a real effort to check in and make sure we were enjoying everything. We will be back for sure.
