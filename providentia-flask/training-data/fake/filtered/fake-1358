I've eaten at The Pines several times and it keeps getting better and better. I gave a four star review very soon after they opened citing focus and service as two things that prevented me from giving five stars, which I do not do lightly. At this point, Angelo has really hit his stride. His food is so creative, inspired and downright delicious that I believe he will be recognized as a truly great chef. All of the kinks have been ironed out on the service and, now with the back yard in full swing, I'd give six stars if I could.
