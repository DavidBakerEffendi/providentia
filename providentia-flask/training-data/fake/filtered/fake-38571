We went here due to all of the great reviews. The wait wasn't too bad, surprisingly so for a Saturday morning in Burlington. The dining area is nice and the hostess was friendly. Our negative experience began once we were seated. Our waiter was especially rude and patronizing, and at first we thought it may have been an odd sense of humor. No, he was just a dick. We ordered the eggs benedict, seasonal hash, and the portabella mushroom sandwich. The proportions were meager at best. $12 for a single orange slice, a palm-sized serving of hash and eggs is ridiculous. The sandwich was equally small. The taste was fine but not extraordinary. The eggs benny were surprisingly good. During the course of our meal our waiter was nowhere to be found. He brought our check before we were even finished eating and did not give us the opportunity to order additional food, which we had intended on doing. Don't get me wrong, I am not stingy and have no problem paying for a quality meal but this was pathetic. Don't waste your time here. Sure, it's Vermont's first "green restaurant" but you'll have an all around better meal and experience at places like Penny Cluse, Mirabelles, or Sneakers in Winooski . Those restaurants will undoubtedly have a significantly longer wait (with good reason) but it's worth it.
