Craft house! What a place. An awesome environment to kick back and have some refreshing beers. There's a nice selection to choose from and they change the options pretty often so there's always something new and interesting to choose from. The food is delicious and I recommend the pineapple habanero wings. If you can't decide on food or beer because there's just too much greatness going on, ask Dan the man. The guy always Â has good recommendations and ain't too bad on the eyes. All in all, I leave here satisfied every time from a quick beer to booze filled night with food. 5 stars! Mmmmmm beer....
