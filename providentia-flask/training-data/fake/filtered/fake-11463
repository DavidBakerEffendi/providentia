Best pho in town, hands down.  And I've tried them all.  Their broth has that perfect mix if richness and spice.  The noodles are always perfect, firm and not mushy.  Their meats are delicious, too.  The place is not much to look at, but I'll take delicious food in a simple decor over restaurants who invest in look and forget to make good food.
