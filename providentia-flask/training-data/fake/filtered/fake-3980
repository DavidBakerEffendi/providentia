Last night I had the opportunity to dine at a great, hip place called Get Fresh Table and Market.  It was wonderful.  The atmosphere was warm, comfortable and down to earth.  The food was incredible.  Everything I ate had such subtle flavors and great presentation.  I have dined in many expensive trendy restaurants with an over use of butter and not much care put into the dishes. Get Fresh is exactly what you get...fresh food with a tender caring feeling. The staff is excellent.  They care about your enjoyment as much as the owner and chef.  I think this is an excellent choice if your looking for a good well prepared meal and will be back time and time again.  I highly recommend it!
