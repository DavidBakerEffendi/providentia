We went to the mall yesterday (labor day) and my b-f was hungry.  Instead of Applebee, we decided to give this a try.   I was excited with the choices.  I tried out DimSum as that's my favor.  Sadly, it's bad.....  I tried each of them but they were just bad. The rest of the food was just over sauces/sweet/salty take out Chinese food.   I would not try the Sushi... as the fish does not look good at all.   My favor was the soft ice cream.  hahaha  I had couple of them.  My b-f loved it too. The sweets choices just ok.  They were package sweets.  I did not try any so I can't tell if they are any good.   As for $13/person for lunch (we were told after we got the check that it was holiday so it's brunch instead of lunch), I would not go back.   If you have a large group and love cheap take out food (chinese and pizza), this is a place for you.  However, if you are looking for some good food, there are better choices. If you do love Chinese food, please try Qin Dynasty on 857 Hwy 46 E Parsippany.  It's the best Chinese food around this area.
