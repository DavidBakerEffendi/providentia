The have a very nice, low key atmosphere. We met friends we have not seen in several years for dinner at Bistango and had a great time. The food was excellent and service was top notch. The prices were very reasonable. For gluten free they had warm gluten free bread and a very varied menu. I had the following gluten free items- pizza, calamari, cheese tortellini in a cream sauce, and a warm apple tart with ice cream......fantastic. I will head back to Bistango.
