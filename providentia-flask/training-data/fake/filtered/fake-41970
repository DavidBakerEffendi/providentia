This is one of the best tasting Â chinese food we ever ate. We have been frequenting this place for the past 15yrs and the quality of the food has been consistently great. Lovely ambience, quiet, less wait time, fresh cooked food and also a sports bar fro men interested in ballgames ..prices may be a little on the higher side, but can be justified for the quality and quantity they serve. WOuld recommend this place to all people who love Chinese food.
