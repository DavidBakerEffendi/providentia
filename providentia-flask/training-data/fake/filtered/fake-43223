The chef here is amazing....I had some appetizers that ranged from Skate Fish balls, to chowder, to curried eggplant.  This was some of the most tasty food I've ever had in Williamsburg.  The bar staff was great too.....he recommended a local Pilsner which was incredible.  Go there...drink  , eat and be merry!
