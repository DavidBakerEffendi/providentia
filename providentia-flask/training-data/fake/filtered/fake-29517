Ventured to this Harlem spot on a Sat with my wife to see if we can succeed in finding good soul food. To our amazement we were quite pleased. The food was great!! I had the Obama smothered W/ Mac n Cheese and collard greens( which was somewhat salty) my wife had the ludacris W/ candied yams and buttered corn. We both had the sweet tea. Which was a lil to sweet for me. She loved it. Â The place isn't the best looking thing but the FOOD oh man the FOOD makes up for it. We might make our way to this side of NY another time. Later!!
