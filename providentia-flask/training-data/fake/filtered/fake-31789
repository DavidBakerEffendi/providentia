I need to tattoo this review on my arm, because, like the character in the movie "Memento", I appear to have amnesia about how bad this place is and end up returning. The portions are small, rice costs extra, service is rushed, and nearly everything is greasy. The 2 stars go to their Hainanese Chicken Rice, which is flavorful and juicy. Just make sure you get the entree portion, because the rice dish portion won't be enough. If I had a half star to give, I'd point it to the fact that they've moved to more hygienic chopsticks, instead of having them pointed down in a dirty canister on the table. Here's hoping that I'll remember this time.
