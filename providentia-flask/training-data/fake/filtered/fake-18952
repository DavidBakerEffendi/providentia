Hi, I'm a huge fan of artichoke pizza and in fact I probably come at least twice a month. However, this weekend, I was extremely angry after my visit and am actually writing because I want an apology. This Saturday night, I took my cousin from California to this location. With a line of less than 20 people, your bouncer was acting like a pyscho on some power trip. He was constantly yelling at everyone to get in a single file line, although we all were in one. In fact, he hit my should and told me to go behind my cousin, which I already was. I'm sorry but at no point should any huge man ever touch a female that is about 100 pounds. But, I let that one go knowing how the crowd can get late at night here. After ordering my pizza, I added went to add some seasoning. This bouncer starts yelling at me to "move it along." Mind you, nobody was behind me trying to get out of the way. If he wanted me to move, he could have asked me nicely to step to the side. When I told him to calm down, I'm trying to get some chili flakes on the $5 pizza I just bought, he proceeds to continue to yell to get out of the way and move it along. I don't understand why you have this guy working your door. He's on some extreme power trip working the door to a pizza place and I am writing you so that you speak to him. Like I said, I used to come at least twice a month and am always bring new people here. I don't think I'll be coming back for a while unless the owners get rid of this guy....FYI you don't need someone like this working here, there are plenty of people who need jobs that know how to talk to customers. I get the crowd can get unruly but it wasn't, if you have cameras, I suggest you check them for how all your customers were treated on Saturday night. It's honestly a shame and have already told 8 of my friends not to come here anymore.
