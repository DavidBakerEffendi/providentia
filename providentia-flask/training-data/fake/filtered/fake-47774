This is hands down my favorite pizza in New York. The line is long, but if you are only two people you can usually skip half the line when they come out asking for 'twos'. Last time I was there we sat next to a couple who they pulled off the street in order to fill the table (they were just walking by). Rergardless of the wait, it's totally worth it when you are rewarded with piping hot pizza that basically melts in your mouth. Very good crust and tomato sauce.
