Is it bad that i could eat this literally every day? And can actually afford to? Â The price is right, the taste is right. The ambiance (which isn't much) should be embraced as part of the experience. I always go for the pork boiled dumplings and the egg sanwich. My favorite used to be the pork pancake (basically a dumpling on steroids) but it is no longer on the menu. And don't worry, the line moves quickly enough. This location is much better than the east village one by the way....
