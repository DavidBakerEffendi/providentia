Great food, great atmosphere (although quiet it is not) and excellent service. A party of four for dinner, we enjoyed a variety of drinks, appetizers and entrees and a couple of amazing deserts - the "Cookies and Milk" was a great treat. Overall I liked the simple menu items that were well prepared and well portioned.
