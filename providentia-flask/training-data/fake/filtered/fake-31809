I had been to the Ivy a few times before, but after last night, I will never give them my business again.  While waiting in a line to get in (the night before Thanksgiving, I'm sure, is the only time there's a line to get in there), the bouncers yelled out to the crowd, "if you've got boobs and butts you can get in!"  I would have disregarded their unprofessional behavior if it hadn't been for what happened next.  A patron inside was singled out for being gay and was thrown out by the manager, with disparaging comments. I'll pay the extra dollar for a draft beer down the street.  I am absolutely disgusted with this establishment.
