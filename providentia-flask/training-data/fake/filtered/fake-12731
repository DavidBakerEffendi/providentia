I compare all other Italian restaurants in NYC to Lupa.  And I always go back to Lupa as my absolute favorite.  The Bucatini all'Amatriciana is the best outside of Rome.  Rezzies are hard to come by, so call two weeks in advance or go last minute  & have a glass or two of wine at the bar while you wait.  It's worth the wait!!   And if they have Osso Bucco or brussel sprouts sprouts on the menu that day, order them!
