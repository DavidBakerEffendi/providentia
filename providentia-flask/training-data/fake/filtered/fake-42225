The wait is ridiculously long - but it's worth it. For appetizers, go Cucumber and Veggie Buns. I know you're thinking, "Why would I choose veggie over pork?" I thought the same thing, but a friend advised me otherwise and I was proven wrong. It's a little slice of fried eggplant heaven with this delicious sweet sauce. Â For Ramen, I go Akamaru Modern (the standard) - but the miso ramen is also awesome.
