I've been here twice and had a great experience both times - once on a Saturday for lunch, and another time on a weeknight for dinner. We didn't have to wait for a table either time. The service is excellent, the pizza is incredible. On our most recent visit, per the waiter's recommendation, we ordered the Autunno, which had the tastiest smoked mozzarella! And as always, we got a Margherita (we order that everywhere we go, to properly taste test pizza places against one another). Sottocasa is the best pizza in DoBro.
