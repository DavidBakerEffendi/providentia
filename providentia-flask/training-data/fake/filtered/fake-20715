The food here is good, but the service is incredibly rude! Since we were on vacation and found this restaurant with good review just 2 hours before the dinner time, we didn't make a reservation before going there. And one of the girls there literally said "no reservation? you can sit here if you can get out of here by 7pm" She didn't even look at us when speaking of those words. I really wanted to leave, but it's cold and dark outside and I just want to have a dinner and leave, so we sat down at a table just beside the door, which is very cold by the way. So I took it since we didn't make a reservation, but what I can't understand is after a while, a woman came in without a reservation, nobody shouted at her like the rude girl shouted at us, and she sat there for at least 30 minutes just reading books without ordering anything. I totally can't understand the point. Horrible service for me.
