Made a large mistake thinking I could just go in a grab something quick for lunch. The place is sooo overwhelming. There are so many stations with different types of food. I was in a rush to get back to the office, so I didnt have the time to figure out the processes for getting and paying for food. If you have been there a few times, then maybe you can get something quick. The place was just packed with people. I looked like a deer in headlights walking around so I got some stares that clearly said "really... you have not been to Eataly before? Stupid tourist." I have lived in NYC for a year now and I have a little more patience than some new yorkers, but I really could not deal with Eataly.
