Cucina Romana has rich bold flavors with few ingredients.  Amis tries to do Cucina Romana but left me a little disappointed especially with the pastas.  Two of the three pastas we tasted felt like an American remake.  They were sweeter than Roman cooking and had none of the rich flavors of peccorino and pancetta that I've come to expect from the cuisine.  I've lived in Rome for five years and they didn't quite get the taste.  Melograno is closer to Roman flavors with simple complex dishes.   That said,  the gnocchi with oxtail ragu were delicious;  it was closer to the richer deeper flavors I've tasted in Rome.  My partner's steak was perfect!  It melted in your mouth.  My lamb was only so-so.  There was too much salt and parts were overcooked.   We had polenta pear pudding for dessert.  The flavor and texture were nicely balanced and made me wanting more.  Add just a little more whipped cream (only another teaspoon) and it wouldn't have been to die for. If you share pastas at dinner.  Be advised that 2 pastas are sufficient.  We ordered three and began to get full on "il primo." The atmosphere was phenomenal. There was a happy buzz of conversation in the background that was loud but felt right.  Service, always a problem with opening restaurants, was unusually strong.  Staff were friendly and helpful.  I'd definitely go again. I just hope they adjust their sauces some.
