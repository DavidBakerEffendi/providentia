I went with a group of 10 co-workers for dinner and a show.  We had a 5:30 reservation which should have given us plenty of time for dinner before the 7:30 show.  Our waiter brought our drinks to the table 2 at a time (not very efficient) and we did not get served our dinner until 7:00!  Some of us were able to get our drinks refreshed, but not all of us.  Dessert was served but we were not asked if we would like coffee or tea.  Needless to say, by the time we got the check and settled our affairs, it was already 7:30 and we had to wait outside the theatre doors until 7:45 to get in. I know others who have been there for lunch and had a pleasant experience so I am only speaking for myself and the others I was with that night. Very disappointed ...
