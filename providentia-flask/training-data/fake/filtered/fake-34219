A bit pricier than I was hoping for, but all in a wonderful place to hit up for a yummy dinner.  My friends and I searched around and decided on Yasuda last minute.  The food was delicious, prepared in a really timely fashion and incredibly fresh.  A good meal with good company.  I'll be back next time I'm craving sushi!
