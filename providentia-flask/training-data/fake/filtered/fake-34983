We had high hopes for the new restaurant in princeton -- if there's any town that needs more restaurants, its this one. The decor at agricola was fine. The food was just OK esp. for these prices. The arctic char entree is teeny tiny and despite ordering appetizer, entree & dessert, we were still a bit hungry at the end of it. Service was very slow and we didn't like our waiter's attitude -- inattentive and rather argumentative, if you can believe it! I don't think we'll be going here again. Sigh!
