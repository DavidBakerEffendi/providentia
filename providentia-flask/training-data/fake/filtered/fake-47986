My grandmother has just moved to Winooski and wanted to treat me and my BF to brunch. Unfortunately, the wait was long at our first choice, and Grandma was hungry! So, in the interest of saving time, we decided to try Our House because the wait was shorter. The staff was very helpful and the atmosphere was good-- we particularly enjoyed the collection of vintage lunchboxes. Service was swift and the mimosas were tasty. Unfortunately, the food was a bit more disappointing. I inquired about the "twisted" eggs benedict, which features fried, poached eggs (?!) and was informed that it couldn't be ordered "un-fried" because it was prepared ahead of time. That should have been a warning! Still, my BF ordered it and was very disappointed to find that, as you might guess, due to the double-process, the eggs were totally overcooked. They resembled fried, hard-boiled eggs, not poached. Additionally, the hollandaise sauce was not of the silky, rich kind but more of the thick and squirt-able kind, applied in squiggles over the top of the dish. Ew. All-in-all, don't order this if you're looking for a typical runny egg and sauce benedict experience. My omelet was satisfactory, but the tomatoes I had asked for weren't in it and I was confused by the application of the other additions. I ordered an omelet with two kinds of cheese, caramelized onions, tomatoes, and ham. The omelet was delicious, but the onions were plopped on top and a big slice of pan-fried ham was stuck inside the omelet. It didn't detract from the tastiness of the dish, but it was a strange kind of DIY presentation that I didn't expect. I might try this place again, but given that there are lots of other, potentially better brunch options in Winooski/Burlington, it wouldn't be my first choice.
