I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for the owner!!  I went to eat lunch with 3 others a couple of weeks ago and because of the light snow that day not many people showed up for lunch.   The food was excellent, our server was very informative and was able to give our party pointers on what would suit us best.   Towards the end we unfortunately got to know the owner.  Instead of making small talk and asking us how our lunch was, he imposed on us very awkward questions.  He even lamented how on this site his rating went below a 4, and if we could help him out on that.   Please read other people's comments below, many others have had issues with him.  Do yourself a favor and only go if he's not in!   Manhattan may not have many other options but take the advice of others and head out to Jersey City or Queens.
