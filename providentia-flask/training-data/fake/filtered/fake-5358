From: Shaden a student worker from the women's center @ southern Connecticut state university. I had the great pleasure of having Mama Mary Soul Food cater our sistah Hood luncheon and it was a pleasure having them do so. The service was great they were very attentive to us, they met every needs that we asked of them, Great and Huge thank you personally from me to Sabrina. It was a pleasure! THE FOOD OMG, lets not even go there it was AMAZING AAAAMAZING... the banana pudding, and yams was delicious. the chicken wings was fried all the way through that was great to see because a lot of people cannot accomplish that with fry chicken! i have to say, so thank you so much for the service that was provided, for our SISTAH HOOD LUNCHEON!
