Excited to have Burrito Box so close after living near Fordham for 3 years, moving away and returning to the hood after a 3 year absence. Â Burritos are excellent and filling, reasonably-priced and I don't mind waiting at lunchtime because they have excellent salsa and chips that you're free to help yourself to while you're waiting.
