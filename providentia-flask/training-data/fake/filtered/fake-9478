Service and food was okay.  Thought it was a bit weird when they served a whole apple and banana instead of slicing them up.   Was satisfied with the portions and the taste was good.  After we left,  I noticed that I must have sat on some chocolate or balsamic vinegar  because I had spots all over my white pants.  It was all down my right leg.  Needless to say I was not happy!  This establishment is trendy and comfortable but they really need to educate their staff on how to clean their tables.
