Some friends and I went here for what we thought would be a causal dinner on Friday night.  After waiting triple the time they originally said for a table, we were finally seat.  Took the waiter about 10 minutes to even come over to offer water.  After we ordered they brought our appetizers out after 20 minutes and kept asking if we wanted more drinks.  It took OVER AN HOUR for food to come.  We were very polite to both our waiter and the manager when we asked how much longer because at this point we had waited almost two hours just to eat.  They never once apologized for the delay.  They just said it's coming and that they were busy.  Well, if they were so busy then why did two parties who were seated at the same time as us (bigger parties may I add) finish and pay for their meals before we even got our entrees?  When we finally did get our entrees, mine was cold and they charred burnt my friend's pasta.  It was literally BLACK.  We then called for the manager again and he said that is how the pasta is supposed to be...completely insane.  So she sent it back and then we waited 20 more minutes for her food.  FINALLY, we had our food (overall it wasn't good at all...stale bread, penne was cold).   When the waiter gave us the check he literally threw it on our table and walked away.  We asked for the manager and just said how unhappy the entire experience had been and made it quite clear in a polite way that the restaurant really should do something about our meal.  He was RUDE and AWFUL.  He just kept saying "Well what do you want me to do?"  Any respectable restaurant would have comped our entire meal due to the horrific experience with everything.  The manager didn't even say he was sorry for the waits and mess-ups.  He then said he would take of our drinks which was a  crap move then just kept being so incredibly rude during the entire process.  No one should ever go here again.  Food was awful...service was terrible....BOYCOTT THIS PLACE!!!
