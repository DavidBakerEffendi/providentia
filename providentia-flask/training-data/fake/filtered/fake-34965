EXCELLENT........! great restaurant and great food in the pleasant environment.i really like it. i still love and respect restaurant mon berger. therefore i am giving 5 stars. i  have been eaten foods form other five stars restaurant. but this five stars restaurant super excellent in food. last weeked i visit this restaurant. i ordered a berger. in only 5 min  my berger was prepared. i feel much hungry. instant, i start to eat the berger. in 5 min i finished the berger. berger was very taste, hot and spicy. natural and artificial flavors also contributes to make more taste. the staff friendly and attractive.they were all nice, good looking and honest.
