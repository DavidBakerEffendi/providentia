We have been going here for years and the food is always good...The owner is from Italy and really takes pride in his food and the ingredients he uses in his dishes. Â It is true that there are many people who eat here several times per week..It is comfortable and clean.......My husband is also Italian(from Italy) and he loves that we have this incredible Trattoria so close to home.
