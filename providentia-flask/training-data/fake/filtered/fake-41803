I've heard good things about Santucci's so on a busy work day, my co workers & I decided to give it a try. We called & ordered a large pizza, half red, half white & we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. We work in a busy Hair Salon & we all eat lunch whenever we have a free moment so a 45 minute wait was workable for all of us. I can't explain how surprised we were that our pizza arrived 2 and a half hours later after 1 follow up call at the 1 and a half hour point & reassurance that it was on it's way. At that point they could have delivered the best pizza ever created and it would leave a bitter taste in my mouth. What was most disappointing is that we received no apologies & no explanations. We won't be giving them another try.
