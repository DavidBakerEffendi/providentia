Indeed - the falafel is probably the best in Manhattan (and best high-end in the city; there are other contenders, all in lower price ranges, but whatever). Never dry. Never bland. But! I joined yelp to spread the word about the Sabich. Once upon a time, I was one of those freaks who hated eggplant, creamy sauces, and hard-cooked egg. Now that I have had a Sabich, I don't even know that person anymore. Sabich. Sabich! Of course I would appreciate it if they took cards, and had shorter wait times. But a line out the door, while annoying, is usually indicative of greatness. As it is here. Oh, and not that this information should be relegated to afterthought status, but their pitas are SO fresh, floury, and delicious.
