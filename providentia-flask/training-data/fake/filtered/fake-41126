A friend suggested to check out Totto and so I did with my grown up foodies children. First attempt was during lunch time and we got there 20 minutes before they open and wrote my name for 4 unfortunately we lost our seating since the other 2 were still on their way to the restaurant so we ended up leaving and ate at Room Service ( few blocks away). Since I am curious about their ramen, we returned for dinner and made sure we were all there waiting for table for 4. While waiting for our table (waited for about 40 minutes) I approached the hostess and she was so busy that she did not have time to even allow me to ask question and did not bother to come back for my question. Finally after 40+minutes waiting, we got our table for 4 and very excited to sit and experience their ramen. My daughter asked the server if there is an outlet for a phone charger and if she can charge her phone (low bat in new york is a big No no especially for tourists) and the server told my daughter "NO" so we continued to place our order. Since we are from San Francisco we know good ramen and Totto fell short from our expectations. My daughter's poached egg was cold inside and the server could not explain the difference between the seasoned egg and poached egg when we were placing our orders. Overall the employees do not know good customer service and yet they demand 20 percent tip/gratuity even for the worst customer service experience which I normally give gladly if not more but this time I walked away giving 5-6 percent only (very generous for really bad service). The owner/management should send their employees on learning Â how to give good service training and lose their "we are the only game in town" attitude!!!!!!!!!! I will not recommend this place to any family or friends visiting from the Bay Area.
