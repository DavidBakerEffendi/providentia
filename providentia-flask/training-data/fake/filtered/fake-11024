My girlfriends and I wanted in line for over an hour to get a table (on a Wednesda night!), but it was definitely worth it!  After my foray into sake at Kyotofu, I was super psyched to try more savory-sake pairings.  Here are my take-aways: - Tsukune meatballs - YUMMMM!!  It's a special house recipe.  We paired these with a dry sake (Otokoyama). - Tongue - sliced thinly, grilled to perfection.  WOW.  We paired this and some other grilled beef with a nama sake. - A gyoza special - we paired this with beer. :)  Perfection. Service was so-so, but who cares!  The food more than makes up for it.  I want to go back to taste the roasted chicken bones - they were sold out on the night we went.  Wait on that line - you won't be disappointed!
