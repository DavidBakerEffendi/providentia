They really make amazing shawarma... I always wanted to try shawarma, because it greatly reminds me of the Turkish kebab, and the Greek gyros pitta. I traveled to this place, so eager to taste the shawarma. The meat was really amazing, and they make their food with care, you can tell by the taste and the very look of the food. It smells and tastes godly. Everything is so fresh, and you can simply feel the authentic taste. I really liked it. If you have any doubts about this place, please just go there and try it for yourself, experience divinity !
