As a panamanian, I am thrilled that Kelso Bar and Restaurant is open.  It would have been a misfortune if one of the few Panamanian institutions left in Brooklyn would have closed for good.  Now under new management, the place looks modern. The food is the same - goodness. I am proud to bring friends and family to dine there.
