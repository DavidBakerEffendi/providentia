So my wife and I had a Groupon for this place and we've been meaning to get out there but it's hard with a baby and all...  We finally got a sitter yesterday and made time to go up there, double checked their hours on their website (which as of today 6/13/11 are still not updated) and drove 25 min up there just to find them CLOSED in contradiction to their site. So I called today and spoke to the general manager at Hot Tomato's to ask if they'd just extend it a bit to make up for their misleading information and they said they will not honor it past it's expiration date and won't give us anything in lieu of it.  i told him "This is a matter of $10.  I drove up there based on false info on your website (which he said they're in the process of updating) all the way to Hartford, got a sitter and everything and you're willing to lose a new customer over $10?  You already got your portion of my money." He said we've had time to use it and when i said "you're willing to lose a new customer over $10?...etc." he laughed and said "yeah i guess so".  SCREW YOU BUDDY.  RIDICULOUS! After all this I called Groupon and they gave me a credit back!  Groupon WIN.  Hot Tomato's FAIL!
