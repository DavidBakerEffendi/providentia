Woohoo! As Â good as it gets! says it just right...when I first heard Mexican/French cuisine I had to think about what that would taste like, one bite and you are convinced this combination is mouthwatering. The menu has a glossary so you aren't left dumbfounded and miss out on some great dish because you had no idea what was in it. I've been there twice since it opened and each time I ate with friends/family who have completely different taste than me and we all left more than satisfied. The menu has a great variety.What to try? The tacos are delicious, not your standard taco, tastier with just the right amount of spices. I don't usually eat lamb but I tasted the lamb sausage tacos and they are delish. Of course the guacamole is fresh and perfect. The cheese plate gives you a taste of a variety of cheeses with different sharpness, definitely for the cheese lover. Love that they have cippolini onions on the menu.Lobster burger so tasty and good..jalapeno, mozzarella..need i say more?!My favorite was the raviole which is whole new take on your usual ravioli..it has just the right kick with jalapenos and cilantro. If you like plantains, the puree is simple and good like menu says with a glass of red or sangria mmmm mmmm!!! And finallyyy the creme brulee trio which you must leave room for and a hot cappucino with just the right amount of foam.
