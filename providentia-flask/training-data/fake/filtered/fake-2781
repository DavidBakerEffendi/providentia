I was just informed that my family attempted to go to this establishment earlier this evening, My cousin was just recently confined to a wheelchair and they were all going out to dinner, and chose Cuban Pete's. They were pushed around the restaurant numerous times, obviously they couldn't find a place to accommodate the wheelchair and it seems they didn't try too hard. The server then informed my family that she called the manager Dominic Restaino and he told her to tell my family TO LEAVE?!?!?!?! :After being pushed around an out of control room in this restaurant that is obviously poorly run, waiting almost an hour to have their order taken THEN they are told to leave by the owner/manager? THIS is how they treat handicapped people?? I say it's discrimination at its worst and we will be sure to spread the word everywhere that this is the way they treat their customers. We will never visit this place again, and will do our best to spread the word so others can follow suit. It's absolutely unacceptable the way the server and the owner treated our family. I would think others wouldn't approve either, if they were in our shoes. Shame on you!!! Just because you're busy doesn't give you the right to treat people like dirt. If I could give a NEGATIVE star rating, believe me I would. Shame shame shame!!!
