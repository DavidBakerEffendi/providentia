I was pleasantly surprised. Decor is nice. We went during Valentine's and the place was pretty packed. Didn't do hibachi - got seated in the table area instead. Miso Salmon and the Chicken Terriyaki were good choices. Service was a bit slow due to the amount of customers. They also ran out of certain desserts. But other than that, the food was well prepared.
