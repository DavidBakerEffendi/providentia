I came to this restaurant with high expectations only to be let down when the server delivered my steak to the wrong patron who cut his steak up into slices. She then tried to give me his steak which was already cut. I asked for a new steak and waited 20 minutes only to watch my party of nine eat theirs. At that point I took it to go. Lucky me was offered a free desert. Never mind that my dining experience was lousy I don't usually complain and this restaurant is usually really good. But at this point it should have been discounted or something .
