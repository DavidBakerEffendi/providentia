I don't see what the big deal is since when I'd gone there I was almost ignored for most of the night. I'd ordered their corned beef and cabbage, and damn if that cabbage was as solid as a rock!!! I don't know, but it was my firs time trying it, but it was super salty. I'm not irish so I wanted to try it. I hope that's not authentic, because if so it didn't bode well with me. I've been there other times and I swear I'll be waiting for the bartender for almost ten minutes before he tends to me. The atmosphere is cool, but go outside and you'll be greeted by panhandlers who literally ask you for money while you're trying to enjoy a beer on their patio. The neighborhood is questionable, which is weird because you cross the street(Farmington Avenue) towards the north, and it's like night and day, lol....anyways, it's an OK pub, but I wouldn't rave about it.
