I was here a few weeks ago. I got a pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe to go. The place only has seating for maybe eight ppl, so it's more of a take out place. ( Guess thats why its caled pepe rosso to go lol)The food was cooked pretty good, but was a small portion Â for the price. But it was quick and fresh
