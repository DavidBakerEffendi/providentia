My husband I stopped by this restaurant after spending a day at the spa.  What a perfect end to what started out as a great day together.   There was no shortage on anything at this restaurant.   Our server, Tabs, recommended a cocktail for my husband and he loved it. Our appetizer, Asian Wings, were perfect. Our entree's were absolutely out of this world.  My husband order the Red Velvet Waffles and Fried Chicken.  All he could say was "WOW, WOW".  Of course, I had to taste a forkful and I was speechless. I ordered the Lobster and Shrimp with Grits.  Oh my goodness!!!!!  These were two (2) of the best meals I have had outside of my house in a LONG time. We had to meet the chef and shake the hand that prepared such a delicious meal. My husband ordered the Peach Cobbler and Tabs was able to find Peaches and Creme Ice Cream, to make it all complete. I have to thank every person that attened to our every need while we were at SoCo. The music was great as well.  Thanks to the DJ. Can not  wait to go back.  Brunch on Sunday.
