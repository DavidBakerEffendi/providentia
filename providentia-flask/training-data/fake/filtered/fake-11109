I stopped in to get a bagel sandwich as a treat for my husband and I to share for lunch. This was no treat! The Cajun chicken sandwich, one of their special sandwiches, consisted of a frozen, breaded chicken patty, microwaved, and then put on a bagel with some really odd sauce. I wouldn't even let my dog finish what I was throwing out. Will not be back.
