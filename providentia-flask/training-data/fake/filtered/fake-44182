I just ate lunch here with my 6 year old son who has a nut allergy I clearly stated to the waiter 3 times about this !!!! YET HE STILL  Tried to serve my son a dish with nuts in it we asked for the penne with out the pine nuts and here comes the entree with these pine nuts all over the top of the plate before my son eats this and gets sick I say HEY this was supposed to be with out the nuts remember ??? Our waiter looks confused and takes the platter back into the kitchen  now we already been waiting for this initially for over a half hour to come out  so he takes the plate in the kitchen and then comes right back out with the same plate he originally brought out. He just took the nuts off and brought the same plate I was stunned. I said my son needs a whole new plate because the pasta already been cooked/ came into contact with the nuts and there were still a few nuts remaining in the actual  dish !! Being that he is allergic he can not eat anything with nuts if its been cooked in or around other food etc,,, you would think the waiter or the kitchen would be aware of this for health reasons etc..  Not one manager came up to the table to speak with me when I demanded to see the manager I am very displeased with Stella Rossa !
