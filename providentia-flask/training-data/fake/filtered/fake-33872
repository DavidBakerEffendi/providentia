Got hooked onto this place a few years back & now Im a regular. The food is outstanding & reasonably priced. All of the soups are homemade & are outstanding also especially the Pea Soup. The hamburgers are made fresh Â not hockey puck frozen patties & the onion rings are to die for. If you want something thats not on the menu & John has the ingredients he will make it for you. One of the best places I've been to for a long time
