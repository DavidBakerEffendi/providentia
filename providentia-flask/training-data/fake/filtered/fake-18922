Mixed feelings. I don't like to give bad reviews but my friends and I are angry.  We have been waiting 4 hours for our pizza.  Not cool, Artichoke Pizza, not cool.  We've called every hour and they keep saying it will be here in 15 minutes. We live SUPER close.  Yes, we could have just picked it up, but no one wanted to leave the party.  HUNGRY. Okay so they reimbursed us and hooked us up with a free bottle of wine and free pizza.  They are a-ok in my book now.  But still we had wait 4 hours.
