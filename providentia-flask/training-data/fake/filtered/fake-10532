this place used to be good. now, expect to wait around for a good 20 minutes before a server can even take your drink order. its a great atmosphere, especially when they open the outdoor patio. but the service just got horrendousfood was delicious, now its mediocre. no one wants to wait around for an hour to eat a burger, and that is exactly what your going to get at opcao.
