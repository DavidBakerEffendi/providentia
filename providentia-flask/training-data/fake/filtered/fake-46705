One of the best deals for a great, tasty meal on the UES that I've found.  As Turkish restaurants go, it is far and away my favorite in this part of the city. The swordfish kebabs were an amazing deal !  The Mezze Platter is a must try.  Great outdoor seating in the warm months.  A great place for locals, and worth the trip from another part of Manhattan (even for notoriously lazy Manhattanites!) .
