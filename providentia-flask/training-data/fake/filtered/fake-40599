Came here with my friends yesterday. At first I was very impressed, the interior was very nice and it smelled amazing in there. However my good impression was quickly demolished by the terrible service we received. We were served by a waitress with dyed blonde hair with brown roots growing out and bad eyebrows. She had such an attitude while she took our order (she looked like she really hates her job) and would walk by every 3 minutes to keep an eye on us even though we weren't doing anything. It happened to be my friends 17th birthday and we had a cake on our table and she came and told us to "keep it on the down low" but with her tone and facial expression you could clearly see she was telling us to put it away. Afterwards the man serving us water(who was very kind) offered to put the cake on a plate for us and although we declined he insisted. This lead to an argument between him and the waitress in the back where they even had to consult their manager in a different room. He came back with the cake and apologized for not being able to put our cake out and wished my friend happy birthday once more. Before we were finished with our pizza the waitress swung by again and gave us our check, which clearly meant she was trying to get us out as soon as possible. Don't get me wrong the pizza was really delicious but I think the next time I'm craving pizza I'de rather call up Dominos.
