Worst food I ever had in my life, I dnt Know how u can call it Latin food I Order food last night, black beans Were uncooked and I Mean completely raw I couldn't even Bite through them, steak way over Cooked, bacalaitos had just awful pieces of onions and peppers, And the chicken soup let's not even talk about it I spend $70.00 on The worst dinner ever. If thats the way u guys cook ur Kitchen should be close down Just stay as a lounge Way over price and awful I will Not recommend it to anyone.
