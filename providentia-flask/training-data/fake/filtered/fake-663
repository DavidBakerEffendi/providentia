I was in the old neighborhood today and stopped by the Old Canal inn for lunch.  Haven't been there sind the new owners took over, the place has certainly changed, really looks nice.  The bartender talked me into having the death burger, it's a beer batter deep fried burger topped with mashed potatoes with jalapeno peppers and nacho cheddar.  It was delicious and I'm stuffed.
