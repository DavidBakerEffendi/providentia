This place is perfect for when you just want to eat a large breakfast for a cheap price.  The food is cooked in front of you as people come in and out.  We came with a group of 3 and sat at the counter.  I had the Blueberry pancakes with a side of sausage and it is true, they are AMAZING!!!!  My friends had the farmer's omelet and the breakfast burrito.  Both looked equally as good as my pancakes!  It is a really neat spot with a lot of regulars.  Def give it a whirl if you are in the city!
