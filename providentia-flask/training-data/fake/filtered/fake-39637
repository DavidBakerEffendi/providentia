Hello all, I've been looking at yelp reviews for a while now, and have found some amazing food based on them. Here is my first review. SriPraPhai is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in NY! They have great food! Some highlights: * Coconut rice (you have to try this; it is soo delicious!) * Soft shell crab (with green curry and pineapple) * Red curry (add pineapple, and eat with coconut rice) * Roasted duck salad (it's very spicy though, even though I asked for mild, but it was delicious) * Saut√©ed chicken with cashews, pineapple, and roasted chili. Their menu is very long and may have to be studied in advance :) Great to have such a big selection to choose from. The restaurant is usually crowded, but the waiting time hasn't been long when we've been there. However, when I stopped by for take-out one time in the evening, it was very very crowded and it looked like the waiting time was longer. Either way, the food is awesome and worth waiting for. Just keep in mind that they are closed on Wednesdays. Also, the servers are nice, and there is outside seating. I definitely recommend this place!
