Wow. I can't get enough. Been here a goodly amount of times for all sorts of seasonal tasty bits (and I mean that literally since the menu ranges from brawn to broad beans). All the gastro-essentials of my life - pork, cheese, eggs and seasonal vedge - are dealt out with ace skills here. Exciting cocktails (w/ homemade concoctions like sweet potato shrub) and a fun regionally-centric beer list make this place a keeper. Always reliable and surprisingly affordable brunch too.
