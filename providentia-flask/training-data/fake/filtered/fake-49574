The New York food scene has always been a little bit about pilgrimage and vision.  And while Glasserie might be somewhat off the beaten path it's worth the trip to this emerging Brooklyn neighborhood. Reminder, it was not so long ago that DUMBO and Williamsburg were considered out of the way. Now on to Glasserie....Flew in from LA and went for dinner on a Friday night. The place was packed, the atmosphere a lovely blend of candle lit chic industrial, the soundtrack wonderful hip and moody.  The service was good, servers and bussers mostly attentive. The food was delicious! Cocktails even better. I prefer small plates intended to be shared; it's the best way to taste the range of the menu. Definitely order the flat bread, labneh, tahini, and the cauliflower dishes. I'm not a lover of lamb but the lamb croquettes are a MUST HAVE. All in all LOVE this place.
