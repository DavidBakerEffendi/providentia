Oh you ravishing, alluring spy, how your kitchen creations make love to my mouth. The first point scored here was the name, which despite being an apple varietal makes one helpless not to feel a little bit Bond-like despite the crunchy hipster environs of the East Village. Second, the atmosphere. The rustic c-shaped nook where we were seated seemed like our private portal through time and space to a creaking farmhouse, with the farmer's bubbly daughter taking our order and a wife in the kitchen who clearly must have spent Rumspringa in Hyde Park at CIA to create such flavor profiles for her food.  And the home run, of course, the food. Truth is, I could honestly have Northern Spy's sweet onion and beer bisque for every meal of the day plus dessert, and still order another to take home for the next day. The pickled eggs were also magic: a subtle zest of sweet beet-like nuance that's just enough to bathe out the astringency of the egg without being overwhelming or in the least bit vinegary.  My fave East Village spot to satiate my epicuriosity and by far one of the absolute best spots in the city--can't wait to return to try the brunch.
