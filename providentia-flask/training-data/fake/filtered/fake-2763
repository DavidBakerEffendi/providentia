I walked inside Cuban Pete's with high expectations tonight being the fact that the food did smell good and my family and I were celebrating three birthdays. But high expectations turned into a nightmare We came in at 7:40 to reserve our our table of 12 and they told us the wait would be 2 1/2 hours. The more we waited the more people who came with us began to leave because of the wait. We ended up waiting for 4 hours and on top of that half of our party left because they had work in the morning. The manager, Dominick, had a repulsive attitude and was very rude. He showed no interest in what my family had to say about the long wait or that people who came after us were being called before us. We ended up being the last party being called. A shameful restaurant to be served in. I, myself ended up leaving cause I couldn't stand to eat in a restaurant where the employees work ethic was horrible towards their customers and the manager and employees could care less on their customers thoughts. Whenever we spoke about how long we waited, Big Headed Dominick would act like he didn't hear a word you said, which made me wanna slap the fat off his neck. NEVER will I  EVER  step foot in THAT place again. Left in anger and hunger. Wouldn't spend a dime of my money in that shit hole of a wannabe Cuban Restaurant. Fuck Cuban Pete's.
