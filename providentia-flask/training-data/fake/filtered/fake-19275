Sooooo good! Â I went last night w 2 others. Everything I tried was delicious including fried clams, veal pappardelle, shrimp ceviche, pork chop served with farro and panacotta with figs for desert. The service was great and staff was very friendly. Great setup and the place gives off a very warm welcoming feeling. There is a full bar with tv so it's a good place to come and hang with friends. I have NOTHING negative to say about Mayfield. Everybody should stop in for a bite!!!!! Please ignore the comments about a long wait. There was no wait last night. Those people were probably there during the hurricane n r just complaining.
