I live right on the corner, and ever since they changed "owners", the Sicilian Pizza has gone downhill. I'm not a big fan of covering the cheese with the sauce anyways, but the cheese is melted, but not "stringy". Not what I've eaten here before. They need to bring back whoever was running this place. The thing is, its always PACKED!! and your lucky to find a table, or be here for less than an hour.
