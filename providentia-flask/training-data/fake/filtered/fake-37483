All of the dishes were prepared well and lived up to expectations. But the reason I will be returning was the tremendous service. When we arrived, my friend and I were looking forward to a specific dish, and upon being told that they were out of the dish, the waiter noticed our severe disappoint. Much to our delight, 5 minutes later he returned with the dish and said they managed to scrap together one last plate of it, and served it to us free of charge. That's how you run a restaurant.
