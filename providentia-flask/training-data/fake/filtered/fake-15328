Last year I gave this place three stars. But that's because they've always had the worst service ever. Seriously. But I still went. Because of the pizza. That's the only reason. And because I live 5 blocks away. So, I won't go on about the previous horrendous experiences I've had here with service. Roberta's has stepped up their game. I'm really so impressed. I don't know what happened but I am really happy because now I always have a good experience. Now I go there or order delivery almost once a week. fyi: come any night and expect to wait. I never really mind because they over-quote you anyway and I like to hang out in the back and have a drink. You can order appetizers out there if you like, as well. If you come with more than 6 people you may have to split up. But it's still worth it.
