My friends and I went here to try out Joe's Shanghai.  We had to try out the soup dumplings and we just ordered a side of fried rice.  I've had Dinh Tai Fung's soup dumplings in Arcadia, Ca and I must say, Joe's Shanghai is pretty descent.  Nothing beats Dinh Tai Fung (since they have a VARIETY of soup dumplings), but Joe's is pretty close.  Unfortunately they only have Pork Dumplings so vegetarians or pescatarians be informed.  For the price, its reasonable.  8 dumplings for 4.25 ~ 0.50 cents each.  Try it out, I am sure you will like it! Couple of things to know on how to eat the soup dumpling. 1.  Place soup dumpling on spoon. 2.  Use chopsticks and puncture one whole allowing soup to seep out a little. 3.  Place sauce on top.  (IF you want the sauce to be a bit spicier, mix the chili in, helps enhance your taste buds!) 4.  Devour in one bite to enjoy party in mouth!
