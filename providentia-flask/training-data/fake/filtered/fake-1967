Brooklyn Crab Seating- Seating was very prompt I came in on Monday night around 8pm and was sat no more then 5 minutes later decor - I loved the total layout and decor the fact that it is on stilts is sheer genius I love the view and the sunset was just out of this world the view of the water is stunning. The view of the statue was out of this world .. Service- From the two hosts I truly felt like I was welcomed I was greeted by a warm face named Dilan and then promptly told to head up stairs . My wife and I were sat very quickly by a young hostess. Server/service -our server Fred later to be known as Brooklyn Fred  told us with a smile welcome to Brooklyn Crab in a thick Brooklyn accent  ..he stated his name the specials and offered us a drink from the bar. Very normal more then I expected from the reviews I have read nothing like the horror I had read.  Our server took our appetizers and entree order. Again nothing like what I had read in other reviews. The food- My wife had a grilled lobster I had a oyster sandwich both perfectly done. I loved everything the food was great I wasn't so shocked by the prices but I can see where some would have an issue . Over all experience- The views are great the food good but for the wife and I was the service was out of this world. We will be back if not for nothing the service is the draw here. thanks Brooklyn Crab you have a real gem here.
