I'd never had Malaysian food before going to Banana Leaf.  Now I'm a huge fan.  The area may seem a bit sketchy, but Banana Leaf is nicely decorated, clean, and would fit right in around Rittenhouse. My whole table loved the Indian pancake appetizer with the dip - we were literally fighting each other to get the last couple bites.  We agreed we could have easily drank the sauce.  I remember the mango chicken was quite good (coming from someone who doesn't really like fruit-flavored meat, etc.) as well.  Overall, everyone loved their dish, and this was a group that included several first-timers (some of whom had never had Malaysian/Indian/etc food ever) and a guy who moved here from Malaysia three years ago and has sampled every type of cuisine imaginable.
