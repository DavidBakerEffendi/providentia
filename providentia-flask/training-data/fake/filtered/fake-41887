Our visit to the restaurant was a last minute decision on our way to see a show on broadway.  We were apprehensive initially about choosing the place somewhat randomly,  but very pleasantly surprised with the entire experience.  It was crowded and filled w/lots of pre-theatre diners so we were concerned about service when our waiter took a long time to take our order. However, once we placed our order, the food came quickly, was hot and really delicious.  The rigatoni focaccia was fabulous as was the chicken parm and the pasta e fagioli soup!   The bread basket was filled with warm, scrumptious bread that we devoured and the service was friendly and efficient like a well-oiled machine.  Even though it was clear that lots of patrons were in a hurry to get to their shows, the staff responded in an efficient manner that was still relaxed, professional and still achieved a welcoming atmosphere.  As one table of diners asked for their check halfway thru their dinner, the server said "finish your dinner, I promise the check will take 5 minutes, relax & enjoy".      We will definitely go back and highly recommend!
