Solid UPW spot, have been going here for years ever since they first opened on 79th. The food got to be too salty and we stopped going. Recently went back last night and everything was excellent. The price is right and the portions are good sizes, the tables are small and you feel like everything is from IKEA. Having said that place is a must try.
