Dig Inn is a happy friendly environment and I felt that as soon as I opened the door.  I was greated by Kay Kay, Jessica and Tiy. They make you feel special from the time you walk in the building. The food is a plus. I've never been in an establishment where everyone is so full of joy. I will be back tomorrow. I'm so glad Dig Inn came into Nomad.  With great food and service like that I wish you guys great success.
