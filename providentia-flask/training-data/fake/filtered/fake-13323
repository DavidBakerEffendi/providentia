I was driving and seen this little cute place so went around the block to park. First no parking had to park about a block away which is fine. I was walking up and two of the residents, so I thought were smoking in the back sidewalk, I had to go into the street as they wouldn't move..well I walked in like I said cute place but things all over the place, very disorganized. No salad bar ? ..I was on line waiting to order when I seen the woman that was outside smoking come in from a back door, still with papers in her hand and go directly to making sandwiches, so I am assuming she didn't wash her hands and was now making food... I ended up ordering a cake that was awful and a coffee. The coffee was the best part...
