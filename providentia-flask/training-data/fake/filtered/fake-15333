I love the food at Dudleys (chicken burger and fries + mayo are delicious), but was very disappointed by the service my boyfriend and I received today. The cook dinged a bell TWICE to let the waiters know that our food was ready (which my boyfriend and I heard both times it was rung on the other side of the restaurant) and neither one of the two waiters presents took any notice at all that our food had been sitting ready for us for over 5 minutes. It look one of the waiters heading towards the kitchen to do something else for him to finally pick up our food. Also, the portion size seems to be shrinking since the last time I was here. My chicken burger was very tasty, but compared to the last time I got it in April, it was well under half the size. Over all, I love the food and atmosphere, but am frustrated that the staff don't pay more attention to getting food to the table in a timely fashion.
