This place is DELICIOUS. I am vegetarian but strangely love sushi even though I never have too many options really - so I was ecstatic to hear about this spot. The rolls are delicious, innovative, healthy, complex, beautifully presented and flavorful. The spot is tiny but they play great hip hop music & has a fun energy to it. You leave feeling satisfied but light n healthy. Love it - highly recommended.
