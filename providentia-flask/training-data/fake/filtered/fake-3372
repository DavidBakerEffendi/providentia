We were a group of 12.  The hostess seated us at a table which really seated 8 comfortably.  When we asked to have another table added to accommodate us she got an attitude.  When we asked a question to one of the wait staff, she was rude.  As for food, with the exception of the chicken wings, food was mediocre.  We were told by the wait staff, their entrees are family style.  No way - we ordered 4 or 5 of the same dishes for our group.  Rice - $3 a small bowl - outrageous!  We ordered Pet Pha Lo (duck dish) - really where was the duck meat???????? The rating of 1 star  is only for the Chicken wings.  We all agreed we would not return.  Restaurant Manager - fire that Hostess!
