When I think of Marzullo's Restaurant I think of "Cappa di tutti" aka "THEN BEST." Perhaps it is because I am a wana be Italian and grew up thinking pasta was noodles with ketchup on it that I am so pro Marzullo.  Or maybe it is because all my friends, even the former Chief of the Montclair Police invited me with his family for a lovely dinner; or that when my good friend's wife passed away the repast was there for over 60 people; or that once upon a time when it expanded I rented a stretched white limousine to take eight of my friends there for lunch. I could go on and on. Better yet, when a friend was released from a nursing home all he wanted was some of Marzullo's "gravy/sauce" and pasta as his first meal. And you are remembered and welcomed not just by the great staff but by the owners as well. I went to an event at Notre Dame Church when Father Anthony Rendazzo was going on a sabatical; various caterers made the event memorable but the buzz was about the "wraps" and "who made them?"  Marzullo Caterers in Montclair.  I went in and told the owner about the plaudits and he said: "I got up at six o'clock that morning and made them myself."  Thank you.  NO, THANK YOU for KEEPING MONTCLAIR fed the best of the best.
