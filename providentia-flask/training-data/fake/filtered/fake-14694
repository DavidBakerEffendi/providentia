Great music, food and staff! We were instantly made to feel welcome by Nelson and Fred (our waiters). The music ran from old delta blues, to new wave, to rock, to 60's soul...and was the perfect volume. We ordered Bloody Mary's as we arrived 1/2 hour before dinner service which were ample, spicy and delicious. The staff was attentive but didn't hover, courteous, nice and knew the menu well. We perused the Brunch menu which was well rounded, reasonably priced, with something for everyone, but ordered off the dinner menu. I had the Duck Confit with Polenta and Asparagus with a side of Horseradish Mashed Potatoes and my wife had the Mussels, with a side of Mac N Cheese and Pommes Frites. The duck was tender, tasty, fell off the bone, was juicy, and paired well with the flavorful and delicious polenta. The mashed potatoes were very good with just the right hint of horseradish. The muscles were plenty and very delicious, as well as, the mac N cheese (some of the best we've ever had or tasted), and the pommes frites were double fried as they should be. We finished with the Creme Brûlée. It was perfectly hardened and glazed on top and the custard was perfect. Overall, the meal was well prepared, delicious and reasonably priced. The waiter told us that they had recently changed chefs and I can only assume it was for the better!!! I'm very happy to see a quality french bistro in Bushwick, which is seriously lacking in haute cuisine, or any food of this caliber. Mominette is a much needed and welcome addition to Bushwick, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys french bistro cuisine, a relaxed bistro atmosphere, great service and most importantly, reasonably priced and delicious food.
