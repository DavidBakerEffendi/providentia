Just discovered this place trying to find breakfast during my all nighter studying for exams. They open early, and when I entered they were happy to say good morning. Clean, Quick, Delicious, Affordable, Great Customer Service, and all around Best Breakfast Gem at Temple. -- They should get on GrubHub! Will certainly return again
