Been back twice since my original review and Dos Segundos is 3 for 3 and going strong. Update to my original rave on the calamari special: the pulpo a la parilla off the regular menu is even better! Believe it- the orange/lime garlic marinade has so many levels of flavor, finishing with a spicy note on the beautifully grilled octopus- you gotta try it to understand, it's mouth watering! My girlfriend is rapidly making her way through the vegetarian menu too and loving ALL of it- Most recently the heaping vegetarian chorizo frybread, which is like a giant pizza loaded with veggie sausage and jalapenos- two things she loves. Annnnnd I finally got that Peanut Butter Bombe, which I am hesitant to tell you how awesome it was, for fear of it selling out too quickly on my next visit. But it ruled!!  Imagine a bundt-cake shaped slice of whipped peanut butter heaven encased in chocolate. Then drool a little. Cantina dos Segundos is dope. Place was packed last time and nothing suffered, obviously word is getting around that it's a must visit (and repeat). Three diff. waiters so far and they were all awesome, our latest's t-shirt: "frankly scallop, I don't give a clam." I will continue to give mad clams to Dos Segundos.  Word up!
