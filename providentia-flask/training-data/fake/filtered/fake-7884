Now THIS is the restaurant that Big Mama built. "Southern style" food to me means food that tastes like my Big Mama made it. Many in Connecticut promise it -- few deliver. Sandra's Next Generation delivers. Somebody from Ms. Biscuit needs to come take notes. By the time you get seated at SNG, there are warm johnny cakes brought out to your table. The servers, young and older, are "honey/baby/sugar" types -- they let you know that you are right at home. No attitude, no gruff. They want you to sit back, relax and know that you're in good hands. And the desserts! There's an in-house baker who makes those enormous, purr-inducing cakes and pies you could get after church back-in-the-day. Exquisite! Our food was devoured in happy silence. The price point was so reasonable, I think we tipped 30% just on GP. SNG is a winner. Big Mama would be proud.
