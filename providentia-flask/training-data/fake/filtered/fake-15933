Oh my God, what a Gem!!! We discovered Piacere some night last year, after being out a little too late. We closed down the restaurant with all three owners, who double as waiter/bartender/pizzaiolo.  What a riot! We had so much fun with them and had the best pizza in Nolita (in NY??)! It melted in my mouth as I scarfed down every morsel; it was amazing.  Since then it'a our favorite neighborhood spot!  The atmosphere is fun and adorable with rustic Italian feel. The pulse is always a party and the pizza is INCREDIBLE! And better yet they deliver! I could not be happier to have Piacere in the neighborhood! It's such a find!
