This place is the only restaurant worth going to in the upper valley.  The food has gotten better and better.  The service is very consistent for the amount of people that go there.   I waited over an hour for a table the host thanked me for waiting and the server was smiling and suggestive through the whole meal.   I was very impressed with the craft beer selection.  Crazy an Italian restaurant would have a selection like this.  I had gnocchi and was blown away with how delicious it was. My wife had a salad.  She was jealous that she didn't get what I had.   What made the experience memorable was the chef.  I think his name was Mike.  He stopped by and asked how the meal was.   When does the chef ever stop at your table.  Especially when it's so busy. Can't wait to go back.
