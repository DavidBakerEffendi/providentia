I was at the restaurant the other night with clients, and we all just happened to be women. I was a little confounded by the extensive Italian wine list given that I am CA wine devotee. The waiter kindly agreed to help me make a selection; however, his suggestions primarily came from the wine by the glass wine list, and I was hoping to order something a little more special.   The sommelier was making her rounds to almost all of the tables within view, and I expected she would  stop by our table to offer her direction, too. No such luck. We apparently were not on her radar screen. Otherwise dinner was delicious and the wait staff most accommodating. But the sommelier was MIA.
