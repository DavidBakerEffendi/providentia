I stopped in to eat at this brand new restaurant because I couldn't resist the smell of freshly baked bread emanating from the door.  The space is cool and modern with clean lines and simple décor, which is perfect for the Tribeca warehouse space it occupies.  The flatbread pizzas are diverse, delicious and good for you.  They're made from organic cheeses, meats and seasonal vegetables.  My girlfriends and I each ordered a salad to start - the spiced pecan salad is a must - and then shared 3 different pizzas (Medicine Wheel, Dancing Heart Bread and my personal favorite: Punctuated Equilibrium).  Each of the pizzas was delicious and savory without being too filling. There's an extensive wine and beer list to choose from too. I'll definitely be back again soon!
