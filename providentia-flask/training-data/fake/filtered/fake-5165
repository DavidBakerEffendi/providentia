The Bistro continues to be a sure bet whenever I'm in Soho. They've made a few changes to the menu- which had me nervous (I am a creature of habit) But I have to say I'm mostly delighted. The salmon is even better than before. And the watermelon gazpacho- wow. Still a great place to have a relaxing meal- and watch the world go be. Everything in that neighborhood seems to be turning over- I hope this place sticks around!
