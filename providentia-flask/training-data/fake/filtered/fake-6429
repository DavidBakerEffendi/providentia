Nothing special. The burgers are decent (there are definitely better ones in Philly), the fries were meh (but I do love crinkle). I didn't get a shake, so maybe my opinion would be different if I did......but not by much. Based on the price, and the size of the burger, I wouldn't exactly recommend this to anyone. I've had better, I've had worse.
