Went for lunch for the first time today. Had hand-stuffed dumplings, amazing sauteed kale, a chicken and puffed rice appetizer and lamb "chili". Everything was amazing: made from fresh ingredients, perfectly seasoned, and presented elegantly! This might be the best restaurant in Hanover. (...or at least tied for first with Pine.) My only regret is that I can't go back for dinner tonight to try everything else on the menu. :)
