I stumbled upon this place, while strolling on Bleaker a few years ago.  I instantly became a fan and have been going back almost weekly.  The place is great, the staff is great,  and the owner is great! I know most of the staff by name and they are always willing to provide real customer service.  My favorite is the clam and PBR special, along with the all you can eat crabs.  The steamers in garlic sauce are awesome, although I do wish they would give you a nice slice of crusty bread to sop up the delicious sauce, instead of the small corn muffins.  If your looking for great food and friendly service at a reasonable price.  This is the best buy in Manhattan!
