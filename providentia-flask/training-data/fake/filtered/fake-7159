We have been to this restaurant since they had only 4 tables. Son of Ms. Sripraphai was only a college student at that time. Since then, even though some of their menus have been a little Americanized, it is still the most-real-Thai like restaurant in NY Tri-state area. Since the beginning, they have treated us like a real family or friends and celebrated our family growing. The place is so baby/kid-friendly, and you don't need to worry even if your baby starts to cry. In stead of giving you a dirty look, they will pick your baby up and play peekaboo. They care about customers, and when my husband could not finish a dish, they came out from the kitchen and asked him what was wrong (He was just full...). I hope that this place would not change and be there for a long long time. You are a part of our lives already.
