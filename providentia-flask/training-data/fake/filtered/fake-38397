I have been going to bars in Philadelphia for close to 15 years now, and I have to say the atmosphere at Misconduct is one of the best.  A year or two ago something must have changed because they really stepped it up and they are now my favorite place to have a beer, have some food, and watch a game. The only negative thing about this place is that the beers can be a bit expensive, but they are of the highest quality (plus you are in center city so it comes with the location) and the bartenders are very well educated about them. Another great thing about Misconduct is that they have some of the nicest/prettiest//sweetest waitresses around.  There are two waitresses in particular that work every busy night that are just a gift to the eyes and a pleasure to be around.
