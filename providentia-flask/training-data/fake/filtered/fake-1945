As transplanted Marylanders, we definitely are tough critics when it comes to  steamed crabs.  We were excited to order the the steamed crabs with Old Bay and were not disappointed.   Brooklyn Crap had the recipe right and our only gripe was that the crabs were a bit on the small side.  We went on a Tuesday and the 1$ oysters and 2$ Narragansetts were on point.  My wife enjoyed the chowder and the cole slaw and corn complimented the crabs well.  Seating was prompt, service was friendly and attentive and the view from the top deck was great. The night was topped off with a great piece of cheese cake.  We will definitely return and recommend Brooklyn Crab to our friends, Marylanders and New Yorkers alike.
