This is my favorite restaurant in all of Philly. The service and food is amazing and since we go there frequently they give us free food. Everything (decor included) is top notch. Best thing ever is the Roasted Chicken with ngaki (I don't know how to spell it) and vegetables. It is so good. The chicken is super soft and can be cut with a fork and the sauce is so good that at the end I take bread and dip it. The vegetables are amazing too. The food is wonderful. Must eat...
