I enjoyed the fresh fish,salad and vegetables. entree was hot and the service quick and a friendly waiter made all the difference, bread basket was fresh and plentiful.. I would like to return but restaurant seating geared for 4 and up . There are no cozy spots for couples just small areas of tables next to each other where u feel squished and unappreciated . We asked to sit at a table for 4 , just the 2 of us . At first the concept was almost foreign to staff until we said we would leave if wecouldn't be accommodated .We don't go out often and wanted a comfortable area to sit in with my husband,I did make a reservation a week before and I asked the manager after if I should state wanting to sit at a 4 seat table for my next reservation and he said yes! ***
