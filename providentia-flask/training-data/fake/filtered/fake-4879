This restaurant is really as good as it gets for lunch time. Location: Even though Fork & Spoon is right next to my office, I would walk 5 blocks every day to get lunch there. They have so many options & are constantly changing their specials & buffet. Also, it's a pleasure to be there. The staff are all wonderful and the others weren't exaggerating when the said it's spotless! I have lunch there every day & will continue to.
