For cheap dumplings, a good place to stop. As a broke ass student, it's nice and filling. And the quality isn't bad either though you could find better elsewhere, but for the fact of $1/4 dumplings doesn't give much room to complain about. I'm a fan of their dumplings, fried or boiled. Other stuff on the menu doesn't really appeal to me, but to each their own.
