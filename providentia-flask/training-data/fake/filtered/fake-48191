Definitely a unique experience with large, wide cut Belgian fries and a wide variety of dipping sauces. We got three sauces: Mango chutney, Vietnamese pineapple, Honey mustard, and of course Ketchup. While the fries are fresh and served (very) hot, the dipping sauces didn't really taste spectacular. In fact, they were just average tasting and didn't really make a big difference. The restaurant itself is kinda dingy looking with very limited seating. Our table was dirty with a spilled drink and fries! It's not a great place to bring friends - not even sure you wanna hang out there with just two people. It's an interesting concept, nonetheless.
