We came here for a friend's daughter's birthday.  I went for brunch.  This is a very trendy place so bring your best  hipster outfit and a hearty appetite.  Everyone had da who he's and real food but I had breakfast.  8' a simple girl!  The  oatmeal was hearty and delicious and the bacon is crispy and tasty.  the servers were accommodating for such a trendy place and very sweet.  we did not even have to wait 5 minutes even though the places was crowded To the hilt.  The calamari, Mac and cheese and fries samples from friends were equally as Delian.  Go for the style And the food.  if you are low key then it's probably not for you but if you want some NYC trend, and food then head to Chelsea!
