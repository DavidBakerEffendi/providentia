This fall, some friends and I were driving through Vermont on a road trip adventure and found ourselves in need of breakfast. We were in a hurry and needed to find someplace to stop on our route. At a crossroads in the country, we spotted Jersey Girls. We pulled into the parking lot. A hand-painted sandwich board boasted of local-everything breakfast sandwiches. Agreeing that this was indeed the place to stop, we walked in to a clean, sunlit space full of local food, products, and art. Two of us ordered biscuits and gravy, two of us ordered corned beef and hash, and we were all so pleased and full by the last bite. After placing our orders, the woman in the kitchen directed us to hot cider and hot coffee. The biscuits were great, the English muffins were homemade and incredible, and the eggs were fresh and orange-yolked. The meat was delicious and raised by neighboring farmers. Produce was available for purchase in a display cooler in the dining area. We couldn't have been more lucky with finding Jersey Girls as a wonderful breakfast stop. If only they existed at every intersected highway! If you like fresh and carefully prepared food in a quick and convenient setting, by all means, support this fabulous business.
