My sister and brother-in-law took my wife and myself here. They live a few blocks away, and I am a big fan of Delaney's (same owners, totally different vibe). I live in New York City, and spend quite a bit of my time eating out with clients. The food here really impressed me, and the portions were immense. I would absolutely take anyone I was trying to impress to this restaurant. Our server was great, wish I could recall her name. I am looking forward to eating there many more times!
