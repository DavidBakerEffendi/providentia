It's not the innovativeness or pricepoint of the sandwiches that makes me give this restaurant the worst review I can imagine. It's because of their unreasonable rigidity in "No modifications. No modifications." My friend and I came here, and she has a strong aversion to cilantro. It's real, people nytimes.com/2010/04/14/dâ€¦ They refused to leave the cilantro off the sandwich. I was disgusted with their intransigence and bad attitude. Ugh. I still have a bad taste in my mouth.
