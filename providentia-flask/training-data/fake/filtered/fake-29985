This place is hands down the best place for oysters, have been coming here since the week they opened. Between their selections of beers and oysters- I can honestly say this is my favorite place in NYC. Though they are always packed and very small, it is WORTH the wait. They will take your cell number and text you when your table is ready- which isn't bad considering the amazing places to grab a drink in the area. They do not take reservation but again it is WORTH the wait or go early for their happy hour! 6 oyster and a beer/wine for $12 - seriously???
