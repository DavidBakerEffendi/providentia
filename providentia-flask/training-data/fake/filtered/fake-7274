Always looked forward to going to this place whenever we are in New York. We were very disappointed this time. The onion soup was way too salty this time and it seemed that the cheese potion was cut in 1/3 of the previous portion. My wife ordered the French toast for lunch. Though it was done well we expected more for $21. Â In comparison the French toast at Nougatin at Jean George was much better (the inside was moist and juicy and the crips lightly charred outer surface made a great combination and much more memorable then the one we had at Balthazar).
