I got to fully agree with the 2/18/14 review.  My wife and I have been going to Bella for years since they were originally right off of Rt 3 where Matthews now exists and the line used to be out the door but last night will probably be the last.   They have progressively gotten worse but last night reached rock bottom.  First of all there seemed to be no maitre d on duty when we came or when we left; we were sat by the bus boy.   Ok not a huge deal but shows the level of care from the management.   The food which we used to gush about was just pedestrian, nothing special worthy of the prices they charge.  It wasn't just one dish.  Nothing seemed fresh.   The meats, the fish, the vegies all seemed like they were frozen for a long time and just thawed out or if not frozen had been decaying for days.   Even the side salad seemed to have been sitting in oil & vinegar for hours before it was served.  None of the sauces were anything special.  You could go to the Nevada Diner which we do all the time and get better quality food for 40% less with a lot better service.
