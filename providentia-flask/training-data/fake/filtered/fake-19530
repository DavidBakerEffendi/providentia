Came here for brunch with three friends, and while we really enjoyed the outdoor seating and the cheap and yummy mimosas ($6 with three refills?? What?!?), the food and service could have been much better. The food itself was fine but none of us got hot food. My potatoes were cold (though spiced nicely, so they would have been great if warm), the salad had some dead leaves, I got meat when I asked for no meat, and I got the wrong kind of bread. Also, no refills on coffee is madness, but the coffee itself tasted fine. Lastly, my portion was tiny and I was still hungry after the meal. I would have been fine with this meal if it were $8 at a shitty diner, but it was $30 at someplace that is supposed to be good. Not worth it.
