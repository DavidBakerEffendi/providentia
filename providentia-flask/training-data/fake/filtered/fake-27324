We were in NYC for a week, staying at a nearby hotel.  Stopped in every night at the Park Avenue Tavern before we called it a day.  Great drinks, great desserts, great late night menu and great staff from the wait staff, particularly Alex, to the bartenders and Kirk the host.  Made us feel very welcome in the big city.   Hope to go back some day.
