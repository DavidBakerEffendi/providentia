Yes, I gave in. After being told by several significant others to 'try' Village Whiskey...I just had to go. I ordered a big juicy burger and chowed down on some amazing fries-pure heaven. Their cocktails are also 'no joke'....the bartendar had me and my friends try some whiskeys and then suggested cocktails and wham!-we had quite a night. My only complaint would be how crowded it can be...be prepared to wait for a seat.
