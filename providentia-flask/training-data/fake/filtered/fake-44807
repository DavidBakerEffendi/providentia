I agree with other reviewers, I didn't want to write this because I don't want my favorite place to get too crowded, but I actually care about the patrons of this fantastic establishment...the charming couple Diego and Jessica and their two adorable daughters who are often in the restaurant. Come here for... -Delicious food cooked with love -the only restaurant I have ever been in in NY where the majority of people walk in and excitedly greet the owner and proceed to have a 10 minute conversation. -Wonderful kids products for sale, and activities for kids during the week The first time I came here, Jessica was really busy, so her adorable baby got passed around the restaurant while she graciously served us all. This is my happy place.
