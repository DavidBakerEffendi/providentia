Please! someone explain to me why the best lemonades in Brooklyn are not on the menu. My kids enjoyed the Strawberry Lemonade and my wife and I indulged in the Pineapple Ginger. My god! I know it was popular, everyone were drinking it and at times they actually ran out of it. The lemonade they are selling now is an insult to the patrons who spent the same amount of money for the quality drink from last Summer. Please bring it back. PLEASE
