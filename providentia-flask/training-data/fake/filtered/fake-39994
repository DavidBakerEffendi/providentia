Walked in to get some soup - to go.  Today's soup was black bean.  Terrific!  I love black bean soup!  And they politely warned me it had bacon.  No problem.  Bacon?  Bring it.   What they should have warned me is that their black bean soup with bacon costs, with tax, $10.79.  Eleven bucks for soup?  That's insane.  Even the server was embarrassed by it.  Nice people work there.  But I will never go there again.  Because only an incredibly idiotic person would spend that much for black bean soup.  The owners are, it seems, conning thieves who should be ashamed of themselves.  Eleven-buck soup is killing The West Village. Walked four blocks down West 4th.  Ordered black bean soup at Sevilla.  Five bucks.  It was delicious.
