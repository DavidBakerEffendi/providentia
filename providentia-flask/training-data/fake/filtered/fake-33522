This is my new favorite place!!! Last night it was my 4th or 5th time there and it keeps getting better.  A very diverse small, sexy and cozy hideout right in the village... The drinks are amazing and A+ for creativity. The food is fresh, tasty and delicious. The ambiance is FUN with different music from 80's, 90's and nice current artist. You can write your own confession on the walls of this place or read someone else's, anyway you are bound to stomp on few funny one that make the place warm and fun. The most important part though, is the People that work there. They make sure to Welcome you and assist you as soon as possible. Erika, the owner is a delight of a person and makes this place a unique one with her vision. My friends and I were impressed by how low key they are and how they ensure you are having a great time, even if is closing time, Oops! (just once!)   This place is perfect to go for drinks, or dinner, alone, as a couple, or in a group. I can't wait to try the winter menu, they told me they have some nice surprises. Can't wait to go there again and continue trying their sexy and funny drinks. My favorite so far is the Love affair and Devil's Advocate ;)
