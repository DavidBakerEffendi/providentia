I will never ever return to this restaurant which insulted me and destroyed what could have been an ok meal.  OK only.  The food was uninspired and at times seemed to made up of leftover bits of other peoples meals. But the true insult was being asked to leave because there were people waiting for a table.  They waited until the bill was paid and then wanted us out.  Instead of offering to relocate us to the bar with a complementary drink as other restaurant will do they just walked us out. It doesn't matter if the food was good or not, if you feel insulted by the staff its a done deal.   No stars for this tremendous insult which is goes against the traditional Japanese values of welcome and goes against all general restaurant good practice.  Steer clear.
