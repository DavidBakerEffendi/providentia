Everything about this place is great.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the wait times of an hour or more, but you know what, it's worth it. The tapas are  make my mouth water as I write this.  The atmosphere is cozy  and tight with a great young crowd. Highly recommend this diamond in the rough!!!!
