After promising my mom (who lives in maine) that Bar has THE BEST pizza in the WORLD, and talking it up so much we finally made it in.  We made it early (430) and made the order to go for our LG pizza.  we decided at 5 since they opened and the pizza wasn't ready that we'd sit and eat it there.  Well after being told our order was the FIRST of the day, we figured we'd get it quickly. not so much. after seeing about 4-5 pizzas be sent out we finally had to ask where ours was.  Where was it? AT THE VERY BOTTOM OF THE PILE! This was not the cooks faults, but our servers.  After getting absolutely NO service from the server herself (tall blonde), we had to ask other servers for help (I even got up and poured our own waters for us cause no one else cared to ask if we wanted a refil). I felt so embarrased talking this place up and getting this service. not to mention our server puts on jacket, and goes outside for 15 minutes, comes back with food from another establishment, and eats it RIGHT IN FRONT of all the customers. the manager even stepped in and was eating and they were all on their phones texting whie avoiding servicing anyone. isn't there a break room for employees to eat OTHER establishments food in???? What boggled my mind the most was watching the manager eat away and text away with the server!!!! Upon finishing the delish pizza we ordered the same to go, and got a burnt pizza.  We are sitting right next to the kichen, can see and hear everything going on and hear the employees say 'shes crazy'  when i had an old slice from the FIRST UNBURNT pizza i said all we would like is for this one to go to look like the first one we got, NOT like this. and showed the difference.  HOW RUDE.  Upon making a complaint to the manager who didn't once say she was sorry, she offered to pay for the pizza to go.  we waited 30 minutes and no one came up to us until 30 min later to ask how we were paying for it!!!!!!  On top of all this horrible service, I wanted to let the owner know how his establishment was being run. So I emailed the email address on the website requesting that I can get ahold of the owner. It is obvious where the servers and managers get their mind sets and attitudes from, it is from FRANK! He emailed me back insisting he was the owners "PARTNER" and refused to give me information and failed to mention that HE WAS INDEED THE OWNER!!!!!!!!!!!!! what is going on???? **I HAD TO CALL TOWN HALL TO FIND OUT WHO WAS THE LEGAL RIGHTOUS OWNER BECAUSE FRANK FAILED TO MENTION IT AFTER NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS OF ASKING HIM!!!!!!!!!!   if youd like to see proof and photos on photobucket that i uploaded of the copies of the emails of me emailing frank continuously asking for the owners information to make a complaint and him completely denying me of it and avoiding admitting HES the actual owner, send me a message i'll gladly provide those links to you or just search for LesPacho on photobucket and you'll see them there.     why doesnt frank just come out and say he's the owner? What is he hiding? As someone who frequented bar at LEAST once a month (living 45 minutes away), they have lost such a loyal customer.  We ended up tipping the cooks that day the $10 the server couldve wouldve gotten had she attempted to do her job. But it comes as no surprise that the staff lacks to assist any customers needs, look at the owners response to a concern customer for gods sake! DO NOT SUPPORT THIS HORRIBLE RAN BUSINESS!! GO TO MODERN INSTEAD THEIR PIZZA IS JUST AS GOOD AND THE SERVICE IS INCOMPARABLE BECAUSE NOTHING COMPARES TO THE HORRIBLE CRAPPY SERVICE AT BAR!!!!!!! GO TO MODERN if you want good service AND good food. DO NOT SUPPORT THE HORRIBLE INCONSISTENCY AT BAR RAN BY UNPROFESSIONAL AND INCOMPITENT OWNER FRANK! shady shady
