I called to check on my delivery which was more than an hour late. I was told on the phone I was being too impatient because its Friday lunch rush. I asked if I could get a discounted price for the long wait. The person on the phone said next time to come pick it up if I want it on time. I asked to speak to a manager and turns out the owner was the one I was talking to! Can't believe the owner would talk to a customer like that. I wasn't even being rude or disrespectful in any way. Just a concerned customer. I cancelled the order because dominos got here before they did and when I called to cancel they said to never order from them again. Don't eat here. It's mediocre food, high prices and run by a jackass. I will go to dominos. It's cheap, decent food for the price and they have better customer service surprisingly.
