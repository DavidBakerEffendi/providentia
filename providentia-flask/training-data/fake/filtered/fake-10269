PT is a perfectly hip but low keyed restaurant that delivers every time on atmosphere, taste and service.  The outdoor patio is cozy and relaxing and really comfortable.  The appetizers and entrees are quite varied and certainly authentic and delicious.  Portion size is perfect so there is no leaving feeling like a bloated whale.  The service is impeccable. The waiters are friendly but not ingratiating as well as being very knowledgeable. The wine list is also terrific.  Prices are extremely fair.  Run, don't walk, to this Williamsburg treasure.
