Excellent restaurant. I'm originally from Caracas but have live in DC for over 24 years. I was thrilled to find this spot. The food, ambiance and price were great. I had tequenos for appetizer, a Reina Pepia arepa for main dish and shared a cachapa. The drink of choice, Polar beer. This place reminds me of the many low-key restaurants in Venezuela. I will definitely come back when I'm in NYC.
