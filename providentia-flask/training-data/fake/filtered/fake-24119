My parents and brother were up from NC last week and we stopped by this cafe to eat supper. We had honey dipped fried chicken, and I have to tell you it was the best fried chicken I have ever had. The staff are friendly, the food is delicious and they went out of their way to accommodate us. It's as close to good old Southern cooking and hospitality you are going to find in the Northeast.
