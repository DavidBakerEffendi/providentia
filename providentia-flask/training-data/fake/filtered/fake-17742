i have been eating here for a few years now. this place is delicious at 3-4am after a long night out with friends. the lamb and chicken combo is what i usually get. not really sure how to describe how good it is but the place is delicious. the only reason i am leaving 4 stars is the wait. they need to find a more efficient way to serve the mobs that show up at 3am.
