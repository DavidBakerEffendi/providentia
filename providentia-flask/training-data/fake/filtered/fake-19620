This place is OK given the lack of Thai food in the area.  I wouldn't normally go, though.  If you're hankering for some and don't have car access from campus, go for it.  You probably won't be blown away, but I doubt you'll be seriously unhappy either. The atmosphere is casual and open, not claustrophobic or dirty, which is a plus.  Wait staff is decent.  Usually it's not too too hard to get a seat with friends. That being said, I ordered a green curry once and just didn't enjoy it.  There was a soapy aftertaste I couldn't ignore.  I finished it, but it quite literally didn't leave the greatest taste in my mouth. I've also ordered the Pad Thai, which is decent and was satisfying.  Enough for a lunch meal (I do have a big appetite though!). It's a fun place to go with friends once in a while if they're hankering for it and you don't have a car.  Otherwise, I'd suggest Penang, which isn't too far either and tastier.
