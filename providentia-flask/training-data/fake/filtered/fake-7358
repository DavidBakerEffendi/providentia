This is probably a 3.5 star, because a lot was a little 'off' in a way I'm not sure was good or bad. But I was overall satisfied, so but my intuition said to round up not down. Started with the tomatoes.  Generic, but good, except I'm not quite sure what the watermelon was doing in there.  Not sure if I liked it or not, it just left my mouth a little confused. Two of us myself included had the special ravioli which was a truffle/chanterelle something. When it first came I was astonished at how small the portion size was, particularly relative to my other lunchmates whose portion sizes were gigantic or at least looked that way in comparison. But I guess that's to be expected with something with truffle? The taste however was amazing...I can still taste it. For dessert we had the spumoni which, in contrast to lunch, was enormous. And incredibly delicious. Our server was prompt and attentive, but she had a bit of an attitude. Again, not sure if it was a good attitude, or a bad attitude, I can't quite place my finger on it. She told one person that she wouldn't like what he'd ordered--seems a bit forward but on the other hand, maybe she was right and spared him? Add this to my confusion about this place.
