I'm a hard critic so I don't give 5 stars often, but I do really enjoy Bonnie's Grill in Park Slope. I think Ron Swanson would approve as well. The burgers are so delicious. I've actually been there multiple times and the last time impressed me so much I had to get on the Internet and write up a review. Try the chicken wings-- hot. Share them with a friend. If you are feeling really hungry each get a burger but you could honestly split one. That's what I did last time. The burgers are so delicious. Must have some great spices or something to marinate the meat. I walked out the door saying "that was so delicious" out loud. I highly recommend.
