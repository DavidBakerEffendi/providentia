When they first opened everything was great .Every time we went the food was delicious and the host or hostess was very friendly. As time passed the true color of this butterfly began to show. The food seemed to become subpar and the Host especially arrogant when you told him there was an issue. My family of 6 went there nearly once a week until it began to go down hill. I had high hopes for this place because we live so close, but I guess it was not meant to be. The food is passable ,but the management is the biggest concern in this place.
