First time in Philly and found this great home-base restaurant.  Both lunch and dinner entrées were great on the palate and wallet. A true trattoria. Service was perfect for lunch and a bit hurried at dinner, though never had the feeling of being rushed out so they could turn the table. Atmosphere was pleasant and a perfect level of background music to mask table to table conversations while not having to raise your voice at your own. Single restroom was large, clean and sufficient for the amount of seating. BYOB since a liquor license is so expensive but they provide a "free" glass of wine.  Nicely handled and appropriate. Locals and tourist can enjoy together. PROS: Full and wide menu of quality plates. Small and cozy. Neighborhood atmosphere while only two block from the Liberty Bell. CONS: Table bread could improve, nothing more than a cold, white, grocery store baguette.
