I was here when it first opened...food, service was So/So.. Even met the owner and not impressed. I was out Saturday night holiday shopping, and decided to give it another try. I was greeted at the door, by a young man. Told us he was the manger,he even stopped at the table to check on our service. I am sorry, we did not catch his name ( though he was very tall! ) The food was so much better... Tuna to die for. Turned out to be a very enjoyable experiemce. I will now tell all my friends!!!
