I needed to send a Kosher deli platter to a friend who had a death in the family and I do not live in the area. I called and spoke to the manager.  He was able to help me and is sending a lovely platter with all the extras to my friend on the date and time I requested.  The manager was very accommodating and pleasant.  The price was quite reasonable and I would order from this restaurant again!
