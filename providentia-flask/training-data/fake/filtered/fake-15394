Arriving on a Wednesday at 6, our party of three were seated in the rear courtyard by a very cordial hostess who told us the specials and made appetizer and drink suggestions.  We enjoyed the Ceviche Mixto (shrimp, octopus... very nice).  Then two of us had the skirt steak and the other dish was ribs.  All were done as requested and delivered to the table at the proper temps and surprisingly fast, but without rushing us.  We all agreed that the food was uniquely presented (such as steaks on Argentinian hardwood platters that were slices right from the tree, bark still encircling them).  It is cash only, as it says on the front of the menu.  The great food and service will bring us back again.
