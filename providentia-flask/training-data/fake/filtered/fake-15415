Went to DeLorenzo's last night (Tuesday) at 8:30 with two other people for a quick dinner.  Since I literally live upstairs from the restaurant in the Lofts I bare witness to the lines of people waiting outside daily to get in.  Each time I see this I have to chuckle and ask myself "why?"  The pizza is ok but it's surely not worth waiting an hour (sometimes more) for.   Then comes the service.  Horrible!  Servers are only interested in getting you in and out.  I guess I can understand this since they're constantly trying to turn tables in order to get the mass of people waiting outside into the restaurant.  However, last night this was not the case.  It was fairly slow with 4 open booths.  Thinking we would walk in and sit down we were greeted (I think by the owner or manager), given a number and ask to wait.  Why???  After 10 min of waiting I requested to be seated in one of the 4 open booths.  "I'm sorry sir, I can't sit 3 in a booth" was the response.  I politely asked "What happens if 3 sit in a booth?" then reminded him that it was 8:30 on a Tuesday night and it would probably be ok to sit us there.  "No I'm sorry sir, it's our policy".  So after 10 more minutes of standing there hungary staring at 4 open tables we left and went to the best kept secret in Robbinsville for Italian food...Massimo's. In the opinions of myself and of my friends the pizza at Massimo's is much better than at DeLorenzo's.  There is never a wait, servers are friendly and there is a bigger selection.  My suggestion is to skip the hype of D.L's and head 1/2 mile down the street to Massimo's.
