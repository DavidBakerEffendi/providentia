This without a doubt was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. 2 hours waiting for dinner to be served and they come out with two out of three dinners. To add insult to injury they would not take anything off of the check for a meal that was sub standard. $9.00 for a side dish of penne. Pasta is 99 cents a lb. This is just a hang out for the SI men to bring their girlfriends. Anyone who thinks this is a great restaurant cannot be Italian. The only satisfaction I got was not leaving a tip for the moron waiter on a $130 bill. Anyone who goes there watch your bill they charged me one other time for cake I never had. LOW LIFES...
