This is a funky, friendly, oh so tasty little cafe. As such it is 5 stars in the Funky, Friendly Cafe category, not something that I give easily. But the intangibles here - the sandwiches are inventive and delicisous, the wall-sized menu board so packed that it takes several visits to unravel, the vibe so friendly and welcoming - that nothing else makes sense. Highly recommended. Make a point of it.
