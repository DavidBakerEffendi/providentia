At first of all I thought this would be great for a family of six.  We spent about $50.00 and recieved sub par food.   The 2 salad bowls were practically empty and needed tweezers to pick up salad.  The pizza is a frozen dough, tasteless, cardboard dried out mess. With the many toppings and choices they all taste the same.  We have made better pizza at home using Pillsbury dough.  The most outstanding thing is the filthiness.  My 9 yearold daughter need to use facilities and she would not go.  We pointed out to the owner that the bathrooms were disgusting. He sent someone to clean them.  The tables were disgusting.  I would not go here again.  If you put a pencil to it CiCi is expensive.  CICi markets itself as a bargin but it is not.  The real bargin -My family buys pizza from our hometown pizzaria 2 for $15.99 I purchas an addition pizza with toppings and the owner throughs in knotes or pinwheel for free.  The bill is $27.60 every week.  The owner made pizza in Hoboken for years.  Save your money and support a local pizzaria with good cheese and suase.
