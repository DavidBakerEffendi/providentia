Warning: Sang kee Noodle House is much worse than Sang Kee Peking Duck House in Chinatwon (the same owner, though) My boyfriend and I went here twice, and every time was a big disappointment. Both the food and services were awful. We ordered steamed dumplings and were served with boiled and broken ones. We also ordered Singapore noodles (as I liked the one from Sang Kee Peking Duck House), but what we got at this place was just unflavorful. Not to mention the servers, they even didn't know about their food. I asked about the ingredients in the seafood soup and the waiter said it's seafood. And I didn't like it all after I tried. My conclusion. never go back again.
