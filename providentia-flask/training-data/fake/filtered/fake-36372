This is my favorite Italian restaurant, I do not say that lightly, the food tastes almost like it was flown over from a kitchen in Italy, to Greenwich. This place is awesome; it is a small inviting little northern Italian restaurant with a lot of character. The best part about this place is that they have HOMEMADE pasta at affordable prices. Great atmosphere, wonderful food, and the staff were a pleasure to interact with! Â I highly recommend giving this place a try!
