Very Disappointing!!! Our office ordered for delivery.  We ordered 8 stromboli's 4 spinach and 4 pepperoni and 5 orders of sweet potato fries. 1. We wanted to change the stromboli's to meatball and they said they couldn't they were already made, what true Italian restaurant serves premade/frozen stromboli's? 2. The delivery guy called the office and said there was no parking so I have to come down and get the order. I went down and not one car was in front of the building. 3. I sign the receipt and he said "what no gratuity" , I informed hhim that Iwhen I placed the order I told them to include a 10.00 tip, he looks at the slip and says oh. 3. The sweet potato fries were so soggy and cold, they gave us 5 packets of ketchup for 5 large orders. 4. the strombolis were overcooked and very tough.  Our office usually eats up all the food - not this time.  There is still 4 stromboli's left and 4 boxes of fires.  Never again.
