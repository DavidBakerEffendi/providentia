I have been in restaurants where the service was mediocre or inattentive.  Pietro's, however, moved from that level of total disregard for service to MEAN and NASTY.  I eat out all of the time and have never been treated this badly.   We made a reservation for 10 and all of us sat at a table for 6 although there was no one nearby to our table NOR did any one sit at any nearby table for the total of 2 hours we were in the restaurant.  It got worse however.  My personal favorite was the server yelling at a 5 year old to remove her fork from her plate.  And....it goes on.....as we were putting on jackets to leave, the clearing staff began pushing the tables together by shoving them into us.  And this was after we left a 30% tip.   How did you manage to find so many terrible people and put them together in one part of the restaurant?  You really need to think about restaurant management and policy.  OK pizza and a bunch of lettuce on the plate cannot compensate for this.
