Great food and confortable ambiance. It was the perfect place for a relaxing dinner with a friend. Staff was attentive and suggested great choices for dinner. It takes you back to the local bistro setting of an old Paris neighborhood like St Germain... It's not about the over the top scene and decor; it's about the well prepared food!
