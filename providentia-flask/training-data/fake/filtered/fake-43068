I have come here twice and loved it! Nothing less than a five star review is fathomable to me. The cocktails, both the social ones on the menu and anything else off it, are expertly made. The tuna tartare special the other night was delicious. The empanadas are fluffy, hot, filled up with tasty cheese and spinach, and just the right amount of crispness without greasiness. The owners are some of the friendliest restarauteurs I have encountered in the area, making us all feel so warm and welcome and all the staff from the bartender to the waitresses to even the busboy were super nice and accommodating of our group. Definitely coming back here again and often.
