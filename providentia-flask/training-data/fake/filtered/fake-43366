OK, I don't write reviews but after this last horrible experience I felt I needed to tell as many people as possible to avoid the is place! First off we have been to this Outback a total of 4 times since it opened and 2 of those 4 times have been bad experiences so lets just say we will NOT be returning. This time was last night at 6PM New Years Eve and it was not crowded at all so service should not have been bad but it was HORRIBLE! There were 8 of us that started out ordering drinks and apps from the waitress that you could tell did not want to be working that night and had the personality of a wet sock. After we got our drinks and apps she dropped one of the apps on the floor and said she would be right back with the replacement app, it was 15 minutes before we say her again WITHOUT the app! After taking our dinner order and drink order she disappeared again for 10 more minutes, when returning we asked about the app that we still didn't have and all the plates and glasses on the table that hadn't been bused yet. Now the dinners come out 40 minutes later AND THEY WERE ALL WRONG AND MINE WAS "LOST" IN THE KITCHEN AND WOULD HAVE TO BE RE-DONE!! Now we have 3 drink glasses each (8 people X 3 drinks 24 glasses!!!!) plus app dishes and dinner dishes stacked all over the table with no room to put a thing down!!!! I called over the manager and told him this was absolutely ridiculous and he should be ashamed of his restaurant. Needless to say our entire meal was comped and we left in a hurry NEVER TO RETURN! STAY FAR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!
