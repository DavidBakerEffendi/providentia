Really some of the best Chinese food I've ever had. Very fresh. The best items on the menu are: - The Wonton Noodle Soup (with Beef Stew is always a good option, and the roast pork or roast duck a good second option) -Pan Fried noodle with Shrimp, so ginger-y, garlic-ky and delicious -Sui Mei is tasty -steamed roast pork buns. Really nice service too. Way to go HK.
