Love the pizza.  You can ask to have it cooked to whatever level of "done" you want; I hate burnt and dark or pale and raw, so I ask for "golden" which is what I get.  And it is divine.  Other people bring in their own (sometimes bizarre) toppings, and the chefs cheerfully fling it on the pizza for them.   The bartender and the guy at the door, Gerry, a full-time music conservatory student,  and some of the staff are very nice. Gerry is the  is the best, polite, cheerful, juggling phone orders, delivering take-outs and taking cash, directing customers, and somehow staying above the fray. The salad could be updated, but this is Contes.  They don't do updates, and that's part of the charm.  It's why the regulars are real people, not U elitists (unless they come in to "slum"). " If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"  is not Conte's motto.  "Broke or not  broke, that's how we did it, that's how we do it, we don't fix nothing,  take it or leave it,"  that's more their theme.  At least it's not phoney.  And for some of us, it's nice to see a place that hasn't been yuppified, no matter how much pressure there is to "modernize".  Conte's operates on the principle that new isn't necessarily better, just different, so why change.  I admire the stubborn adherence to whatever it is they're stubbornly adhering to.  You go for the geist, as much as anything.  You go for who you run into. Conte's is about a lot more than pizza.
