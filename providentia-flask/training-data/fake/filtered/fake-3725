When we have company in town, this is a frequent stop. Full disclosure. I've never tried anything but their specialty pizzas (and a few appetizers). They only take cash. And if you eat in on a busy night, they might shoot you a free dessert as you're going out the door. They're just good like that. The specialty pizzas are well worth it. The Chicken Cordon Bleu and the Cheesestake pizza are some of the best dishes reincarnated as a pizza. I found the taco pizza a little strange, but my wife and brother loved it. A little on the pricey side if you're used to Little Caesars (15-20 bucks) but worth it, for the size of the pizza, the quality of the ingredients, and the amazing taste. You might drive right past it if you aren't careful--it is a small shop by Gauchos and the Fire Department. There's an ATM just up the street at Schuyler Bank (that talks to you and scares your pants off at 9 at night) if you forget cash. But if you hang around Kearny enough, I guarantee you'll see their delivery car everywhere. Check it out!
