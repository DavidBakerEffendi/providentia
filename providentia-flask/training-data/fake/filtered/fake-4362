Horrible, the only suggestion would be breakfast.  The tall Greek host has an attitude. The Spanish hosts is very nice though. The owners daughter is a so fake.  She should comb her hair.  The owner sits there and hardly smiles, unless you get him on a good day.  The waitress are so rude.  You might get a few nice girls but most are RUDE. One waitress who works days is so loud and coughs in her hand then serves your food. I can't take looking at that.  It is getting worse and worse, two weeks ago was my last visit. NEVER AGAIN.
