Please fire the hostess. We have been living in New York for two years have eaten out at nice restaurants at least twice a week throughout. We have never been treated with more disrespect than we were at Yakitori Totto. We arrived at 5:45, about 10 minutes after calling to see if walk-ins were welcome. The hostess blocked the entrance and asked told us we could come in if we could finish our meals within an hour! I asked how fast the kitchen was. She refused to answer, and told us there was a long line (nowhere to be seen), and that we should leave and come back earlier. The entire time, she had a very stuck up attitude. Restaurants should make their clients feel good. The higher class ones actually do. Yakitori Totto is just a craphole with some insecure Japanese girl working the door.
