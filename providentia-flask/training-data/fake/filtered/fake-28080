Holy Crap! Amazing! The chef's tasting option was one of the best meals we've ever had. Once ordering, we were asked if we had any preferences, and of course, we just went for it. Well, I'm sorry, but I think we should have paid MORE for what we received. It was amazing. There was foie gras, lobster, the whole gamut of fine flavors and exquisite pairings. The food was wonderful, and the service was stellar as well. Yes, it's not cheap. But the value is incredible, and I'd go back again and again.
