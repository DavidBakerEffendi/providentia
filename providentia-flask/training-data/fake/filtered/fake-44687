Best food in the city.  If you like variety and vegetables, this is the place for you.  And if you like meat, that's ok too, they have plenty of delicious food for you too. Soups, salads and sandwiches are fresh, creative and delicious.  The case is also full of freshly prepared food that you can take home for dinner (or heat up to eat on the premises).   The staff is friendly, accomdating and fast. And the ice tea is amazing. And except for 12 noon, I never have trouble finding a place to sit.
