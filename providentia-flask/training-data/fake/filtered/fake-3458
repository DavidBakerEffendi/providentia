After much anticipation, I was finally able to make it to Sabrina's for Sunday brunch with friends. We tried to overlook our server's bad attitude and enjoy our food. I had ordered a decaf latte... it's 2:25am and I'm still awake on a night before the start of a work week. This tells me they didn't make my latte as I had requested. I was also dismayed to find a hair in my yogurt. My husband's smoked salmon omelette was over-salted. I'm sorry, I wanted to like it. But this place just didn't win me over with its sarcastic server and the unfortunate hair.
