I give it 5 stars on food, but dropped a star because of the prices.  I have been 2x for brunch and both times had the garlic roasted chicken while picking off my tablemates' oatmeal, fritatta's etc.  Everything we ordered was superb, and the staff was very nice.   The drip coffee was good, however the espresso was atrocious.  No crema, basically brown water.  I was very disappointed in the espresso, at this "authentic" italian restaurant. All in all I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys fine dining and is willing to pay for it.
