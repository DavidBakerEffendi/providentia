the best I've tried many Thai places in NJ and NYC, but this place is my favorite.  If you go make sure to order some chicken satay as an app - delish!  Another specialty dish of theirs is the Mango Chicken.  I have brought friends from out of town to this spot and have never heard anyone raving about the food.
