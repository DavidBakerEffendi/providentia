Was really excited to try this place the other day because I love mediterranean food.  The people inside were nice and helpful, which is most of the reason they get two stars.  However, the food was pretty underwhelming.  I got the meat special, which I got because I wanted to get the best and see how they stacked up.  The chicken was a bit tough and the shawarma was ok, but the overarching theme of the entire dish was that it was pretty much without taste.  Just greasy from the shawarma with no spices coming through.  I even got tahini sauce, which is usually very flavorful, and even that didn't have taste.  The portion was generous and pretty heavy, so I only ended up eating about 2/3 of it and didn't end up saving the rest.  I am writing this review so the owners can hopefully take the feedback and improve, because if they don't, there are plenty of places downtown that do the same kind of thing much better (ex: Tikkaway, Chipotle) and will get my and others' business.
