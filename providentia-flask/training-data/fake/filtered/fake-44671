Dinner at LaVa. WOW. Didn't expect a top chef and the greatest tastes but we got it. I had the Short Ribs (not sure is the right name...)but the taste. WOW. My wife had the fish. She's still talk about it. Compared to the high end restaurants we go to here and there and spend a fortune... here it tasted GREAT and the tab .... less than $80 = Happy camper.
