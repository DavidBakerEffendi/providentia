Came here with my boyfriend for Valentine's day, the service was beyond incredible as was the food. Everything I ate was amazing, I was hesitant about ordering the trout but I am glad i did. I went in with my mind set in ordering 1 drink but then i had the Orange Blossom and that turned it into 3 drinks! Just as Rebecca L., I felt like a judge on Top Chef.
