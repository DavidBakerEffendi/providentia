We waited a while before trying this place & it was well worth it.  From the moment we walked in the door, the staff was friendly & above board, as was the service. I had a plain burger with blue cheese & mushrooms,  my friend had the salmon BLT & we shared some oysters. The oysters, on special at $1 each, were fresh & delicious, as was the salmon. The burger was a little salty, but otherwise tasty. Our bill was a nice surprise, only $29 for a lot of food. Our server was just the right amount of attentive & seemed genuinely concerned about how we liked our food. A gentleman, maybe the chef, even came out to ask us what we thought.. I'm very impressed with the way they've turned things around & responded to criticism. I'll definitely go back. Oh, our server told us that their license for outdoor seating should come in a week or so, another reason for me to go back.
