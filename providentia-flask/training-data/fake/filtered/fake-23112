I travel regularly from Boston to NY and found this place during my travels.  I love the beer selection and the quantity and quality of food.  I had the BBQ ribs and a great IPA on draft.....um um good!  I have the luxury to eat at many restaurants in two major cities and i have to say the ribs here were the best i've ever had.  Keep up the great work and i can't wait to stop by again next week while i'm on the way through to another meeting in NY!
