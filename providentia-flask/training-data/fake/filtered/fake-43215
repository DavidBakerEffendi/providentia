My sister and I were in New Jersey house sitting for someone when hurricane Sandy hit. We were looking for a place to go that had electricity, so stopped in for for food and a latte. The customer service was awesome, and it seemed like they really knew their regulars. The food was awesome, and so were the drinks. If I lived in New Jersey, they'd be a regular spot for me!
