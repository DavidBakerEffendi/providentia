I really wanted to like this place, especially after being heartbroken over Alan@594 closing. We took it being crowded on a Saturday night as a hopeful sign.  So we ordered the lamb gyro platter, Turkish hamburger, and chicken kabobs.  After a long wait, our food arrived.  It was okay at best but not nearly as tasty (or as inexpensive) as Falafel Hut or Jackie's Grillette.  And when we were asked for hot sauce to try to spice it up a bit, we were given barbeque sauce.  Huh?!
