Recently changed chefs. Would have given it 5 stars previously for the food. Previously had what was possibly THE BEST fish & chips in the whole of NYC and wonderful foie gras mousse. Very sad that the dishes have now changed and are cooked in a different style by a different chef. Food is okay now--was excellent before this. It was a neighbor gem so I feel really sad about the chef change!
