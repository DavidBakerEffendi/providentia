This is the worst restaurant in the St. George area, I placed an order today that consisted of zeppoles and a chicken parm roll.  The zeppoles were very thin strips of fried dough, they tasted awful, I think they were fried in DIRTY OLD OIL, have you ever seen a zeppole made like this,  i throw them out.  The chicken parm roll, the dough wasn't cooked, there wasn't any mozzarella cheese in it, if there was six tiny pieces of  chopped up chicken in that roll it was a lot. The sauce looked like they opened a can of crushed tomatoes and but a spoonfull on it. I called to complain, asked for the manager who refused to give his name, he was a NASTY  RUDE DISGUSTING person, who prefers to scream at his customers, Then to find out what the problem is.  He would not listen to anything I had to say, instead he told me that the food was great and there was something wrong with my taste buds. Never offered to replace it, or to refund my money. This man should not be allowed to serve the public, instead he needs to be FIRED!!!!!  This was the first and last time I will ever order from them.  When I find out who owns the DIVE!!!!!!! you can bet he will hear from me.
