My Mom and I have lunch here at least twice a week!!! The food is fantastic and the lunch special prices are phenomenal and they come with drinks!!! The Drunken Noodle very flavorful and is the best I've ever had and the spring roll appetizers are amaaaaaaaaaaazing!!! The owners are super nice too!!! :D
