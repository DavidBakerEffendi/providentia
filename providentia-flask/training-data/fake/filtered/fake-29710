Simply amazing. I just cannot say enough good things about this place.   The atmosphere is intimate but not stuffy.  The kind of place you could spend all night in and not get tired of.  The decor and lighting give the restaurant a unique quality.  It's sort of modern but at the same time has a classic feel to it. The food was absolutely amazing.  From the first bite into my burger to the last sip of my milkshake, every morsel was delectible.  All the food is super fresh too.  The meat is fresh ground that day, all the fries and onions are made on premises even the flavorings for the milkshakes are created daily. Finally, to make the whole experience perfect, the price was just right.  Burgers range between $2 and $4 depending on type.  One could have a great meal for no more than $10. Definitely check this place out.  Also, do yourself a favor, try at least one double bacon cheese slider... you will thank me ;)
