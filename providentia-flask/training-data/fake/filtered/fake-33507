This place is fantastic. I can't say enough great things about it! I'm a mom, and if you go early in the evening (dinner starts at 5) it's nice and family friendly. They also serve lunch now. The staff is very welcoming (more on that later). Later on in the evening, it's a decidedly grown-up crowd. The food kicks some serious ass. I've had the hamburger and it's really awesome. It comes with sweet onions which really add something to the experience. The mac and cheese is delicious and a great option for kids (as is the hamburger, with its yummy potato wedges). I've also had the chicken pot pie with... blood sausage. I never thought I'd like something with blood sausage, but it's soooo good. It melts in your mouth. The brussel sprout are great, and so is the farro salad, and the kimchi (which can be made vegan by asking to subtract the fried egg). Prices are very reasonable. And finally, Hamilton's boasts the greatest bartender the world has ever seen in Joe (not to be confused with the chef, who is also Joe). Joe is everything you want in a bartender. If I had a serious drinking habit, the upside to it would be getting to spend hours seated at the bar at Hamilton's, chatting with Joe. And the cocktails, made with Soju, are really awesome too.
