I don't understand why everyone makes such a big deal about this place. I came here for a late breakfast/early lunch with my girlfriend...WHAT A MISTAKE. You would think that ordering something as simple as pancakes with eggs and bacon and a cheeseburger deluxe would taste fine but NOOOOOO. To start off, my girlfriend's pankcakes were gooey on the inside and burnt on the outside, the eggs were cold and the bacon tasted like cardboard....not to mention that's pretty much what it looked like. I asked for my cheeseburger to be cooked medium, and got something that looked like a piece of charcoal. The lettuce was brown around the edges and the french fries were soggy...they must have been sitting out for too long. I would rather eat at McDonald's. The server was so unfriendly and I felt like I was bothering him when I asked for a refill on my soda, which by they way, he never came by to see if we needed anything else. To top of this terribleeeee expirience, this place is so closterphobic and they don't accept credit cards....ummm, last time i checked the year was 2012. If youre really looking for a good dining expirience try hitting some other place up in the neighborhood because this place blows.
