We went to this diner on our way to pick up our puppy only because it was recommended by "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives".  The particular episode that recommended this place showed that the corn beef hash was made fresh and that it was incredible---same w/ the waffle.  The corn beef hash was probably the worst we've ever had!  There was nothing fresh about it at all.  It was like mashed potatoes actually.  I think it was worse than canned corn beef hash since it was sooo soggy!   The waffle was ok, but definitely nothing to write home about.  It was probably the most disappointing experience we've ever had from a diner recommendation.  "Triple D" probably was paid to have this diner show up on tv and recommend it.  Downright horrible and DEFINITELY not worth the trip.
