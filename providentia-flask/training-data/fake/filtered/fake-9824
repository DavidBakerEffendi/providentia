I took my wife to Marc Forgione's for brunch on a day we were celebrating 20 years from the day we met. She had no idea where we were going, and was gleefully surprised with my choice. She absolutely loved the decor and ambiance. I had made reservations (through YELP), and even though it looked pretty busy when we arrived (walk-ups were being told there were no tables available at the moment), we were shown to our table immediately (another detail that left the wife quite impressed!). The service was fantastic, the staff (specifically our waitress, Tina) could not have been more pleasant and accomodating. The fire bread waiting for us at the table was out of the world!! The brunch menu was limited, but interesting. It included combinations we had never heard of before, but were more than willing to sample them. As it turned out, the food was so much more than we could have imagined. Absolutely delicious!!! Our experience at Marc Forgione's was so wonderful that we plan to visit it again, but this time for a romantic dinner. I am recommending it to everyone who cares to listen!!
