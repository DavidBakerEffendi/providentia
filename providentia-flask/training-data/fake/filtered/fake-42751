I ordered their burger and was offered the choice of fried bun or a regular bun. "A friend bun is our thing." I ordered the fried bun and didnt expect anhting more than a slightly toasted bun. What I got instead caused my heart to stop. The burger was stuffed inside a zeppoli. I dream about this burger. Bring a couple of friends and share it. Make sure one of your friends is a cardiologist.
