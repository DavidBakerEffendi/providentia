i went to this place last saturday, it was fantastic !!!!!! the lady that was in charge was the generous and nice personthat i've never met. the food was great. especially their spicy fish and dumplings. you guys HAVE TO TRY IT OUT !! and because it was also my friend's birthday, the lady in charge gave us free birthday noodles. my friend was so touched by her, he ended up leaving 40 dollars tips to her. However, that sweet lady did not take it, he gave back 20 dollar to him and said she just did what she supposed to do and then thank him. this is the nicest restaurant experience i've ever had. food are great and peopel are nice. Even though they weren't doing a really good business right now, i hope it'll get better and better every day!!
