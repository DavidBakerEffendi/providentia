What a lovely experience! Had just arrived in the city and was looking for a gluten-free friendly restaurant near my hotel. The staff was super accommodating and double checked with the chef to make sure everything was gluten-free. The scallops were absolutely amazing! Perfectly matched with green apple puree and thick pieces of bacon. (Great with Samuel Smith's Organic Cider!) The head chef/owner is great, really personable, and has a real love for cooking and owning a restaurant. The genuine smiles on his staff are the proof. Check it out!
