This pizza is great!!! I headed out to Manhattan just to try this pizza. I used to live in Brooklyn where I could get good pizza but after moving to Long Island it was hard to find a good place to eat. I heard about Lombardi's on the History Channel and that they use a coal oven to make their pies. Wow what a difference you can taste a truly original pizza; how they used to make it in the good old days. When I got there the place was packed out but even though there was a Â line and a lot of people inside the wait time for me was about fifteen minutes; not to bad considering all the other restaurants like Outback and Applebees usually make you wait thirty to forty five minutes and I did not have a reservation. Once you walk inside you can see all of the history of that pizzeria hanging on the walls a lot of people have been there including celebrities which just gives this place another wow factor. This place is great and it is not to expensive Lombardi's is a must see if you are traveling to New York and the pies are infinitely better than any Chicago deep dish.
