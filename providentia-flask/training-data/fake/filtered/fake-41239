The best ramen noodle soup I have ever had. I think this little place is better than Ippudo and any other ramen place in NYC. Just be aware that it is really small so not a good place for large groups. Also you can't make reservations in advance so be prepared to wait. The wait of course is so totally worth every minute of it. Yummy, delicious flavored Ramen.
