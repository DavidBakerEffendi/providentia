We came here from a recommendation by another aussie and it definitely lived up to the expectations and more. It was a little dark inside but maybe it was because it was a gloomy day, lovely and intimate atmosphere though. I especially loved the decor inside. Our waitress was just lovely, got chattign with her who recommended a few places for us Aussies to check out in Manhattan and was really helpful (we didn't get your name but you were just lovely and we hope you got our large tip!) Soooo yummy!!
