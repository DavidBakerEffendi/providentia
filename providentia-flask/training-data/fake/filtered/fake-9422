ok, i am a kid, i Know i am not supposed to write reviews on the best restaurant in the world. let me just say i had the best cheeseburger in the world at the little owl. perfectly cooked classic burger bun 2 or 3 slices of firm juicy mouth watering bacon 1 or 2 slices of melted american cheese one blessed cow. 1 more perfect bun i went there for my graduation dinner and it was way more than i expected. my family heard that some critics said that the Little Owl was the best burger in the world but and i TOTALLY agree. i cant comment about the alcohol but the iced tea was great. the service was more than i can ask for my sis wanted tomato juice and the waitress said she might have it in the Â basement and she went in to the basement and got it. the location was perfect. there was not a lot of cars beeping (in fact there was none at all) It was quite busy but not loud. Tip: make a reservation next i will try the pork cops me and my dad are trying to recreate the burger but i don't think we will come close. the desert was great
