Soco is an amazing date night restaurant. I attended Friday night around 10pm. Everyone had seats; there was minimal waiting. The lighting at Soco was dim, so it gave off a very intimate atmosphere. *Thumbs Up* I had the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffle. I have never tasted a waffle so good. I believe my boyfriend had the pecan crusted or covered pork chop. He enjoyed that very much as well. We also had a side of mac & cheese & cornbread. Those were very tasty too. The servers at Soco were very nice. The bathrooms were clean and the restaurant is very beautiful and cozy. I also enjoyed the background old school R&B very much. I definitely recommend attending. Enjoy!
