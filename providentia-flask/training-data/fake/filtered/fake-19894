One of the best take out middle eastern joints in the borough.  Simple and very consistent.  The hummus is creamy and well done.  The chick peas have been pealed before crushed and there is a good balance of tahina and spices.  Not over spiced, thank god.  Food is authentic and is home style and not pretentious.  Best of all, the price is a bargain.  Why can't we see this more often.  Even my picky prek kid wil find something she likes.  The staff is always nice even though they look a little intimidating.  Having extended family from Lebanon, I can say even they were impressed.  The falafel was not dry and perfectly spiced.  This is a must when visiting the new "village" of NYC.
