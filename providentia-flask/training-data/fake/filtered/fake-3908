Came here Thursday for dancing, it got a full dancefloor around 1230, the music was great and it was still really easy to get a beer at the bar.  Came back Saturday morning for their brunch.  If the attached diner fills up they open the bar section to patrons, don't worry, the bar cleans up nicely to accomodate for the brunchers.  Food was awesome and reasonably priced and the service was really good (for a night out drinking or the morning after.
