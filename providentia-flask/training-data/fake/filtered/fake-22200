Have only been here for dinner, and enjoyed it every time. It is always fresh, the staff are friendly, and it has a great ambience. It's a small spot so expect a little bit of a wait if you don't have a reservation - but it will be worth it. Would recommend the BBQ squid app, the sashimi is always great, and the 2000's house special rolls are worth trying.
