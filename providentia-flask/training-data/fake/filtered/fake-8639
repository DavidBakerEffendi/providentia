Ten stars!!! This place you would never even know exists if somone didnt tell you about it. Opera singer in house while you eat:) What a good time! We even stayed until everyone left and hung out with the owners. They were so down to earth and friendly. I felt like we just ate over a family or friends house but got served and had an opera singer show up at our house. I would highly recomend this establishment.
