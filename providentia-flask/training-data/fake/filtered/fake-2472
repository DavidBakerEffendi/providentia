El Vez! EL YEAH! I've been here a few times and man the food is excellent. Mexican food at it's finest and the tricked out bike over the bar is a nice touch. The blood orange martini is excellent and the De La Hoya guacamole is next level. I also love knowing the fact that the spicy food would certainly debilitate Scott Bisceglie. The thought of the pain it would cause him only inspires me to come back. VIVA LA RAZA!
