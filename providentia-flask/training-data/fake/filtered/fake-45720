I recently went on a date to this restaurant in Philly.  In terms of the food and service, I was blown away at how good it was.  We chose to do the chef's tasting menu.   The first course of prosciutto, cheeses and olives was delicious!! And, every course that followed was equally good! The only drawback was the noise and the closeness of the tables.  It was really hard to have a conversation with my date.  Other than that, it was an excellent experience. The service was excellent.  Our server was so much fun!  And, she had a ton of "useless information" about the food we were eating that I thoroughly enjoyed!
