Never disappoints..always a treat.. Great cocktails..assorted starters platter is good if u like fried stuff.. Husband got red curry which was great.. I got the Bangkok chicken pumpkin curry..was disappointed with that..as it taste pretty much like the red curry with pumpkin.. Desert cake was standard. Decor is very hip and modern
