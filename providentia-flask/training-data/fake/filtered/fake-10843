Cute little place to hang out with friends. We ordered the crawlfish with very spicy sauce. It is addictive, yes! Eating directly from a huge plastic bag and throwing the shells into the bucket on the table, sounds like a lot of fun, Huh? Recommend it! Â Well, there is always a long line, but it is definitely worth the waiting!
