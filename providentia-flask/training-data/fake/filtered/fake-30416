We went here on a Thursday night to celebrate our anniversary. Being vegetarians, we found the menu online to be inviting (that is, there was more than one vegetarian option). We also liked what the restaurant stood for (local, sustainable food), so we decided to give it a try. For most of the night, we were the only ones there (another couple showing up just before we ordered dessert). This was a bit strange, for lack of better term, but also made us a bit concerned about this restaurant because we genuinely liked it (and this is part of the reason we decided to get onto Yelp and give it our rating). The service was friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable, and the food was good. I wouldn't say it was amongst the best restaurants in New Haven, but we would definitely go back again. The bread/scone basket with the infused butter was a good start to the meal. I had the roasted bell pepper with multi-grain pilaf stuffing. It was a bit sweeter tasting than the way we make stuffed peppers. However, once I got past that, I enjoyed them. The side vegetables (green and yellow squash and purple potatoes) were a bit uninspired. My wife had a two of the appetizers as a meal - the vegetable tempura and the risotto balls, both of which she enjoyed before realizing her entire meal consisted of fried foods. We also shared the black garlic with toasted bread, which was good, but sweeter than we expected. The big test of the garlic will be when we offer some to our 6 year old daughter who is a garlic fanatic. For dessert, my wife had the blueberry (and blackberry) cobbler, which she liked a lot. I had the amaretto creme brulee, which seemed a bit overcooked, but was very tasty. The wine list is decent, and probably perfect for this type of restaurant. We would recommend this restaurant, and definitely hope it sticks around...
