I grew up just outside of Philadelphia. A place where a good hoagie is a given.  I was surprised when I moved to the Trenton area that finding that good hoagie would be so hard. (finding good pizza is much easier)  My search ended at Chiarello's. They understand what goes on an Italian hoagie. Bologna should never be an option. The rolls are always fresh. I was told by someone working there that they get more than one roll delivery per day so they can always have the freshest bread.
