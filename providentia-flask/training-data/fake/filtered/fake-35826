Tried this restaurant for the first time for lunch. LOVED the Italian potatoes; I am a very picky eater so I tweeked the Chicken cutlet club sandwich; great crispy crunchy roll with grilled chicken, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella, and a balsalmic vinagret which was a semi thick consistency which was delicious. Â I also had a side ceasar salad which was great also. Intimate setting no kids around which was a nice change. Very soothing environment; GET the Italian potatoes....to die for!!!!
