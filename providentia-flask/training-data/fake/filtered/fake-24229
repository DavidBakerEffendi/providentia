This place makes a good thin crust pizza and shrimp parmigiana.  Everything else is pretty average.  However, be sure to only use it for delivery.  The ordering area is chaos, with no orderly line, and people who cut to the front are rewarded by getting served right away while, if you're patient and polite, then you'll be waiting a long time.  The service is indifferent and they really could care less if you took your business somewhere else, but the delivery guys are nice and prompt.  It surprises me that they're better at delivery than take-out, which you'd think would be easier.
