This place is fantastique! In the city, food this good would be twice this much. They haven't raised their prices in all the time that I have eaten there. Which is unusual in ny. This is the way felafel is meant to taste (for all those of you not in the know). If it tastes any other way it's due to budget set backs. All their other salads and stuff are also worth trying.
