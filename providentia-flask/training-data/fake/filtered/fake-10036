Been here a few times, food is always a step above the prices.  The problem is the crowd, too aspiring for the 'sex in the city' life style , shrieking included.  But the real problem is getting in. Tonights issue was a boring guy who could not give an estimate for a table of four then when our group had arrived and ready to be seated he still couldn't say when a the table would be ready.  Many 4 tops were available in sight at 7:30pm on a Thursday (and they don't take reservations),  Service was stupid not worth the time to try and get in...  Sevilla is a few steps away but run by professionals, whole different story.
