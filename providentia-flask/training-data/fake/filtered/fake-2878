2 people in our party were throwing up within 15 minutes of leaving here and sick for over 24 hours with food poisoning. Â  The food was not that good first time down- trust me it was even worse as it repeatedly came up. If that isn't enough the service is indifferent and the place seems like a disorganized mess.
