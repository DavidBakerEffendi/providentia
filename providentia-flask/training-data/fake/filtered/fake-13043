Ok food but service sucked. Sat down at 5:45 pm. Dinner arrived on our table at 6:45 pm.  Waiter had his tail up his rear the entire time and never came over to apologize for the wait. The guy who came out with our dishes (1 dish per half hour) said the stove was broken and now fixed, But why did tables around us get their food first even after they were seated after us?  There are tons of other great Thai restaurants around the area with better service and food. This place got too big for itself. Overrated for sure.
