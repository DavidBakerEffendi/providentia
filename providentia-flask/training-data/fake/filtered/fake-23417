Greenpoint Heights would be a cool place to hang out, good food, nice bar selection, trendy decor.....if not for the rude and nasty bartenders. It is incredibly difficult to get their attention to actually order a drink, despite that there are often three of them; Depending on who serves you, the prices for the same drinks change; While I was at the bathroom one of the bartenders took all my money off the bar, over $20, and then had the audacity to ask for her "shift change" tip; and then she continued to work until closing.      I will definitly not be going back there, as long as it remains under the management of people who are so obnoxious towards thier customers.
