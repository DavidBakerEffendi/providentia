Best brunch spot in Brooklyn. My roommates and I have to limit ourselves to going only once a week. I'm a little nervous to write this stellar review because I don't want it to get too popular and crowd our #1 spot... but I can't help but say great things for them. I love everything about this place. First of all, the food is absolutely delicious. The Beef Hash as well as the Biscuits and Gravy are both to die for. Also, when they say bottomless brunch, they mean it! I've been to too many brunch spots where "bottomless" really means two glasses if you're lucky. Not Jeatjet. They have your next mimosa on the table before you even think to ask for another. And they'll keep 'em coming for as long as you want. The staff is super friendly and helpful, the atmosphere is chill, and the decor is rusticly cute. JeatJet gets an A+ all around in my book.
