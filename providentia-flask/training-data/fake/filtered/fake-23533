I have been going to this place since infancy. Not the same as when Pete (the Mario looking guy for those walking down memory lane with me) was there overseeing! But as long as Gus is there it's still the best Greek pie you can get in New Haven! I'm from Wooster Street (home to the Italian big timers: Pepe's, Sally's & Abate's) and I have to say that Pizza House is still amongst the top 5 overall in New Haven!
