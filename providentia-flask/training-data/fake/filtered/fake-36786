The staff was incredibly rude and showed no regret for how they treated us. The excuse from the female server was "sorry you're upset", which showed no self awareness on how she treated her customers. Even when one of the people from my group, who has incredible serving experience pointed out her flaws, she got defensive and made it seem like it was our problem. The "manager" was also rude and did not help resolve any issues with our service. The group of the staff all congregated at the front service table where you pay, where they were talking badly about our table for complaining. An extreme sense of arrogance from that place. I would never recommend it. My food was subpar at best.
