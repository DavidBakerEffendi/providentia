Super yummy! Everyone should try it at least once. They have a really good shrimp/lemongrass soup. The pad Thai and chicken fried rice is also very good. The bar is also fun, too. Everytime family visits us from California, Maryland, or even just friends from NYC, we take them to TOB's and they've all loved it!
