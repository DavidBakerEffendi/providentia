I love this place. Their shawarma is top notch and absolutely delicious. After a night of drinking, nothing hits the spot like one of their shawarmas. Not only is it delicious, but it's filling and affordable. And their lentil soup - just great. The only drawback are the lines that can form. Since it is such a small area, the line can get a little crazy at times. But it's so good that I'm willing to wait in the cold for one of their falafels or shawarmas.
