I've lived in Bushwick for a couple of years and ate at 983 when it  was Life, and again under its new ownership.   * I love the new look!  It is cleaner and feels more spacious.   *The menu has some changes, but mostly for the better, in my opinion.  I've had brunch and dinner there, and both meals were great.  (The eggs benedict sea-style are my new favorite!)  The prices aren't crazy...there are far pricier restaurants in Bushwick, believe me! * There are some pricier cocktails, but I can still get my $5 Brooklyn, so I'm good!  :) *The staff has mostly the same people, as far as I can tell, including the kitchen guys.  (Yay, Danny! Yes, even the employees behind the scenes are known by the customers.  Love that! )  And when John, Andy and Alec (bartenders) have such great rapport with their bar regulars, why would they want to change?  (I think some new faces are there temporarily to train, not take over.)   Also, sorry, but I have to say it...I was confused when I read about all of the boycotting, etc, because that is not at all the vibe I get, and I was told that a former employee (who left of their own volition) was upset and causing a commotion.   There are many Bushwick residents who make their livelihood off of this restaurant.  If you want to try to close a restaurant down to hurt the servers, bartenders, kitchen staff, many of whom have worked there for years and have done nothing to deserve your ire, that's pretty selfish.  Again, my opinion.
