I wish I had come across this restaurant sooner. Having always been a fan of malatesta and not realizing there was a sister restaurant, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon malaparte and decided to give it a try. Not only was the food off the chart, the service was impeccable. I have to say that the service as malatesta has gone seriously down hill which is why we were on the look out for a new italian favorite. My boyfriend and I enjoyed a wonderful meal and kept it mind for the next time we wanted a low key evening with great food and wine. Fast forward 2 weeks. My family came to visit, which included my parents, 2 brothers in their early twenties and one of their girlfriends. May I also mention that my father is extremely impatient and we had a diverse group of tastes. After the wonderful service, reasonable prices and great food we had the last time we were there, we decided to take the group to malaparte. The wait staff made the night our most enjoyable meal of the visit. The staff was attentive, made sure the group always had drinks and the wide range of food, came out quickly, done to perfection and no one was waiting for their dish. Additionally, when paying the bill we did not notice that gratuity had been included (due to the extremely reasonable prices) and tipped on top of it. The staff immediately pointed it out to us and returned the extra money. I can not say enough I impressed I was by the staff. Thank you for such a wonderful evening, it went off without a hitch and the family couldn't have enjoyed it more! (also failed to mention, this is my first yelp review, joined just to post on this restaurant!)
