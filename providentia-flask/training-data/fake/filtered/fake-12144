Janet was my server, what a great job she did!  Friendly, personable service and great food.  I had been here before, it was night time, a very different crowd.  This time here in the afternoon, very cool neighborhood feel.  Old friends catching up, young people gathered to watch the game. I would definitely make the Pour House a stop on your Vermont tour, easy access and near the airport.  Please tell the Owner Jay Germani that Sully sent you, he might buy you some of Ed's famous wings!
