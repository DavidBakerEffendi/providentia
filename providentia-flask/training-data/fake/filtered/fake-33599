I came here with my sister last Thursday night at 7:45pm. We were seated upstairs. It was fairly empty when we arrived. After looking at the menu for a few minutes we made our order. We got the beef momos to share, I ordered the goat thali and she ordered the beef fried rice. Hungry and excited to try the food, we waited for over 30 minutes before they brought the momos to our table. It was slightly cold and not as good as I was expecting. They were dry and the dumpling shell chewy. For the price we paid for them, we could've gotten better dumplings/momos at a different place. Not discouraged, we hoped our entrees would be better. We waited another 30 minutes and by then I was getting frustrated. The patrons sitting by us also haven't gotten their food yet. They had ordered a few minutes after us. I was very hungry and antsy at this point. I suggest to my sister that we pay for our appetizer that we had already eaten and just leave. My sister said since we already ordered, they probably already made it and she didn't want them to waste the food. We waited another 15 minutes before they brought the food to our table. The goat thali was pretty tasty but the portions were extremely small for the price. I tried my sister's fried rice and it had a strong fish taste to it. I wasn't sure how to make of it. Overall I was highly dissatisfied with my dining experience. The atmosphere was very nice and I liked the water tins. However due to the slow service and the food, I could only give this place a 2/5. We won't be returning.
