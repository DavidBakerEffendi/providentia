I was passing through old city tonite stopping at the book store and cds, on my way back I saw that the Khyber Pass Pub was opening tomorrow (November 9th). I peeked in the window and saw a bunch of people (Mostly beer reps) quenching their thirsts and sating their appetites, one of the owners (Who I've known for years) caught me peeking and opened the door and invited me in.     The old bar is still there, but the other room is completely re-done, the stage where you've seen many bands play over the years is gone, replaced by wooden floors that looked like they came from an old church. and chairs and tables of different sizes and types, I was told by the bar manager that they are still working on their beer list but I started off with a Ballast Point Even Keel which bode well.     I found a seat at the bar and tried some of the new menu from Mark Mckinney, mostly Southern fare, with pub favorites thrown in. I sampled some Gumbo, which was good, but I was blown away by the fried chicken with mashed potato and collared greens. Thanks to The Khyber Pass Pub my membership in the cklean plate club is in safe stamding.
