I have been to McLadden's Pub twice now. The first time the bar was packed, wall to wall people. It took at least 20 minutes to get a waitress and then another 15 minutes to get our 2 draft beers. We were surprised by the crowd. We were hoping this neighborhood establishment would be a lot less 'club' environment and more professional clientele. After an hour we decided to get a bite to eat. This was not a great experience either. Between the amount of time it took to get nachos and wings (an hour) to the poor quality (wrong food delivered, very limited cheese on nachos and not heated, etc.. ) we were disappointed. However we decided to chalk it up to new restaurant and give it another try. We are sad to report we went back Saturday night and our results were not much better!!! It was very loud, we could not hear our own conversation. After sitting for close to an hour, our food still was not ready. When we questioned our waitress, she was polite and apologized but said there was a delay in the kitchen... We were offered more drinks, but really wanted our meals. When the food finally arrived, soup was luke-warm,my burger was not cooked the way I asked and the cheese was not what I asked either. The reuben was ok- hoped the bread was grilled because the bread was soggy. Beer selection is great, but food quality and timeliness of food was too much...We are hoping 3 times may be the charm?
