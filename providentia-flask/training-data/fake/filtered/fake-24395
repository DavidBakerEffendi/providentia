The drinks and food were both overpriced, and when I asked about freshness/local foods, my server told me the majority of food was premade/frozen from Sysco (Gross!) While sitting and trying to enjoy my mediocre (at best) food, it was hard to relax while watching the employees running about (several had completely sweated through their shirts), as the owner was schmoozing and drinking at the bar. Although the view was beautiful, it hardly seems to warrant paying a very steep bill for poor food, drinks and overworked staff DON'T GO!!
