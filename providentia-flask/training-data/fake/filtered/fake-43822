I had another great experience at Landmarc recently.  I used to live in Tribeca and frequent Landmarc often, having moved about a year ago, I recently went back with a group of colleagues.   We had a great table and were seated promptly.  We ordered a few bottles of wine which were nice and relative in price to others.  To start we had calamari and mozzarella, ricotta and zucchini fritters.  For entrees we had a variety of dishes, I had filet mignon which was perfectly cooked - really good piece of meat.  For dessert we shared Landmarc's dessert sampling which was also good.  The service throughout the night was very good, never had to ask for anything, our server always anticipated requests and , made recommendations for portions.
