While the food was decent and the atmosphere was okay, the service was poorly lacking. My girlfriend and I were eating lunch in a mostly deserted dining area. We ordered apps and drinks. Another group of 6 women came in and were seated next to us shortly after we arrived. Our server took their drink order then came and took our order for our meal. She did not give us our drinks. About 5 minutes later the ladies received their drinks, we still did not get ours. 3 minutes later our appetizer Â came out, but no drinks. The appetizer was okay, the mozzarella sticks were fresh, but the chicken was obviously frozen and over salty. Finally, after 20 minutes when the waitress came out to clear the plate I had to actually ask where our drinks were. Turns out she had forgotten about them. After getting our drinks the pizza came. Very traditional New York crust, but a bit undercooked and very greasy. The price was not bad, $32 for lunch; but due to the lackluster service and frozen food, I do not recommend this as a family restaurant. If you are in a hurry, you can order a slice to go, otherwise I wouldn't waste the time.
