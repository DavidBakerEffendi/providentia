Truly disappointing. Positives, busy vibe, even on a Â Wednesday night. The corn chowder was amazing. The raw bar was very good. that ends positive list. Service is just horrible, these servers are not even trying to pretend they are interested or care about quality. just so slow it was unbelieveable. The air conditioning was dripping on our table and many other tables as well. just disgusting, Flat fish was over breaded and over capered....just not good. the bill for 6 was over $500....for a horrible experience. run, ran way from this flashy/trendy place because everyone else will be soon.
