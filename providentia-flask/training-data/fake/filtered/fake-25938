NOPE, I've been here several times and really want to like this place, but NO.   They have a decent beer selection, but that's where it ends.  The beer/drink prices are outrageous...  $10 for a 1.5 oz shot??  Um hello, is this S. Philly or NYC?  the food is bland at best...  and the owners constantly 'lurk' around looking at you -- if you've been here, you know exactly what I'm talking about.  Freaky.
