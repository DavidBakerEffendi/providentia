Ordered in a few times but never eaten there so I can't comment on the setting. That being said, the food is fantastic. Being a first generation indian-american, I can easily say I've eaten my share from many types of Indian eateries...this is one of the best. So far I've tried the chaats, chicken, tandoor, veggies, breads, all have been excellent. The food is fresh and the spices are very well balanced. Â I highly recommend the chicken rashmi kabob, wheat roti, any chaat, bhindi. Hope these guys are around a long time.
