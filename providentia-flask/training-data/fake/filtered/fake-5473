This place is amazing. I expecting a wait since the restaurant is supposed to be really popular but our party of four was seated right away. I forget what the name of the ramen was but I had the spicy type of ramen and it was delicious. This is real ramen, not like the type you make from the dollar packages. I would recommend that you order the pork buns too. They are very quick with getting your orders and the waiter was very nice.
