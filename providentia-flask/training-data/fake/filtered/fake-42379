I went to Saxon + Parole the other night with a girlfriend and had a fabulous time. We went early and started with a yummy cocktail at the bar. I don't remember what the drink was called, but it was sweet and boozy at same time. The scene at the bar was so pleasant; a nice breeze, friendly bartender, and neighbors that we really liked (we decided to forgo a table and at at the bar instead because of them). Everything we ordered sounded super-simple, but the flavors were complex. The mini seafood tower was a real surprise. I'm used to this being straight-forward -- raw oysters with some clams and shrimp. I think the mussels were smoked? It was a flavor explosion. The mushroom pot is amazing! It's so light and tastes like the essence of mushroom. I probably would have been happy with just the starters and a cocktail, but we also ordered the short rib. I always order short ribs when they are offered. These were perfect (actually one very large rib), juicy, falling off the bone with a slightly crispy, tasty coating. YUM and YUM. The interior of the restaurant is also very cool, but everyone was focusing on the food. We were so into our meal that a couple sitting near to us at the bar copied our order dish for dish.
