I think that this place is one of the better chinese buffets in the state. We drive from quite a way in ordeer to go there. They have a great combination of "American "style chinese food as well as more authentic chinese food. For a very competitive price you have peking duck and lobster during dinner!! Great selection. We go most holidays so that everyone can have what they want and as much as they want. Highly recommend.
