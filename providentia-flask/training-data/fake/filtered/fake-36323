Tourist trap, tourist trap!  Couldn't wait to try the pasta the duck ravioli and also the short rib bundles.  We have a family of 3 generations of Italian restaurants.  We have eaten all over Italy and are very well traveled and eat in many of the top restaurants and this was awful.  We have never not finished our meal or left before dessert. Scarpetta's gets first place for us hating our meal.  The duck ravioli tasted like strong cheese (no hint of duck or anything else), the short rib pasta bundles tasted like mushy baby food - ugh!!!  This restaurant is just bad
