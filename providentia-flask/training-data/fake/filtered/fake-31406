I went here once to celebrate my cousin's birthday. I ordered the seafood plateau for appetizers (this is meant to be shared) which was excellent. For the main course I ordered steak of course. I had the cut of the night cooked medium and it was perfect. This came with garlic herb french fries and I also had a side of creamed spinach. Overall, the food and service was amazing. The only thing is that it is a little pricey but you do get what you pay for. While it might be a little expensive for some, I'd definitely recommend it especially if you want to celebrate a special occasion.
