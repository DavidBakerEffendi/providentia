We had not been in this location since the new management and remodel (hard to believe that was 4 yrs ago).  Went with family of 3 + in town nephew who just loves Hibachi!  None were disappointed!  Easy seating, clean, great, very friendly and attendive service, great show, excellent food and prepared wtih great flavorings.  My husband commented that it was much less greasy then previous place.  The kids LOVED it.  We were asking what the various "squirts" were and one was sake!... when we showed shocked, the chef proceeded to "squirt" a mouthful for my husband to try to the amusement of all!  Made for a fun, family oriented gathering to share our week.  Great end to a tough week and we all walked out very satisfied and full, not wanting for more!  Bill was also VERY reasonable vs. other places in the area... kids got off for less than $12/meal + got to try Japanese soda (for all those not in the know, adds an additional level of entertainment to "ready it")!  Given it is a BYOB, bill with tip was less than $100 for 4 people and that included 4 of the Japanese sodas!  Will definately return!  Sorry it took us 4 years to realize it had re-opened and was so good!
