Fish tacos had no flavor certainly due to total lack of seasoning and cod with the consistency of paper. Restaurant out of Chardonnay and diet coke. Husband ordered linguine with seafood which was just ordinary and not worth tolerating the deafening noise inside the restaurant. We had started outside but the chairs were completely uncomfortable. A long way to go before north end becomes acceptable and a go to spot. Very disappointing as we were hoping for a casual place for dinner on a regular basis.
