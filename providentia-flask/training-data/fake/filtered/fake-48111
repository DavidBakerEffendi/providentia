Blizzard of the century in New York and the host (not Italian) would not let us sit for a drink at the bar as it's "reserved for dining" Plenty of empty tables, lots of empty bar chairs. Guess the staff wanted to leave early. Can't blame them for wanting to leave early but come on! There are so many wonderful Italian restaurants in New York, operated by delightful Italian staff. We won't be going back!
