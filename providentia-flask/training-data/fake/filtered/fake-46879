First, I have to say that when I walked into this place, it was not at all what I expected. I am new to YELP, so when I saw that I worked a stone's throw from the #1 rated restaurant, I Â had to check it out. This place is a total hole in the wall. No big signs, no menu to take with you but don't let the fact that this place looks like a total dive fool you. The guys were very friendly and helpful, the service was lightning fast and the food... Good Lord, was amazing. We had the Italian Hoagie (Daddy Wad) and the Pork Sandwich and it was a life changing experience. I will never be the same. Be warned that this is cash only and you should also prepare to take your food to go because although they have seating, it is not much.
