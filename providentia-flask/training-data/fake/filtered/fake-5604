The food was very good, however, I did have to send the wings back, because they were not hot.  They fixed another order of wings for me, and they were very good.  I think the atmosphere in the restaurant is dedicated to a younger crowd, which was the composition of the crowd.  The seating was not the best, and very congested.  If anything some change should made (atmosphere) to try and draw the older crowds. We are in our late 60's, and really need a restaurant where the seating is more comfortable, and the lighting is less dramatic. Joe Holden
