absolutely the best pizza in Manhattan.... really interesting place,  they have a nice back room with a huge skylight, the mandatory wood burning oven and a beautiful open kitchen.   our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, i had the "cacio e pepe"  and it was as good as the one i had in Rome, my wife had the octopus appetizer and she loved it, but the pizza Emporio makes is what sets this place apart, buffalo mozzarella, san marzano tomato and light thin crust. simply outstanding.
