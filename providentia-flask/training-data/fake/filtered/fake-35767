Excellent food Exception service Imaginative combinations Was there yesterday with a party of 7 We could not have been happier Only negative comment: Â the French toast is fried...it should say that On the menu. Otherwise, it was perfect. I have read the negative reviews....I guess you can't make everyone happy Waitress was outstanding
