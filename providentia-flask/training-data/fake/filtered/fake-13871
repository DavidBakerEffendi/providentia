Pretty damn tasty. Nice big sandwich, hot and fresh ingredients. I'm sure it fulfilled my caloric intake for the day, but it was worth it! Â Had Turkey & Bacon and Cheese and Tomato, and lots of yumminess. Line moved quickly, friendly and efficient. Reasonably priced. Not much immediate seating, although there was plenty inside the office building Atrium. If you're in the mood for a sandwich, check it out!
