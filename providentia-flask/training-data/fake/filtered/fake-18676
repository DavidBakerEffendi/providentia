Went here for lunch right before heading to airport to head home to Chicago.  Really, really liked it.  We are in the tavern which was very comfortable and lovely.  Service was friendly and phenomenal.  We shared the fish cake salad.  Amazing!  I had a delicious cheeseburger and my friend had the chicken with sausages.  She loved her dish.  We split the chocolate, coconut and pecan cake with butter pecan ice cream.  I would go back for that alone.  WOW!  Loved this place.  Can't wait to plan another trip to NY and back to Gramercy  They take reservations in the dining room but not the tavern.  One of my favorites.
