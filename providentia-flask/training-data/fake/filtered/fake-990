Everything here is authentic and amazing! I would eat here every day if I lived closer. Whenever someone comes to visit me in Philly, I take them here. Everything I've eaten there is delicious, prepared with care, and brought to the table by FRIENDLY waitstaff. The waitstaff is friendly, accommodating, and patient (...having trouble deciding or waiting for the last member of your party to arrive). I could go on and on and on about how much I love this place. Check it out for yourself, you will not be disappointed.
