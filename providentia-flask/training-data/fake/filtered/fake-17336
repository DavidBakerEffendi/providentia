Shocked to find this place right around the block. Good food. I'm not into sushi but fianc√© loves it. He ordered some rolls w mango topping, said they were great. I had hibachi w filet n lobster. Lobster was grilled too long but steak n rice n veggies were great. Would return. We got delivery so I'm sure eating there would have been better but we have a baby so that wasn't possible.
