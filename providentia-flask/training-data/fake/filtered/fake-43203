Food is mediocre but attitude of owner is the worst - the  waitress and then owner asked us to move to accomodate a larger party just a few minutes before we were getting ready to leave (although there were other tables available that could have been combined to seat the other group).  When we protested, the owner pretty much said that we had been there long enough and she needed to turn tables.  When I said that I had never been asked to give up a table before she told me that I didn't get out enough.  Needless to say, neither my friend nor I will return - not for the food and certainly not for the service!  It's unfortunate because the owner fails to understand the importance of good customer relations in keeping a small business alive and we went there solely to be supportive since the food is really not the draw.  Don't know how long they will survive with mediocre food and really poor attitudes!
