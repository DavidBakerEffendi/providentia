It is surprisingly hard to find good, fresh food at very reasonable prices and Westville does this splendidly.  If you want a pork chop and scrambled eggs  with vegetable sides or meat and potatoes, this is it.  This is simple, wholesome, clean American fare.  Compared to the options around it the quality of the food, especially for brunch, sets this place apart in Chelsea.  Only slight problem is it is a) small and gets, obviously, b) packed.  Go on a weekday for lunch, same great food without the hustle and bustle.
