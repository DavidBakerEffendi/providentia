DELICIOUS but TOO SALTY...the selection of food is great and even vegeterians can have feast. beer and wine selection is wonderful, so my husband loves going there. make sure you get there early otherwise you will get really drunk before you sit at your table. my favorites are chicken liver toast, gnudi, prosciutto tart with arugola, their clam chowder and salads (artichoke or carrot salad, in spring radish salad) and dont forget the famous burger with tasty and addictive fries. i feel like stuffed pig after leaving the place but man it is good to pig out ... amaretto chocolate cake and famous banofi pie with fresh cream. writing this review i am getting hungry for more.
