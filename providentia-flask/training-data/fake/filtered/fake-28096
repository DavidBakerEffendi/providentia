My wife and I went with a group of eight for a quick bite and drinks.  This was supposed to be a first stop of three or four restaurants on our way to a concert.  We didn't make it to the other restaurants.  We couldn't.  What started as a couple of dishes to nibble on between sips turned out to be a full-on feast. Without a reservation (on a Thursday) we assumed we'd mingle around a couple of barstools.  We ended up at a great table in the bar area overlooking Chestnut Street. The Ensalada De Jamon is awesome.  Also try the Manchego Cheese with Truffled Lavendar Honey.  The Pulpo A La Gallega (Spanish Octopus) was also very good although the spices reminded me of Herr's BBQ chips (not that there's anything wrong with that!). Sangria is house-made and tasty.  Not a great beer selection (should a Spanish tapas place have one?) but the Alhambra Negra dark lager was decent.  We did get a solid recommendation from staff member on a nice bottle of one of their Spanish reds. Considering the size of our party, the staff was accommodating, friendly and attentive. We make every effort to find our way here when downtown.
