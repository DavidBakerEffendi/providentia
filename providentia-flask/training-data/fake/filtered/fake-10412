Zinna's is a very nice looking place, clean, neat but very loud even with couple seated tables. My overall experience was bad. It took long time for my food to go out. No apologies from the server. I didn't enjoy the wings appetizer and salad was just not fresh. I served before and know what to expect. Service was poor. A lot of things to be improved. Don't recommend it.
