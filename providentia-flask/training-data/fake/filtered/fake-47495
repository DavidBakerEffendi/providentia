Over the past few months I have been to Grimaldi's, Lucali, and Di Fara several times. Here's a breakdown: Wait: Lucali- Hard to get a table, arrive ahead or call early. Di Fara- Chaotic ordering system and very long waits for the pizza. Grimaldi's- A massive line administered by a pushy (physically) old man who takes larger parties ahead of smaller ones to artificially make the line seem like its moving. Ambience: Lucali- Small, cozy, candlelit setup. Wonderful view of a garden out back and the pizza being created. Di Fara- Cramped, loud, full of families fighting for tables. Grimaldi's- Loud, horrible music, faux-Italian/Brooklyn to cater to its tourists. Pizza: Lucali- Very thin and crispy. I have had several different kinds off of their limited menu and they all have been wonderful. Great calzones also. Di Fara- Very tasty and substantial, but so oily! Put me into a food coma for the rest of the day. Grimaldi's- Well when it came out it had a hole in it. As in there was a large hole in the pizza where pizza should be. After flagging down an employee to inform him of the issue, he explained to me that they have a large stove and "stuff happens." Very disgraceful that they do not stand behind their pizza. The pizza that survived the oven was decent. Overall, if you want a true famous Brooklyn pizza experience go to Lucali or Di Fara. Both serve amazing pizza that are worth the wait. The only people that will be impressed by Grimaldi's are those who would be equally happy with Sbarro in Times Square.
