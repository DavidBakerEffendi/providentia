I have had the pleasure of eating Indian food in different cities all over the country, but I can honestly say that most pale in comparison to my experiences at Karma.  I've been coming here for years since I was introduced to this little hidden treasure by my college roommate, and although the restaurant has undergone many changes over the years in ownership, decor and service (for the better!), one thing has remained the same - the food is exceptional! If you're looking for authentic Indian cuisine served by warm, friendly staff in a great location, then look no further.   I have so many favorite dishes here, so I have to recommend that you try as many as you can! The lamb vindaloo, the saagwala, the chicken tikka masala (a staple!) are all amazing - and the naan is simply the best. I just went back for dinner this past weekend with my brother who was in town from Chicago, and despite being a pretty tough critic when it comes to food, my brother was absolutely impressed with Karma as well.  The waiters were so friendly and attentive, and one of the owners actually came over to our table to introduce himself and make sure we were enjoying everything and having a good time - we honestly had no complaints!  Like I said, the amazing food has been what always kept me coming back for more, but it seems like they are turning over a new leaf with the new ownership and even better service.  I am excited to see what is to come, and happy to say I'll be a loyal patron for years!
