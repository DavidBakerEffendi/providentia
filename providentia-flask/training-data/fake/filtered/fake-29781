This is how Thai food is supposed to be- lots of flavor.  Excellent cooking/preparation and use of spices.  This place is really great.  Friendly service and a good atmosphere.  They have a $20 special that includes thai iced tea or coffee, an appetizer, soup and entree.  Can't beat that! BYOB too...
