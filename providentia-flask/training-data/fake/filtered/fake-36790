High End all the way! Made a secret reservation for my boyfriend's birthday here and he was no less than impressed by the end of the meal. We started with some red wine, crispy calamari salad (YUM)  and spicy duck meatballs (holy cow, these were divine)! One of the dinner specials was a sunflower head and my boyfriend is disappointed  to this day that he didn't order it. It's definitely something we may never see on another menu again. He opted for the fish special which was good, but his heart was set on the other dish. I ordered the porkchop...juicy, succulent and sang in harmony with all the sides it was accompanied by. We ordered the side of crispy brussel sprouts...again, tasty and delicious. We ended with grape jelly donuts...holy moly! What a great night...small spot, with a romantic vibe...give it a whirl, you won't be disappointed!
