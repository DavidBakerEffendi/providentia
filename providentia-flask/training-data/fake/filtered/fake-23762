When you're in Philly you have to try a Philly and Pat's is famous for them.  When sister said we were going to Philly there were two places I knew I wanted to go Pat's and Morimoto's.  A fancy and a casual. I only thought I had had a Philly before but having had the real thing has spoiled me for it now.
