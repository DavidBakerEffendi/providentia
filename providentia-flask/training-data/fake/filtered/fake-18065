I ordered the boneless wings with parm fries.  I enjoyed the wings and sauce which I thought were excellent.  The staff was friendly and even took time to chat with me while i waited for my order.  The place was very clean and the seating was comfortable.  I am planning on heading back there this weekend with some friends.  I had a great expereience and rate them at 4+ stars for their overall service and never frozen wings.
