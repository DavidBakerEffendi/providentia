BEWARE....THIS PLACE SUCKS SERVICES..SUCKS FOOD..SUCKS They have lots of variety in menu but don't know how to make it. I am pure vegiterian so can't comment on non-veg. The place looks nice from outside but, Â you will get very bad smell inside and not sure why? The food doesn't have any test to it..Go at your own risk..very ugly and uncomfortable sitting arrangement. I would not advice going there as experiment either.
