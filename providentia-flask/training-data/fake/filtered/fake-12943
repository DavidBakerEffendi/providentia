First time, last time. I only went because it was a friend's birthday and she chose it...so there you have it. We were a party of 12+ so we were a decent group for a sit down. Food was mediocre, place was cramped but the service was the worst I've ever had. Perhaps it was an "off" night for our main waitress but after reading the reviews regarding service, maybe I'm being more forgiving than I should. #1 she really didn't look like she wanted to be there (or employed for that matter) #2 orders were either mixed up or missing - of course, a couple apps and my dinner #3 the girls said the drinks were nasty and when I tasted it they were pretty bad      - certainly C students from bartending school #4 the check comes and some people were like "I guess no dessert?" The B@!#$ points at me and said "he said nothing else" and walked off!!!! I was so shocked I had no words at that moment which is probably good for her. I will never ever be a patron there even if it was the last place on earth. The rudest, uncomfortable place I've experienced in my life. I hope her attitude was worth it because she single handedly ruined that tip. I'm sorry if this place was tip splitting but damn.....just.....damn....By all rights we should've just walked without paying.
