This is definitely some of the BEST Italian food I have ever eaten (and growing up in NJ says A LOT)!  There is not one thing on the menu that isn't absolutely amazing, from simple pasta dishes like the stuffed shells to ornate specials like Rigatoni Special (I can't remember what it's called) with sun-dried tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil in garlic and oil!  There pizza, well tomato pie, is top notch.  I especially like their pan pies.  You can also create your own gourmet pie or get a pie with toppings on only a couple of slices!   The owner is always there so it is a great family atmosphere with incredible food.  And it's also BYO!  So come hungry with your own bottle of wine and enjoy the best Hamilton has to offer!
