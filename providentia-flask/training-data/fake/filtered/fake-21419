The food wasn't horrible, but, as other reviewers have pointed out, the service is quite bad. The waitress seemed downright angry with us for not being prepared to order immediately upon arriving, and was not pleased when we asked for separate bills. If it wasn't for the horrible service, this would be a decent Thai restaurant. But, as it is, I won't be coming here again.
