if you like thin pizza with little to no cheese, this is the place for you. i really like the thin crispy crust, but theres not enough sauce or cheese AT ALL. Â the second time i went there i actually had to order it with extra cheese and sauce but for the extra cost i didnt feel it was worth it. oh and they dont use amaroso's rolls for their cheesteaks. they use some sort of baguette which isnt that bad, but c'mon we're in philly! gotta go with amarosos.
