Went to g Lee's last week and am already craving the ribs again.! Have been here before a while ago and was greeted by this beautiful young server, I believe her name was Joy. She truly made my experience there wonderful. Was kind of disappointed when I didn't see her . The bartender was amazing. Very informative on the menu and knew what he was doing definitely. but the food!!!! I loved everything about it. Only reason why I give it 4 stars is because my Cajun corn And greens were a little cold. Otherwise, great atmosphere, great decor and great service! will definitely be back. Hopefully the waitress is back also. :-)
