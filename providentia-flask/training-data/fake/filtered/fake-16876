I recently went to ABC kitchen for my birthday and it was fantastic. I had been looking up restaurants in the city for a while and came across it on a list of the top restaurants in NYC. I was a little apprehensive choosing a restaurant from this list, as I didn't want to be disappointed if it didn't live up to the hype.  Well, it absolutely did! We had the ricotta apple dip, the raw scallops, and the roasted cauliflower for appetizers. All of them were amazing! The scallops were the perfect temperature, texture, and flavor. They had just the right amount of acidity.  The cauliflower was out of this world. It had pieces of smoked bacon and and nuts that made the dish amazing. For entrees we had the meatball pasta, the chicken, and the crispy pork. All of them were awesome. i would recommend the pork and the chicken if I had to choose two. We had the caramel ice cream and the carrot cake for dessert. They were also great. The service was spectacular and the inside of the restaurant was absolutely beautiful.
