Foodwise it totally deserves 5 stars Plus! However the service yesterday was not what one would expect for a 4 stars and a half restaurant. I get that on a Saturday night this place gets very busy but it was quite annoying to see the servers literally running to and from the kitchen and arguing with each other. Maybe they need another busboy 'cause the hostess was cleaning the tables which meant that she would "welcome" the clients with hands full with dirty dishes which was pretty uncomfortable. However, the food was awesome. We've been here 3 times already and we love everything we've always had. We always get pasta or risotto and love all of them so far. Our favorites are Papardelle, the black risotto with squid and the goat cheese ravioli. So, a piece of advice, even though they need to improve their service, this place is a MUST in terms on good Italian Food! Let's hope I can upgrade this review soon to 5 stars as it deserves!
