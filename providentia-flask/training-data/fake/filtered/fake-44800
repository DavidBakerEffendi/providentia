Fantastic.  One of the best Italian restaurants I've ever been to.  The people were so gracious and polite.  The food was really great and it was really busy.  I don't understand some of the bad reviews, because they were not at all what we experienced.  There are so many crazy people in the world.  I think this site should only allowing paying customers like open table to review restaurants and show a receipt.  It is not fair to any business to trash it and you don't even eat there, but leave mad.  So what?  We loved our three visits here over the last year.  It's completely worthy of it's praise and it's a small comfy place with excellent food and excellent service.   We would definitely come back next time we are in Philadelphia.
