Great food and a menu that offers great variety in really good seafood, steaks and salads. I bring clients here for lunches and dinners more than any other restaurant in midtown. The bar is lively but intimate. The restaurant is really well done and quiet enough to have a conversation. The guys who work the room (Aaron, Alex, Nick?) and the bartenders always remember your name and make you feel like you own the place. I sound like an ad, but I never write reviews. I love this place.
