Who would've thought that after going on a Pho pilgrimage across the country that I would find the best Pho I have ever eaten so close to home.  This place is the best, no question about it.  Pho Boston couldn't hold a candle to these guys.  I honestly love it all - the broth, the tender meat, gritty interior, and particularly the snotty attitude.  This soup is so good they are allowed to have an attitude.  Think the soup nazi on Seinfeld, it's that good.
