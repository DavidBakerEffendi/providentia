If you're in LES you need to try this place at least once. I get three tacos here about once a week. Food is always fresh. Nothing greasy or too salty. The Guaco Taco is out of this world, and I'm no vegetarian. I've never had something out that tastes that good and is "just" guacamole in a soft tortilla. The folks working and cooking are so nice. I iwish they had another location uptown closer to where I usually work, because I would totally be here more often. If you're in a hurry be prepared to wait for a few minutes at lunch hour. The place is tiny and they have like two people at most cooking orders, and everything is made to order. Not knocking them for this, but FYI -- don't be in a hurry and walk around the market if you need to wait ;) Edit: In addition to the Guaco I recommend the Cola-Braised Pork and Chipotle Chicken. I get this trio nearly every time.
