The atmosphere is ok, but the wait is just crazy... The food is delicious though... I loved the grilled octopus and the fried feta cheese. Also, you should try the stuffed sea food, simply delicious. I highly recommend this place but go there early and not on the weekends, unless you are willing to wait because they do not take reservations...
