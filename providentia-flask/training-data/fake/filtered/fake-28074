Amada has become our favorite spot in the city.  They consistently prove an ability to impress, no matter how creative we decide to get with our dinner selections.  The staff is courteous and knowledgeable, the atmosphere is fitting, the food is authentic, and we always walk out extremely happy. Two thumbs up to Jose Garces.
