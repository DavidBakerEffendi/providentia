Being a tango lover, I'm always attracted to the art  - music, food and people of Buenos Aires.   By chance, through a friend from West Chelsea, I had an opportunity to experience PORTENO restaurant! What a delicious experience! From the quaint ambience, amazing helpful and friendly southamerican staff, with perfect suggestions of appetizers, wines to pair, and the  entrees, just divine! Oh , not to forget the perfect music, not too loud, not too low, best traditional tangos and tango noveau  - I wish I had my tango shoes along.  My only recommendation is to have some lights out, since NOBODY should miss it, Even that  they have the perfect view of the Empire State Building to bless them! It still seemed a little dark and hard to find.  Enough with writing now and lets go Porteno.
