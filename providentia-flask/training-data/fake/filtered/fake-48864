For every compliment I want to pay this place, there always seems to be a complaint the goes with it: 1. The food I've eaten was usually pretty good! ... However half the menu seems to be unavailable (no lamb burger, no skewers, no reuben ... Wth?) 2.  The servers and bartenders are all knowledgeable.  Especially impressive service considering the bartender looked pretty uncomfortable rolling off the laundry list of things that weren't available ... ... However the staff always seems to completely change and the food seems to come out of the kitchen REALLY slow. 3.  The whiskey list was impressive! ... Again though, a good deal of what's listed is unavailable and some selections are a bit overpriced. To be fair, it was explained the whiskey list was changing extensively soon 4. The draft list is the best reason to go! ... Not so much for the cocktail menu though which is uncreative, pretentious, and overpriced With a spot this good, with the servers trying as hard as they are, I can't help but walk away with the impression that this place SHOULD be better than it is. It just can't seem to stop tripping over itself.  I prefer Growlers (about two or three blocks away). Selection isn't quite as good as The Barrel House's (should be), but they definitely have their act together when it comes to running their business ...
