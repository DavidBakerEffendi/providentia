My family and I have been coming to Il Michelangelo's since it opened.  Up until tonight the food was always excellent along with great service.  Tonight everything starting with waiting to be seated for 5 minutes until being acknowledged to the dinner was bad.  The Spedini which is usually amazing was nothing but a couple chunks of bread smothered in what tasted like over seasoned cream of mushroom soup.  For the first time ever in my life I sent my dinner back before they even put the plate on the table.  I have always ordered the veal saltimbocca because it is usually that good.  Tonight it came out in a different looking sauce covered in so much black pepper I would not touch it.  My daughter ordered the eggplant rollatini which tasted a little bit like dish water and my husband got the chicken and shrimp special which he could not eat either.  Very disappointing to say the least.
