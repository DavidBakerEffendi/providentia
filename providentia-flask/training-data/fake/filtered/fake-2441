Sorry Yelp reviewers... I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I actually went here based on the glowing reviews and was honestly a bit grossed out.  The soup I got had no flavor and I couldn't finish it.  The next day I never felt so bloated by the amount of salt I had consumed from it.  Pass on this one.
