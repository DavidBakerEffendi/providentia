Freeman's.  I LOVE YOU. EDIT:  I love you when you don't make me wait 2 frickin' hours to grab a table! Seriously though, I've never had a bad meal here.  The atmosphere is laidback, decor is hipster cool, and food is always good (if not a little heavy).  Try the devils on horseback, artichoke dip, and anything with trout.  I could eat here every night of the week and die happily. Minus one star for iffy service - sometimes it's great and sometimes it sucks.
