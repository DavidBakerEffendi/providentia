Sat at the bar for dinner during a recent business trip. 1/2 price beer & wine from 4-7pm, and a VERY generous pour on the glasses of wine. Ordered the homemade mushroom ravioli. I didn't realize they would be in a cream sauce or I wouldn't have ordered them, but they were declicious nonetheless! Great prices for a restaurant so close to Time Square. Will definitely be back.
