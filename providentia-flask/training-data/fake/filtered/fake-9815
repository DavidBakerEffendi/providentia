Visited MF last night to celebrate our anniversary - experience was incredible from start to finish.  We were greeted warmly by the hostess, and there was a welcome letter on our table wishing us a happy anniversary.  In fact, the entire staff was well-informed because our server and sommelier both knew about the special occasion and went above and beyond to make it memorable for us.  We were treated to complimentary champagne when we were seated. The food was amazing - I had the kampachi (citrusy, smooth, and refreshing) and my husband had the chili lobster (rich, warm, and spicy).  We both wanted to lick the plates clean.  We shared the chicken under a brick for 2, and it was the best chicken either of us has ever eaten.  I don't know how they get the chicken that juicy and flavorful, but it was incredible.   Served with Yukon Gold potatoes (my favorite) and broccoli rabe (not my favorite, but even I ate it because it was prepared so well).  The sommelier was helpful and informative and guided us to choose a wonderful bottle that complimented our meal perfectly.  Our server was kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and the perfect amount of attentive.  She even surprised us with a small peach consomme as a light dessert, and the kitchen wrote "Happy Anniversary" in chocolate on the plate.  It was quite a treat. The restaurant space itself is very attractive and well-designed.  There was a good crowd there that night, but noise was not an issue at all; the whole place has that friendly vibe about it.  We just wished we weren't seated next to a family with two young children who played on their iPod Touches and watched videos while their parents enjoyed the 3 hour-long tasting menu, but I suspect this is merely a sign of the times.  All-in-all, it was a wonderful dining experience and we intend on returning.
