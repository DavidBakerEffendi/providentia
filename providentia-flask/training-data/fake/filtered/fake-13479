I am traveling on business and the hotel I am staying at is a block away from this restaurant. Having never traveled to New Jersey and not knowing the area, I was really glad that this place was within walking distance from my hotel. I had the Lamb with Yogurt, I believe it was the first choice on the meat and yogurt section. It was delicious, cooked perfectly, tons of flavor, and portion size was good. If I am ever in the area again I will definately be stopping by. This time I will be more prepared for the BYOB!
