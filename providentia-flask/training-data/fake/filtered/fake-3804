My fiance and I went here on a random Friday night a few weeks ago, actually thinking it was a Mexican place (i'm not sure if we were just overtired and completely not paying attention), but when we found out it was French, we were thrilled (and luckily I had a bottle of wine in my purse just incase it was BYOB - which it was). Everything was delicious.  We had muscles for an appetizer which were finger licking good, my fiance got the Steak Au Poivre and I got the Sauteed Skate.  We both ate EVERYTHING on the plate.  We couldn't get enough.  For dessert we had the Flan and Bread Pudding and cappuccino's which were delicious.  At the end of our meal, the owner came over to check how everything was and offered us a taste of butternut squash souffle.  We were so full that we couldn't possibly eat anything else, but we enjoyed talking to him for a while before we left. The only reason that I don't give 5 stars is because later that night, I ended up getting sick (which rarely happens).  My fiance, on the other hand, did not.  So I'm not sure if it was something that I particularly ate or if something just didn't agree with me.  But regardless, I have to say that everything was seriously delicious.
