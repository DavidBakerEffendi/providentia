This place rocks me like a hurricane!! Yeah that's correct. I said that. I've only had breakfast but it's always been great. Stuffed french toast maybe the best french toast I've ever had. Â Huge, generous portions. Very reasonable prices. Cute place. Only drawback is it's a nuthouse on the weekends and I've always felt a little rushed.
