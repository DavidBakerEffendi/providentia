Had the absolute best experience last evening, thanks to Chef Angelo and his wonderfully attentive and gracious staff.  Loved the tomato mustarda; cheese & breads .....delicious!!  The homemade cavatelli w/trotter ragu....loved, loved, loved!  Had a sampling of almost all of the menu items (way too full to eat another morsel), and today I was thinking that I should have went the distance right on through to dessert!  The decor is cozy, warm, inviting and comfortable. Love the distressed feel to the place, and the outside garden really completes the ambience of The Pines. It was a full house last night and what I observed & heard were the sounds of "ums and ahhs", which of course = so delicious!  The Pines is a keeper; Chef Angelo is a treasure, and everyone near and far should pay this place a visit!  I know that I'll be back!
