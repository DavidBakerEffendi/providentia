Good beer selection, nice service and an overall nice experience.  Flatbreads are great, wings are killer.  Even the less "barlike" food is really good. Special note about brunch.  It is the best in the area, by far.  Do yourself a favor...avoid the lame place called the "strip joint" a block away, and come here for quality food and drink
