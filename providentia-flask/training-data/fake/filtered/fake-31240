This is my favorite pizzeria in the downtown/FiDi area.  I am a huge fan of the old fashioned pizza.  The tomato sauce is slightly sweet, and there is just the right amount of cheese.   Another staple item at Adrienne's is the Nutella Chocolate cake.  It is quite rich, but worth every calorie.  It melts in your mouth and completes the meal nicely.  When ordering, we often get extra slices to keep in the refrigerator for later.   Adrienne's also has great lunch specials.  I love the Tomato and Mozzarella salad, as well as the Stuffed Shells.  The chicken sandwich is just as amazing!!   Even with how much I love Adrienne's, I always order it to go, as it seems to hit the spot whenever I'm at home craving Italian food.  However, the actual restaurant seems quite inviting, right on Stone Street.  I have no doubt the experience would be even better if I were to dine there.
