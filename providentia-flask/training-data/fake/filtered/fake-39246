agree entirely with Lucas H. review.   At our table, we enjoyed the baked clams app and two pasta dishes, all very tasty. There are at least a dozen pasta choices, each pretty simple in composition, allowing perfectly-cooked noodles and flavorful sauce to be fully appreciated.  This is good old-fashioned family-recipe-style comfort food, but served in proper portion sizes (left feeling satisfied, but not uncomfortable) at very digestible prices. Now take the chic interior, knowledgeable servers, and creative cocktail list - not uncommon in this City, but refreshingly unpretentious here.   Galli was a perfect date night, and I'll definitely go back.
