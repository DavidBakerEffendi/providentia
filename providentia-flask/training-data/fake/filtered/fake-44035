My two friends and I went for dinner (around 8pm) at Caracas in Brooklyn on Thursday, March 3rd of last week.  It was absolutely wonderful!  The food and service were both unbelievably fantastic!  We were seated right away.  Our waiter answered all the questions about the menu for us. Everything was delicious!  In addition, the staff seemed very attentive to all the customers' needs.  Despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded, it appeared that the manager had a great process of efficiency. We all agreed that due to the food, the ambiance and the management, we will start being regular customers at Caracas!
