I live/work in Philly. My folks and relatives were coming in from out of town for some Italian Food. So I did an informal poll.  Some results I got were Cafe Valentino's, Davinchi's, Tres Scalini, and Scannichio's. But given that multiple people recommended Scannichio's at the top of their list, that's where we went. I obviously cannot speak o the first three, but we were very pleased with out choice. Mark was our waiter and he was very friendly and informative.  The Specials of the night seemed to go on and on but luckily we had one person in our party with a photographic memory who we consulted with.  It turns out we probably had one of each of the specials.  The Fig and Sausage starter, and  the artichoke and shrimp risotto were fantastic, but my favorite was the grilled romaine with strawberries and goat cheese(i think).   Half our party was in the clean plate club for entrées. One of these clean plates formerly had the crab cakes with a rose sauce.  Another had the lobster ravioli which lived up to the hype of being light and fluffy.  Another was the Brazilian fish dish.  The vegetarian in our group loved the stuffed eggplant. We even banged out 5 deserts from cannolis to tartufo to cheesecake.  Everything was great. We will be back!
