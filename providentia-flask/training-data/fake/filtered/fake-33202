I take all my visitors here, and they have all loved it. No fail! I don't know what it is...perhaps the magic white sauce...perhaps the way they marinate the meat? Whatever it is this cart is indeed a crowd pleaser. As you can tell from the line that extends past the cart... Summertime not such a big deal...Wintertime is another story. Worth the wait though, and these guys are pros. The line moves quick! Cha- ching for them....and a full belly for the rest of us!  Want a place to bring your out of towners?  Drunk and need some comfort food? Need a late night eat? Want to go into a food coma with a grin on your face? This place is your answer! DO IT!! Just remember to bring that cash!
