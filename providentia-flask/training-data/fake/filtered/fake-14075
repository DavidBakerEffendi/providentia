ya-hoo! what a find.... meggy & i kinda ended up here on accident, kinda. and when GPS got us there, we ended up in a strip mall across from a dennys next to a liquor store... it didn't look like much from outside. Then we took one step in the door, and everything changed! Great atmosphere, mood lighting, pretty blue lights and hold on here it comes.....happy hour! sushi & beer! The whole staff was super friendly but not annoying, the sushi, edamame and beer were fantastic and the price was right. Clean bathrooms, the absolutely only thing I would change is the music... kinda elevator-y. But then a guy came out and played live music so yeah, this place is great.
