I have not dined in person but have now ordered take out several times. Every time the food has a fresh taste and does not have the mass processed taste like you'd get at Chipolte, Qdoba and Moe's, all which I have had so the comparison was an easy one. Portions are huge and the pricing is spot on. Thanks for coming to Lyndhurst! Keep it up!
