While the food was just OK and the rose was subpar,  the service and attitude of the staff needs to be revamped.  We had to ask our server twice for drinks that were not delivered, and at one point, he spilled an entire glass of water on me and into my pocketbook.  I understand that accidents happen, and I received many "I'm so sorry", but they (I saw him talking to what appeared to be management about the mishap) didn't even offer to buy me a glass of wine. That shows a complete lack of regard for the patrons.  Needless to say,  we will never be returning to this establishment.
