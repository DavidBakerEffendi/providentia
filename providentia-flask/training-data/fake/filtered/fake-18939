I was tired, hungry, and wanted a hamburger but not wanting to venture any further stumbled into Artichoke.  Small line moved right along, and I ordered the regular slice which was pretty good, and easy to eat, but wasn't a $3.50 regular slice.   I  took a look at the artichoke pie which many seem to flock towards, but something about a dip base being on there that turns me away.  I'll stick with the basic tomatoe sauce, cheese, and the basil which is always a nice touch.
