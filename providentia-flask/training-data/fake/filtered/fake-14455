This has to be one of the best restaurants in this area. Rt 17 is just filled with scummy bars, fast food joints, and chain restaurants. Vesta is a breath of fresh air. Not only do they have an exceptional ambiance but the staff do not try to rush your meal like most of the other establishments I go to. They have many different signature cocktails to choose from and fantastic food! I had the wood fire lasagna and for dessert my family shared a Nutella Pizza....delicious! I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a quality meal. This place is great for lunch, dinner, or a quick drink. I would consider going here for breakfast if they were open for that too!
