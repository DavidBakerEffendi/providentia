This is a pretty disappointing chain.  The pizza is subpar (at best) and not worth ordering in the first place.  If you're looking for a pizza place, this isn't the one.  There are certainly better options in the area.. Their pasta and other options are decent--not exceptional, but they're good enough to merit ordering on occasion. However, their customer service is among the worst I've ever experienced.  I primarily order through online services, rather than calling on the phone, but that shouldn't really make a difference. Presently, I am waiting for an order that I placed at 8:15PM.  It is now 9:40PM.  I just called and the best they could offer was "Oh, we had a problem with our fax machine. Your order is out for delivery." Needless to say, I will no longer be ordering from Primo unless I don't expect to be hungry for 2 hours.  And also if I don't set the bar high for quality food.
