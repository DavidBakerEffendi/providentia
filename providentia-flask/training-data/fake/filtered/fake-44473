Teddy T & the Dirty Popps We've been going on Tuesday nights for 9pm trivia night. Always a good time. Can get a bit rowdy during the game, but that is to be expected. Plenty of good beer. Haven't tried alot of food, but can vouch for nachos, corned beef and meatloaf. Come to McLadden's...it's definitely w.o.r.t.h. it! See everyone tonight.
