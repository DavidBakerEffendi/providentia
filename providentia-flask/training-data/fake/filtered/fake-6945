Use to go to the one in Nutley for over 10 years, NEVER a bad experience. When I heard it was opening by my house, I was ELATED. I went there early in 2012 with a few friends bragging about it [thinking it was going to be like Nutley] and it was HORRIBLE. Cold apps, Greasy entrees and COLD coffee. WTF!? The manager wanted to give us drinks on the house. Well we don't drink. Went back about 9 months ago and it was AMAZING! I couldn't believe it. Super hot tasty food all the way around. Went back last night, NEVER EVER AGAIN! The food took FOREVER to come out, were never asked how we were doing, Apps were SUPER SUPER GREASY, dinner was NOT tasty at all and of course GREASY and I never wanted to run out of a restaurant so bad. We were such LOYAL customers and I have to say, I was never so disappointed like I was last night. Never EVER going back again,
