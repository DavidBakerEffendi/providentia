This place is ridiculous, I've eaten here once and it was actually quite good. But when you call a place and try to get delivery thirty minutes before the kitchen closes for the one hour changeover from "lunch" to "dinner" and they're no longer accepting deliveries in anticipation of the changeover than you really need to reassess your policies. I also walked in about a year ago at 3:45 and was denied a table in anticipation of the dreaded changeover. The food is really not that different and an hour is such a long amount of time, how is it acceptable to extend that hour. Grow some nuts and do your stupid job.
