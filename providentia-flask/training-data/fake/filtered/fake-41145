We visited the " new" restaurant in Manhattan and sat on the stools at the counter.  No wait.  The tuna appetizer was yummy.  Our Ramen Miso broths were nicely balanced with flavors.  The pork was fatty and tasted like the chicken.  Maybe it was that there wasn't much  flavor in either.  Unfortunately it felt heavy in our stomachs afterwards.
