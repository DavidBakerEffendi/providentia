Went here with my b/f and a couple of friends.  Our waitress (Justine) was the best ... I will ask for her again when we go back ... and we will go back!.  She came over timely and was very helpful with sugeestions and explaining the various menu items.  She regularly checked in on us through out the evening but not in a pushy way ... she was very friendly and sweet.  I checked in on Yelp and we got a free appitizer order ... WOO HOO - if it's free it's for me! ... they also brought over free plantain chips to start us off!  I ordered a Brazilian Red Sangria per the recommendation of Justine ... IT WAS AWESOME!  I Never had sangria like that before but they also have the more traditional version if you prefer .... but try the Brazilian one!  Again with the recomemndation of my new BFF waitress Justine, I ordered the plantain crusted BBQ mango chicken.  WOW that was very different and very good.  It comes with your choice of two sides ... I got the tostones and the spinich with garlic ... both were great.  if you are looking for a fun and relaxing place to hang out with your friends to have a good time that is reasonably priced ... then GO TO BOGATA!  You will not be disappointed.
