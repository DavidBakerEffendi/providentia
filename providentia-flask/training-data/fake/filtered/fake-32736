I went for my friends birthday and did not want to return.  Yes, the food is good, but it's not the best.  Yes, the long speech of specials are nice.  But the waitstaff was pushy about the wine which bothered us since most of us drove there and wasn't drinking.  They put a glass in front of me and poured some of the wine even though I said I wasn't drinking.  What a waste.  And since they were out of the bottle my friend ordered, they brought out a more expensive bottle and tried to sell it. After asking for the price on one special, ($26) the waiter gave us a scoff when we decided to order something less expensive. "Oh, THAT's fifteen."  Yeah buddy, we have the menu right here, WE KNOW its $15.   The manager explained to my friend that the waiters were just doing their job at being very attentive and dismissed her claim that the waitstaff was being pushy.  Whatever, none of us will go back anyways.
