I always thought chinatown fried dumplings were pretty much the same in taste, but my taste buds were blown away after trying the fried dumplings from prosperity.  The skin isn't thick but thin and crispy, just the way I like it.  The filling is juicy and full of yummy flavor.  Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.  There's always a hand full of people inside so a fresh batch is usually available.  This is a MUST try for cheap eats, so you could do justice to your taste buds.
