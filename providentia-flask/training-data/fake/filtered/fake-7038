Best bagel in town.  Super fluffy and not too dense.  Interesting flavors, too.  The Montreal Bagel was a great choice, would highly recommend it. If you have room for it, try one of their pastries.  The brownie was to die for!  Great service and a great atmosphere. I look forward to coming back again soon.
