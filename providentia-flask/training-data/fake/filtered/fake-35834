During the Halloween Parade, we happened upon this restaurant and were happy we did. The staff was very attentive and friendly, the ambience was nice and the food was surprisingly good. The pasta dishes, especially the gemelli, were excellent. We were capped off with lemoncellos and had a great experience. We didn't know it had just opened and predict they'll have much success.
