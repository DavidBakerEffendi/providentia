A wonderful experience all around! The restaurant has an amazing atmosphere and the food is beyond delicious. I especially recommend the oysters! Loved going for drinks after dinner in the neighborhood but could have stayed at County all night. It is the kind of place where you want to spend your entire evening, taking your time enjoying each dish and the company of the ones you are with.
