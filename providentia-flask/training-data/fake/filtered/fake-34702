I always like to try something new and go to a different place. I have been to Â Sanford's over 20 times and will continue to go back, it has become a regular place to go to. I do not have a favorite meal here because everything I have every ordered has always been delicious except for the organic chicken which has no flavor at all. I love their salads because its chopped.My favorite salad is peasant salad. Sanford's please add "The Almond Crusted Salmon" to the menu instead of being a special this is absolutely delicious.
