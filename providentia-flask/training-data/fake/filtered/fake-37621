I went to Pio Pio with my partner and a friend last Saturday night. We got there at 7PM and were seated immediately. We ordered appetizers, a great meal, a bottle of wine and dessert.  The food was great and the service was fine...until they rushed us out and, actually, asked us to leave so that they could have the table for customers coming in.  We did not spend an excessive amount of time at the table and, considering that we ordered all that we did and left a nice tip, we felt that this was rude and uncalled for. The food was good, but, unfortunately, I would not go back to this Pio Pio because of this incident. I understand that Saturday night is a busy time for business, but it is rude and in poor taste to ask customers to vacate their table because they are taking "too long."  This is especially the case when we ordered all that we did.
