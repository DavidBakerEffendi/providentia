I discovered Dusal's in 2001 when we moved to Franklin Park.It's 2014 and we are still eating there.   This is my favorite restaurant. We eat here at least once, sometimes twice a week The food is delicious and the owner's and wait staff are so friendly they make you feel at home. I love that they have blackboard specials that are different every week.  I usually eat a lot of seafood and my wife likes chicken dishes. Check out their Zuppa De Pesce or Shrimp fra Diavlo, they are so tasty with just the right amount of seasonings  I have never had a problem with anything I ever ordered at the restaurant or take out.  If you are in the area, check it out.  You won't be disappointed.
