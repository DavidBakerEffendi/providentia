Made our way over to D/Windsor to try their burgers.   Great space with a really cool vibe.............bartenders are attentive and the beer selection is top shelf w/ 15+ beers on tap, all reasonably priced.  They have a window near the rear of the bar where you order your food.......the day's menu is posted on a blackboard.........the menu is limited to a few sandwiches, salads & plates to choose from (think burgers/chicken sandwich/ribs/caesar salad) We arrived at 7pm on Sunday, July 4th and after getting our drinks, I went to the window and was told that the ribs & burgers were sold out. I understand that ribs are made in limited quantities, but how can a bar be out of burgers at 7pm on the 4th of July?!!? We ordered some hush puppies (they were great), finished our drinks and took a walk over to the Dram Shop where we had some of their ridiculously good wings & burgers. Will go to D/Windsor again to try their burger, but earlier in the day !
