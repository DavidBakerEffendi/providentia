We were on vacation looking for something quick easy and non-chain. With good reviews. This fit the bill. We did take out back to the hotel with the kids. I got the veggie platter, my husband got lamb kebabs, Plus an order of seared cauliflower. Both came with rice and what appeared to be homemade bread. We split with the kids cause they are small orders were big enough to give the kids some and not feel deprived. My husband loved his lamb, And would not stop talking about the bread. I thought the bread was excellent. The kids loved the seared cauliflower. Which in my eyes looked deep fried. The green dipping sauce that was homemade with herbs was awesome with the cauliflower all sauces were homemade. It Was busy with a 75 price order for take out, but still didn't take long they knew how to staff properly. . Seemed popular with the locals. Service was good my husband wanted to go back a second night the only reason the review is not five stars is I found the veggies to be over the top with grease. They were tasty But I think they could have used to be put in a spider before being boxed to get the extra grease off. The grease leaked in the bag too. Spinach that came with the platter was perfect. I would go again next time I want to try the falafel. Price value was great two meals and cauliflower $27. I asked our hotel if they knew about this place before we went and they did not. We almost didn't go glad we did.
