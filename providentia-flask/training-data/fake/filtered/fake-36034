We left our hotel in Manhattan to meet a friend at Roberta's and it was well worth the long subway trip! We sat at the bar and had brunch on a Sunday afternoon. The bloody mary was good (and I've had many bloody marys in my day). The menu was small, but everything on it looked great! We ordered lots of food and it was all amazing. Unfortunately something got mixed up with our order and not all of our food came out, so I'll never know how the bibb salad was! Next time i guess. The bartender was friendly and gave great service! Next time I'm in Brooklyn I'd like to stop in here and try the pizza. I wish we had a place like this back home!
