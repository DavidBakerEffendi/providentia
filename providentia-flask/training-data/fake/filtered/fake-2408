I have eaten dosa all over the world including the mother country, and Thiru makes the best dosa I have ever eaten. The batter is crisp while at at the same time remaining moist, His pondicherry has vegetables so fresh they taste like home grown. Well worth coming from Washington D.C to try - I was skeptical when friends told me about him, and now I am a believer.     And having read the other reviews, anyone giving less than a four or five star clearly should stick to McDonalds, since they do not deserve to be reviewing such great food.
