i moved to nj 2 years ago and ever since, i've been Â coming to lu's. and being from ny. it was nice to find a real italian restaurant that has class & style.im not a wealthy guy but for all of you who find it $$$$, stick to olive garden, where you will get big portions on the cheap. and leave us who appreciate lu's alone.
