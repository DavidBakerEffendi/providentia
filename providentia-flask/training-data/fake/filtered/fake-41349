Terrible service! My wife and I went there for dinner on August 18, 2013, before 6pm. There were only a few tables taken at the time. Our waiter was a young guy who promptly took our order and he did come back once to ask us about the food.  After that he just disappeared.  After the main course, we wanted to order some dessert but no one in the waiting staff came by to see what we needed.  At least after 15 minutes, the guy came out to serve on our next table and still ignored us.  After waiting for another 5 minutes we saw the guy in the other room (near the kitchen).  We had to signal to him for the check without ordering the dessert. If you go there and the waiter is a young man, do ask for another person in the waiting staff! It was such a contrast to our previous lunch visit about 2 weeks ago when we were seated in the room near the kitchen.  At that time the gentleman at the bar took our order and other ladies in the waiting staff helped taking out the food and taking care of the check. Even the manager (owner?) came by to say hello. A usually generous tipper.
