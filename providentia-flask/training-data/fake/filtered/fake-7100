I went to this place for the first time last week based on a lot of recommendations.  I was told they serve good breakfast and are open 24hrs....my kind of place.  When I got there at 8pm I was disappointed to find out that they don't serve breakfast all day, but my disappointment quickly went away when I received my meal.  I can't wait to go back and try breakfast.
