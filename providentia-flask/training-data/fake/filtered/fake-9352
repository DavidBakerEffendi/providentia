Recently, I ordered a pizza pie from Algieri's for the first time and my reaction was, "Oh Wow! Finally found great pizza close to home." It was the perfect pizza pie! Tonight, although the right amount of cheese and tomato, the crust was nice and thin, but burned and barely chewable and the bottom of the pie was moderately burned with a burned flavor. Sorry to say it was a big disappointment, but hopefully that will not happen again when and if I decide to order again from this local pizza restaurant.
