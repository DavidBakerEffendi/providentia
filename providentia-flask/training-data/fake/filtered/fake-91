So me giving one star to Geno's steaks seems like a fair enough deal me and my wife were very excited to travel to Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak from Gino's as we dreaded the long wait for a 8 inch sub was not worth the wait I like to order my cheese steaks with onion mayonnaise ketchup and hot sauce in light Peppers as I approached the window and gave the gentleman my order he explained to me they don't make their sandwiches that way there Â already pre made so I bought two cheesesteaks my cheesesteaks were cold and tasted like rubber their customer service was horrible there seating arrangements were horrible there are hundreds of other locations in Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak and I'm sad to say that I did not choose else where to eat I will never eat at Geno's again ok
