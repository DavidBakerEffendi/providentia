I got to say this is one of the bet pizza places ever. I only have one complaint though. This man is a orange car who delivers on the weekends and I've noticed my pizza slices have been missing so before he delivered i asked him to open the pizza box and there it was a missing pizza slice! So then i asked him why there was only 7 slices instead of 8 and he said "dude i was hungry" then he proceeded to barge into my home and punch me. I don't understand why the delivery driver was so mean to me. Please tell my brother to stop eating my pizza slices i get so hungry sometimes. 5/5 stars because the pizza f***ing amazing.
