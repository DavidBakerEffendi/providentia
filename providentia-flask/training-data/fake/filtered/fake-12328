Tonight my wife and I had the tasting menu at Serpico. It had ten off-menu courses for $85 a person. This meal was completely worth every penny. The dishes were intricate and unique, but completely approachable. I found myself surprised more than once by how much I enjoyed an ingredient that I had previously thought of as intimidating. We sat at the chef counter, a choice that made the evening. Watching the staff work together in such a cooperative and composed manner was such a unique experience. It made the complex nature of the dishes even more impressive. This was truly one of the best dinners that I have ever had. I would recommend this meal to anyone.
