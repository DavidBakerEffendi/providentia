This restaurant is not worth the money they charge. I have ordered take-out from this restaurant a handful of times over the last three years. I keep going back because I like a change in food every now and again. Each time I remember why I don't order from there. The pizza is decent, pastas are decent, the french fries are disgusting, calamari is chewy and their onion blossoms are greasy with a spicy sauce(great for your stomach later). They don't put a top on the spicy sauce, so when you get it home, it's all over the onions. If you don't like the sauce, too bad because that's how you'll have to eat it. Their food would be easier to stomach if the attitudes were better. On each occasion, I have had waitresses with nasty attitudes. I'm thinking maybe they like the men better or they cater to the regulars. The guy ahead of me got a thank you and a smile. I didn't get a smile or thank you. I asked for a bag to carry my food and she handed me the bag to put the food in myself. I get that it's not easy to deal with customers. There are a lot of people who are rude and nasty but no restaurant can afford to be discriminating(especially with their prices). The sad part is that it's not just one waitress, but all of the females there seem to be rude. I have never dealt with the men but they don't seem to be running the take-out area. I truly feel like I wasted my money because I ate one of three dishes ordered. I wouldn't even serve this greasy mess to my dog. I only gave this restaurant a one star because I had to rate it. I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT UNTIL THEY BECOME MORE FRIENDLY AND ACCOMMODATING TO EVERYONE. The last time I went in there, it wasn't busy but she didn't want to help me at all.
