If I were to rate the food and price, I would have given four stars. But I gave two stars because the customer service was very bad. I've never written a review for it because I thought "what the heck, they're just tired". But i had enough. My brother and I had dinner Â there today and ordered the Raw beef with lime juices. We got four slices of lime. My brother asked for extra because he likes his beef with lots of lime juice. The waiter stared at us and said "Why? Did you taste it? with a mean attitude. He left without giving us lime. We weren't impolite to him when we ordered. We said "please and thank you". The customer service was not satisfactory, not only this time, but other times.
