my family took me out for dinner for my birthday on march 15 and suggested don peppe. we were a party of 7..we heard from others who have dined here in the past on how great their dining experience was . we also checked the reviews on  yelp and tripadvisor and zagat  and found great reviews. we however did not have such a great experience. we knew that there would be a wait but not 2 and a half hours(we should have not not been told  the wait was 30 minutes) we could have dined elsewhere but decided to stay and wait . we were getting anxious and hungry. the service was less than perfect. we knew how busy they are but we felt as if we were being rushed ,in fact the waiter told us what to order rather than us deciding. the  waiter was not very attentive and at times could not find him at all. once the food arrived we dugged into it(family style) because we were starving. the food  did not live up to the hype in our opinion. it was good but not worth waiting several hours for. for a 550 dollar bill we did not get what we paid for. we tried it and i am sure it is good for most of the reviewers but not for us sorry we wont be going back to dine there.. it was a memorable birthday but not in a good way what a shame...really wanted to give five stars....but couldnt...
