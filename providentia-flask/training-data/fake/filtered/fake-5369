After 30 years of being happy loyal customers my family agreed "this is the last visit". As one reviewer wrote this is a slow cafeteria not a restaurant. Everything seems not just frozen, but precooked now. This visit I could barely eat what I ordered. Jimmies has gotten more and more cringe worthy over the years. Staff seems focused on packing people in - Â not quality service. I don't know what happened to this place but clearly the owners do not care. Frozen seafood is just not acceptable to me as a New Englander. Yuck!
