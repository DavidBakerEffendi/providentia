Well to sum things up, be sure to check your order and receipt, because the owner will over charge you and your family. We are a regular customer to this place, and we always have to double check our receipt and order to make sure that the staff did not charge us for something that we did not eat...on top if you try to order a pick up they will mess your order up and will make you wait 30 mins and still get the order wrong....please if you decide to go there make sure you double check your order and receipt, ask for a break down of charges...better yet know what you order and how much the order should come out to.
