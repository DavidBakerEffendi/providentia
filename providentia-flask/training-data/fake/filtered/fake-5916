Awesome meal.  I came here for brunch with two friends and had a great experience. The place was packed  but we had made reservations so we didn't have to endure the endless wait.   Pickled bloody mary was beyond amazing.  Beignets appetizer was good, but not spectacular, i think it needed more powdered sugar.  I had the burger with fried egg which was very flavorful though a bit messy (though I love a good messy burger).  My friend had a salad and said it was great. My other friend had the cookshop scrambled which i tasted and it was delicious.  The buttermilk scone/biscuit was the best part!  Overall, great place to enjoy brunch with friends.
