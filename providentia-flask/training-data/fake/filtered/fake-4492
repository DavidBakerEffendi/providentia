Generally excellent hard working wait staff and atmosphere and food quality!  Went twice: 1st time was indoors for lunch (excellent knowledgeable waitress and another waitress also displayed a fine attitude and personality) and then again for dinner outdoors.  Indoors is better than outdoors since you could hear the music and I think the service is better there too.  One of the outside waitresses, the red hair one, who was not mine so I couldn't even reduce her tip, made some mistakes which affected my table.  First she brought out 8 glasses of ice water for people who weren't even at the restaurant yet right next to my table of 2 that was eating chips and hot sauce without the benefit of any water to drink.  When I spoke to her about it she acted dumb and rude about it instead of professional.  Then later when my son's napkin fell onto the gravel floor, she quickly bent down, scooped it up before he could, threw it away, and did not bring him another napkin!  Was this her way of getting even for the water problem?
