OK I love milano's medium spinach calzones . They will feed you for 2 days for 10.00. The only problem is because of their size the insides are Luke warm when delivered. But that is not a problem for me. Don't mind throwing it in oven for the price,taste,and size its well worth it!!! Kudos Cafe Milano  keep your calzones  just the way they are and you'll have a forever customer.
