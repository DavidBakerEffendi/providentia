Stop reading Yelp reviews and check out Dasiwa for yourself. Right now. The food is amazing. Try the Loaded Gyoza or Not-cho as an appetizer. There is not a bad roll on the menu, but my personal favorites are the Dasiwaki, the Emerald City, the Aspen, the Orchid, the Shaggy Dog...and I could keep going. If you have room at the end of your meal (and good luck with that), the mochi is a refreshing dessert. The service is incredible. In all likelihood, you will meet Tom, the owner, or one of his kids over the course of your meal. The restaurant is small, and often crowded, but never once I have seen any member of the staff let that affect their service. Sam is particularly wonderful and sweet. Everyone is very accommodating - whether you need ice buckets for the five bottles of wine you brought with you (it has happened) or you want to customize an order of a roll on the menu, they've got you covered. On a personal note, a group of friends and I have been regulars at Dasiwa for almost 3 years now. This restaurant is so special to us that last year, when he needed to pick a location to propose, my fiance went to talk to Tom at Dasiwa. Tom closed the restaurant for us on a Monday night, Sam made a playlist of romantic music and set up her phone to record the event, and the sushi chefs made us an amazing dinner while keeping the post-dessert surprise a secret. It was incredible. I'm actually amazed that Dasiwa hasn't expanded yet - if this restaurant was located in a more central location, people would be flocking to it. If you decide to venture to Fairmount to give it a go, bring your beverage of choice, prepare to search for parking, and make a reservation. Any hassle you have to go through will be well worth it once you're there.
