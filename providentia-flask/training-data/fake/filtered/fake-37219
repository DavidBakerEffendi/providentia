Hillstone Restaurant on 53rd street and 3rd Ave in NYC  has found the secret for a successful restaurant experience.  Resident New Yorkers, my wife and I eat out often.  At Hillstone we have always encountered smiling, helpful, attractive, and attentive servers.  The food is excellent.  We have had salmon, ribs, their burger and their amazing strip steak.  We cannot say enough about that strip steak; it is juicy, tender, flavorful and seared to perfection.  It is actually enough for two. And their desserts are terrific as well.   For the quality, we find their prices absolutely worth it! Mike A.
