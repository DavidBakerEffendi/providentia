As someone who loved Cookshop when it was helmed by Rob Berry, this was an obvious destination for me. And even these inflated expectations were far exceeded. The decor is warm, even sexy (one quibble is with their own website, whose pictures make it look like a sterile English pub) and the service was dutiful without being intrusive. But the real star is obviously the food, which is positively scrumptious. The steak and the chicken were both cooked perfectly, and the latter came with quinoa and grilled onions that I'm still thinking about three days later. And dont miss the escarole/dandelion/anchony salad, which is an updated and far superior version of the old Cookshop dandelion dish. I'll definitely be back, hopefully many times.
