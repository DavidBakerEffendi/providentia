I've eaten countless great meals, but this is the top of the list. My whole philosophy on restaurants is that I'd rather eat at some cheap diner with good home-cookin' food, than pay way too much at some fancy place for mediocre food.  HOWEVER, that being said, I'm willing to pay for an amazing meal, and Scarpetta was amazing! Went with a friend and we ordered a plate of the regular spaghetti, then also ordered a plate of the special pasta with black truffles that was the special that night. Told the waiter we were going to pass the plates and share them, so he actually brought them split between two plates.  Nice touch of service that most places don't do. As if the main course wasn't amazing enough, the desserts were even more phenomenal.  But I think just about everything there is probably near-perfect.  The one item I would not order again was the Short Ribs appetizer. They certainly weren't horrible, but I've had better and they just weren't nearly as special as every other item we had. But I love it and will return often!
