One word: AMAZING. Went to Sazon Latino on a referral with another couple and was absolutely blown away. We had to go back the following week. You can't beat the quality or the price. As said in many other reviews, there is a new menu every day. The staff is incredibly polite, and we can't wait to go back again soon.
