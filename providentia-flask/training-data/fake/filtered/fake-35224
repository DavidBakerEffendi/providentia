The service is rude, there's no way to deny it. I went prepared to be offended, after reading some reviews, but they surprised me anyway. On the other hand, food is fantastic and the price is the best you can find. Being able to eat fantastic italian food, spending 7-8 dollars makes up for the not so great service. Went again. Food is out of this world. Best italian possible, great quality ingredients, best value in town. I would like to give 4.5 because of the service, but 5 is fair enough.
