The first time I had the square slice, I immediately declared this place the best pizza of NYC. I've had my shares of oily, over cheesed, over sauced square pizzas from a number of family run places. But this one is special, its got the right consistency and mixture of all the flavors to make one artistic slice of heaven. Thank the gods for a great nostalgic place like this. Forget the cheap imitations, just go to here if your craving pizza.
