This is my usual dinner destination when ever i have friends visiting from out of town.  Come in groups of 4 and more for your own table otherwise, you are seated at a communal table with other diners.  I personally prefer having my own table to enjoy my meal.  The SOUP DUMPLINGS and SCALLION PANCAKES are my favorite.  Every time I'm in the neighborhood, there's always a line waiting to be seated.  Normally i bail out once the waiting period exceeds 30 minutes, but my craving of the soup dumplings just makes the wait worth-it.  They  have other dishes that are very good as well,  but i feel i can get those at  nearby restaurants with no lines.  Just a warning though, please check your bill before paying, seems like there's a hidden 15% gratuity already added to your bill written in Mandarin.
