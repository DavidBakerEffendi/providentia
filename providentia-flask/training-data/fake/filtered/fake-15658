With many productions that may have once graced the stages of Broadway, the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn offers a good selection of shows that are open for a limited time. Just a little outside of busy Manhattan, I think this theater in Millburn is worth the trip for your favorite productions. Over the years my family and I have seen a handful of their productions with our most recent trip being after Thanksgiving to see their version of Oliver.
