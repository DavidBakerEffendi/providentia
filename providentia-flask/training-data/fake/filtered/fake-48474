so i was a tourist tryin to get an authentic cheesesteak. it was great. they had a crazy ordering process that was posted on the front. if i didnt read it  i would have totally got lost in ordering. they are known for their fast service. and being a tourist i didnt want to look stupid. i got a cheesesteak with mushrooms. i was good. but i wished i ordered it with a different cheese. I think i got it with cheese whiz. i was good non the less. i can truly say now that i had  a real phily cheesesteak. i definately recommend this place. for real cheesesteak come to pats king of cheesesteak
