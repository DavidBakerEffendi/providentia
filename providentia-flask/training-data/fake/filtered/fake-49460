I should first state that Stephen Starr is my personal god. That said, El Vez is just as good, if not better, than anything else he has done in our fair city. Been here 6 or 7 times and it is always great. What ever you eat will be fabulous, but you can super-size the experience by ordering the "blood-orange frozen margarita." Caution: you might only want to get just one...
