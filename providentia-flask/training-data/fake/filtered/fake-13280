If you are filipino, don't expect to pay $9 or $10 for a good meal. You and your mom know that it doesn't cost $20 something dollars to cook adobo, pusit, palabok, and kare-kare. Bokchoy for $6?!? Oh yeah did I forget to mention that these are individually plated?!? Food was mediocre, didn't seem much of a fusion. The server had the nerve to ask us if we wanted to double up on any of our orders... Hahah watta guy All in all, a bit overpriced when you know how much something should REALLY cost.
