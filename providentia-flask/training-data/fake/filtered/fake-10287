Best sticky bun I have ever had! My wife and I stopped by Panadero for the first time and we will be back soon.  We also got some sandwiches for later- what flavor.  Savory,crispy bread, fresh greens, tasty meats and  cheese.  This place is off the beaten path from downtown Burlington but you won't be disappointed!
