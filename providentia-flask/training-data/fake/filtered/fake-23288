Went out here on a Saturday night for dinner.  The service, food, and atmosphere were all excellent!  It was busy, but we didn't feel rushed, and were able to enjoy a wonderful meal.  The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, and both of our meals were excellent.  This was our first time here, and we will definitely be back!
