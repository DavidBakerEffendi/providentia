AMAZING service. Especially the guy who seemed to be the manager. There was NO shortage of other helpful staff, including the hostess who helped us keep our reserved space while other people hovered in the hopes of stealing it from us. The menu looked great, but unfortunately the food wasn't amazing. However, what was lacking in taste was absolutely made up for in service. In fact, our waitress misheard a part of our order, but just let us keep the wrong thing she brought and then brought us what we actually ordered - at no charge. Thanks B&W for making my brother's birthday so fun!!
