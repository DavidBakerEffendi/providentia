Okay, food is great because it's a Jean Georges joint. I'm a sucker for pastas and desserts. I had the watermelon goat cheese salad. So good. Also had the heirloom salad. Also, so good. Entree had the cod, which was aiite. Dessert had the creme brule. Oh man, I could eat this all day. What else? I've been here several times, and the food is always good. You just have to get ready to shelve the dough cuz it'll get pricey.
