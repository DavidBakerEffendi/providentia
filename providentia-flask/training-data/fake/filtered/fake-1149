I went to Pylos last night and was very unimpressed with the overall experience. In fact the only reason that I gave this review any stars was the friendly service. Yes the restaurant is beautifully designed but the food should not leave you feeling like that was the only justification for eating there. The food was amazingly underwelming (It really shouldn't be possible to make a lamb shank dry and stringy) and there was a long wait between our appetizer and  main course that was nearly 45 minutes long. The beet salad was roasted beets that while very well cooked were the only flavor in the dish. Beet flavored with essence of beet with a beet marinade it seemed.  The only flavor held in the tiny dollop of cooked and chilled beet greens at the top of the heap. I had the Moussaka which was decent but most definitely did not live up to its $16 price tag. My girlfriend and I were so dissatisfied that we ate about 1/4 of the main course and packed the rest to go (hopefully that lamb shank can be converted into a decent stew). Judging by the other reviews, this may have been an off day for Pylos (sunday) but from my experience, if you want greek food, look elsewhere.
