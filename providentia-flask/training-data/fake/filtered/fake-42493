I have been to Bocca Lupo twice, and both times I was satisfied. I wasn't wowed by the food, but it did taste good. The first time I came I got the macaroni and cheese. It came with mushrooms, which I didn't see until it came, so that sort of annoyed me because I am not a fan of mushrooms. The mac and cheese itself was very good though The second time I came I got the risotto with roasted almonds. It was very good. The risotto was a little tart but because the almonds were there it was balanced out. The only thing I didn't really like were the very small food portions.
