The food was amazing. The service was amazing. Atmosphere was amazing. Everything about this place was amazing. Get a reservation as this place was booked solid on a Monday night. There are only a few seats inside. My fiance and I shared our dishes which was great as we didn't want what was on the 5 course tasting menu. The 5 course tasting menu is a good deal though.
