Never, EVER come on a weekend with a big party (we came with 10 ppl on a Friday night). They told us the wait was an hour and a half. Which was long but at least there is a bar there to pass the time. Only thing was it turned into a 2 and a half hour wait. We confronted the manager who informed us that the 2 tables that were able to accommodate us didn't leave yet.  One table he said has been there for 6 hours and the other table for 4 hours (which I didn't believe for a second).  He said he couldn't ask the tables to leave,  which is also ridiculous. We asked if they could combine tables and the manager said he couldn't because it's a fire hazard. We told him that he wasn't accommodating us at all and then said if we didn't like it then we could leave. What nerve asking us to leave but couldn't ask the two parties that were there for a really long time to leave.  So we finally got the table after 2 and a half hours.  Lucky that the service and the food were good. Despite that, I give this place 2 stars because of how rude the manager was.
