If your in the mood for authentic, upscale Italian food then this is the place. I have dined here 6 or 7 times and always leave happy, satiated and looking forward to going back. I love going here with a large group and ordering lots of appetizers for the table to enjoy. They have a terrific wine list and tasty food specials. Excellent date night locale.
