Had been looking forward to Balthazar after all the hype, had the steak tartare, lobster risotto and the duck pie, all the biggies. What a disappointment. Maybe it's because I've had good French food and not just the American spin. Average. And to top it off the steak tartare my friend and I shared gave us food poisoning! I would be wary and lesson learnt. Don't believe the hype. I would not recommend and that's being polite.
