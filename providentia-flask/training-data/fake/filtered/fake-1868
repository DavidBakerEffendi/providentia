Our concierge recommended this bar to us, my friends had just arrived in town late Saturday night. After leaving 2 other bars because the Bartenders were rude, I can't tell you how refreshing it was to walk into a bar and be greeted with a big smile and friendly "good Morning" from Angie. It was our friends Birthday and The Ear Inn made us feel so special and welcome. Angie is great fun, and a walking encyclopedia of restaurants, bars and the city in general. If only all places treated they're customers like this.
