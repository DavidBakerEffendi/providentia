I rarely write reviews, but I had to because this was one of the best experiences I ever had. It was two of my friends birthday and we decided to celebrate it at jones, which I'm glad we did!. Our server's name is nadia (not sure about the spelling). Surprisingly she was in training, I would've never guessed until her trainer told us. Anyways when we first sat, it was really cold. We told our server, which she took care of the problem right away. One of my friends was running late but Nadia introduced the menu, got us our drinks and asked us if we would want some appetizers while we wait. She recommend the Mac and cheese which was good! After my friend came, she got her drink, recommended the chicken and waffles, which we all three got because she made it sound that good. Then she asked if we would like the gravy on our waffles or on the side. We got it on the side.  I'm glad she asked bc I wasn't too crazy about the gravy. I have to say though that it was the best chicken I ever tasted. After we were done, my friend had one piece of chicken left and wasn't sure if she should pack it. But Nadia said shed be more than happy to pack it for her. Afterwards I told the other server to bring a candle with whatever dessert my friends order. Nadia came back recommend some desserts. I wanted to share the chocolate cake but one of my friends isn't really crazy about chocolate so Nadia suggested to top it of with vanilla ice cream which was an excellent idea! Long story short, both servers were really friendly and attentive. Nadia always came back to refill our drinks and everything came on time. I'm the kind of person that I hate clutter on the table, but she always took dirty dishes off the table and set us up with new ones.  She was also very funny and made us feel welcomed. I am definitely coming back!
