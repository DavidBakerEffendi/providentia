Cuban Pete's is the worst restaurant I have ever been in my life... Their customer service in incredibly unprofessional, they treat you like you garbage and like you are not important as a customer.  Their Manager is disrespectful and the owner certainly does not have a clue on how to treat and keep good customers.  He gives you the run around when correcting an error done by THEM.  It is sad to know that they can treat customers so poorly at CUBAN PETE'S. I will never recommend anyone to go to this restaurant, and I will never eat at such poor customer service so cold Restaurant.. Obviously they do not know how to run one.
