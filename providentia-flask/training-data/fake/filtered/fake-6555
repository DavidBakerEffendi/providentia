Bar Taco is simply delicious - trendy, tapas style, and different. I usually go for chicken tacos but instead I always get the fish tacos here. The ingredients are simple but somehow everything is so refreshing. Service is pretty good, although sometimes it can get super busy at dinner - what can you do? I'm not a huge fan of their dessert options but that's no big deal - their mojitos are delicious! Kudos to that restaurant for making a more basic menu so new, satisfying, and unique!
