Finally made it to PYT after a few months of hearing about their amazing burgers, and I my expectations were met.  Even on a busy Friday night, we got a table and our food quickly.  We had a fantastic waitress, Sarah, who not only did a great job keeping the PYT specials ($7 for a high life pint and a shot of Jameson) comin, but she also put up with me and my friends obnoxious behavior, which is always appreciated.  Overall a good experience, but it was really packed and hard to get around, kinda have to yell to hear one another, but I guess thats just about any bar.
