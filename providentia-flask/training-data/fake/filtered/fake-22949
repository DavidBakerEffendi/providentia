ROBBED BY BARTENDER AT VERLAINE!! On May 23, 2011, a friend and I were drawn by the $4 Martinis. Initially the bartender appeared like a friendly guy, but in actuality he preyed on my friend and I  because he thought we were drunk!  He took advantage of the fact that I gave him a $20.00 tip and charged me for a separate bill, which we never consumed! In fact, I even paid for drinks for another patron at the bar. He assumed that I would never notice because I appeared so generous! I am appauled at this bartender! Please be careful! WOW!!! TO BE ROBBED BY A BARTENDER!! WHAT HAS THIS WORLD COME TO????????
