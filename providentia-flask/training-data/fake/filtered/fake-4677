Ok, so I went to Rouge with my mom and my sister on a Wednesday night. My mom had been there before for business so she told us a little about the place. First off let me say that the service is excellent. It's fast and the waiters/waitresses are friendly. They were excellent with my sister (who is younger in age) and answered all of our questions. Rouge is one of so many places that you'll pass by a million times and never think about. It's not big at all, yet the food is excellent. I got the cooked salmon and it's flavor was amazing. My mom got the Rouge burger and said that it was great. My sister got the vegetarian special, which even for her choosiness, she said was very good. Fast service, a homey feel, and great food. What's not to like?
