I've been going to El Rincon Criollo since I was a child. Tio Rene and Tio Baldo have been great! And Sotico was wonderful! Going there is like coming home! They fed me great food as a child, the catered my wedding, fed me when I was pregnant and I couldn't stomach a thing but their food! They fed my daughter her first meal, took care of my Mom to bring back her strength when she had cancer by bringing her delicious Cuban food. Their food has not only been outstanding for as long as I can remember but they have made anyone that comes in their doors part of their Cuban family. What a great place to eat, what great people to know. Barbarita
