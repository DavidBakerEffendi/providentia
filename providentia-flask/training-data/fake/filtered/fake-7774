I have so much more to try here but so far ...its great food!!! My favorite empanadas so far: Veggie Reggaeton Chicken Cuban The only negative about this place is that the tables are so close, you sometimes over hear conversations you don't want to hear. Â Twice I had to sit next to freshman college kids talking about roommates who don't wash dishes and their frequent use of adderall...Oy!
