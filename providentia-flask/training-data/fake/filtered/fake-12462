My girlfriend loves macaron and couldn't wait for until this place opened up. Of course when it did, she drag me and our friends there. The line was out the door and down the block and God I hate lines. But I wasn't getting out of this one. So I had to suck it up and wait. I was telling myself that these damn macarons better taste like heaven and give me organism at the same time. It didn't give me one but I did get goosebumps when I had it so I wasn't as pissed since they live up to the hype. All the flavors were very good. All very soft and flavorful. I was hooked after the first bite. The orange blossom was definitely my favorite.
