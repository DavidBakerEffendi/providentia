I had a chilly cheeseburger with fries and my wife had stake fajitas. Food did not taste bad, in fact it didn't have much taste at all and was just bland. The food was also slow in coming.  The waitress was very polite and kept interrupting our conversation every 5 minutes to see if we needed anything.  Environment was run down with cafeteria style tables and chairs.  Urinal did not flush in men's room and the stall was being used to keep cleaning supplies.
