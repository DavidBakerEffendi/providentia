I would give this place five stars, but it is contributing to my already expanded waist-line. So far my favorite is either the Buffalo Gal or the Coney Island. I am a bit scared to try some of the more out there dogs, but hopefully will get my name on the wall. The people are nice and it's good to find a place open at 3am on a weekend. Only wish they were open later on the weekdays. The dogs are very filling, be warned...and addicting.
