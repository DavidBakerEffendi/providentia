Was at the restaurant Saturday afternoon.  Ordered a Hainan Chicken, waited for 40 minutes but the chicken never arrived.  I asked 4 waitresses where our chicken was but no one came back to tell us what's going on.  Finally, the chicken arrived and our rice was already cold.  When we paid the bill, we only gave 10% tip and the waitress ran after us to the front door and asked if everything was okay.  WTF.  No, of course not.  The service sucks.  Although the food is not bad.
