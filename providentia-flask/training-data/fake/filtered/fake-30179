My wife and I were walking down Bleecker Street on our way to Little Italy during a weekend visit to NYC when we noticed a "sandwich board" picturing what looked like a bread bowl filled with melted cheese and topped with an egg.  Two women were outside looking at the menu, and I asked if they knew the name of the dish.  One of the women said it was "Ajaruli," a Georgian specialty.  (I looked it up at home and some recipes refer to it as "Acharuli.")  First things first, if you ever stumble into Old Tbilisi, order this!  It is possibly the best thing that I have ever eaten.  We sat at the bar.  While waiting for our food, I asked the bartender, Giorgi, to pick out a glass of semi-sweet wine.  His pick was an "Ojaleshi," also from Georgia.  I had never had a wine from Georgia before.  It had a sweet front and a refreshingly dry finish.  (So did the next two glasses.)  It paired very well with the Ajaruli which one of the owners, David, came by to show us how it is traditionally eaten.  He also had us try some therapeutic mineral.  We were also introduced to Vasil, his brother and co-owner.  Everyone was extremely friendly and proud of their culture.  Next time we are in New York, we are heading right to Old Tbilisi.
