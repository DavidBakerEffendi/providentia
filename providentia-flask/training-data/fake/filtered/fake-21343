All around excellent! Â Food, service and drinks are all outstanding. Bogota is a model of what a restaurant should be. The menu is varied and enticing. The cocktails are fantastic. The service is attentive and friendly- almost too good to be believed. I recommend Bogota for dinner or brunch. The best coffee I've ever tasted- you won't stop drinking it! One of the top three in all of Pk Slope without question. I will return again and again.
