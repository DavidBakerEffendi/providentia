i made a reservation here to celebrate my graduation and have dinner with my family.  this was my first time here and i wanted to show my family who is from out of town a nice time in philly.  we made a reservation and we waited for TWO HOURS. not ONCE were we acknowledged about this while we stood there. TONS of people came through the door and were seated right away.  we were IGNORED by the servers and the hosts when we kept telling them that we had a reservation. i was EXTREMELY upset since i had made a reservation and didn't think it was right that we were there on time for our reservation- only to wait while other people who came in AFTER US were getting seated, served and finish dinner. this was supposed to be a celebratory dinner, but by the time they finally seated us it was already 10:30 pm. NOT HAPPY. by this time i was about to ditch this place and head on over to chinatown.  the food was nice, and the inside was cool looking so i will give it that.  however, to me it was just not worth it and i was NOT happy that i spent that much money for being treated like that for a dinner that was supposed to be a happy occasion. i wanted to show my family a cool dining experience, but after that horrible service i won't be coming back or bring my family here for dinner ever again.
