This place is great. Food, beer, sides, everything is great. When I come to brooklyn to eat I always have high expectations...this place delivers. I had an unbelievably tasty steak cooked perfectly medium rare. The steak must have been cooked in a vat of buttery goodness because it was remarkable in every way. Truffled mashed potatoes were great. Wife's grilled sardines were exceptionally good as well and we can't wait to go back sometime in the near future. Great beers in tap too.
