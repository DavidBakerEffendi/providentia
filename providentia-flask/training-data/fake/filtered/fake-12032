We went to BLVD Bistro for Father's Day.  We are a family of five (with one child included). We went during the beginning of dinner hour (5:30).  They gave us a choice of sitting outside (beautiful weather!) or sitting inside and we choose inside.  Short version, the meal was amazing! I had the pan fried chicken with collared greens and potato salad.  The chicken was fried to perfection, yummm!! My husband had the short ribs (equally yumm!) My son had the turkey meatloaf, which he loved! My daughter had the humongous sized pork chops, which she also raved about and my youngest had the mac 'n cheese kid-size.  My daughter also took home the apple pie which she described as scrumptious!  Drinks were red sangria (very good) and sparkling sweet tea, which was a really good flavor!  The chef never stopped by and the biscuits (to me) were a little overcooked, but still tasted great!  All-in-all we were very satisfied customers and will go back again during brunch because I want to try their shrimp & grits!
