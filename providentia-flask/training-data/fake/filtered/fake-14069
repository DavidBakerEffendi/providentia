I had the worst sushi dinner at this restuarant. I had been to Ginza in Bloomfield, it was not bad, but the one in Wethersfield was aweful! We arived at the restuarant and there was no customer at all. I thought about walking out, but felt weird so we ended up staying for dinner. The sushi was not good and the prices are high. They give you very little food for a high price. We had to end up going over to Sake Restuarant because we were still hungry after paying over $100.
