Great Indian Food. All vegetarian.  We waited and waited for Bombay Talk. Finally gave up and tried Talk of the Town. Wow, what a pleasant surprise! All of our hesitation due to the place being empty vs Bombay Talk turned out to be misplaced.   Although small, this is a gem of a place. I am going to tell all my friends about it.
