This place stinks and we would never go back there. The food was awful and the staff was horrible. There were young kids running the place and the place was a disaster. There was hair in our food and everything came out wrong from what we ordered! They also DO NOT like kids in this place. They asked that our kids be quiet and that they stop spilling things on the floor. I would never visit this place again!!!!!!!! We asked to speak to the owner and they told us he does not speak to upset customers!
