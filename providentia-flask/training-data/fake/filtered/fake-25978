The food here is always amazing. But more than that, the people who own and run it are great people who care about their customers. On Christmas Eve, our son wanted to leave carrots out for the reindeer, but my wife and I forgot to buy any. The grocery store had already closed, and we ran into Wazu on the off chance they had carrots. Not only did they give us a carrot, but they peeled and wrapped three carrots for our son and didn't charge us because it was Christmas. That's class.
