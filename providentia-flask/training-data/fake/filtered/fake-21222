This is a kick ass donuts place!!! Finally there is a place in Hamilton. Unlike the franchisees around the corner, you can taste the freshness and it doesn't feel doughy or heavy.  Also, they have awesome coffee and very good panini's.  This is what you expect from an owner who graduated from NY Culinary Inst. Of America .   will rate this place ***** mike
