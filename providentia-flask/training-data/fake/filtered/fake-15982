We lost power in our neighborhood Tuesday night and headed into the ConTav for dinner. Along the way, we picked up 2 other families and showed up at 6:30 with an unannounced party of 13. The hostess quickly accommodated and even setup some games for our gang of 8 children to play with. Thanks for making a "no-power" evening, Â a little less dark. -The Arborleans
