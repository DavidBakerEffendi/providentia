I've been to The Office a few times. I stuck mainly to the bar food, hot wings, burger, beer and everything was ok. I like the environment, laid back and relaxing. Nothing spectacular but not bad. I've had good experiences with the wait staff for the most part. The last time I went there however, I was extremely disappointed. We went in with the intention of having drinks and dinner and they were a little busier than normal so we were seated in the back area. We had to wait quite a while to order our drinks and appetizer, because our server knew some customers who were seated at another table and spent most of her time chatting it up with them. We finally got our hot wings (brought out by someone else) but we still didn't have drinks or plates to eat off of! It was at least an hour (since arrival) before we finally had drinks and plates. The hot wings were mediocre in taste and skimpy on sauce. After the hot wings were eaten and our drinks almost gone our server came back and asked if we wanted to order dinner (1hr 45 min after arrival). We politely refused and asked for the check. She immediately got it for us (the only thing we didn't have to wait for that night) and we got out of there to eat somewhere else. There are so many good places to eat. Don't bother with The Office.
