I am a fan of artichoke pizza. Not only are the usually open until late, but the pizzas are usually very fresh. The pricing is steep for a slice, upwards of $4, but definitely worth it given the portions of a slice and the deliciousness of the food. If it was cheaper, I would give it 5 stars, but a solid 4 none the less.
