This place deserves all five stars,no doubts, it is an island of Philippines in New York . Food is delicious, service is quick and staff is super friendly. The place is simple and clean, bathrooms are spotless. We had a dinner on Friday night, palamboc (green noodles with seafood) was fantastic, clams with garlic and beer were delicious, two dishes and two beers cost us $44 and we were happy as clams.
