I went to this restaurant to test it out since it is new to my area. Bad idea, the service is ok. The waiter needed to be told what to do (fair enough since it is new and he seemed not to have any experience or training) the food and drinks although good WAY too over priced for the portions they served. It was like eating appetizers for NYC entre prices. It was ridiculous. The check came out and since we paid with a credit card the bill needed to get adjusted. I should have just gone accross the street to hellz kitchen where I would have been satisfied. I don't recommend it.
