Went here with a large party (10 People).  We called ahead and were told they don't take reservations, but to come anyway and they would fit us in if we did not mind waiting about an hour. 3 hours later we left.  We were angry that we had spent as much money as we did at the bar. They made no effort to block off tables in order to seat us in regular seating.  The just kept telling us, that there was one large table upstairs and we can't make them leave. We wrote management at Steven Star and they offered us a gift certificate...  but they only gave it to one couple in our party (there was 5 couples)...  they did not share it with the rest of us.
