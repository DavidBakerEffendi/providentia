I found this place by purchasing a living social deal. It's a nice very small place that gives you the feeling of almost being in dining room at home. The atmosphere was great, and our server Gina was outstanding! The food was awesome and very reasonably priced. As we were leaving the owner actually came over and introduced herself as well. It was too hot while we were there but they have a nice sitting area outside as well. I will definitely be going back, and i would highly recommend giving them a try. Make sure to call for a reservation though, based on the size i would imagine it would be tough to just walk in.
