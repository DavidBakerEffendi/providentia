Wonderful place!The server was fantastic,the food was perfect! First time we went we sat outside and it was delightful and relaxing.Went back for my birthday celebration with my whole family- our server, McKenna was charming and attentive, (party of 4 with a small child!) great jazz combo was playing- a lovely evening for all!
