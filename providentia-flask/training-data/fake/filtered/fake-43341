Mercer Cafe is a treasure in Port Richmond.  It's not your typical greasy spoon breakfast joint.  It's a quaint little breakfast and lunch spot nestled on a tiny block.  The steak and crab Benedict is outstanding looking and tastes decadent with highlights of lemon zest and creamy butter in every bite.  Pair it with freshly brewed La Colombe coffee and you'll be set.
