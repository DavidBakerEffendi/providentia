malagueta not only offers restaurant dining but private events..i just had my baby shower there..the food was amazing my guests were very impressed..the staff and owners really go out of their way to make it enjoyable and personable..everything was on point..a nice atmosphere where i was able to sit and chat with all my guests..couldnt have asked for a better place to celebrate..my guests definitely plan on going back for dinner as well...thank u malagueta for hosting such a special day
