I picked up a Groupon for this place and given we love barbeque and it is only 15 minutes away I thought we'd give it a try.   BIG MISTAKE.      I wish i could say the food was good or bad but given we never actually got to eat any I can't judge.    We made reservations and showed up on time ad promptly waited 10 minutes to find someone who would seat us.   Once seated we waited another 20 minutes and no waiter or service person even showed up in the room we were seated in.  Two other tables were there before us and they just left.  We went looking for a waiter and were told they only had one waiter working and we would have to wait.  We left and we are never going back.   I emailed Groupon right away and got a refund.    If they don't want customers they should just close the place down or make it take out only.   CROSSED OFF THE LIST.   At least we have  Woodpit in town, great food and good service.
