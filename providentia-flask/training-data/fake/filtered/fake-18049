First time trying Devil's Alley - Phila Beer Week 2014. Agree with other reviews - The food was amazing. Best dry rub chicken wings. Right amount of spice and side dip. Chicken salad was fresh and not smothered in mayo. Excellent quality and competitively priced. Staff was friendly and pleasant. Facilities were clean and neat. Very interesting atmosphere - street dining, near open window, upper floor or main floor. Totally enjoyable.
