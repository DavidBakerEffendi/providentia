I popped in for a late-night meal and chose the chef's tasting menu for $65.  It was fantastic!  I've eaten at a lot of great tapas places.  I've eaten at a lot of top-rated restaurants.  I can say this meal was phenomenal, service was first-rate, and truly a great value for the money.  I like all of the Garces places, but this is my favorite.  I really don't think one can have a bad experience here unless you bring it with you.
