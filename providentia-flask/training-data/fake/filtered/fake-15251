Went here this week for a sushi fix- wound up getting the Phoenix Roll- which I have to say was OUT OF THIS WORLD!! The sushi was prepared so fresh- with the tastiest ingredients!! I am a big sushi fan, and knowing my sushi pretty well I have to say I am quite impressed with the quality of food at Hibachi 2 Go!!! The sushi is presented in a beautiful way, made fresh and taste delicious! Have to say Hibachi 2 Go beats out most upscale sushi restaurants I have been to! They have this special teriyaki sauce for the sushi as well- I don't know what it is made out of- but WOW! I also tried the chicken and shrimp teriyaki, which is also amazing and prepared fresh as well! The teriyaki sauce was packed with flavor and really complemented the chicken and shrimp well. I also had the kani salad- WOW!!!! I love kani salad and this freshly prepared dish was right up to my standards!! The crab and the sauce was amazing!! I will Â DEFINITELY come back to Hibachi 2 Go- I can't believe this concept its amazing and incredible food for a take-out place!! Please try it!! Never going anywhere else in philly!!
