This place gets a lot of rave reviews and I can see why. Neat atmosphere, BYOB and great service.  The food is good too. Don't get me wrong but I don't think it's all it's cracked up to be.  I don't know anyone who doesn't like it and I have only been there once.   We started with Haloumi which is a very salty Mediterranean cheese that has been flambé-d.  They served it with figs whose sweetness counteracts the salty.  It was still too salty for my taste (my fault for ordering it).  My wife got the Sole with green beans and polenta.  I thought they used good quality ingredients but they had used too much butter.  That's all i could taste.  Why bother with food if it is just going to be drowned in butter?   I had the boar sausage topped with stewed raisins with asparagus and sweet potato puree. It was fare.  I don't think it was anything special.  Nothing about it grabbed me.   Don't get me wrong, Mediterranean food's brilliance comes in its simplicity but this just didn't seem to grab me.  So while it's good, it's not worth the hype. I would try it again to see if maybe I find it to be a better fit.
