Great, laidback place to grab a beer and some grub. Don't let the fact that it's a bar fool you--the food here is a must! I've had the burger, pork sandwich and grilled cheese and everything's been super fresh and totally beyond what I expected (even the pickles on the burger are crazy good). And they come with a mountain of fries which are totally TO DIE FOR! On top of that, there's a great selection of brews (which changes a lot so don't get too tied to a fav.) to wash it all down.
