I heard of this restaurants opening from a friend and knew I had to try it. It had a very spacious,  welcoming feeling too as  were the employees. They were all knowledgeable,  and happy to greet you upon entering and following up to see how your meal was. The owners were constantly making their rounds to make everyone was ok. There may not be tons of seating but great for take out or just hanging around with friends and listening to music streaming through the joint. This isnt your typical "fast food" restaurant,  if you want great food you have to wait for it- yet when me  and my friends ordered we barely waited more than 5 or 10 minutes! Being from south jersey across the bridge from Philly you know I had to try the Philly Mac. American, chedder cheese and peppered steak...Phantastic! (Watch out Philly, you have company in the world of the cheesesteak). I also had the Rueben Mac (great concept by the way that REALLY works), deep fried mac and the Mac Rolls all of which were fantastic. Come on its a mac and cheese egg roll with a creamy dipping sauce, how could you not love that? My friends also tried the white truffle mac, piquillo peppers and the lobster mac. Again, delicious. If you are anywhere in the tri state area and love mac and cheese and want to try the old heartfelt childhood classic with an adult spin on it,   I highly suggest you make your way to Mac Attack! Asap. Dont go in expecting ordinary, they are far from that! Living almost 2 hours away will no way in any shape or form keep me from making this a regular weekend road trip for me. I can't wait to get back and try more of their fantastic dishes and see what I can get surprised with next.
