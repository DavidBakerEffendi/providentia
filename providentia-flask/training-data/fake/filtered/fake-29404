Their coffee is fine, but place really lacks the warm and cozy feeling I expect from a caf√©. No refill policy, their 'no outside drinks' policy includes water you've brought from home, and the barista who was working while I was in had a bit of an attitude problem with me and several other customers. Completely unwilling to make reasonable accommodations. She's got the rules down, but could really work on her friendly disposition and making her customers feel comfortable and appreciated. I probably won't be coming back.
