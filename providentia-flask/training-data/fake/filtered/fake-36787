First I have to say our waitress was polite and tried to be helpful but it started with a 20 minute wait which was not a problem. They then seated my party of 5 at a table for 4 we thought we would just deal with it but it wasn't working and once we saw 2 tables open up, I kindly asked If we could be moved and they asked If we placed our order yet and we had so they said they couldn't move us. They then said they had people waiting for those tables. They did finally seat a family there 5 minutes later but but the other area was open until a few minutes before we left. The waitress tried asking for us to get moved but she told us that they keep saying No. Once our food came out the only one without food was our 5 year old son. It took at least 5 minutes before his food finally came out. Obviously,  he was hungry and restless.... it was terrible!  I will say the pancakes tasted good but were mixed too much so they were tough and difficult to cut. We also had a huevos rancheros wrap that was delicious but hard to enjoy while being squished into the Booth. All this while looking at 5 empty seats at the main long table. We will not return and will continue to tell everyone of our experience. My guess is they feel they are too good and well known enough to care about one unhappy family.
