We decided to try the Yardley Inn again, and were extremely disappointed. Our waitress paid no attention to us at all - she chatted with other tables and passed by us with our drinks empty and never asked us if we needed refills. We had to ask her twice to bring us our drinks. We were a table of 4, and one the of the entrees we got was the Korean braised short rib. Absolutely terrible! It looked like they had trimmed a nice steak of all it's fatty pieces, grilled the pieces, and threw it on a plate. Again, we waited for our waitress to stop by so we could send the plate back. She never came by! We had to stop another waitress - she took the plate and said she would send the manager over. The manager never came. Our waitress eventually stopped by and mumbled something about how "that's how the entree is supposed to be." Â We opted to not get another entree (not that she even asked.) We finished our food, and waited 15 minutes for someone to finally take the plates. Our waitress walked by us 4 times and completely ignored us. When she finally came back over, we simply handed her our credit card so we could pay and leave. We will NOT be going back to the Yardley Inn. I would never recommend it to anyone. I cannot believe the terrible service we received. We ended up paying $110 (plus tip) for this meal. Totally unacceptable.
