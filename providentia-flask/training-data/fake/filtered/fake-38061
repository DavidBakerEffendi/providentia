I had the pleasure of having an unforgetable "first-timer" experience at The Grilled Chicken Palace.  You are greeted as you first come in by one of the biggest smiles you've ever seen...and she says "Is this your first time?".  From then on, it's an amazing taste-testing adventure!! There are a few seats inside, mostly for those patrons, waiting to take home what's promised to be the best takeout home-cooked concoction you've ever tasted! It's a culmination of comfort food with an exotic touch!! I instantly felt like family and am a customer for life!!
