Best pizza I've had in NYC (and I've had Fornino, Grimaldi's and many other highly touted pies). The ingredients are so flavorful and the pies on the menu have perfectly complemtary toppings. Even with all the great fancy pies they offer though the margherita is the best thing going and very affordable.
