Ever since I was a little brat, I've always questioned if I can eat a burger that's bigger than my head. That was finally answered when my mama dukes introduced me to Jackson Hole. They served me a bacon cheeseburger with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions that was so huge, I couldn't figure out how to stuff it in my mouth. The Big Mac and the Whopper look like cute little babies compared to that beast I was served. I looked around and observed other folks eating their burgers with knives and forks, as if it was a steak or something. It was a major battle trying to finish that burger, but my belly was victorious and very satisfied. Here's a few other cool things about this joint. They have a hardcore 50's theme and it's actually pretty cool. The exterior and interior really looks like the diner that Marty Mcfly walked into in the first Back to the Future flick. Each table has a jukebox that you can stick a quarter into and select from a menu of old school songs that you can flip through just like a real jukebox. Your selection is added into a queue of songs that are played for everyone in the diner. This is the diner in the awesome movie Goodfellas. Their shakes are really good and are served in those huge tin cups that they prepare them in. They serve fresh squeezed orange juice. You can actually watch a bunch oranges go into their magical machine and the orange juice flow out into your glass. They have a picture of Bill Clinton dining in one of the tables displayed near the front door. That is one guy who knows burgers. The servers are really cool but the line for a table can get ridiculously long during the weekend brunch hours. Â  Have you ever had a burger that's bigger than your head?
