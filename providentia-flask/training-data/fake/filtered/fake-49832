For the experience I had last night, giving Adriana's even 1 star is a gift.  We have close friends that are regulars there and figured if they love it there so much we should give it a second try.  It is really sad when the only redeeming quality of a restaurant is the food. The food was very good, but the attitude of the majority of the staff was beyond reproach. After 20 minutes of waiting for a bottle of wine we were given a huge attitude when we asked where it was. There was a significant wait each time we ordered a bottle- 20 minutes or greater.  They were inflexible with their menu- which gave us the feeling the food was pre-made.  We had the general feeling the staff could not be bothered to serve our table.  The one female waitress that ran the bar was very good- quick, efficient and kind.  At the end of the night when we advised the waiter of our dissatisfaction he had the audacity to say we were being rude.  I have never once in my life been called rude.  I don't even think he was at our table long enough to discern the fact we were rude.  We basically only saw him when we placed our order - he never came to check on us and never asked us if everything was OK.  When my mother spoke to a friend about the awful experience we had a staff member stepped in and said it was us and to never come back there again. The owner sat there and watched my mother being verbally assaulted by a staff member. I go out to eat twice weekly and have never been treated like this before.  We will never step foot in this restaurant again.
