These people are thieves! I ordered a pizza from them. When the girl gave me the total is seemed high so I did the calculations and found that I was being over charged. I asked her to go through the calculation with me, she stated she doesn't need to do that because she knows how much the pizza cost and she has other customers to serve. I asked to speak to a manager and he too was unwilling to recalculate the price. I felt that they knew they were over charging but didn't want to admit it when they were called on it.
