This restaurant is fairly new, as it opened up in September of this year. The place is pretty small which isn't a bad thing. It has a really intimate feel and from that perspective it might be good for a first date. On the food side, I had the chicken, green beans, cornbread, and macaroni & cheese. I was with a large party and we waited nearly an hour and a half before five of us were served. Two of my friends and I had chicken that came out hot, though our sides and cornbread were cold. We told the wait staff and they came back and promptly took our plates. That was great, but they took our plates behind a bar (that doesn't serve alcohol) and stuck them in the microwave one by one in front of us. I was starving, so I ate, but my friends declined and decided they'd eat elsewhere. The desert which was a red velvet bread pudding wasn't particularly appetizing and most of my group didn't finish it. Many plates of food were returned partially eaten. It wasn't that good by many of our estimations. The wait staff is really kind and enthusiastic, so that was a nice touch. One of the girls in particular was pretty hot, so that of course was plus for me and my two little eyes. The owner was nice and available as well and offered my friend a free meal to take home (that was declined) and was also offered to come back for the Sunday Buffet. I think that the Essex Sports Cafe has a lot of things in place to make the place really great and they're in a great location, right across the street from city hall in the bustle of downtown Newark. I personally think they'll have to offer really good and a great experience to be successful there. I'm going to try it again with no so large a group and see how it compares. Not yet impressed.
