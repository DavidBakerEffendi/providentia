I absolutely love this place! The mac n' cheese is a must have. Now no mac n' cheese can compare. I've been there on a few occasions and never had too wait long to get seated or for our servers, which have always been great, but it has been on weekdays either early afternoon or past 1am. I've never experienced rush hour. I usually get the mac n' cheese, but I've also had the silver dollar pancakes & the veggie burger, Â as well as the fries and various desserts. All were delicious.
