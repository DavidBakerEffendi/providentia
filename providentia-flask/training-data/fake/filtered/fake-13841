I hardly ever write reviews but this one felt necessary. Went to this place for the first time with my boyfriend tonight and oh man was I disappointed! The waitress was rude, slow, and overall just not attentive, which was interesting since this is such a small place (which is usually something I like) and there were not very many customers there at all. So we went ahead and ordered our food. My bf ordered the Pad Thai. To keep it short, it was just a complete mess. In all the years we've been dating I've never seen this guy return a plate of food until tonight. He was polite about it and asked if he could switch it for something else, the waitress laughed and said no because he had already tasted it. You wouldn't know that you don't like it unless you've tasted it so that made no sense whatsoever, but he didn't want to be a bother so we just decided to share my plate. A few moments later the chef came out to our table and asked what was wrong with the plate we sent back. I immediately felt how aggressive and upset he was at the fact that the plate was sent back. He proceeded to tell us (more like yelling) that if we had never tried that dish before we simply shouldn't have ordered it. I don't know about you, but one of my favorite things is to try different foods and places, it'd be silly to never try anything new for fear of not liking it. Anyway, he was so loud, rude and obnoxious it was humiliating! We were still charged for the food and at that point we just wanted to get out of that place so we just paid for it and left as fast as we could. Its safe to say will definitely never be going back or recommending it to anyone in our area. Sad since the place is a block away from where we live, I was excited to have it be one of my new go-to places. Honestly, it was an all around bad experience.
