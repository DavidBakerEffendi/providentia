Comment to the owner Gavin: My family and I were vacationing in New York at the time and I actually talked them into going to dark horse for lunch. I thought the ambience of the restaurant was great. We went on Saturday December 6, 2014 at about 2pm. The restaurant was 3/4 empty at the time. After the fact, we went to another Irish pub in time square and it was fantastic. What really made our experience at your restaurant horrible was the waiter. I don't think your customers and guests should be treated as though they are eating for free and that your employees are doing the customers a favor. I'm sorry but, Bad for business. Waiter had a heavy accent, didn't catch his name. Bus boy was very nice.
