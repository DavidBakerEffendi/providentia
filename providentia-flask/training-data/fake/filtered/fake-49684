What a disappointment my Sunday lunch turned out to be. I started out with high expectations. The ambience was outstanding. But you can't eat ambience. The portions were ridiculously small. Perhaps this was a blessing in disguise. The salmon , which arrived after a very, very long wait, was dry and flavorless. The service was extremely slow. The waitress was sullen if not outright rude.. The baked Alaska, I had for dessert, turned out to be quite enjoyable but it did not make up the overall experience.
