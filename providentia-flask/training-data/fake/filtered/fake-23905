Terrible service. My party of four were basically ignored by the bartender when I went for dinner. It was so bad that my boyfriend went to the hostess to ask for a glass of water. We finally got 2 of the drinks we ordered after we were seated thankfully the manager comped our drinks but if the manager Anthony reads this he should really reevaluate his staff. Our server was alright but not willing to engage my party until he saw the tip we left him. Then he decided to be a bit more personable. The food was ok and the portions were too small but I'm sure we would have enjoyed our food more if the service was better. I won't ever be going back, and you shouldn't consider spending your money there.
