Completely blown away by their brunch menu! Everything is so well-portioned and flavorful and the list goes on ad infinitum.  Someone ordered the Sicilian baked eggs over at the next table and that's definitely going to be my choice the next time I come here.   My tastes were veering towards hearty that morning so I opted for the steak and eggs which they serve sunny side up with herbed potatoes.  I'm not really someone who has a natural inclination towards steak but trust me when I say they do theirs well here.  I was licking the knife clean, reminiscent of the opening credits scene to Dexter.  Not to mention the little wooden marker stating how well your steak was cooked was an adorable and classy touch. They do their ginger ales in house too, which is always a plus in my book.  The one I got had tons of fresh cucumber muddled within the ginger ale, so you get a dry yet refreshing touch. I didn't get to check out the photobooth that everyone's been talking about, but really, when the food is so good here, that should be the last thing on your mind.  Save the picture taking for those drunken, wasted nights at a bar where you're able to break out your best poses in a conveniently placed booth.  You come here solely for the food. Oh, and definitely make a reservation.  It was a madhouse on Sunday morning, but you can see why.
