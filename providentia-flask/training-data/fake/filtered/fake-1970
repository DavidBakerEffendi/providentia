I am 15 years old and this is my very first restaurant review.  I was very disappointed with the service, the food, and the staff of this restaurant.  Our waiter was no help at all.  He could have cared less about what we actually wanted to order.  Not only was the service rude it was also very slow.  I went out with my family to have a nice dinner in town to end a busy week and it made me sad that my dad spent his hard earned money on food that tasted like it had just been run through the dishwasher.  The food was bland, not hot, and had no appeal.  I know we will never return and I'm going to tell all of my friends at school never to go here.  It should be zero stars not even one.
