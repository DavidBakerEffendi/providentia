I adore Rucola! It's my favorite neighborhood spot. I have eaten there many times. Occasionally there's a flaky waiter but overall the staff is really nice - especially the maitre d' who I think may be one of the owners? Not sure. The drinks are delicious and there's always a new and wonderful seasonal cocktail to try. The charcuterie is Â great - especially the speck, I also like the grilled octopus, roast chicken, pork loin, homemade pastas. YUM. Great Italian-y dishes. Oh and brunch is good too. The place is small, so the tables are close together and there's a big communal table in the middle of the room. If you want lots of elbow room, this is probably not the place for you.
