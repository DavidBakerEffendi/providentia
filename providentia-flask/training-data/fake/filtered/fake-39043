I just moved to burlington and was exploring town, stumbled across this store as they were finishing construction. i talked to the owner and he explained their whole operation, and a few days later it was up and running. unbelievable yogurt! it was pouring rain all week but this place kept us dry for the couple of rounds we went there for. going to be an after dinner regular for us
