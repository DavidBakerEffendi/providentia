The setting and the food are just perfect. Casual dining with very good prices. This is a great place for a small group of friends to spend a few hours over tasty drinks and a great menu of small plates to share. The small plate portions are good but the main dishes are just enormous. Rather shockingly large really. If you order a main course go light on the starters. I was impressed they even had drink specials on a Saturday night. I've noticed reviews saying the service was rude, short, and other bad things. I did not experience this at all. I'm not one that appreciates the wait staff being overly attentive so maybe my standards of good service are different but I found our waitress very pleasant and just attentive enough to keep our table happy. I will definitely be back! and my croque-monsieur was awesome!
