I came here for a birthday dinner with 5 people, and they were very friendly and the 4 course tasting menu was DELICIOUS!!! The chef was very gracious and friendly. The tasting menu is something everyone should try - its from 5-8pm, $35/pp I think. The chef asked each person at the table their likes/dislikes, allergies, food restrictions, etc. I am vegetarian and its near impossible to find delicious, well-conceived dishes at good quality restaurants - so this was a HUGE treat. The atmosphere is romantic, dim lighting, rusting - Â great for a date.
