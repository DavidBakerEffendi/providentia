This was my first visit to Ippudo . I heard a lot good things about food but was really disappointed with ridiculous rules of this place. My friends were celebrating a promotion and I decided to join them at the last minute. I arrived to Ippudo when they were sited and ordered food already. I was informed by the hostess that there is no "add on policy" and that means even if they let me go in, I am not allowed to order food. This was fine with me as I was not hungry and just wanted to share the moment with my friends. I was sited when food was on a table and my friends we eating.
