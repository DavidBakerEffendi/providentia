I brought my brother here when he was visiting New York. He was skeptical that the pizza here could really be better than your typical NY-slice. But now he's a convert! The dough is perfect, and the cheese just melts right off. The touristy vibe is a bit too much if you live here, but it's worth it for the awesome pizza.
