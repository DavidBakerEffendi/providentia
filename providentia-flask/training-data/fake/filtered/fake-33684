The food and atmosphere of this place are awesome. Really tasty fajitas and a fun place to hang out. What really spoiled our experience was the service. Jose Tejas is known to have long wait times. My brother had stepped out to run an errand during our 1 hour wait. He wasn't back by the time we were seated, and within 5 minutes the manager (Alex) came over and made us relinquish our table. He was completely unreasonable for the following reasons: 1) This policy had not been enforced at the time we were seated. 2) We were planning to order my brother's meal immediately, preventing a possible delay caused by his absence. 3) We started eating the chips and salsa, my father had already ordered a drink, and we were still asked to leave. It really spoiled our evening, and given that we were in a rush, the effect was only amplified. Seemed like a waste to produce such tasty food and hire such a delinquent manager. Moral of the story? If you go, be prepared to wait, and make sure no one leaves the premises to avoid a frustrating turn of events.
