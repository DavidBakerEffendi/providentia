So I have heard about this place from a few folks.  I met a long time friend there last night.  Ordered the "grilled mackerel" sub and split pea soup.  The soup was good.  The sandwich was good.  But, I wasn't impressed.  I was expecting more ambience/vibes, but it was kinda flat.  Also, I would like to know why do restaurants/cafes think it is okay now to charge $10 for a sandwich and not provide a side dish?  This is why I do not eat out much.  Not sure if I will visit again during a visit to Philly
