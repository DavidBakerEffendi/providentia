I came here as a reference from a friend and I am glad I did.  I ordered the Kyclades Special which was enough for 2 people. The taste is delicious, and the service is great. I sat inside but it was just too noisy for me, so I asked to be seated outside instead. Luckily it was a beautiful day outside,  the ambiance was great.
