This is one of my favorite restaurants. I've tried a number of dishes and they have all been wonderful. Danny Meyer's restaurants all emphasize great service and I have always been treated very well here. The mixed berry ricotta pancakes are perfectly made and flavorful. The berries and ricotta come on the side so you can add to your taste. The pastas and meat dishes are delicious and fresh. You won't leave feeling heavy at all! Great flavors all around. Definitely make reservations in advance. Maialino books up fast!
