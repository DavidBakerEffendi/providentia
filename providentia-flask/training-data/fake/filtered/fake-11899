Absolutely fantastic!  I went there for the eggplant parmigiana, but the waiter convinced me to try the veal and eggplant.  Against his recommendation, I also ordered a side of linguine bolognese... how can you not eat pasta at a place like this?  I ate until I hurt and then took three more bites!   Did not come close to finishing, but I sure tried.  They specialize in family style but they will serve single guest. The portions are substantial and the the quality is great. Very friendly and helpful waiter.  My water glass never quite got empty and the food came out quick and hot. I will definitely be back.
