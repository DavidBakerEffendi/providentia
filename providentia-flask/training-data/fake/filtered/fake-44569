I do not even know where to start. The service here is AWFUL and the food is OK. I lived in NYC for over ten years and love going out to eat and trying new spots. This was my second time back so I feel I can finally review it. The hostesses are the rudest I have ever encountered in any dining experience. If you ask a question, they laugh at you and roll their eyes. I felt compelled to write a review bc I do not understand how this place is still so busy. It is not that great. Last time I went for my sister in law's 35th bday. They brought all our food out cold and forgot her meal. Not only did they not apologize at all, they then brought out her new meal cold and raw too with again, no apologies at all. We were in shock. They just didn't seem to care at all. After brining out cold, undercooked food we all sat there with empty wine glasses and water glasses. We finally said something and the manager came over and didnt seem to care that much either. I do not get it at all. When this has happened at other restarunts like LAVO in NYC the managers have come over, apologized profusely and offered to buy a round of drinks, etc; however, I guess this establishment thinks they are too good for that. If you are considering going -- do not. There are hundreds of other restaraunts so much better, and so much more worth you money!!
