Discovered this gem of a restaurant after spa treatments during our annual girls' spa weekend in Princeton. The homemade meatballs are out of this world! They were so good, we asked for 2 orders to go and that is what I will be having for dinner Sunday when I return home. The place is small but the clientele obviously loved the food, as we did. The service was terrific and very friendly. We also had a salad and thin crusted marguerita pizza that was simply outstanding! Â I would highly recommend this place and truly a hidden gem.
