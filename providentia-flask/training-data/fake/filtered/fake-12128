Physically a lovely place with a nce bar. We came in with a groupon for paella for 2 and a pitcher of sangria  We ate and drank at the bar  jay the bartender was great..personable and attentive  The paella was bland and undistinguished  It also wasnt really a paella for 2   more like a paella for one and a half.  We did have a very nice appetizer of chicken and skirt steak  We ordered cocktails beyond the sangria 9which also was just OK) and the cocktails were overpriced  In an area of fantastic latin ethnic restaurants Vivo failed to distinguish itself
