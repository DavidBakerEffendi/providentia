This place was pretty cool. -decor was really pretty cool. we didn't dance, or go to the bar, just ate in the diner part, it was still early. the food was great, and the cocktails were excellent. try "the painkiller". they don't have frozen drinks however :(. the waitress was very sweet as well Didn't sit outside, but it looks like a beautiful area. def. a hipster hangout. I'd recommend silk city as a starting off spot for food and drinks!
