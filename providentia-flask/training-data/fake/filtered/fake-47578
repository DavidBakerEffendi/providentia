Give yourself an extra hour or two to queue to get in, because it's unlikely that you'll be able to just walk in, even on a Monday night. When you do manage to get in, be grateful if you don't end up sharing your personal space with too many other people in the cramped tables. The pizza is ok, not spectacular. I think they rely purely on keeping people waiting long enough that they are famished and have a skewed perception of how good the food is. Not exactly somewhere you'd go for a relaxing dinner, that's for sure.
