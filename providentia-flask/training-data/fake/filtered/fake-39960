Good vegetarian options, friendly and accommodating but insanely salty food (beware!) Due to the dearth of vegetarian dining options in our area, I have to applaud Pei Wei for offering many veg and vegan options. They clearly mark the dishes that are pure vegetarian and many can be made vegetarian if you ask them to leave out the sauce (which usually has fish paste). Do take note of their nutritional content which can be found online. Their average dish has over 3000mg of salt, PER SERVING -- that's over 2-3 days worth of the max recommended by dietary guidelines. Ask to hold the sauce or get it on the side, your body will thank you. Salt issues aside, if you get their dishes steamed they still taste pretty good and are relatively healthy and tasty. The tofu is similar to the tofu you'll find at PF Changs and the vegetables were crisp.  The brown rice was perfectly done.  I would eat there again but order carefully.
