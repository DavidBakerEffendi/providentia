I came here to try out some Asian food that's not Korean or Japanese. I don't really remember what I ate, but I think it's quite palatable. It's not something you could quickly get used to if your diet usually consist of burgers and junk food though. This Cambodian Cuisine Torsu deserves my 5 stars. :D
