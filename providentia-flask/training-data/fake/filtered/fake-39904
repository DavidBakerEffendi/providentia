7 items on the menu were not available! A Saturday night - even the items we ordered had to be modified because they didn't have all the ingredients.  There was a 2 page article in 7 Days newspaper on the revival of fondue.  Skinny Pancake had an ad on the page stating it was available on Fri and Sat.. But no such luck - the staff even had to look for the fondue pots and then came back and said 'no go'.  Very disappointed - felt sorry for the staff as they had to keep apologizing.  This is definitely a poor management issue.  Won't go here again.
