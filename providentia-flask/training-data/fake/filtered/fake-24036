The night I got engaged, my fianc√© and I some how randomly found Woodrow's. They technically weren't "open" but were having a preview night for who ever stumbled in. What a great bar we found! The staff is so nice and there's excellent beers on tap (Try the half Guinness half Blueberry Ale - it's so good!) Woodrow's is a must try!
