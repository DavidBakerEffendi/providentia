After two separate lunchtime visits for my group of three, it's clear Chickie's & Pete's  reputation hangs entirely on its sports bar setup, because if you're not a sports fan, and are looking for anything more than mediocre food in a noisy setting, you're out of luck here.   On our first visit we ordered two  cheesesteaks and a burger.  The burger was fine, but took nearly 30 minutes to arrive.  The cheesesteaks were just plain awful: the meat was not on the griddle long enough to cook off enough of the juices, and as a result the bread rolls had literally turned to mush before our first bite. Our second visit just this week was some months after the first.  We knew to avoid the cheesesteaks, so this time we ordered a chicken club, a plain pizza, and a burger.  Again, the burger was fine, and again took a long time to arrive -- about 25 minutes.  The chicken club was bone dry and flavorless.  Not sure how you can make a tough, chewy chicken cutlet, but they managed it.  The pizza was quite literally a big soggy undercooked cracker smeared with mild tomato sauce.  No sign of cheese at all, and easily the worst pizza I have ever tried.  At $12, that's an absolute outrage. We ordered fries on both visits.  They were fine -- but let's be honest: it's almost impossible to screw that up. Both visits were in the early afternoon, and the place was about half full each time -- and with hard, bare surfaces reflecting sounds everywhere, it was quite noisy.  It was tough to have a conversation that could be heard above the other diners and the televisions, so you can forget having a business lunch here. Bottom line:  if you're a sports fan, go for it, and stick with the beer and fries.  Anyone else should steer clear.  If you're in that area, there's a couple of small Italian places in the same shopping center -- go for one of those instead.  You'll be much happier.
