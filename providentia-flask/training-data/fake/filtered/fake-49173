this restaurant is not worth going too. the service is horrible. we had to wait 15 mins to get our drinks, wait another 15 mins for our order to be taken, etc....( we waited a very long time for everything) and the waiter seemed like he was not listening when we gave him our order. the food had no taste whatsoever. no seasoning. very bland. and the servings for the table top grill were very small. but the absolute part of our dinner that ruined the night was the fact that after we asked for water we saw him pour our drinks and then start zapping bugs/flies with their tennis racket looking bug zapper around the drink station. he was doing that for 10 mins and then served our waters to us....of course we didnt drink the water.  other customers looked around to see what the zapping noise was but my bf and i had a clear view of what he was doing. also other waiters joined in the bug zapping festivities.....very disgusting and unprofessional.   my bf and i will not be coming here again. this was a waste of our time and money. the only plus about having a waiter that is lazy is that he messed up on my bf's drink order and he received a free drink......so if anyone wants to try this place out look for one of their lazy waiters and i'm pretty sure you can get a free drink i hope a manager or owner reads this review and has a meeting with his staff. i wish there was a manager walking the floor when we were there so i could personally tell them about their staff.
