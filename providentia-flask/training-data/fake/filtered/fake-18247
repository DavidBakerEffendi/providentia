My 3rd time here with my wife and it was great again..we live in verona so it's right down the road for us..started with a beer & glass of wine in the bar area and that we sat in the main room.  We shared the octopus app and I had the ribeye and my wife had a seafood special.  Both entrees were great and the server was very good with explaining the menu and walking us thru popular items.  The Chef was walking thru the restaurant occasionally which is very cool to see that he cares.  The waiter said they do private parties and she may see if her bank wants to have their holiday party there.  Look forward to the next time...
