I love Jose tejas! I go all the time. It's really worth the trip because the food is cheap and delicious. I can eat the chips and guacamole all day. Try the quesadillas, they are amazing. A lot of the items on the menu are a bit spicy though. My only complaint is that the wait is always at least a half hour here. On the weekend during dinner time you can be waiting for up to an hour. Â The restaurant is pretty loud too which can be quite annoying at times.
