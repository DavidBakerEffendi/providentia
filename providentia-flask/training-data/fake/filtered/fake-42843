I have finally had the chance to tried this malaysian restaurant!!! after all i have heard from my malaysian friends. When i used to live at UWS, I used to go to Penang quite often. Now, I have nyonya which is only a couple of blocks away! This is awesome. I love the food here. Must order Nasi Lemak, MeeSiam, Hainanese Chicken, Roti, and Satay! OMG, I miss the food already!
