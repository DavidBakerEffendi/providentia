went there last weekend and had a horrible meal.  I ordered a crab cake sandwich which took 40 minutes to arrive.   To make matters worse, it tasted like a mouth full of raw fish.   I eat crab quite often and know that it's not supposed to taste like that.   It was served with a spicy sauce that was too hot for my taste.  I asked for tarter sauce and was told that they didn't have any.  How can you serve seafood and not have tarter sauce???   My husband's burger wasn't good either.  I am not used to this kind of food/service there.   When we complained to the waiter he shrugged as if to say "who cares?"   When I tried to go to their website to complain, it wouldn't let me upload my comments and the words "Warning Dangerous Downloads appears.  We will never go back there again.
