The restaurant is very cool and they have a great outdoor space. The servers are very knowledgable and provide excellent service. Their brunch is quick to come out and delicious. My disappointment is usually with the dinner menu as it is very very limited. Last time I went the only meat options were liver and a burger. Also, my food overall was under seasoned and extremely al dente. So in my opinion for brunch it's excellent, for dinner, it's ok.
