Six of us left Eataly walking up 5th Avenue and stumbled on LuLu & Me Gastrobar. It just opened and there were only a couple of tables occupied for dinner. But it's a very pretty, cozy place, and we've enjoyed Gastrobars in Europe, so we gave it a shot. What a pleasant surprise! First, the wine and beer selections are as good as we've seen in Manhattan - and very reasonably priced. The food was excellent. The owners were very welcoming and the staff couldn't have been friendlier or more helpful. And our bill including drinks, beer & 3 bottles of Â wine was under $100 per couple. Wow, what a find! I heartily recommend it and will definitely return.
