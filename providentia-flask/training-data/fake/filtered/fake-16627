I'll make this short and sweet as my visit was the same.  Rushing to a Flyers game and needed a quick bite in South Philly..  Told the waiter I'm trying to make a game, I want (2) orders of Summer Rolls, a beer and a check.  1 minute later, 4 amazingly fresh summer rolls and a Tsingtao beer(I know it's Chinese but I still like it!) showed up.  Fresh, crisp, great peanut dipping sauce, chugged my beer, check on table, my type of place!
