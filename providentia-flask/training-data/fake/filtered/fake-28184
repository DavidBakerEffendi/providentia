I worked at mac attack for 3 or 4 months and I can provide an answer for all of the bad reviews about this place. While I was working there I was the only chef out of 5 that had ever had kitchen experience. The rest of the kitchen staff were dishwashers off the street that were taught how to throw cheese and pasta into a pan. 50% of the staff have never even met the owners of Mac Attack not to mention every employee makes no more than minimum wage which is a recipe for a staff that does not care about their jobs. It is not the employees fault for the missing ingredients, it is the cheap owners who want to pay employees as if they are McDonalds and expect them to work as if it is Tribeca Grill. To sum it all up, save your money let this place close down soon so something better can take its place.
