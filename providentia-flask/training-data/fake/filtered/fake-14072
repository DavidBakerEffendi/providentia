Ok let me first say that it was my fault for even thinking this place would be good. I went here back in February with some college friends and had to wait 2 hours for a table. Then I went again in April and the same thing happened. The food was blehhhhhh but what got to me was the EXTREMELY RUDE waitress. Their attitudes are disgusting. They act as if you are forcing them to work at C.Pot. They take about 30 minutes to even come to your table and then they expect to get a great tip. Never again will I go there ever ever again.
