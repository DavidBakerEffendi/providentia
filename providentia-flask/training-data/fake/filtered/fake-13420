We recently had dinner at the Canoe Club.  It is definitely more upscale than just a restaurant/bar, although the bar was lively and full at an early hour.  The food was great and the waiter was very conscientious.  When our burger was rare instead of the medium we asked for, he was very apologetic and later offered dessert on the house.  Our meals were excellent, especially the fish.  Definitely make a reservation if there's a show across the street.  I highly recommend it for something yummy and a little "nicer" in the Hanover area.
