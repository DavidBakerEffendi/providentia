Super cheap and the potion served is more than enough for girls, I think. The cashier woman greets you in Japanese 'Irasshai Mase' when you walk in..which I thought was very welcoming. If you are a kind of person who is gourmet and prefer having your meal at tidy and clean place, this is not the place for you. And I do not know whay it is represented as a Korean place....??????? Today I worked close to this place and had craved for Japanese curry so I decided to try this place. The curry here is runny type. Good seasoning.Personally I thought it lacks of depth in taste... Rice was not warm and a bit too soft for curry- again this is my personal preference. I had Pork Katsu. The Katsu was alright. The panko was not crispy. Decor- there's no decor..which should be their style. A bit untidy on the kitchen and their walls are covered with dust and dirt.... Napkin holders are not cleaned... The other Japanese Curry place in EV is much better in quality and decor. In conclusion, as a born and raised in Japan, I have many options to try excellent curry back home in Japan Â and in EV, I don't think I am coming back to this place.
