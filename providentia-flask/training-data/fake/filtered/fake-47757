If you're based in lower Manhattan, the weather is mild, and time is of no concern, the fastest way to get here is by foot, hoofing it across the Brooklyn Bridge, under which it's been located seemingly since time began, since the nearest subway station is nearly as far as the other side of the East River. (Alternatively and more expensively, you can take a water taxi that will deposit you at a pier down the street, then walk back to work off your meal.) The interior probably hasn't changed since it first opened its doors - the decor consists of plastic red-checked tablecloths and hundreds of autographed photos of famous patrons. This is New York-style pizza, pure and simple . . . there isn't an arugula leaf in sight. A thin crust is topped by tangy tomato sauce and thick slabs of buffalo mozzarella oozing towards the crisp edges, and topping options don't get much fancier than pepperoni and black olives. Definitely avoid this place at the usual lunch and dinner hours, or you'll wait for nearly as long as it's been here. Cash only.
