My family and I discovered this place purely by chance. On our way home to Ansonia, we got very hungry and could not wait to get home to have lunch. So we looked for a small restaurant on the Post Road where we could have a quick meal. Hao Si Chaun was the first one we found on our way. As soon as we entered the restaurant, the way we were greeted by the staff gave us that great feeling that we made a wonderful discovery. Our next pleasant surprise was the sight of only asian customers sitting in there. Right away, our mouth started watering when we looked at the menu and the dishes being served around us. When finally we took the first bite, we realized that we had finally fulfilled a long time dream: To enjoy authentic chinese food right here in Connecticut.
