Glasserie is incredible, I don't even know where to start!  It's been a while since I've been to a truly unique restaurant. From the space, decor, vibe, and menu, everything was an experience and a break from the same old "been there, done that" trends.  The attention to detail in the decor, food and drinks is amazing. We went last Friday night and had reservations. The place was packed with a lively, positive energy and it was obvious everyone was having a good time. We had more of a night out experience versus just dinner. We enjoyed several dishes including the cauliflower, lebneh, griddle bread,  steak, lamb croquettes, and the rabbit. None of us had rabbit before and we were pleasantly surprised. The chocolate cake with sesame dessert is heavenly. The cocktails are interesting and delicious. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, and was attentive but not overbearing. I keep recommending this place to everyone I know in NY or who is going to be in the NY area, and I can't wait to go back!
