Very disappointing. Rack of lamb was without the usual bones, no vegetable offered. Of the three "lines" of sauces on the plate, one was bitter and there were no pan juices. Sea Bass was overcooked as was the bed of spinach which was underneath. Had to ask 3x for another roll. Service was only fair, unlike their old restaurant. Couldn't understand the the English of some of the staff which made it difficult to communicate. Very expensive for what we received. (Glass of wine was a whopping $24)
