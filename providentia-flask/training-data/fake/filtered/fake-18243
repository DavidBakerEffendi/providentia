My husband and I have been here several times with others and on our own.  Overall I have to say we enjoy coming here.  My husband loves his craft beers and they always have a good selection here.  The food is also very good.  We especially love the pig ears, though they can be a little spicy for my taste.   A few negatives, the service can be bad.  We have had both very attentive servers and horribly clueless servers here, so the service is not always consistent.  The portions are usually small, the worst being the time we went after they had first opened.  We ordered a cheese platter that is best described as comical.  The portions of cheese were so small sharing it was almost impossible.  They have since increased the portions of the cheeses at least. If they are crowded the noise level can get very high loud since the ceilings are so high and the entire place is brick.  The atmosphere is nice and the beer selection is good so we continue to go back.  The bartenders are good and their service has improved.  The first time we went they did not even acknowledge us for well over five minutes, which they were crowded but not so crowded to ignore people that are clearly waiting for a drink.  Maybe they changed their bartenders over but the ones that are there now are very fun and attentive. Overall this is a good bar to get a drink and small portion food, the service can be hit or miss but we will definitely be back.
