Delicious. Under new ownership. Small cafe-style set up with beautiful murals inside and outside and great quality dining food, presentation, and service. We had the grilled squid, Dragon Roll and another roll whose name I forgot and to finish the cheesecake and ice cream. They make everything in-house, including the cheesecake. Prices are super-reasonable for what you get, no complaints. Like everywhere in the Ironbound section of Newark, parking is a pain but it's totally worth it. I'm so happy to have such good quality sushi in my own backyard and only a couple of blocks from Independence Park. Perfect for picnics! Run, don't walk. You won't regret it!
