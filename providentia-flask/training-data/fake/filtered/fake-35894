I had my first visit to the cafe yesterday.  My husband and I ordered cappuccino's which were delicious. While the employee appeared to be new, he was quite charming and friendly.  We sat on the terrace which was relaxing and peaceful.  What ruined the experience were some kids thought they were funny by throwing someone's bike in the lake.  We did not realize what was going on at the time and when it happened those in the park and cafe were stunned.  They quickly ran away as we stood trying to think of a way to remove the bike and discussing our dismay how they can turn something good to bad.  The bike was  too far from the edge to retrieve it so it was painful to walk away and see it still sitting there.  While this was no fault of the cafe, it will make me think again if I want to be in the park to witness such acts of disregard for others and their property.
