TACO RIENDO -- TA'CORRIENDO.  Love the play on words.  Love the tacos.  ADORE the horchatas, so refreshing in the summer heat!  Cheap and easy on the pocket.  The tacos are perfect for when you're not very, very hungry but need something to stave off your blood sugar.  So clean.  Everybody friendly.  Bathroom was impeccable and that counts for a lot these days.  I'm going back, RIENDO and CORRIENDO ASAP.
