Been here a couple of times, once with just the significant other and more recently with both families.  The food was a lot more manageable with the group than when it was just the pair of us, despite how much he can eat!   Carmine's is indeed "family style", which means the portions are enormous!  It looks expensive on the menu, but each order gives you enough food for at least four people, if not much more.  You could easily feed 8 people on $100 if you know what you're doing.   I will warn you about the garlic they put into their food: it's a lot of it.  This wasn't a problem for any of us as we love garlic, but we know it's not for everyone.  And it was in everything we had that night, with the exception of dessert.   There were about eight of us, and we had the following: ravioli with cheese, rigatoni with meatballs, fried calamari, and (you guessed it) garlic bread.  All of it was amazing, if overly filling.  Despite all of us digging in, we still had to take some of it home.   The only food-related complaint was with the meatballs, but I'm picky about that.  They were soft, but not as crumbly as the ones I make, which I prefer.  Still, they had a good flavor.   The dessert was also great.  Despite being stuffed from dinner, the dessert menu looked too good to pass up.  We all had cappuccino or hot tea of some sort to go with the tiramisu and Italian cheesecake we got.  No complaints here, except it was overly filling once again!   I would give it five stars, but the wait was pretty awful.  Took us over an hour to get seated, and then another hour before our main course was delivered to us.  The hostess was very good and we did not feel neglected at all.  It was just a busy day in the city, and an even busier day in Times Square.   We would come back, but maybe during an off-time.
