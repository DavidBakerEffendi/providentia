Great Panini and atmosphere! This is one of the few European style cafes/restaurants in Williston. Half the shop is where you order, the food and pastries are nicely displayed. I always get the blackened chicken paninini....to die for! Just the right crunch and spice. The only reason I gave four stars is that some of their desserts are not fabulous, prefer Mirabelles for pastry.
