Outstanding Italian food. It's the type of place you take your parents to. They have, like, a million specials every day there. The service is good. Â Kudos to the servers for listing off all of those specials. The dishes are a good size, I always leave with plenty of leftovers. They have all kinds of Italian dishes there but my favorite to get there is good old spaghetti and meatballs.
