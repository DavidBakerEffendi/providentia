I thought I would love this place I had high hopes. It looked pretty interesting online.  First turn off was the the pricing for their products. Its  just not feasible or economical. After purchasing their misco kale salad, I had a bad stomach ache soon after which lasted for weeks. I never had stomach issues so it was a shock. I found out soon after from visiting my primary doctor that I had contracted a parasite and I blame them. I have no proof it was them but I know my body and what I ate that day and the weeks in between. I will not be returning. They are obviously brand new to the food industry and have a whole lot of work to do. Unfortunately my pockets don't deserve to be sacrificed while they figure it out.  Sometimes looks can be deceiving, i thought it was getting back to the way humans ate? Its more so  over hyped with prices even Steve Jobs God rest his soul would scoff at. Its far too expensive.  The prices are outrageous, enter at your own risk. I'll pass. I 'd rather go to whole foods cheaper and safer.
