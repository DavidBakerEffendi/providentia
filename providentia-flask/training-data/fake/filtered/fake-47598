Great pizza for a great price. Nice thin crust pizza w/ fresh mozzarella and tangy sauce. I was there during lunch time and It was quite busy, so I had to sit with strangers (community seating). The service is pretty good considering a full house of patrons. My only complaint would be the limited parking spaces around the area, so the only opportunities to enjoy their food is only when there is a parking spot when I happen to be driving by the place.
