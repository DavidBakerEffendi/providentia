Friends made a reservation for Saturday night, Labor Day Weekend. We likely did not need a reservation, as the place was half empty all night.  We found the wait staff attentive, and helpful.  We split the Martini Salad, which was interesting, and tasty.  The shrimp with pasta and broccoli rabe was tasty, and shrimp good size and tasty.  My date had veal and eggplant parm, also plentiful, and tasty.  Parking was adequate, pricing fair.  We will return! Also: BYOB, always a plus!
