Love Uncle WILLIE'S!!!  Friendly staff and if you're looking for brewed sweet tea (not the kind where you add sugar after, but the kind where the sugar is brewed in with the tea) this is the place.  i grew up in the South and this is as close as it gets for Connecticut!  BBQ is awesome and the hush puppies are addicting.
