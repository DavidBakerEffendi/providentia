I am giving 1 star because it seems I cannot not write a review without a star. OMG! The to-go sucks. Biryani both mutton and chicken was horrible. Honestly when you say biryani it is supposed to have spices and not just plain white rice with some red colors. No salt, No masala whatsoever and the chicken smelled, like it was stale. I had ordered to-go biryani's for a pot luck imagine how embarrassing it is when the food you brought to pot-luck sucks.
