You want a Panini....... then go to Anthony and Son Panini Shoppe!!!  The panini's are delicious!!!  I've had a few different sandwiches and they were all fresh and made with high quality products and of course love!  I travel all the way from Brooklyn to have the Panini's, so must be something pretty good!  You cannot go wrong with Anthony and Son!!!
