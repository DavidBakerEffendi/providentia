Great new bar!  Upstairs feels like you are at a classy bar in an episode of Mad Men, downstairs is cozy basement with beautiful wooden bar and booths that have your own personal taps! Food was great too - had the French dip sandwich which was DELICIOUS!  Great place to go for a few drinks with friends and one of the few nice bars in that area.
