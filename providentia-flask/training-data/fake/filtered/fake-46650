The manager is very rude. First, we get charged a ridiculously high amount (without telling us) for having a small cake that we brought from outside as a birthday cake for one of the persons in the group. When we asked the manager to review it, he refused to do so and then rudely told us that from next he will also add a 18% tip on the bill upfront.
