I went here with my family on a recent excursion into Burlington, and I had a great experience. One of my biggest pet peeves is when service takes a long time, and I'm happy to say that the staff here is friendly and attractive ;) I had a lovely meal, 'Chicken Under the Brick' and the Lemon Curd for desert! The atmosphere here was also great!!
