Been driving by everyday for a year and I always tell myself "I'm going to have dinner there sometime soon" but I always forget. Tonight was the night, we went for date night and it was AMAZING!!! Excellent service from arrival to departure. Such a nice atmosphere. The food is literally the best in Yardley. Italian can sometimes be cliché and bland, but everything here is fantastic and fresh!  Enjoy your bottle of wine and your dinner for a perfect experience. I am definitely coming back, many times.
