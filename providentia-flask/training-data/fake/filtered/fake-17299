This place is great. I usually get the grilled steak or chicken ranchero burrito, but they sometimes have special burritos that are cheaper (barbecue pork or mole) and those are awesome, too. Their salsa is phenomenal, and they always give free chips and salsa with to-go purchases, as well as free chips if you decide to stay there. I've tried the tostada salad, which is pretty good.
