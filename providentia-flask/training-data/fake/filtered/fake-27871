Amazing.  Love the ambiance, simplicity and attention to detail.  Reminds me of a childhood barbecue joint in Tuscaloosa that served only ribs and white bread -- nothing else.  Here it is pizza and calzones, period.  Freshest ingredients. Try to face the kitchen and watch the cooks at work, it's magic. BYOB.
