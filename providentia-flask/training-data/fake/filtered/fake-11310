I love the fruits and vegetables at Eataly.  They are always the top quality, very fresh. The products are very high quality but sometimes too expensive for regular home use. I would suggest the buying the ingredients and making fresh pasta at home instead of paying extra to eat it at the restaurant there.  Same quality but double the price.
