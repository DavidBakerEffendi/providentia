What can I say, a down to earth, unpretentious pub with a great selection of beers and good pub food. Â The owners are outstanding and very interested in making the experience enjoyable, most of the staff is well versed on whats on tap (though the taps change often enough that it's tough for them to keep up!) Happy hour prices are outstanding and they seem interested in bringing some new options with monthly 5 course beer and bourbon dinners, the food which really gives the chef a chance to shine, which he does! I hate to recommend it so highly, I want it to myself
