We live only a few blocks away, (walking distance), and have frequented the Continental weekly, either to eat in or take out.  After the terribly rude service from the owner on New Years, we will never return.  The food was always ok, there is certainly a restaurants in the area, with much better, the beer selecation is nice, (as far as my husbands concerned), and the drinks we ok............... it was always generally a pleasant experience for a small bar, often very loud......... but we will no longer spend a dime there again..........
