We enjoyed our dinner! We had the Hanger Steak, Trout, and Croque Monsieur. Fantastic!  Plus some incredible Oysters from Mass.  Yummy Wild mushrooms.  Finished with delightful dark chocolate pudding and banana walnut brownie and maple bourbon ice cream!  Had Manhattan's and Martini while we waited for a table. Wonderful experience!
