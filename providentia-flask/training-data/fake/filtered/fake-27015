Found this restaurant just by walking by. Very nice with live music. Warm night so sat outside. Food was delivered very quickly. We loved everything. Shared the dumpling sampler which was 8 dumplings. The chicken pad Thai was lemony with tiny pieces of chicken. We also shared sceczuan string beans with pork and crispy rice with shrimp. If I lived in Center City I would go to this place all the time. I also had a delicious beer...Framboise... Which was so outstanding I want to drink it for breakfast! Cost was very reasonable. We spent $29 each plus tip for 1 appetizer, 3 entrees, 1 beer, 1 glass of wine and a soda.
