We had decent pizza here this evening, but my issue has to do with the "pricing." On the menu it said:  FROZEN DRINKS...and then listed the prices. When I got my bill, they overcharged me by two dollars for a frozen margarita; when I questioned this, the waitress said  that I had to pay "one dollar extra for a frozen drink, another dollar extra for ice." Huh? The waitress then said she would take it up with management. I hate being taken for an idiot, because there was no way she was going to do such a thing. The drink was not worth 11 dollars. And please don't lie and tell me I have to pay for ice or a "frozen drink" fee. My problem with Ken's Pizza: they clearly don't respect the customer. No recommendation from me, and Please, Ken: tell your waitress not to badmouth me to her best friend waitress re: my questioning the prices )once she gets inside). She might not know this, but glass is see-through!!!
