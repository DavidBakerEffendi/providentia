Went there on Saturday for the first time. This place is beautiful! The decor is a wood and stone mix and the bar top is made of pounded copper. Outside is a huge patio area with fire pits and a lot of seating. Food was delicious. Bartender was very friendly and attentive. Beer selection is second to none. City Tap is a must if you are in Philadelphia.
