Paul and Megan's first restaurant experience together on a blustery night in December. Paul ordered the pork ribs, which with the benefit of ample salt added after arrival were delicious. Megan's bowl of chicken, cabbage and mashed potatoes was the highlight of the meal, looking like a dish you might find in the Parisian countryside. Moto may be Brooklyn's perfect date restaurant, and the contrast of the grimy neighborhood with the charm and quality of the restaurant offers another example of the observation that Brooklyn's best restaurants are found on the fringes, where lower overhead translates to greater investment in ingredients, preparation and decor. The waitress left us thankfully alone for much of the meal after a long wait, and we had time enough to enjoy our bottle of wine in the dim light. Their excellent date cake and a cappuccino capped the night. Â Be warned that the space is small, and you should be comfortable with the thought of bearing an hour of very close contact around strangers surrounding the bar. Moto will leave you with the impression of having dined in a restaurant whose movie-set timelessness is unmatched in the borough. PS: Megan really liked the live music!
