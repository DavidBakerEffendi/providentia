Well.... not really sure what is going on in this place. When I first heard of this concept coming to williston I Was excited. american flatbread style pizza with local ingredients and delicious micro brews! Then I mad my first visit. The pizza was good except for the sanitizer taste from the serving dish. The personnel .... Lets not go there. I guess I was expecting a group of people who were enthusiastic about the local food scene. But the bar manager was slurping down a 5 gallon bucket of DD iced coffee and was just acting like he knew a lot about the beer. The atmosphere screams ponderosa when it should scream vermont. I made a second visit to see if anything had changed. Nope this time it was red bull and the pizza still tasted good with a hint of sanitizer. Find another place to slurp your drink down. Dim the lights, queu the music overhaul the management. Find people with passion for your product. This is a wanna be American Flatbread. Next time I will just make the drive to burlington. P.s Wash your dishes with hot water and soap!
