Ahhhhhhh,  Angelina's.    The charm of this restaurant cannot be understated.   If you like to be deceived by your waiter and mostly ignored all night this is your place!  There are no prices on the menu and we ordered three dishes and a salad for three people.  When the food finally arrived it was about a pound of pasta per dish,  enough food to serve 7 or 8 people.  The dishes cost around 30 dollars each and the bill with tax and drinks without tip was around $140.  When we paid the bill I told the waiter that he should have warned us to the prices of the food and size when we ordered and by his reaction it was obvious he didn't tell us intentionally.  The food was good and what could have been a great dinner at a lovely place was completely cheapened by the service and attitude of the staff.  I would love to go back, show friends and family when they come to town,  etc.  but I will not.   I have better places to spend my money and would rather go somewhere where they respect their patrons.
