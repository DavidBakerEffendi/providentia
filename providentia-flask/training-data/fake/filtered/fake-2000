I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Mercato.  The BYO aspect kept cost down enough so we could dabble in the four course tasting menu.   The octopus and bean salad was very tasty to start.  The pasta dish was also good, but nothing to write home about.  The best part of the meal was definitely the scallops, which were complemented very well with risotto.  Dessert was a chocolate explosion; I can never complain about that. The overall atmosphere was very intimate and our server was very prompt and nice.  My old roommate described this place as "beyond good" and I would tend to agree with her assessment.
