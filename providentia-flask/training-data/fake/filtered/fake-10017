Went here for my mother's birthday and she absolutely loved it. The albondigas were divine and incredibly juicy. We also tried the sopa de calabaza and that was so fresh and delicious tasting as well. She had the Australian sea bass and I had the Chorizo...both were cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. Definitely will have to go back.
