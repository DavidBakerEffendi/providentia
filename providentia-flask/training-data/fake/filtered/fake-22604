Took out of town relatives back to this Bella Vista stalwart.  You really can't go wrong for good, solid Italian food.  Huge veal cutlets.  Excellent sea food marinara.  Good old fashioned, reliable Italian food, in unpretentious setting, without a bunch of obnoxious people.  Great for a Sunday night, in particular.
