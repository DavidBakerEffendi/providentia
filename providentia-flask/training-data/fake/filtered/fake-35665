I finally ended up eating here after many months of hearing great things from other people. I had tried the Mezze plater with some fresh pitas for appetizer and the hummus and baba (grilled eggplant) was outstanding. Then the friendly waiter proceeded to recommend us the specials. There are about four specials...2 fish dishes one bronzino, the other salmon with pistachio and olive crust. The next specials were a chicken Tajin and a Lamb Tajin. I requetsted for the Salmon, and my friend had ordered the Lamb Tajin. The salmon was very tender, and fresh, but I kept looking over at my freidns plate because the Lamb Tajin smelled so good, and she licked the plate clean. The service was outstanding, and the restaurant was packed. The owner was very nice to us when we left and asked us how we liked the food, and overall a great ambiance and delicious food !!
