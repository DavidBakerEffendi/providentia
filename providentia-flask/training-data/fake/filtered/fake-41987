I used to go to Penang very often, even after Banana leaf was open. But Penang 's constantly changing flavor(getting worse and worse), This is the place for me now. The owner and wait staffs always give us warm welcome. It's always nice, if you're recognized. Their food is getting better and better over the time. Not that crazy about them, but pretty good. And It's BYO(another great thing about them)
