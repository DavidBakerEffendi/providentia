Disappointing. Twice in a row!! So we were in town and saw some good reviews for this place so we decided to order 2 pies for delivery .5 miles down the road. We did the buy one pie and get a plain pizza 1/2 off. Both thin crust. veggie pizza- SO soggy!! Pizza fell apart and the dough was undercooked and soaked. Cheese pizza- no flavor!! 1/2 the price = half the flavor. We called to explain the situation and the (manager? Owner?) first said "Well it's a veggie pizza and thin crust, I'm not surprised it came out like that. Â All the sauces and juice from the veggies could make it soggy like that" WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU SERVE IT THEN?! So the generosity and kindness of Godfather offered to remake us the pizza himself. One traditional crust and one thin crust. 2nd round review. First of all both were thin crust. We didn't even receive a traditional crust as he said he would make us. Both pizzas had oregano sprinkled on top which looked promising. MY oh my was it deceiving. The taste was not as bland this time BUT both pizzas were super soggy, and hard to pick up and eat!! We decided to just give up on this place. We decided pizza from a community center's pool or bowling alley pizza would have been put together better.
