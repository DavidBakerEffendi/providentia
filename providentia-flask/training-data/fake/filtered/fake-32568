SIMPLY AMAZING! I read about Uncle Gussy's online, I was visiting NY and had to give it a try. When I got there, I hesitated as I saw a line down the block, but soon realized it was moving pretty fast, and the aroma was too enticing to turn down anyway. Boy am I glad I waited! Now I understand why people flock to this location. For $6 I had more food on my plate than I could handle, and I'm a big guy pushing 250lbs! Fresh meat, seasoned to perfection with the most amazing selection of sauces. Oh, and don't be fooled by the truck. You have more options here than most lunchtisit down restaurants. You must try the frozen Greek Yogurt! It is simply AMAZING! The other aspect that was very surprising was the super friendly staff. The owners are Greek, all their food is homemade, and while they have a very fast efficient operation, they will take time out to explain the options and share a joke with you. They have a great sense of humor that keeps people coming back for more. They have a different special every day to keep it interesting, and DON'T FORGET TO TRY THE FROZEN GREEK YOGURT! 5 STARS UNCLE GUSSY'S! I love you guys!
