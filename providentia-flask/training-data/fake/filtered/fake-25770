The food is mediocre quality for Italian food.  Their non Italian staffed kitchen does an avereage job of preparing Italian food.  I would not recommend using them for take-out orders. During my last take out order they made no fewer than 4 mistakes on one order.  Do not expect that you will get exactly what you  thought you ordered  when you pick it up. If you do go forward with ordering take-out oders there, do yourself a favor and double check the total price that you'll be charged over the phone.  I'd recommend Capuano's on Clarksville road for more dependable, authentic Italian Food.
