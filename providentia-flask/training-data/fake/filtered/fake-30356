This restaurant would be at home in Nolita or Ft. Greene and is an absolute gem in Bed Stuy.   Food: The bread salad appetizer was tart and filled with fresh tomatoes and basil.   We had the mozzarella, eggplant and zucchini pizza as our entree which was done just right.  They didn't overburn the crust like @ Di Fara's and for $13, you get a whole delicious pie.   Granted, I'm from Hawaii so my taste in pizza is somewhat questionable per my partner, but even he thought it was good so I guess my taste level isn't that bad for pizza.  Hah! Dessert - oven roasted peaches with vanilla ice cream for me and tiramisu for Dan.  Both delicious. Service / Ambience - yeah, it was a little slow, but they were friendly.  Just pretend you're eating in the Tuscan countryside and then the wait won't seem that bad.  Yes, the front room is hot, so just go out in back, btw.  Lovely and cool there, esp. in the garden.  We had a perfect summer meal there last night. Saraghina definitely captured that Italian ideal of simple, good fresh ingredients in classic combinations.  Would recommend a trip out for this if you don't live here.
