Great Job! Had eggplant rolatini, a grilled avocado with crabmeat and pinapple mustard drizzle (that was a special) both were excellent! Chicken alberto was great, chicken was juicy, perfect amount of spice. Husband had osso bucco and loved it. Â Service was fast but not rushed and friendly. Nothing fell short!
