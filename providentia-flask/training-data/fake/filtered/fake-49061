I ordered a chocolate chip muffin, cheesecake and tiramisu from this place as take-out and when I returned home, I was very surprised when I took a bite out of the muffin. First of all, it was literally hard and nowhere near fresh.  It was very obvious that it wasn't made on that same day.  Tiramisu was ok but it tasted nothing like what a traditional Italian tiramisu is supposed to taste like. I couldn't even get  any coffee flavor from it.  They may as well name the dessert something else. With the cheesecake,  there was no sense of cheese or sweetness from it. I don't know about anything else they have but their so called desserts were certainly not worth my money.
