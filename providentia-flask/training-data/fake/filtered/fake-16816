This place has amazing decor fabulous service and Chef Dan is the coolest guy on the block!!!! I had a wonderful time with my server Eric. I love the young staff and the feel of the whole place. As far as the food, its delicious and its familiar and different all in the same bite. I love date pizza!!! Crab toast, Loved!!! The local, organic menu, recycled tables, and handmade dinnerware are all very impressive. The wait staff is helpful and considerate.  The roasted beets and the spinach and quinoa salads were very tasty. The warm mozzarella appetizer was a complete waste to order.. I mean if you like a chuck of cheese you like a chuck of cheese... The sea bass was just weird, sitting in an oily broth and tasteless. Pretzel Dusted Calamari yum!!! The only few things we were talking about in complaint as far as the staff is when we were waiting maybe 10 mins for our reservation the bartender is clearly overwhelmed and giving off that stressed energy that makes everyone uncomfortable. The managers or gaunt floor walkers that seem to walk around and awkwardly stare at the tables with a look behind their eyes that seems as if like they can't wait to get off and have a drink. Which they seem to do on the clock! haha We also  met Ryan the General Manager and he was sweet with a tint of the fake fairy who likes to mingle and give off vibe of that he rather be sitting with us than hosting us. However I personally would return frequently, meaning a few times a year to see what their seasonal market table has to offer and say hello to Dan, for I prefer  spending my money at a few  smaller profile places in Alphabet city that can give ABC a run for their money.
