If you are a happy hour connesiour, like I am, then you must visit Smokin Betty's. When my friends and I checked this place out we were a little surprised to see that it was not mobbed with people looking to drink away their work week blues. It was refreshing to be able to sit at the bar and not have to wait in a crowd to order a drink. It was also nice to be able to talk to my friends without having to Â compete with other voices or scream over loud music. Another plus is the happy hour appetizers that are offered. My favorites are the vegetable quesadillas, because you have to eat your veggies, and the dry rub wings which has a rough exterior texture, but is sweet and spicy. Another fave is the cheesesteak spring rolls. I'm not a huge fan of cheesesteaks, but these bite size mini's were delectable. You might not be able to order just 1 serving. My friend loved the red sangria special $4, she downed like 6 of them. However, I am now and will forever be a Paradise Kitty girl. It tastes like Rita's Mango water ice. You can hardly taste the alcohol so its very easy for these drinks to sneak up on you. Smokin Betty's offers a few creative desserts as well. Overall the service is excellent, with the exception of the hostess who almost never greets anyone so you are left free to wonder around and guess where to sit for happy hour. I love the exposed bricks on the wall and the dim lighting. Fellow Smokin Betty lovers are amiable and love to engage in conversation. I have already been to Smokin Betty's on 2 other occassions and have invited more fellow happy hour lovers to experience the warm, inviting fellow of Smokin Betty's. It's my new hidden treasure.
