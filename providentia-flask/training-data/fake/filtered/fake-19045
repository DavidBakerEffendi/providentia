So there are lots of places to choose from in NYC but the sicilian slices here are amazing.  the crust is double baked (aka fried) but you will not get one drip of grease off of the pizza.  The sauce is amazing and i have to say i have days where i actually want to get out of work just so i can have a slice.  some people dont really like very crispy crusts and end up not liking the place but thats not the norm. As for the artichoke pizza, i am really not a big fan cause its just a slice with lot of cream and is way too heavy for me and most people i know.  The regular slice of cheese here is also amazing.  this place is packed all night especially on weekends but is close to meat packing and other places which make it ideal for a weekend night.
