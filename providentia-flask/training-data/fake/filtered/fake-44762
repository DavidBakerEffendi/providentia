I don't know the exact number of restaurants the city has to offer, what i do know is that  Yerbabuena is one of those places where you always feel at home. We had our wedding in the city and decided to stop by and toast with a couple of "poquito picantes" that is their best drink and our favorite  so do yourself a favor and try it!! don't be afraid if by reading the cocktail menu you think you are about to drink a salad, The flavor's that this drink have will blow your mind away. The food was an outstanding mix of traditional latin food with a gourmet twist, just the right amount of spices and even if you are not used to spicy food i promise you that the explotion of flavor's that your mouth will experience will take your mind back home wherever that may be. If you are in the mood for a Latin American tour without living the city go ahead and try their whole menu as you will find a mix of cultures combined in a fantastic  way from Mexico's fish taco's to a succulent Rib eye steak from Argentina and do not miss a Moqueca (a brazilian paella) the ceviche from Peru will go perfect with a Pisco Sour that not even in Peru you will be able to taste. The service was amazing as always, the super friendly  will made us feel right at home so i am sure you will experience the same type of treatment  thank you Gio and Mario for making our special day beyond anything we expected. It was soooo good we didn't want to leave, thanks again guys and we will see you soon. JFA
