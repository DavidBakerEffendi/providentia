Checked out Egan and Son's last night and was very pleased with the experience. My friend and I both agreed we loved this place and were making plans to come back before we left the table! We liked the homebrew, though it didn't knock us off our feet or anything. It certainly was drinkable and tasty, and complimented our meal well. I had one of the specials which was a beet salad with goat cheese wontons and I loved it, if not wishing there were more than 3 wontons included. We shared the crispy maple wings and they were phenomenal. I also noted that many orders of the wings passed our table on the way to be served, so they seem to be really popular. The premises was beautiful, including the alleyway and the deck outside. Plenty of parking; a beautiful place for a group of people, private party, or even a reception of some sort if they can accommodate that. P.S. - Their chocolate bread pudding was amazing... and it's plentiful, so best when shared!
