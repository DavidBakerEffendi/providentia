I just stopped into Vera Pizza for the second time and wow I'm beyond impressed. The service was amazing, the food was great, the space is huge and makes me feel very comfortable. I had the Penne Vodka and my daughter had Penne with garlic and oil. All I could say was yum. Not to mention the bread, the bread was to die for. Thank god the bread is unlimited and complimentary with our dinners. We also had the mild wings which were amazing. The owner is the guy with hat and glasses you can tell he is a genuine nice guy that wants to increase his business and he's doing heck of a job. This is now my favorite place and is now my go to pizza place.
