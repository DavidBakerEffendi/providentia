I went on a Tuesday for the $10 double burgers and was not disappointed! I am not going to lie, it was the best burger I have had in a long time. It was perfectly cooked and very juicy. The best part, however, was the desert menu! So many great options!! I went with the black bottom banana creme pie in a jar and it was fantastic. I will definitely be coming back to explore the rest of the menu!!
