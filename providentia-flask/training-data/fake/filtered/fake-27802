I love the Farmhouse because everything is consistently very solid. They do everything on their menu well and I particularly appreciate their commitment to buying local ingredients. They have a great selection of beer, I think it must be one of the best selections of Vermont beer in Burlington. I love trying the various Hill Farmstead beers they have on tap. I find myself regularly going to Farmhouse because of it's welcoming atmosphere. I go for work happy hours, take my family there when they visit, it's a great date location, and just nice to grab a beer and a burger. Overall, if you're unsure at all of what you want to do for dinner in Burlington, it's a bit of a safe pick but you really can't go wrong with Farmhouse.
