This place is a rip off and not worth your time or money.  The cafe food is bland, the service is inept, and you better look twice at your check since overcharging seems to be a business strategy here. The fish market is ridiculously overpriced and the high school kids hired to work the counter are inept.  The kid who helped me went right from working the cash register to handling my fish.  He didn't bother to wash his hands or wear gloves.  When I challenged a pricing policy that charged me double for clams because I asked the kid to open them for me, the owner Tom behaved like a bully.  The only positive thing in my experience was their clean bathroom.  Tom can keep his fish, his employees and his crappy food.
