Chose to order take out and eat at our hotel room. Quite a long wait. While my daughter stayed at the GL, I headed out to buy a 6 pack. This sure ain't Buffalo where you can find it in all stores including pharmacies and bars are open until 4 AM. It took me fifteen minutes to find a place. Â Returned to the GL and still waited. Finally got our take out and took it back to the cave, er...hotel. Daughter got chicken gyro and fries. I got chicken souvlaki and bacon cheese fries. Never heard of putting fries in souvlaki but that's how it's served here. Fries were soggy. I don't know what the meat in the bacon cheese fries was, but I doubt it came from a pig. Souvlaki was bland and the pita was like soft cardboard. I love Greek food. This is just a college garbage plate rip off business. Will never go back because this is the last time I ever have to visit the City of Brotherly Love.
