Lunch buffet does not have many veg choices, but good food to try occasionally, food at this place is way better then the most of the India restaurants in Hartford, Manchester and Simsbury area. The atmosphere is nothing special to talk about, and the service was also good (i had been a few times here). Overall a must go place to try for once.
