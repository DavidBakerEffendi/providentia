This is the best, most authentic BBQ north of the Carolina's. The ribs have a great smoky flavor without being over powering. The Friday brisket special is out of this world. They also have a all you can eat buffet on the weekends, so how could you go wrong? They use a vinegar based Carolina style sauce, but they also offer a honey sauce for those that do not like the vinegar sauce. I highly recommend this BBQ to anyone that knows good BBQ.
