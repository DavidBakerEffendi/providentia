We got the half chicken and half lamb halal rice plate. It is a ridiculous amount of food. You can easily split it with another person. I think the half & half is nice. Even though the food is delicious, packed with umami flavors, it gets monotonous after a while. It comes with soft pita bread and seasoned orange rice. You have to use the white ranch-like dressing. The hot sauce is INSANELY hot. We only put a little bit on, but we were dying from the heat. Use sparingly!
