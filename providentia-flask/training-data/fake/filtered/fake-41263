Why go to any type of simple brunch / diner / lunch / sandwich shop when you can go to LULU.  From the Burger to Pancakes you can not go wrong.  Awesome Fries.   Forget pictures and long reviews, and I am leaving one star uncolored cause it might not be worth a long journey to get here but as a neighborhood joint, it is it.
