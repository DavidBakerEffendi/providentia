Worst experience in my dining history.   I've been to Scanicchio's several times over the past 10 years or so and I could never complain until now.  This Monday, my girlfriends birthday, I made a reservation for 8pm (closes at 9).  I got calls from John and the restaurant from 1pm until 4 or 5pm but I was unable o be reached because of work.  They wanted to see if I could come in earlier but we never made contact.  When i finally called back, they made me feel like I did something wrong or like I was now unwanted.  When I arrived I was more accommodating then ANY of the staff, I apologized that they had to stay open for us, but 8pm was when I made my reservation.   It was such an awkward meal,  all they did was talk about what they were going to do when they left, like go down the shore, and they were louder than me and my girlfriend.   To make a long story short, my girls birthday was RUINED due to the lack of professionalism. They rushed us out of there and made us feel unwanted.  I felt like a donkey leaving 20% tip... I should have walked out without paying the bill.   I was never so embarrassed or felt so embarrassed for a business as I did tonight.   There was no explanation or remorse wen I called back to explain my displeasure.     WORST EVER.   Never have been in a place that was not only not accommodating but rude.  They talked louder than we did in the dining room, it was pitiful.  The owners should find out about this because I'll never refer anyone else to this place.   I have in the past because the food is great,  but its not worth the rude and ungrateful treatment we received.   What a nice birthday to remember.   Thank you.
