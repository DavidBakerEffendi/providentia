I had the pork shu mai and drunken noodles. I asked if it was made spicy and she said that she could make it spicy if I wanted it to. I had a choice of medium spicy or hot. Very fresh and great flavor. My friend had the Crispy Pad Thai which was excellent. I will eat there again and suggest it to my family and friends.
