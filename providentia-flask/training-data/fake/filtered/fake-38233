The food was overrated. I ordered a petit filet, and when I sliced into it, it was blue inside!  I sent it back (of course) and they served me my same old steak (with all of the flavor completely lost because it went back on the grill ) and on the same bed of potatoes (which had raw steak juice on them).  How unsanitary!  I do not trust the kitchen here and I will not be back.
