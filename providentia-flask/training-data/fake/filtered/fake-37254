Used to frequent this restaurant on a regular basis. Somewhere down the line they changed their menu and or the chef and not for the better. Many dishes began to fall short of what we experienced in prior visits. Hope they can re-establish themselves as the outstanding Peruvian food restaurant they used to be.
