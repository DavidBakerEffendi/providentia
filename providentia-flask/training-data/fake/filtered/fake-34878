This is one of my favorite places to eat in America. This is very interesting to watch the chef and eat, it's like being on a show and being the judge. Call ahead and make a reservation! Call WAY ahead... like 2 months... The ingredients were out of this world and worked really well together. So many courses, each as delightful as the last. This is worth the money because of the experience. Nowhere else can you find such a unique and delicious experience, a very rare gem! Keep up the good service and I will keep coming back every time I'm in New York.
