It was awful from start to finish....and way overpriced!   Risotto with mushrooms and pancetta had no discernible pancetta and was overcooked...Priest Stranglers Pasta was undercooked (I KNOW what al dente is) and had a very cold glop of ricotta on top of tepid sauce, NOT GOOD. Zucchini strangely had more almonds than vegetable, which was only the skin of the veggie. No trying the Tiramisu as our neighbors on our communal table complained it tasted freezer burnt.  Never again.
