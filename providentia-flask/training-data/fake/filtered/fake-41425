Found this great place on our first trip to New York.  It became our gathering spot.  A great place to sit and have a drink or dine.  The out door patio was a wonderful place to enjoy the evening with our friends ( great NYC atmosphere ) The owner Graham is really a fantastic guy -- knew our names right away - made us feel right at home. He also makes a mean cocktail. Went out of his way for us. Thank you ! All the food was very fresh and really amazing.  The burgers, mac n cheese, home made tater tots, tacos and fries were off the charts.  There was not an item we ordered that didn't hit a home run in taste and presentation. We will definitely come back to see our friend Graham and to dine and drink in his fine establishment. Out standing!!
