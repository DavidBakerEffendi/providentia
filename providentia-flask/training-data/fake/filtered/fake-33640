They cannot & will not accommodate any food allergies, nor will they let you bring your food for the person that has the allergies :/  With food allergies on the rise, this is quite disappointing.  Almost ALL restaurants take food allergies seriously these days.  Most will have separate fryers and grills.  Extremely disappointing.  They need to update their kitchen.
