With only two Chinese buffets in the area, I was happy to see a third one opening. After eating at the Grand Buffet, I was blown away with how much better it is compared to the other two buffets. The food was fresh and was changed periodically. There was a wide variety of food with some new dishes I've never had before. I tend to stay away from sushi at a buffet restaurant but their sushi rolls were actually good. The customer service was great! They left plenty of napkins at the table and I never had to ask for a refill. My dishes were taken as soon as I put them at the end of the table. The Grand Buffet will be the only Chinese buffet restaurant I go to from now on. I look forward to going again!
