This place is my mecca. Seriously. Any product that makes you wait as long as they do, better be fucking good. The wait is worth it, the product is worth the price, the ambiance sucks, because they aren't selling ambiance. They are selling pizza, and they are fucking good at it. Having lived off pizza for age, eaten it on 3 continents and dozens of countries, including Italy, Di Fara is so far my best and most favorite.
