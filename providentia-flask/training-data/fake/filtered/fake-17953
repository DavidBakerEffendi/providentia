After reading these reviews, I made it a point to go check out this place. When I got there, I was shocked. It's TINY and LOUD! I could hardly hold a conversation with my 3 other friends! I ordered the Shrimp and Broccoli and it was simply NOT good. The shrimp were definitely under-cooked. Maybe they had an off-night? I don't know. Maybe I just ordered the wrong things... I dont know. But I'm sorry to say, I didn't like this place at all!!! Cramped, tiny, and bad food! Oh and the service was also terrible. Although the food came out quickly, the waiters were always sooo angry and RUDE!
