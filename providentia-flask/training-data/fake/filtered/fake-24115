Dirty restaurant, slow workers, and mediocre bagels. All in all a bad place and their food doesn't hold a candle to the more authentic bagel shops in NJ. What they could use is a janitor and some knowledge on how to make better tasting bagels as theirs are nothing like the excellent bagels in NYC or North Jersey.
