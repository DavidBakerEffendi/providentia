Great prices, but terrible service and very dirty. Got a peak of the stairs leading to the basement where i can only assume the food ingriedients are kept and I was horrified. I question if the health inspector has ever even heard of Papa Franks. I also observed cooks showing each other pictures of a rat that they found in the basement (OMG!!!) Â  If you care not about your health, and are looking for a cheap place to eat...go to Mcdonalds. Its right up the hill people and MUCH cleaner than Papa Franks. Enough said.
