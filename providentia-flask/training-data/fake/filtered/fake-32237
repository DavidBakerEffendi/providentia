This used to be one of my favorite places in downtown Hartford for lunch and dinner but lately it has lost its flare.  I have continued to give it "another try" but I think this is it.  The service is just horrible especially for dinner.  The owner is not as friendly as he used to be, so if you have an issue with either the food or drinks, suck it up and don't bother to try and tell him or interrupt his conversations.   I am not a person who regularly complains or sends food back, and of the many, many times I have been there I have never expected to be given anything for free, but as a paying customer I think I have the right to express my distaste for what I've ordered since I have had it in the past and remember what it should taste like.  I don't' know if it's that the owner deals with this on a daily basis and doesn't care anymore, but he should learn to treat every customer as an individual and not by the reputation certain clientele may have.  He must've been having a bad day and my party ended up paying for his arrogant ways.   I will not return to The Russell and will warn people to watch out and don't let it ruin your evening.  If anyone has any suggestions where to go and have a good time with friends, please let me know.
