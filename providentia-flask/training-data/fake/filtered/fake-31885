This great nuevo Latino joint is one that i will remember and keep under my belt forever. Besides the impeccable food, on Sundays they have a serve yourself sangria bar, with the most natural and homemade sangria i have ever had. No waiting for waitresses or waiters, you want a refill, you just go up and get it. Great way to start your Sunday with a little buzz and a full stomach.
