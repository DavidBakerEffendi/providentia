Two very bad experiences. Go to Mylai Masala down the road for an excellent vegetarian buffet with great service or go to Tandoori Bite in Princeton for both. Here you will get neither great food nor decent service. The service here -- especially one server who wears his hair in a ponytail -- is dreadful. We found lint on their plates and bowls on the buffet. The server ignored us (literally) and finally told us to go eat someplace else if we were unhappy. One server who quit and bumped into us at another restaurant said the ponytail guy spits in people's food. Persis: change your dishrags, fire your ponytail and train your other servers. Folks: go to the myriad other Indian buffets in the area. At least you won't have to worry about spit in your food!
