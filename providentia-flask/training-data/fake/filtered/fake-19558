I was shopping in the area and stopped to get a bit for lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find that this was a Taiwanese Restaurant. The name does not suggest Asian food. However, the service was awesome and the food authentic and delicious. Do not leave without trying...#4101, 1205 & 3102. It was as if I was back in Taiwan. I'm really excited to have accidentally found this wonderful restaurant. Listen, the food is on the money, the staff welcoming. This little Taiwan in East Hanover.
