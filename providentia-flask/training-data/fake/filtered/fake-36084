Ten of us for dinner on a busy Saturday night!!!!  Greeted with opened arms.  Al, the owner is the best in customer service and Francis was the most entertaining waiter! We all enjoyed our delicious appetizers, salads, and entrees, not to mention the outrages desserts! We can't thank you enough for such a wonderful evening.   We will all definitely be back!
