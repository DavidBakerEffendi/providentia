The Best Hot and Cold Sandwiches around!!! and the price can't be beat!  Their breakfast sandwiches are made fresh to order and loaded with eggs, meat and cheeses for such a low price. Their lunch sandwiches, hot or cold, I can make two meals out of them or share with a co-worker.  You certainly can't get a lb of fresh meat on a sandwich any other place for $5 or 6 bucks. The salad bar is the freshest I have ever seen with so much variety to offer! A MUST GO and EAT!!!!
