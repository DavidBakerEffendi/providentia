Quick, cheap and tasty....a chinaman's favourite 3 things! Cant say much more than that so if you want a quick authentic chinese style meal than this is a great place. Seemed as it was more noodle soup oriented as the stir fried wok dishes didnt look ao good but thats just my visual opinion. The duck and wonton noodle we had were pretty tasty.
