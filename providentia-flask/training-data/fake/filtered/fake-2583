One of our favorite restaurants in the neighborhood.  The ambiance, food, wine list and service are all excellent. Our favorite dishes are the salmon, beet gnocchi and the mezzelune.  If you're eating late, stop by for the Super Pizza (with prosciutto and arugula) on the late night menu.  It can be a little crowded at prime times so be patient, but otherwise this is a fantastic dinner option in the Upper East Side.
