I can't actually rate the food, but I can write that I tried to come here twice, and both times  was turned away!  The first time we were told rudely that they were closing (over an hour before their advertised closing time), and the second time we waited for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged our presence. Based on others' reviews, the food seems decent if you can actually get in.  Is there a secret hipster handshake that I don't know about to actually get a table?
