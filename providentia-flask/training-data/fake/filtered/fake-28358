Great food at best prices. I usually order and pick up when in the area, but you need to make a reservation its always full when dining in. Not a fancy place but really good food. Thats what matters to me. The fried calamari, chicken kabob and a nice greek salad with an ice cold beer or Greek wine yum!! The portions are huge.
