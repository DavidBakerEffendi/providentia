Had a great time here this past weekend with my pals. We ordered a bunch of sushi and some drinks. My new favorite roll is the m&m which has marinated meat inside. I know it's unusual but it was delicious. Service was great, our waitress Jes was really friendly and made good suggestions. I couldn't give this place 5 stars only because I wish the alcohol prices weren't so high but I guess that's what you get for being in Center City. But I'll be back regardless for the good sushi and atmosphere.
