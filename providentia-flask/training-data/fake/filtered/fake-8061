Walking down Church from Chinatown, why suddenly we had an urge for pizza? Read the menu posted on their window, so we decided to give it a try. The Da Mikele Pizza is da bomb! We devoured it in seconds! We also enjoyed the nice setting of this pizza place. Who knows it can get quite rustic and romantic at the same time. The mushroom pizza is a must try too.
