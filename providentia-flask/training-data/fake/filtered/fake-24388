Anyone who is a foodie like me will know this place. The food is excellent and one feels like you are back in India devouring your favorite street side food. Even though they are known for their paratha's I highly recommend their Pau Bhaji it's the best one can find outside of India. The Bhel Puri and Dhai Puri Chaat Â is outstanding. Their stuffed paratha's are so well known that my cousins have heard about them in California and I've to take a bunch of them whenever I visit them. I highly recommend this place to people who love their food and do not mind the small place. Be forewarned though on weekends the wait here is long.
