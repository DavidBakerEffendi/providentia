Went there with a group last weekend.  Food was good, great beer list.  My only issue was that they serve beers in random size glasses.  It is important for you guys to note that a regular Sam Adams should not be served in 325ML glass!  That is less than 12oz for $5+.  That is normally reserved for high-alcohol content/expensive beers.  The person next to me got the same beer in a 16oz glass.  Was pretty upset by that - good beers though!
