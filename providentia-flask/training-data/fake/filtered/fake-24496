I went there on last Thursday and I thought it was spectacular. You order from the counter, pick up your food on trays when they call your number, get your own utensils, and find a seat at the all-communal tables. They have people cleaning the tables and refilling water regularly, and tips can be left on the table or in the jar at the counter. The $13 duck over rice gets you half of one side of the breast, over rice and some greens which I was told were red mustard frill. The duck is cooked to a perfect, tender, pink. The duck is juicy and the flavor is fresh. The skin is crisp, and reminds me of good Chinese style barbecued duck, except that it's not as sweet and hasn't been hanging all morning. The rice and greens are extremely satisfying after soaking in some of the flavorful drippings of the duck breast. I also had the broccoli salad, which was ok. The smoked eel vinaigrette was not particularly strong, providing only a slight smoky flavor, and the crispy rendered duck skin added some crunchy texture. It was served chilled, and for $5 had a decent amount of broccoli, when you compare it to similarly-priced sides at Otto or Torrisi. A couple of customers after me had to wait a little longer as they had just put fresh ducks on the rotisserie. I'm not sure how they would handle it if there were a lot of customers. Overall I thought it was simple, delicious, and satisfying.
