A cool venue for beach lovers. Great food and can put you into that Margaritaville state-of-mind on a summer's day. Order several different types of mini-meals and have a group of people to share - its all there with the huge portions. Every once in a while a Jimmy Buffet tune will play in the background, and its 5 o'clock somewhere! Give it a go - go with an appetite,and have a bunch of your best beach friends with you. Be patient! This is not MacDonald's - not quick, but well worth the wait!
