I don't normally love Mexican food but while In Philly had already been at Continental, which was excellent, and learned that El Rey was run by the same chef.  My kids talked me into going, which I thanked them for later.  Unbelievably fresh, tasty, and spicy - new takes on old dishes plus some new stuff I hadn't seen made this a place you should bookmark for any non cheesesteak meals.  Really superb.
