People please save your money and dont go there, the pizza is wack.  I have been in the search for a good pie for 4 years living in this area, and still have not found any thing worth the money.  Trust me I know pizza I lived near bayonne were pizza is awsome and my wife is from NY so we know our pizza not to mention Im a Chef.  I knew I was doomed when I saw it.
