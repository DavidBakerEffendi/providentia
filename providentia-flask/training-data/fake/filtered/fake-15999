I am baffled when I was reading bad reviews of this place. THIS PLACE HAS THE BEST SUSHI FOR THE $$$ WHEN IT IS 1/2 PRICE.  BAR NONE!!!!!! I recommend Fuji to anyone I talk to when they ask for a sushi place.  It is a 25 min drive for me but totally worth it everytime. Never had a bad meal there!!!!! Keep up the good work
