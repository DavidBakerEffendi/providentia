L-A-M-E S-A-U-C-E! After a delicious dinner at standard tap, my husband and I went home but then decided we wanted dessert. We started walking around up Chesnut St and it started to rain..and ended up at Jones. I figured "Hey its just dessert and cocktails, its simple..its got to be good?! right?" WRONG!!! The hostess was unpleasant the service was mediocre and cocktails were reminiscent of "cruise ship drinks" (stupid glasses/weak). The dessert wasn't memorable..peanut butter pie or something. I had brunch here years ago and remember thinking it was pretty good..not no more!
