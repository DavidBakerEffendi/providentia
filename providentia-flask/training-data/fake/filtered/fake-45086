Food is great, but definitely check your receipts. My bill came out to $40.72. I provided a 17% tip of $7.00. I discovered that Shanghai Asian Manor decided to add an additional $1.00 when I looked at my credit card statement. That is just shady! I will eat there again, but I will absolutely under-tip them next time. It's about principle, not $1.00.
