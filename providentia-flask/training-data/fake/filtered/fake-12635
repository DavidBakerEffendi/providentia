So I stumbled upon this place while trying to search for a good dinner spot in Williamsburg. Oysters-Above average, waitress made good recommendations Pork Chop-Good cut of meat, accompaying sauce was stellar! Overall, this restaurant did not disappoint! Will consider coming back if I end up in Williamsburg around dinner time.
