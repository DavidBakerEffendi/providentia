many time i went to try ramen in this spot point, and ever time when i came here,it alway busy, last night after with some my frien for  about 11/2hrs waiting, we were finly got set and try  some ramen, i had wasabi shoya ramen,couble my friend akamanru ramen, pork bun , borth is good but can tasted out hondashi in there? bun is too oil  and smoll,. for a bowl ramen, $ 15 is not cheap and  also had  to pay  waiting value. look aroud this area, there are so many ramen place, and test is not bad also and price is much lower. why spend few hours for hondashi tasty noodle?
