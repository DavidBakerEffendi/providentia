We've always gone to the Yummy Sushi in Ewing and it's Excellent over there! So we thought we'll try this location (our gym is next door).  Before ordering my meal, I asked the server if she could make my chicken curry "medium spicy", she said it's already mild so I said Ok. Well, my dish came out on FIRE!  When I told the waitress that it was too spicy, the manager came out and told me "OH NO, THIS TYPE OF CHICKEN CURRY YOU ORDERED ARE TYPICALLY ONLY ORDERED BY INDIANS because they like it spicy"... Anyway, she had them rinsed it out (yuck) but at that point I lost my appetite.  To make matters worse, we still got charged for it. Will NOT be coming back because the SERVICE - I would have given the food another chance...
