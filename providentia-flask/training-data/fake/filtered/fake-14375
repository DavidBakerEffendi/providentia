Most restaurants leave you feeling meh, some with the 'that was pretty good', this is one of the few that every single bite and dish gives you a 'wow, that tastes amazing'. We went with four of us, and ended up ordering almost the whole menu, everything was superb. Only down sides as noted before are a general lack of bread to mop of the fantastic sauces that come with things, and a bit of a wait for the food. But it is definitely worth it.
