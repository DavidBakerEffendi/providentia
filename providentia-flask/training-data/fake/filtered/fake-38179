Other day we went with my friend to this place. I came to cashier station and tried to order food but all cashiers were on a phone and I waited for about 10 min to make an order. Then finally I placed my order which was omelet and coffee and sat at the table that was dirty. Even there wasn't busy at all i've waited for 15 min for my omelet to come to me and even longer for a coffee. So I had to ate cold omelet and drink cold coffee. I was very disappointed in this place. Will never come back .
