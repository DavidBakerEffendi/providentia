I have been here several times and have always found the food is very good; I would like to see the menu change once in awhile, however.  They do have specials, but even those tend not to change often.  The beer selection is astounding but pricey.  It's amazing what they did in renovating the old McDonald's building and it's great how they integrated the old with the new.  The service is slow and don't expect to be seated in a timely fashion.  The last time I ate at there, my party of 4 waited 40 minutes to eventually get seated at a table that had been empty since we arrived.
