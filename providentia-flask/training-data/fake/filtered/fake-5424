I absolutely love this place! They have the best pizza ever, seriously. They beat out every pizza place there is. Coming here has made me a pizza snob. Ive only been there twice, but I think its becoming quite popular because the second time I went, my friend and I had to wait like 25 minutes whereas the first time I didnt have to wait at all. Anyway, I always get the white cheese pizza with tomato and basil and it is absolutely fantastic. Its so thin and perfectly made, it just melts in your mouth. The size is the right amount to fill you up too, one whole pizza can fill up two people. Sometimes its not enough only because its so scrumptious you want to keep eating more. The service is great, everyone is really friendly and nice and the owner is also very sweet and nice. The prices are about the same as one of those chain pizza restaurants except its actually worth it to get pizza here.
