Food was excellent, but service was chaotic to say the least! When I asked for the check there was no reaction, even when asking several different servers. I finally tried to do it in Spanish, One panicked waiter responded: "I do not speak English!" I pointed out that I was speaking Spanish and he fled. This restaurant has promise, but the staff needs to be more professional.
