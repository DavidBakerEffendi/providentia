The positives: staff friendly and helpful, traditional Thai dancing set it apart - Thai new year. The negatives: food was poor and much of it canned. You can observe this for yourself by going to the back of the restaurant in the public car park and look in. Mistakes made with orders, with food appearing that we didn't order. However this was quickly fixed. The price was good but you get what you pay for. Much better quality Thai in Montclair.
