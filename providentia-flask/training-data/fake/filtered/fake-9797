I travel around the morris county area a lot for work and hands down when it comes to a diner East Hanover is my favorite overall. I've been to many and nothing beats the newly built East Hanover diner. Every time I've been here I am greeted so nicely it feels like I'm a part of their family (of course all diners are family owned!) The interior is all new so you don't get that diner feel at all. The quality and quantity of food you get for the price is mind blowing! I come on my lunch break most days and it offers a great deal which includes soup or salad, entree and dessert. My favorite is the soup and salad combo (their split pea soup is delicious). If I get out of work early enough on other days I try and make their weekday early bird specials which offers a cup of soup, salad, your drink, your entree and dessert for 1 price!!!! But it's from 3-6 and after that the dinner specials kick in. Another plus is that the dessert is actual speciality cakes which are to die for (of course cheesecake is more expensive which is reasonable they need to make money some how). Compared to other diners choices of "pudding, jello, ice cream" all sooo boring. I didn't even touch on the service yet but everyone who works there is fabulous. The waitresses are so friendly and attentive they really care to make your experience an exceptional one. They have recently told me they own the brookside as well so I'll have to try that one too. I would recommend this diner to everyone! It's worth the travel too!!
