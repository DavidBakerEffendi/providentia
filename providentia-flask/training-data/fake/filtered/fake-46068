All I can say is "wow".  This is an incredible restaurant.  I had the spinach salad and the chilean sea bass.  Both were so good.  The salad  was full of flavor, but the sea bass was incredible.   Most restaurants will overcook sea bass, in my opinion.  But the sea bass at this restaurant  was cooked perfectly.  It fell apart with a fork and melted in my mouth.  I was really impressed.\ In addition to that, the wait staff literally dotes on you, at all levels.  I was very impressed with the service.  I give this restaurant the highest rating possible.  Worth the experience if you're staying at the Double Tree, or anywhere in the immediate vicinity.
