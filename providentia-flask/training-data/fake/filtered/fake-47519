I don't know why everyone thinks this place is so good.  I went there in the afternoon and was faced with the typical long line (quoted 40 min. wait).  Since I was by myself they took me in right away and sat me at the counter, which I thought was great.  However, I sat there for 10-15 minutes without anyone acknowledging me even though a number of different servers walked behind the counter in front of me.  I finally said something and someone came over to take my order.  The service was subpar to say the least.  My interaction with my server totaled about one minute for my entire meal. It seems like they are so used to being extremely busy, and dealing with a lot of tourists, that they just don't care. Maybe I caught them at a bad time.  I hope it's not that bad all of the time. As far as the pizza goes, I thought it was just average. I ordered a Regular (tomato sauce, cheese and basil). I know the coal oven is supposed to be special but I really didn't think it was worth all the hype or for a long wait.  I've had a lot of wood fire pizzas and various artisinal pizzas that I thought were much, much better. If you're in the area and have time to kill, go for it.  If not, don't bother.
