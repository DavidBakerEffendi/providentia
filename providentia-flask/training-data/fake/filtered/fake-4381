To be honest the name is a pretty big mis-lead. As an avid bird-watcher i hiked myself all the way to Burlington in hopes of seeing some Bluebirds yet much to my dismay my dreams were promptly crushed when upon entering the facility and asking where the birds were i was met only with, "sir what are you talking about" and long stares. Given that i am a rather large stress-eater and that I was feeling rather stressed about not seeing the birds, i had nothing else to do but sit down and try and enjoy the ambiance of this so called "bluebird" tavern. However i was quickly reinvigorated when the waiter told me that, "Today the chefs have some great muscles". I promptly dashed to the kitchen as i myself had just begun a body building regimen and was looking for someone to converse with on the topic. Lo and behold i was let down once again as upon bursting in to the kitchen i was greeted by men with rather average builds. Again enticed to eating by my dismay i ended up having a burger, which despite my broken dreams, was frankly out of this world. Leaving the restaurant i had a pep in my step as the waiter had told me about another establishment run by the same owner called The Bear's Den and given that i had never seen a bear up close!!
