I love Salt Creek grille! This past week was my first visit to this location and I had a wonderful experience. I sat in the bar area with my friend and was greeted by Gabby. She had a lovely personality and didn't leave us needing anything. The drinks and food came out so promptly and it was all delicious. I will definitely be back in the near future!
