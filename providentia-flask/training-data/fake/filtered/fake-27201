I usually frequent Sushi Palace so I was quite delighted to find another AYCE sushi place closer to home. Compared to Sushi Palace (mostly tried the sushi): Service was good. Drinks are included. Cheaper for weekend lunch. Nigiri sushi (and sashimi) are tiny. I don't know why they make it so small. It is not supposed to be that small. It doesn't make sense from a cost perspective either considering that I was ordering AYCE. The quality of fish is similar. I feel Sushi Palace may have slightly better quality on a good day but it is probably a wash. But then sushi is mostly about the rice and the rice was not cooked as well at Masa. It was much harder than it should have been and I didn't think they put in enough vinegar. Â  The maki sushi were decent. Variety is less than Sushi Palace but looking at their rolls they don't have some of the crazy stuff (this is a compliment). Tried 2 rolls (Clinton and Ninja) and both were tasty but then my standards for Americanized maki is fairly low. Outside of sushi I tried their kani, seaweed salad along with spicy seafood soup and miso soup. All were decent to good. The soup is about the same compared to Sushi Palace but Sushi Palace has the better salad, notably the spicy seafood salad. Overall this is a good place to go to after you are tired from shopping in the area. I will likely go again. But if I am out solely for sushi I feel Sushi Palace is the better option.
