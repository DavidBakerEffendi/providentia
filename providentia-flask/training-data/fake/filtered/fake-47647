After moving to Brooklyn and countless stories of the famous Grimaldi's Pizzeria, I finally made the trip from downtown Brooklyn to Dumbo for the life changing slice. Lucky for me, the line was not as long as it has been rumored to be, and the short wait was well worth it. The small restaurant was bustling, with tables next to each other and red and white checkered table cloths. The anticipation seemed a bit too much for a pizza but after ordering I was excited. Â Around me were couples nibbling on antipasto, groups of friends enjoying two or more pies. There was a particular topping for everyone, and smiles with the bite, even the person at the next table said "I love this place". When the pizza arrived at our table, warm with the pieces of sausage and fresh cheese it smelled fantastic. It will probably be one of the best pies you ever eat , if you can taste it without eating it. Fresh ingredients, oven baked, and thin enough that even the tiniest person can eat a whole pie by themselves. The first bite was the life changing bite, when you had a taste of everything and a smile comes to your face. I smiled through every bite as I ate half a pie and could still have eaten more. It's fantastic, and while the wait can be a turn off for many, on a summer night its beautiful to wait out in the warm weather, or during the winter there are hours that don't have as many people in line waiting for the perfect pie.
