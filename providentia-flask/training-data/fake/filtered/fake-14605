MENU DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT YOU ARE CHARGED. I've been here four times.. twice for drinks and twice to bring out of town colleagues out to a place that is safe and kind of neat (the outdoor seating is great).  For the times I ordered meals, my meal was good the first time and so so ( salad with pear and chicken) the second.  What really irks me is that BOTH TIMES I was overcharged for the food.  For example the salad with pear list price is $10.50 and then you are charged $11.50.  A buck here and a buck there.  When you are with a crowd of colleagues from out of town, making a stink about a buck is not what I want to do.  I didn't have the opportunity to cross reference the prices for what everyone else ordered.
