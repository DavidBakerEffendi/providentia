I wouldn't bring James Holmes (Aurora, Colorado theater shooter) to this place for his "last meal".  The waitresses are inattentive, rude, inefficient and totally unfriendly.  You're treated as though it's all your fault thay had to come into work that day.  I brought a client and sat at a vacant table for four.  We needed a little bit of writing room.  One of the old witches began screaming at us in front of the other patrons:  "... You guys got to move from that table.  It's for four people.  You're going to have to move somewhere else".   Hadn't it been for witnesses, I'd have hauled off a slapped her with my 94 MPH pitching hand.  The food is the worst (even worse than Domino's).  The crust was soggy in places and burned in others.  The tomato sauce was bland and institutional tasting as if it were from Shoprite and the toppings are sparse.   Be VERY careful ordering drinks.  If you do, pay VERY close attention to the tally.  They customarily pad the check and I mean "pad the check".   I've been told since then, that the people who regularly patronize this place are pretty much a "who's who" of West Haven's degenerate rifraf.
