Really nice new addition to the area.  Great relaxed atmosphere especially in the early evening hours before they start blaring music (why do so many bars feel the need to do this).  Dark and everything wood-paneled is a classy feel but chill enough to just hang out with friends. Beer selection is extremely wide and varied with a good selection of local microbrews.   Probably a dollar or two pricier than needed, but service tends to be decent and again, you pay for the swell atmosphere. Food varies quite dramatically.  They have Steak Frites that are worth the $20, but Fish and Chips that are ridiculously priced at $18 or so.  A fantastic burger on an english muffin (seems to be the trend these days, look at 116 Crown too) is a more affordable option but is a tad on the smaller side.  Problems with a desert led to an extremely apologetic talk from the manager which was appreciated and fixed.   Good go-to establishment for evening drink on weekends.
