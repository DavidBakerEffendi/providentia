This place has an amazing lunch special for $7 that includes a couple of appetizers. Comes out quick too. They deliver. One thing is that t he service here is not great, but it also isn't bad. Atmosphere is really cool and they have a cool bathroom lol. Not that I should be reviewing their bathroom. Anyway, I recommend this place.
