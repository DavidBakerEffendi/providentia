What an absolute scumbag this owner is!  Stopped by tonight and ordered 10 wings to go.  Get home and open the box and all 10 pieces are the flat part of the wing.... no drums.  Now I have worked in the restaurant business for 20 years and what happened here was some customer before me had to request all drums.  Now they get a guy like me who orders wings to go so this owner is going to even things out and stick me with 10 flats.  I bring the wings back and in his broken English the owner tells me it was a mistake.  He tells me someone else ordered them like that and the order got mixed up.  I was the only one in the place from the time I ordered to the time I received my food.  Definitely did not appreciate getting lied to on top of them trying to screw me.  The guy claimed to be the owner when I asked to speak to the owner.  I have never written a review on a place before in my life.  I was so livid that I was compelled to make this place my first.  I should have read the reviews here before I tried the place.  Seems like the majority of reviews on this place are a bunch of horror stories!
