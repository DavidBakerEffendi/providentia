Went with great expectations,very disappointing. Every chicken dish we tasted, the meat tasted stale. I could not think of a single dish that stood out. Vegetarian was slightly better than non-veg but nothing extraordinary. Â Desert was bad too, they had fruit salad, it was nothing but cheap canned fruits in an uncooked custard. Sad, not worth it.
