This was the worst experience EVER!  I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. I took 47 students to this place yesterday for a class trip and not only did they not have a record of the reservation that I made over 2 weeks ago with the pre-ordered food choices, but they practically threw the food on the tables, NO WHITE RICE (I never heard of that!), NO tea, fingers in water glasses, filthy bathrooms, and unhappy waiters.  They were not attentive, or nice to my group of foreign students. The waiters wouldn't even bring more water unless I asked.  I got the feeling they wanted us in and out---take the $$ and get us out of there! The food wasn't even that good either. I thought that when they realized that they screwed up the reservation they would have gone overboard to satisfy a customer who was bringing them of over 500$ worth of business...they did not! Additionally, I was quoted a price of 11.5 a person which I thought was very high for the amount of food we got.  I usually order a meal from other restaurants that is about 8$ and eat barely half...This place charged more and gave us less!  Go somewhere else if you have a choice!!!!!! I'm, still mad at myself for leaving a tip!
