I have ordered here before and the food is pretty good, but I cannot believe how rude the hosts are. I called to try and make a reservation (being a waitress and a former hostess myself) I spoke in my most respectful of tones and was so turned off by the way I was spoken back  to by this guy that it completely changed my mind about dining there.   I'd say go in and give it a try if you want to be made to feel like crap about yourself.
