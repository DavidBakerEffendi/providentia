Update - I have been back to Mr. Sushi over 15 times since my initial review.  It has been years now and they are still offering the same good quality food for excellent prices.  The all u can eat option is now up to $24.99 now but still worth every penny.  If you love sushi and want your fill, this is the spot. I'm writing this review about Mr. Sushi's all you can eat menu.  My wife and I love sushi and for what Mr. Sushi offers, It has the best all you can eat menu in the state.  For $22.99 you can pick from soup, salad. hand rolls, sushi, sashimi and rolls.  The most important thing about Mr. Sushi is the quality.  The food is on par or better than any standard sushi restaurant except its all you can eat for what typically works out to the price of two rolls at another restaurant.  Also, they do not just offer standard rolls like most all you can eat places, they offer over 20 specialty rolls.   Now the food more than makes up for what is to follow.  Where Mr. Sushi lacks is in the decor, atmosphere and especially service.  While this may bother some, if you know that you are getting great sushi at a great price it is acceptable to me.  If you are just about eating a ton of good sushi and nothing else, Mr .Sushi is the place.
