I'm no expert in Korean food, but I've had my share of meh bebimbap. Went to this place on the recommendation of a guy I met at a bar in Williamsburg (thanks Mr. Han!). Who knew I'd get the best Korean recommendation from a guy at an Irish pub? Just got back from one of the most satisfying (I'm talking umami all over the place, people) meals I've had in New York. Their traditional pancakes are outstanding, and the kimchi soup with fresh tofu so flavorful and rich, you'd think someone poured liquid love into it. Â The best by far, however, is the black tofu, house specialty. It is pricey ($15 or so for four medium squares), but I can't imagine anything more worth it. I mean, really, why wouldn't you try something you've never even heard of? I think the reason this place has spotty reviews is that, as with most restaurants, they do several things very very well, and some only so-so. I thought the bebimbap could have been a bit more flavorful or spicy, but I think that's cause it was the veggie version; I'm sure they're relying on the beef to deepen the flavor profile. Anyway, ASK FOR RECOMMENDATIONS, and then TAKE THEM! You won't be sorry.
