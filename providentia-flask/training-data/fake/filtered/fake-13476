One of my favorite restaurants in the city.   I began coming here back in 2002 or 03 when I lived in the neighborhood.  It is the perfect place to come alone and enjoy a HUGE steaming cup of pleasure (whatever yours may be) and a gooey desert crepe. OR for DINNER introduce your friends to this quaint little restaurant that you have loved for years just to find out that they've all known about the place and have been coming for years too!!!  LOVE IT! I was just in a few weeks ago with a friend and usually I go for their crepes but we decided to go for the escargo and two different musssel plates.  All were amazing and paired with a glass of their Sancerre. It gets pretty crowded and loud but in a cozy manner where I could still enjoy conversation with a friend.  The staff is friendly but sometimes rushed.
