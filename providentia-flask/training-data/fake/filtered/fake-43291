24 - ish taps of absolutely delicious craft beer. I mean the selection is absolutely fucking awesome. If you can find another bar in the area with this kind of selection, please let me know. Because you can't. Awesome seasonals. Awesome hard to find craft beers. Awesome imported sours. The bourbon bacon cheeseburger is excellent. Have had it twice and both times I got full halfway between my meal, but finished it anyway. It was just that good.
