The food: generally good. However, being a Middle Eastern restaurant, they should have fresh, warm pita bread. Their bread is dry and tasteless. Also, I bought two sides of okra and rice. To be clear, I did ask for enough for 2 people. However, considering that the containers were on the small side, I was shocked that the 2 sides were quite expensive for what they were. I really like the owner and would love to give a better review, but seriously- Â I URGE the owner to get better bread and to hopefully lower the cost of the sides at least slightly.
