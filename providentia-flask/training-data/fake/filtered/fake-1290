Diamonds location is tucked away, but once you find it, you'll love it.  It's quite large inside. Great atmosphere, with Frank Sinatra music.  Food was excellent, absolutely love the sausage bread, and their stuffed chop is delicious!  Loved how the owners were friendly with everyone, and their late night hours are great!  We need more restaurants like this.
