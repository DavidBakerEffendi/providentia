IN A STEEP DECLINE. Initial excitement turned to almost complete disappointment, Started with waitress missing the glass and pouring our red wine all over the table. One of our party is vegetarian and wanted pasta dish that contained shellfish prepared sans shellfish. Request was granted, but we were informed (from the snarly owner/manager) that the price would be the same and that she would not agree to serve the shellfish on the side for the shellfish eaters at the table. Two appetizer salads that were described with cheese were served without - waitress blamed on new sous chef and corrected one and argued about the second stating - "you don't see it, but it's in there". Final insult was that a two number addition - subtotal + tax was added incorrectly and we were overcharged $13.10; it took 15 minutes to get this corrected, and then the corrected check was delivered to our table without an apology. The food was good, but nothing special and the menu was small; desert was very good. It's cash only and BYOB. For us, August was one and done. Lots of better choices out there,
