My cousins took me to this place when I was about 7 or 8. Now I am ready to go off to college. Nevertheless, I still enjoy coming here with my mom for the famous soup dumplings. Yes, the line might be long for most of the time, but I think your experience will be worth it. Nothing compares to this restaurants' famous dish and those dumplings are absolutely mouth watering. I always have to stop by when I am in the area. I highly recommend this restaurant.
