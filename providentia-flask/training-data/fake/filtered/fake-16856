Best. Lobster. Ever. The oysters were great (as far as i can remember) and there was an appearance made by apples at dessert that was pretty tasty. yeah, i got a little drunk. the wine was good too. The service was nice, the bathrooms are great--it's important-- BUT... minus one star because they messed up my friend's fried chicken TWICE. overcooked the first time and undercooked the second (and we aren't picky bitches, we only send back if it's the real deal not good). so i guess i would say, get the lobster and everything else (the whole fish dish was excellent also), and stay away from the fried chicken. I will totally be back for the lobster, and if you're a big eater, you should order 2 to be on the safe side!
