This place is great. A perfect and tasty vegetarian eatery, one block over from where I used to work. It is a delight to go there whenever I pass through the neighborhood. The falafels are fantastic, and the reclosable packaging is very innovative, and makes for a good way of doing take-out. I would definitely go out of my way to take lunch here. They've got some wonderful and creative combinations.
