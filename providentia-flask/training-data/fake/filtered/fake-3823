All I have to say is damnnnnnnn this food is amazing, I'm a cook by trade an I have to say the cabbage caught my taste buds.. The cabbage was not over seasoned an it was just the flavors of the veggies an thinly sliced.. Now the jerk chicken wasn't dry an it was well seasoned an the had a choice of hot sauce I recommend the green bottle, an a wide selection of drinks an cakes, I had buy another Â dinner to go an my girlfriend an I love this place ...$$$$50 well spent wouldn't mind doing this again
