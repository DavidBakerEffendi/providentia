I've been a sushi fanatic for over 20 years now. I've eaten at over 100 sushi restaurants in my time, not only locally but in my travels as well--everywhere from Seattle to LA to DC to Orlando to NYC. And I have never experienced sushi as good as Jerry's anywhere else. I've been going to Jerry's since he opened, and no matter where else I try, Jerry's is the place I keep coming back to. I live over an hour away now, so don't get to go as often as I'd like. But I make the trip down several times a year, mostly to celebrate special occasions. The specialty rolls are the thing that make Jerry's great. The sashimi is also excellent, but those rolls he makes are mind-blowing. My personal favorites are the Jerry's roll and the New York roll. To be honest, I can't even address anything but the sushi, because that's all I ever order here. The service is always terrific and the prices are very reasonable as well. Very highly recommended!
