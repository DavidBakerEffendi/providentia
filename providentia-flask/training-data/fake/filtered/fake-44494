I ordered paneer tikka.they put lots of food color in it...its look too orange...lol I ordered more papad ..they said naan is coming lol... Spanish guy who took our order compared naan with papad...that's too funny and they didn't gave me more.... worst Indian restaurant saw in my life in US anyway i will not visit again Â .. Thanks...
