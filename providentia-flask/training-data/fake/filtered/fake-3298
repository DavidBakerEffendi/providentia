Went here when I worked at National starch and had no idea where I was.  Now I live here 8 years and go about 3 nights a week.  Great food in pub. Same as upstairs. Love upstairs. Just a bit expensive when you have the kids in tow. Pub is small but always has great music weekends. Very slow service outside on patio. Great idea, just need to have a manager out there watching tables.  Noticed you added staff outside but still is a 2 to 3 hour dinner.  Not good for kids or quick paced life.   Pub, needs more servers. Food is fresh, hot and always good.   Cleaning necessary in restrooms and updating. But I do enjoy there.
