Regular favorite of ours that has Vietnames cuisine with excellent service and price. Favorites include Papaya Salad, summer rolls with peanut sauce and curried octopus. Chicken Pho can feed 4 easily and great taste all year around. Nearby to downtown and airport by car. Â Can combine with shopping at Asian supermarket across from restaurant to complete lovely outing
