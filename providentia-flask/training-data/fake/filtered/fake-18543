Bouley does everything well, but nothing truly outstanding. That isn't to say I don't enjoy their food, which I do, but it just means nothing is new, or wowing. They serve the standard French restaurant fare, and charge a little bit less than some similar places do. They serve a consistently good meal though. Been here 6 times before and will be returning.
