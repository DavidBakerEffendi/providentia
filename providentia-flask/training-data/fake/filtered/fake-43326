Nice restaurant  with good atmosphere. Food was good but service needs inprovement. As we entered the restaurant, a big huge waiter stared at us and said nothing. After about 20 seconds, I told him, we were dinning in and he pointed with his hand to a table on the left back corner and he walked away picking up a menu and a jug of water. We was confused on where to sit and  just walk in on our own and sat  on the nearby table.  This restaurant  has good food but the mangement needs to improve the service.
