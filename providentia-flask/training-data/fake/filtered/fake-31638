I do not understand any of the past reviews. This restaurant is awful. I took a date on Saturday night. We were seated promptly the server was good. The food was blah. The sauce was sour, The pasta was over cooked. My girlfriend had a chicken dish it was dry and burnt on the edges. The past reviews must be from friends of the owner. I will not return priced like Manhattan food like Olive garden. Awful!!!!
