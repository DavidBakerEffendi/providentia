I am the band leader of one of the bands that was supposed to play last night at North Star Bar. My band plays frequently in Philadelphia and has NEVER dealt with a venue that acted as unprofessionally as this establishment did tonight. The show had been planned for a couple of months, and I know many people were planning on attending. However, according to a rude bartender, since not all of the bands were present EXACTLY at the load in time, they decided to cancel the show. VIA A FACEBOOK NOTIFICATION. Not even a call was made to the headlining band who was there loading in right at 6 pm and briefly left to pick up more equipment. In other words, the people in charge of sound/the show had something better to do with their night and apparently left around 6:30 (2.5 hours before the show even started). North Star Bar made an awful and stupid decision, losing a lot of money and respect from musicians and show-goers alike. I do not recommend this venue to anyone, especially musicians looking for a respectful and dependable venue to share their music with.
