We had a party of 7 that had dinner on a Saturday night.  We had reservations and they were ready for us when we arrived.  My first impression was that it was just another pizza joint because of its appearance when you first enter.  Once you get get further in you will know it is not. Boy was I wrong. Our waiter, Francis, was great.  The owner is very personable and most of all the food was very good and very reasonable.  Our group of seven had four of the chicken dishes they offer and we all got the clean plate sticker.  The bread, the salad, the drinks and our entrees were all top shelf. If your on South Street and your hungry try La Fourno.  Your stomach will thank you.  And so will the owner and staff.  They were all a delight. Thanks for a great night out on the town.
