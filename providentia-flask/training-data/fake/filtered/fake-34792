We'd only been to the bar before for drinks and appetizers. We hit the bar first and had some of the loveliest cocktails I've had anywhere. And trust me, I'm someone who has tried some pretty amazing cocktails! :) Try the Orange Blossom or the 4G for something really unique and delicious. Look forward to trying their food on my next visit.
