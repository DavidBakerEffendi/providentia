The Spicy Tuna rolls were some of the most delicious that I have ever tasted in NYC (and my hometown of London!) They had such an amazing texture and really melted in the mouth. I followed by sharing the Kobe burger, steak and miso cod. The miso cod just inched above the rest as my personal highlight - perfectly cooked and really well complemented with an assortment of mushrooms and light miso sauce. I went on a Thursday evening and the place was pretty full with great atmosphere. I'm really looking forward to my next visit to Zutto which I hope is very soon!
