AMAZING! this restaurant is kind of crampt - but great things come in small packages ;) They have what they call "sliders" - there tiny burgers. The best burger you will have in your entire life! The meat is seasoned so well, the burgers are always fresh, when you take that first bite it basically melts in your mouth. The cheese fries are also seasoned to perfection (you can also choose to not put cheese on the fries) they tasted a little Cajun to me - yumm! what you really need to try if your 21+ is the guinness shake. Its a Beer milkshake, but you don't really taste the beer, It taste like a shake rainbow in your mouth. The menu itself is small - on the menu you got Burgers, Double Burgers, Fries, Cheese Fries and soda & beer... Pretty basic. The price is a little on the crazy side $5.00 for one burger - but its so worth it. The service was good - the bartender was very friendly. I promise you this will be the best burger you will ever have. But don't just take my word for it- go in and try it for yourself - you wont regret it
