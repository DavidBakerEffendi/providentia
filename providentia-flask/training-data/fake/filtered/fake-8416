I like this place, but its a bit pricey for pizza. My husband, however, thinks they serve "The best pizza in America." I have to quote him directly. Personally, if the menu items were just $3 less, I'd be giving this another star! Gourmet sized portions (tiny) for big fat wallets. Big taste, yes, but not always worth the big bucks.
