My husband and I stopped here going from Vt to NH on vacation. I saw this place and decided to stop since we were staving! After looking at the menu which was pretty expensive we both decided to have the shepard's pie. Umm yeah, that was a mistake. We thought well they are named after it so they must have a great one, NOT!! It was made of greasy ground beef, peas I think and sad cold potatoes on top. I think the best part was the salad bar...which wasn't bad except for those stale wasabi peas and thick, I mean thick blue cheese dressing. We wouldn't have minded paying $15 a piece if it had been worth it. I would suggest passing this place by there is a lot better stuff along the way.
