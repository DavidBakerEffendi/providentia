Went at lunch time about 1 PM, there was no air conditioning.  There was a breeze, but the loud noise from trucks loading and unloading as well as the busy 3rd Avenue traffic was very unpleasant.  The waiter was not very friendly, mumbling the specials of the day, and you could tell by his attitude you didn't want to ask him to repeat them again.  Likewise, when I gave a discover credit card that wasn't accept by this restaurant the waiter came back to the table and said is a loud voice so everyone in the restaurant could hear "your discover card is not accepted".   Food was decent, but not a place I'd recommend for a relaxing enjoyable meal.  I did hear that the 2nd floor is much quieter.
