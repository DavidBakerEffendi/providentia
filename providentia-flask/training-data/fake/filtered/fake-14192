I've been to this place before and have been impressed by the fresh oysters, neat daily fish specials, and cozy bar. Went in last night ( a little on the late side) and the two dudes working there was some of the rudest people I've ever experienced. After asking to sit by the window, as there were no seats available, they said no. After my friend was confused and asked again, they both raised their voices and gave us major attitude, even raising their voices at us. Again, I'm not sure if it because it was late and they were cranky, but I'm seriously put off the rudeness of this place. You shouldn't treat people so poorly for asking to sit down in your restaurant!
