Went yesterday with a wedding party.  I have to say that it was one of the most pleasant time at a restaurant I have had in a long time.  The staff was quick to seat us, The server was funny, and the food was out of this world.  I had the seared scallops with truffle potato and it tasted so fresh.  The management stopped by the table to see if we enjoyed everything,  Great bar as well.  Do yourself a favor and try it out,  Few places still have what it takes but Nolita Restorante  has it.
