Two weeks ago I had the Beef Fajitas and it was perfect. It was juicy and tasty and spread out grandly on the iron skillet. Two nights ago I had the Beef Fajitas. The meat was overcooked. The onions were dried out. The green peppers were shrivelled. The whole mess was clumped into one half of the skillet. Service was fine both times. The wait is normally about 45 minutes. The first time it was worth it.
