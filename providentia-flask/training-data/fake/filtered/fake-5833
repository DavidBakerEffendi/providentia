We took some friends of ours here for their birthday. This was our first time here since the new owners opened. They have really done something with the expanded space (from when it was the old Lahiere's Restaurant). Our waiter and his assistant were very attentive and stayed on top of our service. Not a very expansive dinner menu but diverse enough that you'll find something to fit your taste. I felt that my meal was average (I had the roasted chicken). Portion size was OK. Had the warm peach pie for dessert which was excellent. Overall we had a pleasant meal. I give the food 3 stars but because the service was great I give them 4 stars. After all good service can save an adequate meal while poor service will ruin the best prepared meal.
