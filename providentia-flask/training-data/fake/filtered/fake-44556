I read some reviews here before I decide to give it try. Decoration: one of the best in the area. have NY feeling and touch. Â 4 star. Food: Hot and delicious. Like the Roti Canai, it's crispy and tasty. 4 star. Service is friendly, but a little slow even at dinner time. 3.5 star Cost: It's reasonable for a casual day out. 3.5 star I am very glad to see a restaurant like Rhong-Tiam in the neighborhood. Plainsboro has been lacking a good quality Asian restaurant for many years. Highly recommend if you like Asian food!
