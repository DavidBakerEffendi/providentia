Whenever I book a board meeting at work, in some of the replies I always get, "Will there be those tarts?" And yes, for every board meeting I stop at the Neptune Bakery to pick up those tarts! Â I have never tasted anything like them! The custard tart has both a light custard and crust. The coconut tart is piled high and the third tart they sell....I don't even know how to describe it except to say it literally melts in your mouth! The Neptune Bakery & Deli is SO worth going out of your way when you want something special.
