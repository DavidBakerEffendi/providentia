Angelo's has the most decadent pizza in Northern NJ.  The chicken marsala, grandma pie, and sweet bbq chicken pizzas are absolutely delicious and eat like a meal - literally.  I've also tried several of the chicken and veal entrees, and they are very good, generously portion sized, and very reasonable in price compared to more pricey Italian restaurants.  I will keep going back.
