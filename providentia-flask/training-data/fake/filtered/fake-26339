I just want to thank you for my order that ended up in the GARBAGE. After waiting nearly TWO HOURS for my order, I found the lettuce in both my salad and sandwich to be wilted. My sandwich was soggy, and the chicken rollentini to be cold as if it had been sitting out on a counter for the entire time that I was waiting. I was going to demand my money back, but instead I will just ensure you that you will NEVER make another dollar from my family again. #foolmeonce #nodinnerforme -- with Jonathan Grekstas.
