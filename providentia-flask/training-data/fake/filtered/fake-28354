I thoroughly enjoyed this place.  I had stuffed shrimp, wonderfully done.  My wife had the scallops (tasty and tender), and my son had sausage (cooked just right and also tasty and tender).  Great atmosphere, fast service and a really cool neighborhood.  Stop by for a meal before heading to LaGuardia for a flight.
