This place is really great, and has a great concept to it.  It is really a nice comfort food place, with a twist of a little bit of class.  The only issue I would say is that it is super small, can get loud and the tables are close together, but thats what happens in the city.  The food is amazing, and is that perfect comfort food we are all always looking for.  We had this amazing soup, which had kale and beans in it I believe, it was so different but so good.  I then got a burger which was so good as well! I would love to come back, just maybe when it is less crowded and not as loud.
