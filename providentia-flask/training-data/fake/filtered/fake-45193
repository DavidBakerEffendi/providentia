I've eaten in and ordered take-out from Nan Zhou and will never eat hand drawn noodles from any other place. They're consistently good (even after being left in the fridge for a day or two as leftovers). So far I've only tried the ox tail, and ox spare rib noodle soups and they have been amazing. I still have yet to try the noodles with peanut sauce that my boyfriend told me is pretty damn good as I'm such a big meat lover :)
