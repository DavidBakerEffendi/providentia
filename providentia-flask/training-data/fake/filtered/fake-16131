I was really excited about trying this place. I went on a Sunday and they were packed but we only waited about 20-25 minutes which I thought wasn't that bad because it gave us time to look at the menu. Whilr we waited though we were by the bar and i noticed the bar tender was using his bare hands to tear mint leaves and to put ice in cups. Kinda rubbbed me the wrong way but maybe I'm just a germaphob anyway When we sat our waiter introduced himself right away and told us he would be with us in a few minutes which he was. We ordered the tomato soup for an appetizer and it took a half an hour to come out. But it was delicious! It took another 30 minutes after we were done with the soup for our food which I thought was a little long. My husband ordered a burger with their parmesan fries and I got the Mac attack. Out of all that, the fries were the only good thing. The burger was pretty average and the Mac and cheese was salty and bland. We then ordered the fried Oreos which was really good. It came with a shot of chocolate milk and a little bit of espresso ice cream. I think I would go back and try something else since their apps and desserts were good.
