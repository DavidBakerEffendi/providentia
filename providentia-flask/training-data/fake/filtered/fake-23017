We have always been a fan of the Soup Girl's delicious soups that have been delivered to our home for the past several years, but we are in heaven now that she has opened her own store in Hamden. Located in the Whitneyville section of our town, she has taken her talents to a whole new level. The store boasts her special talent of creating deliciously healthy soups and light entrees, as well as yummy sweets to satisfy your sweet tooth. If you have  tasted any of the Soup Girl's creations you know it is hard to name just one as your all time favorite!!! If you have never tasted any of  the Soup Girl's soups, etc., visit her new storefront and become a Soupee like the rest of us!
