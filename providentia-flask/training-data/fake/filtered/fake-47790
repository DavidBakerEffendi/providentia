This café used to be so much better, I used to come by more often. I went in last week to work on my computer. I had to stand at the counter for at least 5 minutes while the clerk was busy flirting with someone. He wasn't disrespectful just very distracted like he didn't care he had someone to wait on. The music was really annoying to.  I put my head phones on to drown out the bad club music. What happened to the chill hindu music or Jazz they used to play?
