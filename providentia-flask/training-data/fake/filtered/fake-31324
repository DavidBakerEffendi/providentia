Very disappointing. The noise level was almost unbearable and we found ourselves eating quickly so that we could leave quickly. The acoustics and the music made it impossible to hear the person sitting right across the table (and there were only two of us). The food was nothing special. I ordered the "Bubby's breakfast." Eggs were fine, but the hash browns were almost all onions, one piece of toast was burnt, and the "fruit" on the menu was a tiny, tiny, tiny sliver of cantaloupe. The pork sausage was pretty awful. The only good part of the experience was the waiter. He was very polite, pleasant and attentive.
