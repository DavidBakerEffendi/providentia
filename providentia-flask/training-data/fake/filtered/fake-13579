We've been going to this restaurant- which is quite a trek from our home, for about a year. The food is excellent, and very creative. What we really like is the options you have between a small snack, an inexpensive meal (of great quality) or something fancier. You can have the amazing Langos (Hungarian fried dough "pancake" with either sweet or savory toppings), the goulash- or a higher end dish like hangar steak. They have a French Chef doing his spin on traditional Slovakian home cooking, and we haven't had a bad meal there. The beer menu is amazing as well!
