An outstanding in the Spanish cuisine, flavors that will impress the most discriminating of palates. The food as well as the service is a winning combination. The Shrimp in Garlic sauce appetizer is my favorite and so is the Red Snapper entree. The best part about this whole experience is it doesn't leave a hole in your pocket.
