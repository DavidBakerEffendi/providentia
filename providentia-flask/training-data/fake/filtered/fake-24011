was on a road trip and it was still early in the morning, got off the exit and found the Royal diner. looked at the menu and found something to eat, 15 minutes later I got my coffee the girl did say she was sorry she was on the phone with her boyfriend, when I received my food I noticed the homefries were those frozen in the bag ones, YUCK, my eggs were the smallest I have ever seen and my steak looked like those fake ones kids get in there play kitchen, it was 10.95 and my coffee was 2.95 and oh yea my blue sparkerly seat I sat in was taped with duck tape
