We ate at Villa di Roma over the weekend (party of 5) and had an amazing Italian meal (true Italian!!!) Our waitress Honey was awesome! She was friendly, knowledgeable of the menu and such a pleasure to have serve us! If you are looking for authentic Italian cuisine Villa di Roma should not be missed. From the appetizers to the fresh cannolis I give it 2 thumbs up!
