This place is great.  FRESH sushi is hard to come by.  I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered from here.  My daughter loves the onion soup and spicy kani salad is always delicious.  The black pepper tuna salad is also another fave.  My favorite rolls are the Dancing Wasabi, Volcano, and Million Dollar roll.  The sushi is always delicious and fresh.  My mother even had the one of the hibachi dinners one night and loved it.  My only complaint would be the service, not that it isn't good, but the one waitress can be a little unpleasant at times.  Some nights she is great, and others not so much. Also, if it's really crowded you might wait a litle for your food but it's not too bad.
