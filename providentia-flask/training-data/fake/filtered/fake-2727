We stopped in for a quick drink after a show and it was scary and dirty. I couldn't imagine anyone actually eating here.  I ordered a drink and I am still not sure what it was. When I complained to the bartender I was told I could drink it or leave.   It might be a good place to buy drugs. There was lost of shadiness going on. STAY AWAY.
