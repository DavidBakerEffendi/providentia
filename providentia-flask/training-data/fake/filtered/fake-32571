I have to brag about food truck on 53 between Lex and Park. It's called Uncle Gussy. I bought their chicken pita on wheat, and it was so amazing. I was going to take a picture of the food, but next thing you know it was gone. If you are hungry for some greek food, you should stop by, and don't be scared of the huge line. While you wait, just think I'll finally have a taste of "Greece."
