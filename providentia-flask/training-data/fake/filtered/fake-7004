We have tried every Indian restaurant in Parsippany and this is our favorite, by far They use far less ghee and heavy cream in the preparation, making for a more authentic Indian food experience. As an American, I never realized how wonderful the various spices could be. Yes, the often young waitstaff can occasionally be slow (inexperience?) but this is more than compensated for by the gracious owners willingness to explain how to eat (yogurt to cool when too spicy; red to make more spicy) Indian food. On chat and dosa night we were lost; no more! Mango lassi and garlic naan are spectacular! Â Highly recommended!!!
