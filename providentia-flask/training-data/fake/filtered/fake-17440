This place started off well. They seem to have dropped many of the items I like when they first opened, like the seitan sandwich. The burritos are also very small. The other issue is service. I have had some good servers there, but MULTIPLE times, they simply forgot to bring the chips and salsa we ordered. This has honestly happened 3 times. Our last visit (which was their last chance) this happened again. Of course, I canceled that order since it was supposed to be an app with our drinks. Naturally, the server said "ok". Sure enough, when the check came we were charged for it. They removed it after I complained, but that should never have to happen. She didn't seem even remotely apologetic either.
