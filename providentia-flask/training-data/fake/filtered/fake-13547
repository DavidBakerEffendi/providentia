Catfish has hit its stride and is getting better and better. Dinner is delicious. My husband loves the oyster selection and the catfish po'boy. As a vegetarian, I like their vegan selection but I am thrilled by their brunch. They make a perfect omelette. French toast (pain perdu).... Amazing. Bananas foster pancakes? Just go eat them. Happy hour is great - if you like whiskey, good beer, and awesome bartenders you will leave happy. If you don't like any of these things....just ignore my review.
