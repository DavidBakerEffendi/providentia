my wife and i were in the mood for a gyro or something different we looked this place up and called he made our food ahead of time even though he was closing and we called on our way he was nice and the food was soooo good we enjoyed the lamb gyro and the fixings. the stuffed grape leaves were excellent . we are def going back for a full dinner , take out or eat on sidewalk does not matter food is great tasting .
