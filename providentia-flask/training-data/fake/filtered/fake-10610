I used to really like Atticus. The food was good, the atmosphere was great, and the location is very convenient. After my last visit, though, I'm not sure if I'll be going back anytime soon. The menu has changed multiple times in the last month, and the last time I was there, it featured a grand total of five sandwiches and three salads. The crowd-pleaser tomato panino was one of the sandwiches that, inexplicably, didn't make the cut. Our waitress was inattentive and completely ignored us at one point when we were clearly trying to get her attention. Perhaps all of this would have been forgiven and attributed to the restaurant having a bad day... except that, at the bottom of the menu, printed in very fine print, was the following: "It eats healthy or it gets the hose again". Way to be super creepy and make me lose my appetite before I could even order. I can only hope that the person who made that genius decision has not actually seen Silence of the Lambs. Overall, a revolting experience.
