I have been this place many times for many reason. not only for for lunch & dinner also sometimes stop by  for just drink tea with excellent desserts. all I can say  this place is fabulous. I am very grateful for the customer service along with the delicious food. as a chicken lover My favorite is chicken combination added with some yogurt.if your  favorite is meat  you should definitely try  Istanbul combination. after you done  don't forget to order Turkish Tea with Kazandibi (Bottom of the pot pudding roll) .you will definitely be amazed.
