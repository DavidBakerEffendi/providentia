I went there the other day. I did not know what Greek food was. When I start looking at the menu and I was trying to find something the chef let me to try some Â lamb in red wine and tomato sauce,omg that was the most perfect dish I had in my life he served it with some rice, over roasted potatoes, veggies and some baked beans, everything was very nice prepared. At last I had a baklava as well which was delicious too. I was very happy that I found that place. Soon to return!!!
