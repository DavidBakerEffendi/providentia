The bread basket is very well done. With four different breads and three accompanyments  You need to make certain not to eat to much as it could spoil your meal.  The apppetizers - Fritto Misto is excellent slices of calamari and mixed vegtables piled high with fried lemon and sage, equally as excellent the Octopus - very tender.  The entrees were superb I was a real fan of the red snapper.  The service is very very attentive without being overbearing. Highly recommended.
