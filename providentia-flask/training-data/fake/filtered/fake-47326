I'm a little biased since I grew up here and remember it as THE place to get fresh fish(uncooked) as a kid.  But that being said, it's good.  It's better than good.  The prices are great, especially for seafood.  The classic Southern New England Lobster roll rocks.(that's a hot lobster roll to you non-natives)  The fried oysters are wonderful, The service is quick, the Foxon park sodas in the cooler are worth the trip alone, and the decor is outrageously fun. So if you're like me, hop on your bike and get some lobster and a strawberry soda and watch the beach.
