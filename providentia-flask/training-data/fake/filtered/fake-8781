My lovely wife, Patricia Herringbone III, and my precious children, Bethenella and Williamsburg, were ardent fans of Blue Ribbon Sushi.  To our shock and dismay, this citadel of the sea had come to shore for the last time.  There was, however, a sign directing us down the street to the Blue Ribbon "Brasserie."  We were a bit skeptical, of course.  After all, why would a French "Brasserie" be offering up our beloved fish? When we arrived, we were a bit unsettled by the dim lighting and the "trance-like" music.  Our children stiffened. One of the waiters had the audacity to sport an unconventional hairstyle. I could tell that Patricia, my lovely wife, was becoming increasingly uncomfortable in these surroundings. Bethenella, as usual, was in her own little world, reading Hamlet, oblivious to her surroundings.  Young Williamsburg, my pride and joy, was trying to remove ice cubes from his water glass with his chopsticks, but failing miserably, Our dog Harold, whom we had left outside, tethered to a parking meter, grew anxious and started sobbing uncontrollably.  At this point, we considered leaving, but my brother-in-law was staying at our brownstone, and he is an insufferable bore.
