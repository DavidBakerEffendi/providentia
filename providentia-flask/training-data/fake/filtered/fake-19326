TERRIBLE.  Just went for Valentines Day dinner.  After having to use a credit card for the reservation so you can't cancel, they spring a prefix $60 a head menu on you upon arrival (no regular menu option); so you can't opt-out or else they hit you with the cancellation fee.  Waitress was clueless (but very nice).  Entrees were less than mediocre.  Lemon Sole was gross.  Fillet was gnarly, as is gristly, and they didn't even ask how you want it cooked.   I wouldn't  recommend it to an enemy-  place doesn't deserve the revenue. Not going back unless I absolutely have to for a birthday, engagement or any other obligatory event someone would be stupid enough to book at this place.
