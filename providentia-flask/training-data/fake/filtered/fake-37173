Hands down the best pizza I ever ate. My favorite is the extra cheese , olives and sausage. The first time I ever tried thin crust pizza, I ordered a small one and it was so good I had to have another one. Sam really cares about the customer experience and using fresh ingredients. Wildwood also has the Belly rewards card and runs specials. I let mine ring up to get the free pizza and then by a salad on the side . All the best to Sam and Raquel in the New Year.
