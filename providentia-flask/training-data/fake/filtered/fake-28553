I had a chance to bypass this place. I know very well when I talk about Indian food since I cook my self and own a Tandoor in my house and cook many variety of lamb and chicken in it. Their Chicken is no relation to tandoori chicken, they just cooked in maybe in a conventional oven, cut in pieces, they could do it from last nights left over. Nann was cold and beginner. Beriani rice not professionally made. If I live in this town I wouldn't recommend it to any one. But for once and you are hungry, ok. So you get what you pay for. I paid $10.85 and I believe don't worth it.
