Place is either super busy or empty. Service is great. I called on a Friday night a female took my order very friendly and explain to me the special of the night, when I picked my dinner not only did my order was ready but she greet me with a smile, very polite and charming. In the middle of the rush she still smile and made small conversation with me and others waiting.   I have been back since then and finally know her name, Vanessa.  She makes the best salads at vito's and her service is great.   Pizzas are a plus, cheesy and hot.  Wings are delicious specially on BBQ sauce. If something is wrong with your food they will do anything to fix it, money back, credit and even remake it for you. Don't ever forget to get some focaccia bread!!!!!!!!  Specially right off the oven, is to die for. Waitresses are cute but they need a uniform to look professional, most of them are 16 to 19 yrs old so they are always chatting among themselves, still very polite and accessible if you need help or refills.  They are not rude. So if you haven't stop by there yet please do so. Is a nice little pizzeria place.
