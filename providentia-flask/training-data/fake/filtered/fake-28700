Food here is fine, but it was definitely better a couple of years ago. The food however does take a while to arrive. Management was also much better then. The manager is now a mean lady who wears glasses and says,"I got you," a lot which is actually quite strange. She is not quite fond of kids ( I saw her give a dirty  look  and a smirk to a trick-or-treater on Halloween). Overall, if you leave out the "I got you" lady,it was an Ok experience.
