Great place.  Staff and owners are very nice.  The tacos are out of this world - and leave you feeling satified and not stuffed.   I went on a Saturday night and was able to get a spot at the bar to dine.  After dinner, one of the owners (and the chef) came out to ask how everything was.  Being a bartender and server in the past, I definitely appreciate the owner taking the time to come from the kitchen to make sure my experience was top-notch.  I would definitely go back.
