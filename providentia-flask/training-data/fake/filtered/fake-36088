We are from South Florida  and have dined at La Fourno many times over the years.  Can't imagine better Italian food We chose La Fourno  for our daughter's Law School graduation party last week.  Our 30 guests are still raving about the food and the service.    We were concerned about planning the party "long distance".  The owner, AL, was totally responsive to all of our requests and was in constant contact with us via email and phone.   We had several guests with "special food needs "and these folks were treated like royalty. The only complaint we had was "the food was so good that we over-ate" The awards they have received over the years are well deserved. We would recommend La  Fourno  for a party of two or a party of 30... and anything in between!
