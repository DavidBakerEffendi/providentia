Well, I guess our mistake was going to the Sunday prix-fixe meze instead of brunch.  We ordered 1 vegetarian and 3 meats.  There were four courses with a fair variety of food but the portion sizes were quite small.  In addition, it seemed that there was too much oil on everything.  The dishes were tasty, but for $150 for 4 people and no drinks/dessert, I expected a better experience.
