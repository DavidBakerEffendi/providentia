This past Tuesday I stepped into Woodrow's on my way home from work, to get out of the cold and have a quick scotch. There was an artist on premises drawing caricatures of people for free. His name was Dezi... as in Dezi Arnaz. I thought what the hell, why not get my done too? Turns out I really love my caricature so I tipped the guy $20 (Maybe someday it'll be worth something!). Anyway I decided to stay and hang out for a while. The bar tenders were super chill. Â It was just one of those great nights where I found myself feeling proud to be a New Yorker. Thanks Woodrow's for the reminder!
