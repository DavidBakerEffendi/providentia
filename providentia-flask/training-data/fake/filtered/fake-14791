My husbad and I like to try local restaurants and decided to give Ploy a try. We were not disappointed. The restaurant was beautiful!!! The menu had a nice variety of items to choose from and our meals were generous in size. Service was a bit too laid back, but it was nice they weren't trying to run us out the door. Thanks for a delicious dinner! Sorry we didn't try you sooner!
