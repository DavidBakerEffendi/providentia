I go to Sitar almost every day for lunch buffet since I work only 5 mins alway from it. Buffet is $8.95 which doesn't hurt at all and there food has that perfect indian spice to it. Nice place to dine out at and a very friendly service as well. They have so many diffrent entree to choose from but my favorite are the saag entrees.
