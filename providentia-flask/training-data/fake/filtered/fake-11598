+ Great lunch specials. + Delicious mole poblano... mmmm. + The nachos were overflowing with deliciously gooey Chihuahua cheese, but we were silly to split them as an appetizer for just the two of us! +/- Nice ambience and traditional decor, except we were seated right next to two A/C vents and were frozen solid by the end of our meal. We'll definitely be back to check out dinner!
