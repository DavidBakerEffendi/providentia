Love this place, great food. Their bahn'mi sandwiches are the best. So far I have tried the catfish, vegetarian and the lemon grass chicken sandwich. My favorite is the vegetarian tofu sandwich. It's full of flavors and delicious. The ingredients used are fresh and you can make it as spicy as you want by adding jalape√±os. Another dish that I thoroughly enjoy is the lemon grass chicken pho. It's to die for and was my goto dish during the winters. A big bowl of noodle soup with lots of deliciousness! I love it. The soup portion is big and enough for 1 person. A great casual place to dine in the village. They have limited seating and don't seat u till your party has arrived. Also they are a cash only restaurant! Despite that, the food is absurdly delicious!
