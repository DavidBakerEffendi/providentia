Sorrento Bakery is awesome. The bread is the best bread I've ever had.  The pastries are amazing and the brownies are to die for. They have a deli and the sandwiches (on their own bread) are great. Truthfully, Sorrentos blows Calandras out of the water!  Their stuff is always fresh and consistently delicious. I highly recommend it.
