theres nothing bad to say about five leaves.  delicious drinks menu, incredible dishes, and TRUFFLE FRIES.  how can you go wrong with that? not convinced? STUMPTON COFFEE.  their espresso is to die for, add a little orange twist to it and raw sugar (the proper way to enjoy espresso:)) i went in there a few weeks ago, and had their norwegian poached eggs.  the salmon was not over powering, and the eggs were cooked perfectly.  the hollandaise sauce was rich but not over powering! bloody marys were crafted with perfection. not too spicy, and not to weak either.  the best part of the meal was truffle fries.  it's really the true reason i keep coming back! try the BLAT - bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato.  the bacon is thick cut, so if you usually like your bacon well done, reconsider - it can be a bite chewy. four stars only because its super small and they like to pack people in - it can be a bit claustrophobic there!  oh - and be prepared to wait to be seated!  its a great joint, and people know it!
