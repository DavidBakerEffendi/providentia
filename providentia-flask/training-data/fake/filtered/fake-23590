Great concept and even better food!! I love the Yogurt bar where they can make your own parfait with whatever toppings you like. And if you never had a Fredo, make it your business to go there ask for one! Who knows, you might even get lucky and a world champion winning barista make it for you himself ( tip: ask for the Fredo cappuccino). Now the food, simple but delicious. Try the chicken and pork stix and make sure you order their Farmer's salad and side of feta fries and saut√©ed kale! Wash everything down with one of those strawberry mojitos in a big copper pitcher made for us by a cute bearded manager on the spot :)
