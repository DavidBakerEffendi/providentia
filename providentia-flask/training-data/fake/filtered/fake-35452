I loved this spot.  Went here last week with a date and it didn't disappoint.  I gotta say that the appetizer and dessert was the best part.  Not that the entree was bad by any means its just that it didn't stand out as much as it could have.  This is definately a special occasion spot.  I thought the service was second to none and the decor fabulous.  Best espresso in the city I've had!  Maybe returning for Valentines Day
