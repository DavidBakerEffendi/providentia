I love, love LOVE this place! Everything about it is what I'd consider for a perfect bar. The food is phenomenal; I highly recommend the tacos (chicken!!) and enchilada. Not traditional Mexican-style necessarily, but honestly, BETTER. The kale salad (with lemon poppyseed dressing and cashews) is a great switch-up to the usual and the brunch burger (grass-fed burger with fried egg and other fixin's) is a treat on the weekend. As for the booze: they rotate their well-balanced seasonal beer selection often, and bartenders are always happy to give you info on beers you've never had and make helpful suggestions. Great whiskey/bourbon selection, too. ALL of the staff are wonderful--bartenders, servers, owners, chef--and though it definitely has its' busier nights, it doesn't really draw a super rowdy, sloppy crowd (i.e. I never find myself annoyed by other patrons there, which happens often these days). Since I live down the street, I love how close it is. There definitely isn't much going on in the way of bars this side of McGuinness, so not only was it a much-welcome addition to the hood, but it is kind of an oasis in an otherwise mellow, quiet area. Lastly, the backyard is great. Occasionally they'll host BBQs in the back, and the yard offers so much space that I've never been at a loss for a seat no matter what time of the day/night I'm there. I couldn't think of a better combination for a perfect bar. See for yourself!!
