We went after 1st Fri Aug 2011.  Mei was half full. My wife order a pork dish which she said was fair.  She had to ask for rice which they failed to bring with her dinner.  It took them 10 minutes to bring it after she asked for it while she sat and stared at her food. I ordered braised tofu.  After 20ins they still did not bring it out.  Then they brought out the wrong order.  Then another 20 mins and they brought out the wrong order.  I told them I didnt want it now and bring the check which took them another 15 mins to process. We will never go there again and we suggest you dont either.
