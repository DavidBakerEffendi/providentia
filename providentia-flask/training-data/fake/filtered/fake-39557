THIS PLACE MADE ME SAD!!!! after reading the rave reviews on Yelp, i was really looking forward to dine in here. We wanted to eat something new and asked to the waitress (of course) but she did not know how to explain it well so we had to get clarification like 3 times. I EVEN DON'T LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THEIR SERVICE. I ordered the fresh spring roll and a dish that had (chicken, green beans....and some other crap....)   so our entree comes out first....(what???)  and the rice.....OMG THE RICE IS HELLA HARD.  and its not in the perfect bowl shape...it's falling apart.  the entree was DROWNING IN OIL.   i finally get my appetizer and the shrimp smells fishy...the wrap falls apart...the veggies in there were browning. my coworker's appetizer was fried yams and they messed up on that too!!  one of her yam pieces were BURNT!! OMG - WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY THIS PLACE HAS THEEEEEEE MOST CRAPPY FOOD IN THE WORLD.   NEVER EVER AGAIN - EVEN IF I'M STARVING!
