I had my sons christening here in 2012 and had a wonderful experience. The staff is extremely helpful and accommodating. The food is excellent and they service is great. Everyone had a wonderful time and still tells me and my husband how great it was. They even sent people home with doggie bags because there was so much food. The only thing is it is a little outdated (that's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5) but otherwise you can't beat the price, service and food!
