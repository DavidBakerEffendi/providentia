So impressed by this new neighborhood restaurant! The food is absolutely delicious.  Everything tasted fresh and the dishes were interesting.   We began with a dozen oysters - a mix of all that they had, which consisted of only east coast varieties. They were very good and appropriately priced.   I had the kale salad and sunchoke soup.  Both were exceptionally good.  Filling, but very healthy feeling.  The sunchoke soup had crab in it and the kale salad had apple and breadcrumbs.  So delicious.   My date had the pork chop, which came with faro and endive. Also exceptionally delicious.  The pork was cooked just right.   We ended with the lime panna cotta with fig.  Heaven. Great beer, wine, and cocktail list.  Adorable Brooklyn atmosphere.  Service was very sweet.   We will be regulars.
