My group and I have been pho fans for many years dining at Pho 501 and Le's Vietnamese in East Hartford.  Since we discovered Pho Tuong Lai about a year ago, this has become our new home for weekly servings of pho about 3 times a month.  We don't mind the extra travel from East Hartford for this delicious soup that rivals Pho 501.  For the same money we think we get more noodles and meat and additional flavor of cilantro to make it slightly different from others.  We also like it that we don't have to wait in a long line to be seated, and service has always been prompt, and you are not rushed to free up the table.
