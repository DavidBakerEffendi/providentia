Received a notice from Wine Thief about their wine dinner. It was my first time at the restaurant. The ambiance and d√©cor is great. Felt very welcoming. Food was very good and enjoyed the wine parings. It was a lot of fun. I walked away stuffed! Staff was attentive and very pleasant. I like finding new places to go and I will definitely be back.
