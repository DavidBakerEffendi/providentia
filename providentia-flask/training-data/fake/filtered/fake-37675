Have eaten here few times, and I'm in love with the food. Grade A food, halal (kosher), healthy, fresh and cooked perfectly. Ambiance of the restaurant is super welcoming and small with authentic Turkish feel. I can vouch that the food tastes the same here as it would if in Istanbul. I recommend to everyone and anyone looking for excellent food for a steal of a price!
