It was my first time coming to this restaurant after reading there article in the Hartford courant. Not only was the food great, but the variety of styles which were used was very different something I've never tried before. I have been looking for something healthy to eat, and seeing the pictures in the article I decided to try it for the first time, it was delicious. The price was very affordable and the amount of food was great I think I ate enough for two. I really enjoyed talking to the staff as they were very helpful, and the environment was very clean, I will definitely be coming back!
