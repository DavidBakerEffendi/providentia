Went last night and is probably the best date spot in the Ditmas Park neighborhood. Great food, really cozy, and the service was the best I've had in a long time. Never too crowded, even when full, and not too pricey for the amazing quality steak/lamb sandwich, dessert, and bottle of wine. My girlfriend is pumped to go back again soon. Definitely worth it.
