i always think the pizza from this restaurant tastes just amazing as their fame. i'd waited almost one hour to get the pizza, and they didn't disappoint me even though i waited really long. everything was perfect ; the proportion of the sauce and mozzarella, nice crust dough and fresh taste. i really liked the way they baked the pizza from brick oven, it reminded me of the pizza that i had in Italy. Â  Except the size of the toppings, everything is just great. Anyone who loves pizza and especially who wants to have amazing pizza they'll love this place.
