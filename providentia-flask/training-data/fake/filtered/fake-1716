Probably my favorite restaurant in New York.  Large, varied menu with lots of choices and everything (based on 8 years of experience ) is delicious.  I love their no reservation policy - the last few times I've been, I walked in without a wait (before 8).  Service is professional, not overly friendly.  Blue Ribbon delivers consistently.
