Enjoyed eating here. Open concept and great design. Food was spectacular. It's nice to feel fantastic after lunch. We try to eat healthy at home and when we are out it can be more difficult. Hu makes it easy. I would recommend Hu to anyone looking for a tasty healthy meal with a great ambiance. We liked it so much we went back and got some treats to go for our friends we were meeting up with later. We are picky eaters and loved it. Try it. Only downside is we live in CA. Come west Hu come west!
