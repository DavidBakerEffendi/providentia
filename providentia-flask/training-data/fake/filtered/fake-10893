My wife and I held a large event here but spent the minimum for room rental and services because we were on a budget. The upstairs room is quite beautiful and the event was a hit but, sadly, we were very upset by how the Union League treated us. Staff showed up half an hour late, without apology, for an appointment to go over event details and generally made little effort to disguise their disrespect for us. In addition, our purchased services were reduced day-of despite our contract and we were refused a discount (any breach of purchased services just ended up being subsumed by the minimum room charge). The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth, so I wouldn't recommend doing events here. Perhaps this is simply a function of what we spent (which, believe me, still wasn't cheap for us), but the restaurant was fully aware what were were willing to spend when we made final reservations and didn't seem to mind at the time. Â Disrespectful and unfair.
