At my second attempt I made it. I instructed my friends to the virtues of patience, made them and myself expect the worst and the inevitable queue to eat at Ippudo went like a breeze through a tree. Psychology worked, and, as you can guess from the 5 stars, it was worth it. The pork buns I picked as starter were the best I ever had, the soft resistance of the pork meat is a perfect complement to the cloudy bun that wraps it. Akamura Modern Ramen was perfect. I often find ramen in US too thick and too salty. The one at Ippudo has THE balance. The extra pork belly I added was so amazing that, 1 day after, I'm still disappointed with one of my friends who forgot to add it to his own ramen and took one of my 2 pieces. The overall experience was great, Ippudo is permeated with an entertaining yet typical Japanese atmosphere thanks to the welcome and goodbye shouts and the attentive care of the staff.
