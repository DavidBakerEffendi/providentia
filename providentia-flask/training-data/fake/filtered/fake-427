Eaten here many times and have to say that the service has ALWAYS been subpar. They don't realize that good service and treating customer right is an absolutely integral part of getting people to come back. The tone is set by management, and clearly Tommy Up doesn't preach respect or guest service. Food is great, but there's a lot of great food in Philly. Tommy is a smart guy - must have considered the fallout from posting the receipt and still thought it was a good idea. Donut burger is awesome Â -too bad you have to go in to get one.
