This place is definitely a good place for dim sum. There doesn't seem to be too many other options around the area, so my family has been coming to this restaurant for years. The service is ok and we usually get our food quickly. I love the shrimp dumplings! Â We're usually quickly seated because the place is relatively big. I always bring friends here for Saturday dim sum. I recommend it!
