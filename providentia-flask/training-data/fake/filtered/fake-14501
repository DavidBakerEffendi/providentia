My qualm with Osteria Procaccini is with their take-out pizza. My husband had been a fan of their take-out pizza since they have opened their doors.  But, it is going downhill...at least on the take-out pizzas.  The last 5 or 7 pizzas have been burnt on the perimeter.  We had been willing to cut off the perimeter of the pizza.  But, then we began noticing that the underside of the pizza was also burnt in sections. Perhaps this doesn't bother some people.  But, burnt sections do bother us.  Burnt anything is not healthy.   Plus, Osteria touts that they are health conscious, but, from my reading, burnt pizzas are potential carcinogens.  Right on their menu is typed: Our concept is authentic Italian food free of artificial preservatives, colors, sweetners, flavors, and hydrogenated fats...But, then, why do they continue serving pizzas to-go that are burnt.   And, when you eat pizzas there, their pizzas have not been burnt!  But, the downside of eating in is that you then have to listen to noise.  There are only a few tables where you place your order and then a few tables outside (..and, if you opt to eat outside, then, you have the NJ heatwave.) Also, imo, their pizzas are relatively small, thin, and *expensive* so you have to order more than one.  That's ok just as long as the pizzas are not burnt.  Also, there is a very limited menu here.  No Italian meals..just pizzas, antipasto salads and paninis.
