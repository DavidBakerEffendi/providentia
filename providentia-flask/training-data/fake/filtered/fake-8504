I went to this place the other night for the first time. I had always seen it but never went in. It was pretty crowded. It got really loud really quickly. There was a DJ blasting 70s and 80s music which seemed strange since the majority of the crowd appeared to be younger. They had a whole wall of liquor and our drinks came pretty quickly. Next we ordered some pizza. The pizza was ok, a little well done and not enough cheese. Shortly after that the DJ announced that they were starting trivia. When he spoke it vibrated the whole bar. He was loud enough to be heard a mile away. I tried talking to my friend but we couldn't even communicate over the music. You had to yell to speak. Most of the other stuff was good, but I wouldn't go back if it was ever like that.
