The DJ managed to empty a full happening bar in 20 minutes on NYE with some of the most god awful music I have heard in a long time. There is great music from the 1970s and 80s but hackneyed crap and drivel they were playing is simply insulting. Eddie Money. My Sharona etc. .  WTF.  If I want this crap I would go to Jersey. Oh,  Tribeca I guess is Jersey (just a tad more pricey).
