A day trip to Philly from NYC started with this restaurant my wife & I found on Yelp and the great reviews we read about it. Very local quaint location with a Brooklyn/Bostonian back street vibe. We were the only ones in there to eat initially as it was a weekday morning but lots of traffic for coffee to go and they seemed to be regulars. We ordered Parisian Za and Saumon Fume au Cheval, wonderful tasting food and very flavorful. Cute classic cafe style decor. We were also approached at our table by the very colorful and amazingly friendly husband/wife team that own and create the menu. Service like this should be copied by every restaurant! When I come back to Philly this place is on the list if I'm in a need for a nice meal and not Geno's - and I do like my Geno's. Get my point. Drop in, this place does not disappoint.
