We love this place! Finally a craft beer place right nearby! The food is generally terrific, especially the fried chicken, which comes several ways-on salad, on sandwiches, on eggs-I'm sure if you asked, you could get chicken on dessert! They also have great fish tacos, which we order when we are trying to be "healthy-ish". Really, though, we go here for the beer.  They have a large craft beer selection, and it changes frequently, which is terrific (there are restaurants nearby that haven't changed their food/drink menus in the 13 years of  us living here!) I would have given 5 stars, but there has been one rude hostess we had to deal with--however every other staff member has been terrific!
