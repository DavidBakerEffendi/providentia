I must say the soul food at this spot is out of this world! I ordered the Rev. Al Sharpton, a.k.a. chicken & waffles. The portions for meat that they offer is out of this world! I literally had to finish the rest of the chicken for lunch the next day. The corn bread melts in your mouth and the collard greens are phenomenal. I felt like I was at my grandma's house with helpings I could not finish :-) I brought my friend from England here and she said "they don't cook like this where I live!" The prices are great for the portions you get.
