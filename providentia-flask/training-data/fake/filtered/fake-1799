This is for the staff, first to the waitress , tall with blonde hair, I do not appreciate you being rude to me, throwing my half of Shrimp Po boy in the garbage and try and give it back to me. You have no idea how to treat people and have no right to deal with the public. I should have listened to my friend when you did not bring her drink until after you started eating your lunch, if you take a order follow through. You don't deserve the tip I left, give it to the bus boy. Second to the rudest male manager, I don't know if the waitress is your wife, girlfriend or sister, because I work in customer service and the customer is always right. If I tell you that she threw my sandwich in the garbage, don't tell me it was by your desk. Your desk is not where my sandwich should have been. Third to the rest of the staff "Thank you" you made my friends birthday pleasant No need for an apology, there is no way to rectify this...even the perception of the food being in the garbage, or even by the managers desk is enough to have replaced just half the sandwich. Then for the waitress to treat me so badly after the fact, I was so embarrassed. I paid good money for this meal, this was my worst, by far my worst restaurant experience!
