I must say by far one of the best restaurants in the area. Beats out a lot of the bigger ones in Claremont. I am from Maine and everytime we go to Claremont Elainis is the only place I we will eat. She the best food and it is all made fresh. You could not ask for a better place to eat. Not only is the food the best but the owner is a real sweet person and treats you like family. If you are in the area you must try it out, you will not be sorry
