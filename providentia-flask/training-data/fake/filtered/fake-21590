I made a reservation at the HELL City Kitchen and tried unsuccessfully to reach them over the phone listed on their website. Against better judgement, I continued with their high class (what a joke) reservation only to show up at the restaurant with my entire family for what I thought would be a 5:30 pm birthday celebration with my husband, daughter (7 yrs), son (12 yrs), mother (66 yrs.) and myself and basically be told we couldn t come into the restaurant unless we paid $70.00 for some stupid jazz concert that started at 8 pm. They didn t even try to say, we apologize for the confusion and please come back so we can make it up to you. I wasn t even sure if I was talking to the manager or a ghetto version of one because no real manager would have allowed 5 paying customers to walk away angry. Then the real insult was the phone number for this so called nice restaurant rings out to a cheap answering service. I would not recommend this restaurant to my dead relatives. Thankfully, Suzy Q s BBQ accepted our entire family with open arms, the service from Ashley was impeccable and the food portions were awesome. So here is my advice to anyone in the entire state of NJ.....do not go to HAT CITY KITCHEN........go to McDonalds first....at least you are guaranteed great service!!!
