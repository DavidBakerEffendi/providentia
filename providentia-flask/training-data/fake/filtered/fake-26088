A great Thai restaurant that feels slightly more upscale than your average Thai. i ordered veg pad thai and veg green curry and can't really compare to the Thai restaurants in my neighborhood, and the crispy spring rolls we had to start definitely tasted a little fresher than you'd usually find. Throw in a Scoutmob deal, and it came out to a cheap and fun dinner!
