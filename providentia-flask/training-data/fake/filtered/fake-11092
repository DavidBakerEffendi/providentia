i have been a fan of mithaas for a few years. The food has always been of very good quality. It is the only indian restaraunt that makes authentic tasting "delhi style papdi chaat".Menu is more expanded than the edison location. The only drawback is the service. This is a carryover from the edison location. You order at the counter they give you a number you go sit down at a table and they bring the food out to you. It is great in theory however the food is not always delivered to the right table and many times, when the food is prepared it is sent to whatever table receipt the distributer in the back sees first not necessarily the first ordered. Also the chefs do not see the orders in the order that they were processed so some one who just showed up gets their food first and you might be waiting 20 min. I still think the food is great....
