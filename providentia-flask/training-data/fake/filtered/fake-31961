I am responding to the negative review KCK gave to Posto. As a loyal customer, my husband & I are in the neighborhood & eat there at least once a week, I have never had anything but a great meal & great time, largely due to the staff, Ron in particular. My family visits from out of state, Posto is always on the list, and it has to be on a night when he is working. In our opinion, its the best, from the pizza to the employees, and everyone we bring there feels the same. Juliet & Jim
