Ambiance was trendy. It's a kid friendly place. The food presentation was nice although, the taste of the food in general was mediocre. Ordered age dash tofu, garlic chicken, beef bbq ribs, spicy tuna roll, pork katsu don and pork belly udon soup. The service was terrible - came with a group, waited 1 hour for 3 of their entrees because the blond waitress forgot to put in their order, then they brought the wrong order for one of them and they didn't even apologize. At the end, they got our checks wrong and it took them 4 tries before they got our check right. The experience at Samurai Mama as a whole left us with a bad taste in our mouths.
