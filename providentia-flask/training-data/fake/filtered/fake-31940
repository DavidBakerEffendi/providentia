I've been visiting Posto since it opened a few years ago.  It used to be my go-to place when I wanted thin crust pizza.  The pizza was always piping hot, thin and so delicious.  I used to highly recommend it to friends who wanted to eat in or near Gramercy, but I don't think the quality of their ingredients is the same as it used to be. This time, ordered 1/2 mushroom and half jalapeno.   The cheese has become extremely oily and the pizza very greasy overall.  The sauce is not even tasty either.  I hadn't been back in about 5 months after a similar experience.  For an $18 thin crust pizza, it should be fantastic and I was again, seriously let down.
