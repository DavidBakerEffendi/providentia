I've lived in the Philly area for 15 years and have eaten numerous cheese steaks.  Some friend from NY State visited and they wanted an original cheese steak.  We chose Geno's over Pat's.  It was embarassing.  Tasteless and overpriced.  Like many other reviewssaid, it is a tourist trap.  Don't go there or to Pat's.
