This is a good place to go if you a) can go for an early dinner and will avoid crowds or b) have all the time to wait. While I have been a big fan of Caracas for many years now, whether it was the location in the city (I was going there when they were just a hole in the wall and not many people knew about it) and the location in Brooklyn. I still like their food very much but I have to say that the location in Brooklyn needs serious help. The managing staff doesn't seem to care and forget about the waitress! You'll wait on a Saturday night up to an hour to be seated for a table of 2. It seems as bigger groups have better luck or are simply being seated faster because the more people that eats the more money I guess. The last times my husband and I have been there it has been a disaster from beginning to end, and trust me we wont be going back. Not only did we have to wait forever to be seated, but also for the waitress to take our order, bring our order, take our check, etc. The waitress didn't even bother to ask if we needed another drink when our first ones where done (and she didn't even bother to bring our first round of drinks anyway). Then she came and said that they had run out of rice. Who runs out of rice? As a Spanish woman who cooks regularly, I know that rice doesn't take that long to make and is possibly one of the easiest things to do (mind you, the restaurant only offers two main plates except the specials of the day, and one of them has rice so we felt that was really ridiculous. So after all this wait, over an hour at this point, my husband has to place a whole new order which she also takes a very long time to check on. So yeah, if you don't mind waiting and being served by people who obviously do not care for your business, go to Caracas in Williamsburg. Otherwise, I will just refrain from it and rather go to the location in Manhattan.
