What a delicious way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Some friends and I went here for lunch today and I can't say enough good things about the place. The dishes (ceviche mixto, camarones cuzco and jalea) are amazing and authentic. Even the staff is top notch and always eager to suggest interesting items on the menu. Our waitress Cybelle recommended the entrees above in addition to a mix of traditional cocktails (Pisco Sour) and sangria to compliment our feast. Her warmth, wit and charm made our weekly get together even more special. We will definitely return to try the rest of the menu.
