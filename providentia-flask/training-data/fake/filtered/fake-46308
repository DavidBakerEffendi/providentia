Came here with my boyfriend and this place is absolutely delicious! We ordered the pork bun for appetizer and it was the most yummy pork bun I've ever had. My boyfriend was going to order a second order, but I wanted to save my stomach for the ramen. The ramen was soooo good and I'm giving 4 stars because I wish there was a second restaurant in NYC, so we don't have to wait so long. The food here is definitely 5 stars.
