Went to Joya last night based on rave reviews from a friend. My boyfriend and I were really disappointed. The chicken satay are mediocre at best and so was the peanut sauce. I ordered the Gai Kratiam. I thought my elderly grandmother had cooked up a pot of vegetable and chicken in some chicken broth and sat the bowl in front of me with some rice on the side. My boyfriend ordered the spicy pork and pineapple fried rice. The brought him spicy seafood fried rice. He started to eat it, but didn't like the taste. He then picked up a shrimp and that's when I picked up the candle to take a closer look at his plate. OMG!! He is allergic to shrimp. We called over the waitress, who continued to apologize the rest of the night. She brought him the correct dish, but the taste was still not that great. I will not be returning to Joya. I will continue to go to Sea. They only charged us for drinks and 1 entree.
