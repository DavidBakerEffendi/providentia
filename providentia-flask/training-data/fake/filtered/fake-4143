Brooklyn Commune's best kept secret is the soup of the day. If you're lunching on a budget, get the soup!  It's hidden near the bottom of the menu but it is worth every bite.  For $5, you can buy a cup (more like a pint) of soup with unusual but surprisingly complimentary and tongue-tantalizing flavors. And if that doesn't sway you to try it, I'll give you an example of some of the soups I've enjoyed. Summer peach with blackened salmon served cold, savory carrot ginger, vegan celery root, and last nights deliciously gourmet duck soup with sausage and sweet corn. They also have a great menu, fresh ingredients, and a quiet neighborhood vibe to fall in love with.  The prices are a bit steep, but I trust the quality and flavor of the food that I don't feel guilty spending $10-12 on a truly satisfying meal. See what I mean? I'm hooked.  As should you be. My only suggestion would be to incorporate espresso into their drink menu.  They have the advantage of their location by the train station and could benefit from opening early for the morning commuters tired from the weekend and desperate for a caffeine fix a.k.a ME.
