I had a wonderful time at La Fuorno. I had never eaten in this part of town, and was pleasantly surprised by the restaurant. The waitress was very attentive, and the manager made us feel at home. The food was fresh and DELICIOUS! BYOB and a bar. A fantastic experience from appetizers to dessertsll!!
