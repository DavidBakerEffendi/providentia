Although the food may be good, the service at Nolitas is consistently HORRIFIC. Phone service for take out is incompetent at best. The level of disorganization and chaos is unbearable. Â We have tried to patronize the business but each time it becomes more and more upsetting. Wrong orders, foreign objects in food, long wait times etc. Clearly better management needs to happen.
