So I'm strolling through the neighborhood with two of my co workers and we see this small cute restaurant and decide to go in. Boy was that a mistake!! We only wanted one drink before going to adopt a pet around the corner, but they didn't serve drinks before 12. (fine) then another server comes to us and let's us know we can't have drinks unless we order food (weird, but fine again) now the only problem was the disrespect the "manager" a heavy set Mexican young woman was uninviting very rude in the way she spoke to us. When we told her we would have to find another place she goes "awesome" -- and as servers we know that's no way to bring us back in. We would have tipped her at least 20%. but she completed ruined the moment. we came in bubbly and happy and left very disappointed. I just know I'll never be here again. ever.
