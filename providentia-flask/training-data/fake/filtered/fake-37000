I had wondered about the tour beforehand, but thought I would give it a go...all doubt vanished as soon as we met Scott, he makes you feel like you are old friends and is such a fun guy you want the tour to go all day. The depth of love and knowledge scott has for Pizza is unmatched by anyone I have ever met or seen on TV...Go - take the tour you will have a great time, and great pizza. While I'm at it, get the shirt, people notice ours everywhere we go and want to know more...
