Pretty fantastic Pizza at this place. I haven't tried Pizza this good since the 80's so it's been a while, the place could use a little better upkeep inside but the food is so great who cares. They do a wonderful job on the cooking and I wish in retrospect that I had sent my compliments to the chef. He can sure craft a pizza pie. I'll have to make my way back down to this place sometime soon.
