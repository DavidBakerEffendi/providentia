The place is really nice,the decoration is amazing!,i love the big lamp in the middle of the restaurant,but it seems like a waist of space, I ordered couple appetizers and all the dishes were fine, I did"t find  so many choices when i went to the bar. The liquor options were  really poor. Also the chairs were nice but not really safety!!,believe me,don't move to much if you don't  want to end up on the floor!!
