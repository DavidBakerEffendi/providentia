Tunxis Grill - Newington, CT 08/25/14 Monday - I just left the restaurant and arrived home. Disappointing - S...L...O...W  Service after ordering our Entrée.  Monday night reservations for a party of 6 at 6:30pm.  Four of us were seated and we waited for 2 more.  Ordered drinks and a couple of appetizers while waiting for everyone to arrive.  Placed our meal orders and our salads were served.  Then we waited and waited and .............. waited.  Our order consisted of three salads, one wrap with fries, one dinner special (pasta with chicken) and one baked sole dinner.  At least 30 minutes went by when I had to ask if everything was ok in the kitchen.  The waitress look puzzled that I was asking where our meals were.  So I explained - It's Monday night and the dining room was empty.  Two parties - One with 2 patrons and a family of 4.  And finally our meals arrive 40 minutes later. While we are eating a woman asks the table if everything was ok and I replied that our meals took a long time.  I'm assuming she was the manager but never identified herself and didn't notice a name tag.  She claims there was another large party of 6 or 8 and would check with the kitchen.  She never returned to tell us what the problem was and why we had to wait so long for our meals. Paid the check and the waitress tells me one appetizer was comp for the delay with our meals.  Shame on the manager for not returning face to face and letting us know what the delay was all about.  And shame on the manager for comping the least expensive item on the menu.  Oh ......  the drinks were cheaper.  It will be quite a while before I return and when I do I won't plan on being served my entrée for an hour.
