The sushi was excellent, however I left with a bitter taste in mouth thanks to the poor treatment I received from the staff. After clearing a plate of sushi, my friends and I ordered a roll we never had. We did not like the roll, so we obviously left it. When we ordered the check we had to pay a 6 dollar take out fee to bag the leftovers we didn't like to avoid paying ala cart ($10 or more) for the roll. Now that just isn't fair. It is an all you can eat buffet, so experimenting customers should be expected.
