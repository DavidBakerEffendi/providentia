This is actually my second time here, this time we got in quick, tried get in before the peak hour, i really enjoy the decoration the asian japanese fusion style is really modernized, the food here is really great, we had this steak for appetizer, and the traditional pork ramen as main course, the ramen is so firm and chewy, the broth is so flavored but not greasy its just worth of the trip.
