My business brought me to Caldwell, NJ for a 3-day seminar.  I had asked my colleagues for their recommendation of a good restaurant. They suggested I go to Calandra's Italian Village.  The second day of my seminar I went to Calandra's Village.  I went to the iL Vecchio Cafe for dinner and had ordered Eggplant Rollantini.  What a delicious meal.  My server was great too, so friendly and very welcoming.  We started talking about Calandra's Bakery and what type of breads and pastries were sold there.       After dinner, I walked through the village admiring the many shops.  What a nice, beautiful building and a delightful variety of food and beverages.         I was particularly impressed with the beautiful bakery.  It had one of the largest assortments of breads and pastries I have ever seen in one place and so wonderfully displayed.  There were so many choices, it was a difficult decision of what to select.  I purchased rye bread, whole wheat panella, Bastone Bread and a dozen of assorted pastries to take home and a dozen to share with my group at the seminar.         I received comments that ranged from "Awesome Pastries" to these are "The Best Pastries I Ever Have Tasted!"  Since then, I am back home and my family loves the bread I brought back and the pastries only lasted a few minutes.  My family can't wait for me to go back to Calandra's Bakery and bring home more pastries and more delicious breads!    I would highly recommend both iL Vecchio Café  for dining and Calandra's Bakery to anyone-  If you feel in the mood for a great tasting pastry or would like an experience of indulging in some wonderful and tasty breads ~ Calandra's Bakery, Caldwell, NJ is the place to go.  The staff at the bakery was excellent, very patient, helpful and efficient and the prices were very reasonable too. What a variety and so scrumptious.  A definitely a must see in Caldwell, NJ!
