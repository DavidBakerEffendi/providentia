I wish I could like Atticus more but frankly the waitstaff is rude and inflexible. There are good things on the menu such as the black bean soup (which is not vegetarian by the way for those who care). I purchased $100 worth of books but they would not let me charge my coffee as well and told me there was a minimum charge for food which had to be rung up separately. I could give many other examples which by themselves might be just frustrating but all told add up to a place which is not so good they can afford to dictate. PS the steamed eggs are ridiculous. Either serve properly made eggs or not. Good coffee. Nice location convenient to museums etc...
