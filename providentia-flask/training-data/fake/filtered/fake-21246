I adore this lovely cafe / restaurant. Murat creates every dish with care. Most people come in the morning for the turkish coffee or breakfast but I like it in the evening as well. You can bring a bottle of wine and have a very peaceful evening here. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. The red lentil soup and the coban salad are amazing.
