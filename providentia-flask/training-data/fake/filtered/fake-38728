Went there for lunch. The server was very attentive, the food however, came out way too fast. As the dishes were being cleared, the next course was coming out. We had to skip dessert because of this. The best was the flatbread oyster salad - hands down. The country pate was good, but not great. The fish was good, and had nice flavors but since it came out right after my appetizer I hardly had any breathing room. The rolls were delicious (I had the fruit and nut roll - very rustic, very good). The mismatched silverware was a charming touch. Probably would not go back again for lunch, might give it a second shot for dinner service.
