Good place to catch blues bands or jazz. Â Normally order the catfish jambalaya, and it hasn't disappointed me yet.decent southern style place to grab a bite, nothing super special if you are actually from the south though. Drink prices are actually cheap for a change in the Hartford area. It can get loud in here, so just be aware that it is a music venue that also serves as a restaurant. Can't stress that enough. One of the more unique places to eat in all of Hartford. Which is a statement to how boring Hartford can be.
