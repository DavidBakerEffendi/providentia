We have been there twice in three weeks; the first night it was a Tuesday early so there was hardly anyone there.  But we were impressed with the quality of the food and the friendly staff.  We returned two weeks later on the evening with the Flamenco dancing, got a seat right next to the dance floor.  It was a great evening--the food was good, the mango sangria was very good.  An uneven table caused a quite accidental drink spill and the waiter responded graciously with towels...and a free pitcher of sangria!  We stayed for three hours, had four or five tapas, watched a first rate floor show...and got out for less than $100 for two.  We will definitely be back many times.
