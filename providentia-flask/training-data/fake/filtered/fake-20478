I did not have a good experience eating at this restaurant even though the food is tasty. The service was so slow that it ruined the dinner for me. Our three course dinner from a fixed menu (limited options!) was dragged out for 2.5 hours. Sometimes this can be a wonderful thing when you and a romantic partner are lingering over wine and moonlight, but that was hardly the case on the particular Wednesday night when I ate at Zahav. My party of five consumed our food quickly once it arrived and then wondered, "Where IS that next course?" Note to Zahav: Not everyone with a 5:45 reservation expects to get their entr√©e at 7:30pm. If that's your MO, a little more bread and hummus would have been nice.
