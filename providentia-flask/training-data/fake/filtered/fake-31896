MY FAVORITE UWS RESTAURANT This place is always awesome and everything about the food is perfect. The Sangria is delicious and there are probably like 10 varieties. The bread is very unique- I believe a waitress once told me it was made of yucca flour. But soooo delicious. I have had chicken, steak, and fish here and all have been cooked to perfection. The duck was also quite unique, although of everything, perhaps not my favorite. the lobster and grapefruit ceviche is to die for- I highly recommend it as an appetizer. The focus is definitely Latin, so if you don't like Latin food, don't come expecting to find a hamburger or pasta on the menu. Â Although it is pricey, the entree portions are huge! I have never eaten more than half a meal here! Meat dishes come with plenty of veggies and fried rice (so unhealthy but absolutely delis), so you'll never leave full. Definitely a hard place to eat healthy though- the ceviche dishes are truly appetizers (too small for a meal), and no salads. Great service and ambiance- comfortable, low lighting, the booths are very private. With the amazing drinks and such an ambiance, it is a perfect date place!
