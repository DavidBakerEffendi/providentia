Great spot in Forest Hills. Â It's tucked right underneath the LIRR station. Great selection of beers which includes huge selections of IPAs. Whiskey is also their specialty. Food was delicious as well. The one negative I have for this place is that it gets very crowded during after work hours and the place is a bit small so it can be tough to get seating there during busy hours.
