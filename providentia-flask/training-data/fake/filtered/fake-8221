I went to Yuca a few times before and every time I went there I loved it. Last Saturday, I tried the Sea Food Cous-Cos Paella  and it was amazing! I never had it before and it was even better than the traditional one. I also tried the Palm Grangrada Mojito and it was so good that I order two more.  You guys should definitely go there and try it out.
