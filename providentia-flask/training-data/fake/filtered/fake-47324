The food and service at Mama Rosa's is the best!!!!  Everything is freshly made to order and they accommodate the extras at your request with the best attitude and the sincerest smiles.  I think the pizza, friendliness, and service exceeds anything I have had at Wooster Street restaurants and New York!!!!  Thanks Mama Rosa's
