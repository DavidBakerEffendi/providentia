This pizza is truly delicious, and based on my experience, fairly unique.  The crust has a nice wood-fire char, and though it's thin, has a soft, slightly springy texture.  This is not crispy pizza, and it's not intended to be. The toppings are simple, straight-forward pairings like pancetta with artichoke, and clams with parsley.  The ingredients are are top quality, and each pie is finished with a generous swirl of fruity olive oil.  I've eaten in twice, and gotten it to go once.  Staff was very friendly.  Can't wait for the liquor license because a nice class of wine would really complete the experience.
