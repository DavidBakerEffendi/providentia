I have always liked Zaroka. The food is very good, the service attentive and prompt. As a a veggie, there are plenty of delicious choices for me and my meat eater friend really enjoyed the Grilled Meat platter and the yogurt marinated chicken. I have had lunch and dinner there and both have been equally good and I just love the bathroom decor as crazy as that sounds, but it's very imaginative and pretty. I have only one complaint and it's a BIG one. 5 of us went to eat after a Shubert Show, (all restaurant people so we are OVER tippers) and they added a gratuity onto the check, Something I have never seen on a party of 5 but they may have been afraid with us being all women, that we wouldn't tip properly. (Very common for women to cheap out on the tip), so I wasn't looking for that and didn't comb the check as I should. I was treating and I added a 25% tip to the total and we left. When I got home (1 1/2 hr away), I realized they had added a tip to the check and I had tipped on top of that so 43% Â tip. I was wondering why no one came back to the table after they took the check to do the courtesy of saying thank you for the tip , and they all went and hid in the kitchen. Now I understand they didn;t want me to realize what I had done. VERY SNEAKY and NOT cool!!
