This place is a jewel!  First of all - how often do you find Jamaican/Caribbean food around here?  But I don't just love it because it's unique - the food is really good and you can tell the lady that owns the place puts tons of love in to everything.  The lunch special is a steal, and you get a nice size portion of jerk chicken, rice and peas, plantains and veggies...  Like a homemade meal. I will say that the spice level on the jerk is pretty tame - certainly nowhere near the stuff I had on a trip to the Caribbean years ago.  It's delicious, though, and so tender it literally falls off the bone.  The sauce from the chickens run all down in to the rice and veggies. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it... The place is always very neat and clean, the food is great and the prices are very reasonable. The owner is sweet and is always friendly.  What more can you ask for?  The location is weird, hidden away in a strip mall where you wouldn't even know it's there.  But that's not a problem for you if you're reading this review!  Go out and try it!
