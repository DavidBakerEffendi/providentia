This is a fabulous Mediterranean/Turkish restaurant with delicious and reasonably priced dishes served in an authentically Mediterranean environment.  The staff is wonderfully attentive and friendly, and they have outdoor seating in warmer months.  Their hummus and warm bread are the best in the city.  Only negative is that they have a very limited selection of wine by the glass, and at times, no selection per glass at all.
