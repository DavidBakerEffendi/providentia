I never consider a review from someone who has only visited an establishment once, so i waited until after my fourth visit to Mac's Tavern to write a critique.  I plan on going back again!  I love the location, neighborhood bar atmosphere, and friendly staff.  But the food and margaritas still have to be good to get 5 stars.  I consider myself a burger connoisseur.  A good burger and fries will be my last meal on earth if i have a choice. (Try their sweet potato fries!)  Since i can't eat the bun (celiac's), i really judge the burger itself.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  The meat was delicious, done to perfection, good cheddar, a nice red ripe tomato and crisp lettuce.  Much better than expected from a brand new tavern.  The manager told me, he is looking for a "better bun."  Lost on me, but my husband was impressed.   Friends of ours were visiting from Cleveland and were excited to find the expansive beer selection, especially the Dortmunder from the Great Lakes Brewing Company.  (Our friend calls it the Yuengling Lager of Cleveland.) Anyway, i liked the vibe and feel confident in recommending Mac's to you and all my friends.
