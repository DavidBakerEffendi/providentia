Just had to post about the wonderful Sunday Prix Fix. We went to the 5:30 seating last night and could not have been more pleased. Loved!!! the food. Great service too and each dish was better than the next.. 5 courses with small size portions but by edn of meal felt full and very satisfied. Especially loved the scallops and main course fish. Lots of flavor in everything and unique pairings. Just a delight. BYOB was great too.
