This was our first time dining at the restaurant and it was spectacular. We were greeted warmly as we walked in. The service was as excellent as the food. We had an Armanian waiter who was able to expedite our order. We were quickly brought out bread and we ordered the butternut squash w/o cream and they were able to accommodate us without problems. I would highly recommend the soup. We also ordered the ceasar salad which was also good and the chilled lobster salad. I believe the gentleman Victor ( not sure if he was GM) checked on us to make sure we were enjoyed our meal. It was quite nice. The place has welcoming ambience, I would definitely visit again.
