Food and coffee is delicious, but I will NEVER return. The service here is horrible.  This is beyond the typical aloof Williamsburg.  I ordered a cup of coffee to go and had the milk thrown at me, the sugar slammed down on the bar.  There are plenty of places to get good food in Williamsburg.  This is not worth the service.
