God bless this little place. The atmosphere is as new york as it gets and the food is amazing. Order the simplest thing and you'll be amazed at how absolutely great it is. I have NEVER been disappointed at the Stage. It is one of my family's favorite restaurants and always passes muster with any visitor I bring there.
