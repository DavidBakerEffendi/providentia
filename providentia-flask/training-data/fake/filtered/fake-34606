Horrible table service.  The waiter never bothered to ask how everything was while we ate and never bothered to ask if he could wrap any leftover to take home. We had to constantly ask that our water glasses be refilled.   I ordered the NY Strip and after being served, they never brought me a steak knife.  Once again, I waited for anyone to come around to ask for the steak knife.  It was extremely noisy and listening to others at my table was extremely difficult.  With so many other Italian restaurants, I will not be returning here anytime soon.
