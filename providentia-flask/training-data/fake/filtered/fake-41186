Ramen is pretty tasty.  Definitely go for the meat lovers special. My primary issue is that the wait is too long which is not helped by the fact that people just don't eat and get the f*** out of the restaurant.  In japan, you sit, slurp, and get out.  No dilly dallying.  Getting ramen is a transaction.  In and out.  If you want "ambiance" go pay more money at a momofuku joint.
