As an experienced juice lover, i was extremely disappointed by this establishment. I tried a juice combo of carrot apple ginger and was eager to be delighted. However, the juice came warm, the carrot overpowered the whole drink, and the vegetables are not organic, so the juice had a dirty taste. For 7$ a serving, the juice should be organic, cold, and mixed right, not warm dirty and carroty. On top of that, the people "helping" me were cold, distant, and didn't even make eye contact, and did not even look at me to respond to a question i'd asked. I'd recommend you save your money and juice your own organic fruits and veggies.
