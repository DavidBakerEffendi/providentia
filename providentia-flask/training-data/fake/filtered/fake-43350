Years ago I came to this buffet, and i don't recall having any complaints or maybe i was just too young to remember.  A couple of months I took my kids and my mom there and i was extremely disgusted, i don't' even know how we stood there.  As soon as you walk in it the place feels so muggy, it's like the rug was soaked at some point and they never dries it, there is no type of air circulation there.  The table was dirty, the buffet area wow!!  Food all over the floor, and this tiled floor was filthy just the thought gets me nauseous!  If the place was this bad imagine how they prepare the food?  How clean can that kitchen be?  I still cannot conceive  the fact that the Health Department hasn't gone there and at least addressed this issue!!  Someone needs to do something about this :/
