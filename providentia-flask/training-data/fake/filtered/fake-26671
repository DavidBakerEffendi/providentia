I was visiting family in NJ from out of town and was so blown away by this place that I insisted we go back again two days later. The salads are amazing (try the kale salad or the beet salad!) with really large portions. Most of the ingredients are sourced locally, so that's extra cool. The owner came out to talk to us, which was a nice touch and he's really friendly. BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, this is the best pizza I've ever had, including in Italy. Try the butternut squash pizza with braised kale, and you must also try the risotto - it's to die for. Bring a group so you can all try and share different dishes! The patio is fantastic, weather permitting, but inside is really cozy, too. I bet it'll be amazing in the winter, with the wood fire oven going...
