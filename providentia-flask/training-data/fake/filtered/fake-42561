We celebrated our 8 year anniversary there last night (Tuesday).  What a beautiful night sitting on the top deck, enjoying some pre-diner drinks and appetizers.  Diner was fabulous.  Best rack of lamb I ever had.  The waiter was awesome, he saw we were just taking our time and gave us the space we wanted but was always there when we needed him.  The anniversary card in the menu, complimentary champagne and after diner drinks were a very classy touch.  Thank you for making our night so memorable!
