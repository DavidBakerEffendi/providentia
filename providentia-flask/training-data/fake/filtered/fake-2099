I am absolutely obsessed with this place! Every single time I go, I am never disappointed. The staff is perfectly polite and accommodating, serving us water and items off the menu while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Words do not even begin to describe their biscuits and peach butter. There isn't an adequate description for them. They're an absolutely delicious pair. The perfect items to curb your intense hunger while waiting for either your friends to arrive so you can order, or just waiting for your food to arrive. I was Â a little put off by the grainy texture of the french pressed coffee, but the few sips I had of it were delightful. The cubed brown sugar dissolves fabulously in the hot coffee. I had the eggs and toast both times I went and because of this place, I'm going to start baking my eggs. The bacon is always cooked to perfection and the country toast with butter hits the nail on the head to complete that hearty lunch dish. Plus the tomatoes are so fresh! This place is a gem.
