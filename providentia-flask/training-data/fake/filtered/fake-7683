Fogo de Chao really is a good place to have some good meat. They serve it in a very unique way. How about guys walking around in cool uniform with whole rack of delicous filet mignon and other steaks. The interior is very classy and the food are very tasty. The filet migon was my favorite.The filet mignon was very tasty and juicy. The price was right too for 50$ per person. I had a good time with my friend Steve. The service was very professional and courteous.
