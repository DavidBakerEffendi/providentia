My family has been going there since 1954. We ate there weekly when I was a kid.  It's been my place of choice every single year for my birthday dinner.  But all of us has remarked that the food & service has been going downhill the past few years.  The last straw was last year.  They refused to take a reservation for SIXTEEN people!!! We went on a weekday at 5:15.  First they would nt seat us until everyone was there, although we were missing ONE person. When he got there, they then told us we had a 20 minute wait (which turned into FORTY minutes).  It took another 1/2 hour just to get bread & water. Then it continued to slide downhill.  We tried stopping our waitress numerous times to just take our orders.  It took a almost an hour to get our orders - which were cold -  & several were incorrect. But everyone was so hungry, we ate what was put in front of us. This will be the 1st birthday in several decades that I won't be celebrating my B'day there. In fact, no one in my family will ever return there again. So sad.  I used to rave that they had the BEST eggplant parm in the world & recommend it to everyone.  Now, I wouldn't send my worst enemy there!!!!!!
