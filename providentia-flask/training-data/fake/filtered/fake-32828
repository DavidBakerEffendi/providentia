It took me a while to actually go to this place after reading great Yelp reviews, but when my sister was in town, I had a buddy to go to a late lunch on a Saturday.  Il Bambino is tucked on a quiet block and the atmosphere inside is warm and cozy. I love the mural of the pig on the wall and I actually learned something about ham while referencing it when reading the menu. Great lattes and I LOVE the panini with the fig spread - it's a great combo of sweet and salty.  I'll be back to try the crostinis and the soup!
