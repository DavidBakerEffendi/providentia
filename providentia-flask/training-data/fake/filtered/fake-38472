Delicious food and friendly service! I lived in a region of India inhabited mostly by Tibetans for a month and my experience tells me that the food and ambiance is very authentic. I felt like I was there again! The server knew the menu very well and the food was fantastic-- wonderfully fresh, not at all oily, well seasoned, perfectly cooked veggies. As delicious as it was, our pakora sat in the window too long and lost some of its crispness and while none of the food was completely cold, it was not served as hot as i would have liked. The flavors and textures were so good that I didn't care much. :)
