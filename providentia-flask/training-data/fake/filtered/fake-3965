Get Fresh is a warm, inviting place that is a notch above the neighborhood fare. We ended up there this weekend on a lark and were charmed by it. The coffee was great, the food was thoughtful and tasty. The staff was really accommodating to our two year old, they even had a space to park strollers. We left talking about who we wanted to take there with us next. It's just got a great vibe.
