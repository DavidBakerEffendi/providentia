This place is so disappointing.  They are ruining countless fun days for people in red hook, and don't seem to care.  I have never in my life seen such rude management.  I feel sorry for the great wait staff who have to work for these amateurs.  When a table is ordering expensive food and drinks and having a good time in a calm, relaxed way without bothering anyone at 7pm you DO NOT ask them to leave.  When there are dozens of empty tables you can't tell people you need the table they are at unless you have an event planned in the space. These are restaurant basics. You can't build a place that emulates charming and relaxing destinations like Key West and then shatter the dream with uptight, impatient, slimy management. Perhaps the management should take a vacation and pay attention to how a cool bar/restaurant is run. My advice is to wait for them to go bust in a year and enjoy this cool spot when new management takes control.
