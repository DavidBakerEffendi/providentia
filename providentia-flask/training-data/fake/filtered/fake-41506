Lets just say this:  When I clicked on the words "Fuji Mountain"  I started to salivate.   Wonderful ambiance, INCREDIBLE sushi.  Incredibly diverse menu, best Uni I have ever had. I was there w/ a friend one night and our dinner literally "ran away" (being that it was a live crab, we had a bit of a laugh...) Great Saki selection.  GO GO GO, you will not be disapointed!!!
