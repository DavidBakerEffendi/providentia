I agree with several reviewers that Eataly is beyond just the restaurant to the total experience.  I spent about 1 hour at Eataly.  I first checked out the entire place.  I decided on eating at La Pasta.  I had the Pumpkin, Butternut Squash Lasgna.  It was light and tasty.  I also had a red glass of wine that was very good.  I finished my visit with a traditional sponge cake lemon dessert while I had fun people watching.  This lemon cake was exquisite.
