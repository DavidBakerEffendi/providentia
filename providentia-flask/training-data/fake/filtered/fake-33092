My wife and I have been here 3 times and each time we've ordered something different. . The beer list is extensive, and service always prompt, kind, ands professional. Rude waitress doing some sort of fake accent. We were questioned and treated as though we stole it or were running a scam. Â The service is bad, the food is bad, and the food is over priced for what you recieve.
