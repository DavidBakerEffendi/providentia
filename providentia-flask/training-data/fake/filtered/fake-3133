I purchased one roll of paper towels from Forrest dairy for. $2.28  on  Saturday Nov 26 2011. I paid an additional .16 cents sales tax  I know .16 cents is not much money, but consider over a year period all the customers being charged sales tax Om paper products which new jersey taxation states stores cannot charge sales tax on paper products. I Am sure the owner or owners are aware of this law but choose to ignore it as long as the customers say nothing. Convenience stores charge extra as it is because of being  open most of the time I understand that but this is blatant theft. Ps. I don't know about anyone else but I feel I pay enough taxes in rutherford they should at the very least see that the residents aren't being ripped off. I checked the two other stores. Mini mart. And krausers  same thing they are getting away with charging    sales tax on paper products. It's being greedy
