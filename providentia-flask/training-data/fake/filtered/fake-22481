Do yourself a favor and keep driving. This place doesn't listen to a word you say, they NEVER have the type of bagel you want, and the woman at the front is BEYOND rude. And calling there to speak a manager is impossible considering the unEnglish speaking person answering the phone didn't understand the word manager . They will never see my hard earned money again. If you're the owner and you're reading this, do little falls and yourself a favor and pick up your game and try having your staff listen to your customers if you wish to continue living off an income from your bagel store. Good day
