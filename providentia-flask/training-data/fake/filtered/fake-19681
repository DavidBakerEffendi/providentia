This restaurant has a lot to work on, starting with the food. They don't believe in seasoning. I had the fried tilapia and my date had the beef ribs and after 3 mins of chewing on it we left. Yes, we LEFT and went somewhere else to eat. The service sucked. Our waitress seemed overwhelmed and she kept forgetting things like, our water and the check. This place is overrated and the food is horrible. The menu is limited and is far from southern. I'll never go back there.
