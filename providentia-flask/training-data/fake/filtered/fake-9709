Good food. Terrible service. So I'm giving them two stars. I don't care how great the food is, if the service is bad, I won't come back. I was in town, so decided to get some take-out, I ordered the Pho Tai which is pho with rare beef. When I got home, I opened the box of noodles and there was no beef. Instead of going back (since it's out of my way) I called and described my situation. I asked if I can come back another time for it and the person I spoke with said that was fine. Few days later I returned and spoke with a man --who looked like the owner or manager, and he wore glasses-- and reminded him that he forgot to include beef with my pho. So he said he would give me the beef, but nothing else with it. I said what am I going to do with rare beef. He said that he would cook it! Um what? I said, Well can I at least get a small cup of soup? He said I had to pay $2 for soup. Then I answered, shouldn't I get the soup free since you made the mistake? It's just soup. I wasn't even asking for noodles or anything! He said, okay just for you. Um, gee thanks. It doesn't end there. Before he made his way to the kitchen, he had to stop and talk to the other workers and I heard him utter the word soup with disdain as they all looked at me. I just stood there feeling like a complete jacka**. I told them, to forget the order, that I didn't want it anymore and walked out. So if you plan on ordering take-out, remember to check your order before leaving.
