Joya, words cannot express how much I love you.   We have been regulars here since it opened.  How can you possibly beat super large portions of awesome Thai food for DIRT cheap prices, and a great atmosphere??   I think the average entree cost (besides the specials, which are yummy) is between $6 - $9, and the quality is excellent. Be prepared to wait for a table if you go during prime dinner time, but you can always go for take-out if you don't feel like waiting.
