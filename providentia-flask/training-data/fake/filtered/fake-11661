I've been here a number of times now and I can't wait to go back. What I love about this place is that the pizza is always fresh and hot, never reheated like most pizza places in Philly. The sauce really makes the pizza fantastic because it's so flavorful. The crust is thin, crisp, and tasty. The location is really convenient- right near Jefferson Hospital. The place has a fun, hip atmosphere and friendly staff. It's almost unbelievable that you can get a great slice nearby for only a buck! By far my favorite pizza place in the area.
