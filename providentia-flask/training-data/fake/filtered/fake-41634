Cheap eats in a trendy spot in Hell's Kitchen!  With the HEAVY competition of thai food all over the city, one really must try hard to stand out.  This place stands out for me because of it's lovely decor in it's small space.   IT has that NYC restaurant vibe and is perfect for a date night or with friends.  Not so sure about family friendly since I didn't see one child the entire time I was there dining.   One of the best thing on their menu is the Crispy Duck Salad.  Generous portion of duck meat elevated by the fragrant combination of ginger and lime with crunchy cashew nuts!  Their house pad thai was good but not the best (that award for me goes to the East Village Thai restaurant).  As mentioned earlier, it is cheap with four of us and the bill was under $80!  Highly recommend!
