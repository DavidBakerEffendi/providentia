Danny Meyer knew what he was doing when he decided to take this one on the road. The Shack burger is beyond delicious.  If not the best burger I've ever eaten (I eat a lot of burgers at a lot of fancy restaurants), it's up there in the top 10 and is by far the least expensive.  The meat is juicy, the buns are fluffy and yummy and the shack sauce is the right kind of sweet.  I'm not really into fries, but they're hard to resist here.  I don't know what they put on them to make them so tasty but I want to put them all in mouth all the time. Don't forget to ask for pickles at the counter because they don't have them on the condiment bar.
