Terrible place with terrible customer service. I ordered seafood noodle soup. It was served with almost NO seafood. When pointed out, the waitress had the gall to suggest that perhaps I had eaten it up. I was so mad I asked them to take back the dish and they took it back and I paid for it without even tasting it. They were completely unapologetic about their service or behaviour and I will make sure no one from my family or friends every patronise that place again.
