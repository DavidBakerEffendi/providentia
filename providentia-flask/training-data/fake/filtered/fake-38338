My boyfriend is from Naples. He has been wanting to try this place for some time. The pizza was great, the rice balls were not. He had the margherita pizza, I had the carciofi. Very nice. However, we would not return because of the service. Everyone looks Â miserable for one. Our server was looking off into space while giving us the specials. The busser removed our app plates, only after waiting for me to remove my dirty utensils. I also saw him ask the table next to us if they wanted more water, never removing his hands from his pockets. The wait after finishing our pizza and being offered dessert was extremely long. The check came with our espresso and by boyfriend immediately gave his credit card. The check book was returned as I was taking a sip of my espresso by the server reaching in front of me. I wanted my espresso cup, but was surprised by and arm and an "0h, I'm sorry". It was at that time that my boyfriend actually looked at the check, we were charged for 2 rice balls instead of 1. Forget about trying to get our server back. As we sat, everything was removed from the table, including a half full glass of pelligrino. I asked my boyfriend, "do you think they need this table?". He said what do you expect, it's a pizza place. When you are paying $50 for 2 - 12 inch pizzas, one rice ball and 3 non-alcholic drinks, I expect more. They really should pay more attention, its the details that keep people coming back. By the way, we own a pizza place.
