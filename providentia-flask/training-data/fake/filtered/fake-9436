My husband and I went to The Little Owl whilst on a holiday to NY. We effectively stumbled across the restaurant and decided to have a meal because it looked so beautiful and cosy. As we were walk in's the manager (owner? I'm not sure!) invited us to sit on the platform inside the restaurant and have a drink before we would be seated. The wines were lovely and the the manager was very polite and lovely! We were seated after about 25 mins and wow, were we in for a delightful experience. We stuck to the wines that we had ordered throughout the meal, I had the Pinot Gris and it was beautiful. For our starter we had the meatball sliders - AMAZING!! Just enough to get you started :). I had the NY strip steak with pappardelle and my husband had the crispy chicken. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and were juicy and moist. My pappardelle was cooked to perfection. I didn't want my dish to end. To finish off we shared a self saucing chocolate pudding and were blown away. My husband is a bit of a dessert foodie and he said it was the best chocolate pudding he had ever eaten. All in all I'm so sad that I live so far away (Sydney, Australia) and I am unsure when my next visit to Little Owl will be as it was a truly memorable experience and one that made our trip that little bit more special :) .
