So I haven't been in a few years, but in short - this is where I spent the eve of my 21st birthday (after midnight of course.. and rewind many years ago now).  I love the Burrito Bar.  I have history with the Burrito bar.  If they still serve Maui Wowi's, get it and be prepared for a great (albeit fuzzy) night.  Before 9-10pm, they serve great food.  After that point, saddle up to the bar and have a good time.  It's a fun spot and brings back a lot of great memories.
