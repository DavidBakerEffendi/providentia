Went to dinner with some friends this evening. Got a variety of food: - fresh guacamole - chips and salsa - variety of hot sauces (favorite was the orange buffalo sauce, not your typical Mexican sauce but had awesome flavor and spicy) - molcajete - choriqueso - Mexican rice Everything was AMAZING! The portions are generous, the food is quality and the price is low. It's a small restaurant but its nice to see a restaurant that cares about quality over quantity. Definitely recommend trying if you are looking for authentic Mexican.
