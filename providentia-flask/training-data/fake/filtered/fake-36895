I've been a fan of Lincoln Station for a long time.  Excellent rotisserie chicken, meatball sandwich, and lamb chili.  The service, however, lately has tended to be a little inconsistent.  There should really be more than one person on the waitstaff, especially in the morning.  I've seen really slow lines there of 6 or 7 people and that can be difficult for one cashier to handle.  It makes me feel like my time isn't being respected.  These are the kinds of things customers notice and remember.
