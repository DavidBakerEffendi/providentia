Great neighborhood place. What I like most about Bar Bruno is that all the dishes have flavor and they're not afraid of spice. The food is Mexican influenced Bistro. Everything I've had here has been fresh and tasty. My go-to meal is the Frisee Salad and Cubano Michelada (with extra spice mix). The tacos are great too. If you go too early it's a bit overrun with screaming kids, but on the other hand it's a great place to take our out of town friends who have young, screaming kids. Service is good, laid back and understaffed during busy periods, but everyone is always friendly.
