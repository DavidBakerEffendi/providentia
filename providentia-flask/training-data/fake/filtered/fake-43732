I will never go back and never recommend this place to anyone. Today is the morning after our dinner and i am still floored by how rude our waitress was. I have never in my life been so disrespected.   When I sat down at the table i did not have a place setting. Naturally my friend asked if we could get an extra.  Her response in a very abrasive tone was "maybe you should look around harder" because there was one small tapas plate alllllllllll the way at the other end of the table... are you serious? Then she proceeded to serve evryone else wine, except for my friend and me, making it very obvious that she did not want to service us.  Only replenishing water to the left side of the table and left us with no service at all.  (i guess no service is better than her service??) of course she spilled wine on my friend and failed to excuse herself... the list goes on... it got to the point where i was actually worried that she was going to spit in our food!!! When speaking to the manager he said he was sorry and was going to see to it.  She continued being horrendous and the worst part was that since we were a party of nine the 20% tip was included!!!!!!!  for $700 this is the service you get??????????? The manager didn't even have the courtesy to take anything off of our bill.... not one thing. As we left she was laughing looking right at us and told her coworker "whatever i was having fun with it". A raging lunatic.   I wouldn't go back if you paid me.
