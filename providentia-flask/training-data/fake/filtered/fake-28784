This is a VERY small place.  We almost walked away.  There are about 6 tables on each of two floors and a bar on another floor.  It's a very cute place, but reservations HIGHLY recommended.   The food was very good with one exception.  My short ribs were very salty.  I couldn't finish it.  They were cooked perfectly and it was a nice piece of meat....too bad.  Vegatables were cooked perfectly and the mashed potatoes...delicious.   The service was very good and the waiter apologized and gave me a free desert.  He did the right thing.  The owner stopped by to apologize as well.  I was impressed by that.  My wife had the burger sliders and loved them.  My friend had the seafood fra diavalo and loved it. We got there at 5:30 on a Friday and there was nobody in the place.  But by 6:15 there wasn't a table available.  I would definitely go back and give them another chance.
