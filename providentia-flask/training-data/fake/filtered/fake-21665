The food is absolutely fantastic and they have a good variety of brunch menu drinks. Â  The portions were decent sized and the food was not overpriced as is common with French restaurants. Yum! I recommend getting any of the eggs Benedict for brunch. Perfect flavors. I will definitely go back to try the brunch menu.
