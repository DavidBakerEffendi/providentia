Fantastic Thai/Lao food.  The best in the city, actually the most authentic Thai/Lao food I've had in America.  I spent a lot of time here, the cook was from Isaan and knew how to cook actual Thai/Lao food, so I'd highly recommend it to anyone that was looking for something a little more authentic that the standard Pad Thai.
