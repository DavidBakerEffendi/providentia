We were loyal customers of Bokhara since we moved to town. Now that the restaurant is under new ownership it has gone down hill severely. Much smaller portions, much less flavor, and higher prices. Meat was very dry, potatoes and rice were both under cooked. No flavor to any of the food. We will never order food here again. Further, we attempted to order delivery from them last week. The girl on the phone was exceedingly rude and told me they didn't feel like doing delivery. New owners obviously do not care about food quality or customer service. Save your money and go elsewhere.
