Fedora is a fun place Â to stop by for a quick bite to eat if you keep your expectations low. The salads and paninis are particularly tasty, as well as some of the desserts. I've heard the breakfast is dreadful, but have yet to experience it myself. I did try to stop by near closing for brunch one Sunday, and I was rudely ushered back out the door. The owner/baker, Nicole (I think), is very short with customers and staff alike - it makes me want to boycott the restaurant because of her poor attitude. I believe it is her brother that works behind the counter, and he seems to lighten the mood a bit and keep the bratty prep school staff motivated. I recommend lunch - you can serve yourself and avoid dealing with the teenage waitstaff that clearly have more important things to do than serve your food. I recommend their #1 salad and the chicken/roasted pepper panini. Be prepared for an overcrowded dining area at pretty much any hour. If you are debating between this and and the pizza place down the street, choose Fedora. If you have any other half-decent options... go there. Oh, and it is BYOB which is a rather nice option.
