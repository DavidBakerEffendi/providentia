While the beer selection is second to (almost) none and the decor is very much in line with my taste, the food is just a little too lackluster to keep me coming back for anything other than a quick beer. For instance, the last time I was at the restaurant the table ordered some friend calamari and a pizza to start. The calamari was just this side of rubbery and the pizza was just "ho hum". In a city where some of the best pizza in the world is served, you might want to step up your game or just not offer it. For my dinner I ordered the sirloin steak medium rare. When it came out it was cooked between well done and hockey puck. I told my waiter and they brought me out another one....ten minutes later. I understand that anyone can make mistakes and I would be more forgiving if the steak come out just a little overcooked but to go from medium rare to not a shred of pink in the whole thing, I am much less inclined to chalk it up to a simple error. And while this was one instance I am describing, it has happened more than once to me. But the beer selection and the knowledge about beer will definitely bring me back in. If you are into beer and can stomach just okay food, this is your place.
