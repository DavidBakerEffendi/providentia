Pats and Geno both suck.  They are over rated over priced and have no taste/ flavor at all.. Jim's is a lot better but that is not saying that much either.  Ishkabibbles is far better in the area.    There is also a spot right across from Jim's steaks that is a bar also with great steak sandwiches.   Ohhh and not rude idiots working at either ishkabibbles or that bar spot.
