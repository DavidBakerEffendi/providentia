Great Place. First time was there with the kids (grown up kids) this father's day. Could not get reservation as it was booked solidly. Got three seats at the bar that serves full menu. Great cocktails, bartender service. food selection is great, not overwhelming menu, which gives an opportunity to taste most of the small dishes and appetizers, that is strongly recommended. Cannot single out (maybe grapefruit Hamachi if I have to chose only one!) anything as everything is great, from toasts, small bites, main course and, yeah! desert is a must to sample - blueberry pie is my favorite. Also wine selection is great, specifically a rose pinot noir from Alsace region of France.   Came back the following weekend and now had a chance to dine on a second floor. It is interesting that this simple and comfortable décor is aimed to focus your attention on a food, since this place is all about a great food
