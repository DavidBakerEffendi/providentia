Contrary to previous reviewers, we found the service pleasant and accommodating. The food was fresh, tasty and plentiful. The only negative was the male receptionist who was abrupt and Â  somewhat antagonistic. He would not seat us upstairs because we arrived 15 minutes before our six o'clock reservations. The downstairs area was crowded, noisy and somewhat cold. Rita
