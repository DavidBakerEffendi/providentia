I just ate at Benito One again... and again the food was beyond delicious. I had the steak with mushrooms. It was cooked just right and it was as tender as can be. My friend had shrimp with garlic and oil and she enjoyed it. The service was as usual great. Â If you haven't been there yet, check it out.
