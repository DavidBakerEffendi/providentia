I wish yelp would give zero stars. The start of my problem was that I found a dead fly in my salad. This is something that happens, not a huge deal, but what happened after that is something I've never encountered before. I showed my plate with the fly to my server to ask for a new one. The server apologized and took away the plate. To my surprise, he came back to me with another guy, perhaps the manager, and brought the plate BACK TO MY FACE, arguing to me that the black creature with legs and wings was NOT a fly, and that it was parsley! My coworkers and I couldn't believe the situation and said, IT'S A FLY, BECAUSE IT IS! And then this person took the piece of onion with the fly on from my plate, and ATE IT in front of us!!! He looked straight at me while chewing it, smiling and saying "SEE? IT'S OKAY, IT'S PARSLEY!". By this point, my friends and I were both dumbfounded and furious. Luckily the chef came into the room, also angry (of course!) told him to stop as even he saw the fly and agreed that yes, IT WAS INDEED A FLY. He then apologized and got me a new salad, but what a horrible experience. The owners of the restaurant needs to check their staff. What would the board of heath do to this restaurant if it new that its staff were trying to convince customers to eat food that had bugs in it? UNBELIEVABLE
