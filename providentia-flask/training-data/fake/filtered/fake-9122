I've been coming to Salt and Fat since they opened and truly believe they have the best dishes in Sunnyside. So good, whenever I've considered moving, I think to myself "but then Salt and Fat won't be a walking distance away anymore!". They have such great prices and the tastiness of every dish is undeniable. Must haves there are the scallops, terrine and the foie gras! The bacon brittle component in the foie is enough to keep me coming back! My only disappointment is the disappearance of the pork belly tacos and the pickled watermelon that used to come with the chicken. Their Thai ice tea ice cream and yuzu sorbet are also incredible! It's always been hard for me not to take some home after an excellent meal! The Chef is very personable and the staff is very friendly! I love that the dishes dishes are top notch and the atmosphere is casual. Everyone I've referred there has become a repeat guest and I always look forward to coming back! Bravo Salt and Fat for giving Sunnyside eatery bragging rights!
