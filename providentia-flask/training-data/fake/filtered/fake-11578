Sadly, Â although the food was great the service and manager were extremely rude. I am allergic to cilantro and while ordering I mentioned this and the server said it would be no problem not to add the cilantro. First course of nachos arrived sprinkled with cilantro. I was lucky to be able to eat two chips that did not contain the herb. We told our waiter and he did not seem to care and did not even apologize. The second aspect about our experience was that it was St. Patricks day and we were dressed in green. The waiter banned our table from ordering drinks claiming we were visibly intoxicated, clearly not the case since that was our first stop of the day. If we were "VIP" then they should not allow us in the restaurant at all. In any case, the food was good but the overall experience was such a disappointment that I will not be returning.
