The sliders were okay; nothing special. The jalapeno poppers were terrible. The pepper inside of it was red instead of the typical green, and it had a strange taste. The $4 delivery charge really put me off considering I am located about three minutes away. On a more positive note, the funnel fries and taco bites were very tasty, and the woman who took my order was pleasant. All in all, I'd say I've definitely had better food, but it wasn't horrible.
