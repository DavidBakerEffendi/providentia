Went to Rogues for a friend's birthday...the place was amazing. Great laid back atmosphere and unbelievable food. The mac and cheese was hands down some of the best mac and cheese that I have ever had. Great place to hang with friends, drink, and eat. Â I highly recommend you checking out this little gem in philly! Love it there!!
