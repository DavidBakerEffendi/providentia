When I worked at Boeing we were giving a sendoff luncheon to a guy who was moving back to Arizona. He wanted to go to Pat's. We obliged. Everything worked out. Two open parking spots. Short line. Now I lived within spitting distance of Philly for 25+ years. I never went to Pat's. Had no desire..even less so after witnessing their pathetic over the top shtick (complete with stereotypical mandolin music) these cheesesteak slinging douche  nozzles put on for The Food Network.  Being of Italian descent the "ayyyy yo"  minstrel show completely show put me off. Like I said - this visit was for a colleague. So I went to Pat's. First of all - I hate the overwhelmingly poor and arrogant customer service. Don't ever EVER tell a customer  how to order...and thenembarrass him by sending him to the back of the line if he fails to follow your draconian rules to the letter.  Second, you lazy, self-entitled S.O.B.s - when the line is short make the damn sandwhiches to order instead of serving the dried out greasy cedar chips you guys call "meat". And don't give me that crap about efficiency. You guys do it simply because you're in the enviable position of serving crappy food to people who don't care, don't know any better or are there simply to get a "look at me shot" for their Face Book page. But I digress. I get the food. Dry. Tasteless, dry, chewy meat and a really, strong off taste from the onions. The Cheez whiz had some crust on it which i peeled off. I didn't finish it. We all just sat there. I felt so bad for our departing friend. He had high expectations for Pat's. On the way back one of my co-workers said , "so one word to describe our experience". Here's what we came up with: Hate disgust Indifference Apathy Arrogance
