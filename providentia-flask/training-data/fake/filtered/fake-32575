This place is amazing and one of my favorite lunch places. There is a reason the line is always so long during peak times. I think of this place as a cross between halal cart food and greek. The white sauce isnt your typical Halal sauce. Its actually greek tzatziki which is cucumber yogurt sauce. They have decent sized portions and the Gyro is amazing. The combo platter is my favorite covered in white. The guys who work it are really nice. Try is out for some great great food. But if you want your typical Halal food hike over to 53rd and 6th. Amazing place!
