Great place for lunch and take-out.  Had greek pizza today but have had the stuffed grape leaves, baklava and spinach pie.  Food is all homemade from scratch and authentic.  Can't say anything bad about this place. Friends had the greek lemon soup and really raved about ti. Try it out,  right next to Citizens Bank, just off Pleasant Street.  It is quite a find in Claremont.
