The place is overrated. They built a name for them selves and now they just rely on that.  For some reason they think that their pizza is so special. They keep people crowded outside however there are plenty of opened talbles inside. Besides we had four people: 3 boys and a girl. They sat us in a small table howevery the bigger tables were free. after we asked to be reseated and we were told --NO. Waiter dropped the food on the table and walked away: no bon appetite, no enjoy your pizza.  Waiters at this place are rude and even dont pick up the empty bottles. We paied $70 for 2 large pizzas with four drinks, no alochol. Guys!!!!!!! NEVER go to this place. Save you time and money.
