Quiet ambiance. Quick service. Ordered the various grilled meats. Served with so much rice on the side (wasteful). The grilled shrimp was good (but only 1 in the dish!!!) and the chicken.... some pieces were so overcooked, the fork hesitated to go in... didn't eat all of it. Overall ok... would consider returning, but would order something else
