I wanted to dine at Amy Ruth's for the last 5 years and finally had the opportunity yesterday. It was horrendous.  From the uninspired  cornbread that tasted exactly like it came  out of a Jiffy cornbread box, to the crabcake that was chock full of artificial crabmeat, to the chicken wings that we ordered as an appetizer that had the same flavor of the wings I order at my local Chinese restaurant, my entire meal was a disaster. Both my parents are from South Carolina and I spent every summer of my youth in the south, so I KNOW  southern cuisine and this was NOT it.  I'm inclined to believe that this food will be appreciated by people who don't know anything about southern/soul cooking. The potato salad was watery, the sweet tea wasn't like any I'd tasted before.  It was brown sugar water.  You couldn't taste the tea.  My boyfriend's short ribs had some wierd colored gravy on it.   It wasn't bad, but  it wasn't good either.  I will say the sweet potato (it wasn't yams) was ok. The guy at the door was very nice and allowed me to be seated while my dining partner parked the car and our server was very nice. DO NOT go here looking for "authentic" southern cuisine if you've had good soul food in the past or if you had Sunday dinner at your mom's house the week before.  Amy Ruth does not compare and does not live up to it's repuation.  The food is a mass produced mess!!!
