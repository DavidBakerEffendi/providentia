This is as good as a taco truck gets. Freshest ingredients down to the amazing home made salsas. I had 2 Carnitas tacos with yummy Poblano slaw and a chalupa dog with crispy bacon and the works. I have eaten Mex and tex-mex from tons of different places and this is top notch to be sure. Everything smacks of home made goodness. Great quick service as well. My little kids loved the tacos as much as I did!
