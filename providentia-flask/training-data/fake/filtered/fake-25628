I've been to Birra quite a few times now with the wife and kids and I must say we had a great experience every time ! The waitress' are all very nice and extremely accommodating. My kid's get very restless in restaurants but not here because they bring out some pizza dough for them to play with.....Brilliant!! Now we(the adults) can enjoy our beer and food in peace! The food and beer selection were very good too! Great spot....we'll be back!
