The wait was 1.5 hours but the bar vibe was really good. Good selection of beers, but wine lacked flavor during dinner. I wanted the skirt steak but notice d that no one had ordered it while we waited. EVERYONE has a burger. The corn soup was the best I have had in Â a long time. Burger was very good which I had at medium. 2 floors of space. The worst thing about this place is that the bathroom temperature is like 100 degrees and soooooooooo small.
