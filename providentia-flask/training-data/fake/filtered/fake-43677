Probably one of my all time favorite spots in the neighborhood. The menu changes every couple months so there is something new usually every time you go. They have a nice sidewalk cafe which is great when the weather is good, but the inside is very cozy and very nice in the winter time. Other the fact that the food is great, one thing I really appreciate about this place is the fact that the service is really good, which is rare for restaurants like this. Typically when you go to places like this, there is a bit of pretentiousness that is to be expected, but Five Leaves does not have that, so you get everything; good food, decent price, and good service without the attitude. Always a good experience.
