My friend and I went to Supper the other night. He kept raving about how great and authenthic the food was so i decide to give it a shot. I have to be honest, when I first got there I wasn't impressed at all. The first room is really small and I was not happy to sit right next the kitchen. Then, my friend asked the waitress if we could sit in the back and she took us to this warm and cozy room. It completely chanded my impression of the restaurant. Not only was the food great but I was impressed by how quickly the food was served. This is definitely one of my favorite everyday place!
