The hype was better than the experience. We had a 7:45 reservation, did not order until 8:30, and when the entrees had hot arrived by 10:30, we asked for a check. When that arrived the entrees were still on the check. We sent the check back and it took 15 minutes to correct. The food was fine but we left hungry, and with no apology from management. When I arrived hone, I got a cancellation notice from Open Table where I had made the reservation, I assume that was so I couldn't post a review. These boys need to grow up. We probably won't be returning. There are too many great dining experiences in Philadelphia.
