I finally made it here a couple of weeks ago, when my husband and I were going out with a friend.  It was a Friday evening, around 7:30 p.m., and when we got there, there was only one table in use.  (By the time we left, the place was pretty busy!) We got a Kennett Square pizza to share.  I ordered the falafel burger, my husband got the eggplant parmesan, and the friend ordered a Miles Burger.   Everything was amazing.  The pizza is more like a flatbread style, but wow was it yummy.  All of us enjoyed our other choices, and I can tell you that you get a lot of food here for the price.  We could have easily been stuffed with the choices we'd made, without the pizza. I would recommend it.  The woman working there was really friendly, and it didn't take long for our food to arrive at all.
