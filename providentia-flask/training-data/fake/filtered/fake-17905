I had heard so much about this place - maybe my expectations were out of check.  And we waited for so long for a reservation.... Our waitress took our order and then we never saw her again - we had to ask the maitre'd for the check! The food was incredibly bland.  How can anyone mess up Spaghetti w/white clam sauce?!  I had to put so much cheese and hot pepper on it just to add some flavor. One good thing is the portion size.  If you don't care about the taste, but want lots of food this is your place!
