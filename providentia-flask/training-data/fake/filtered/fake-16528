This issue with the other posts are at best false.  Cafe Mulino cooks just as if your were in Italy, I know this because I visit family there yearly.  If you want over the top sauces and over seasoned foods go to Olive Garden or the local pizza shop that messes up Italian food.  Café Mulino has the right blend of seasons to complement the food not hide it.  Their portions are appropriate not over salted, peppered and "garliced", real Italian's do not use a lot of garlic this is an American myth.  What you get a Café Mulino is quality and service that doesn't push you out the door in 15 min.  The atmosphere is on a relaxing European timeframe that allows you to have a great meals and the ability to socialize with your loved one, family or friends without being rushed.  If you want fast, cheap, a lot of bad food go elsewhere.  If you want to feel like you're eating at a quality Italian Trattoria like in Italy, this is your place.
