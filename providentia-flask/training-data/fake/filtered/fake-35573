I've been saying for a while that the best burger I've had in Park Slope was at Press 195, but tonight, my girlfriend showed a online review claiming that Bonnie's Grill has the best burger in the area. So, we decided to go and check it out. The burger was definitely delicious and simple. I ordered it with lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, jalape√±os, and cheddar cheese, with a side of fries. The burger was good and juicy, if not gigantic. My only criticism is that there was too much bun, but otherwise it was great. The fries were good, but nothing special. Personally, Press 195 is still my favorite burger because of the better bun proportion, and the fries, but Bonnie's is still pretty great.
