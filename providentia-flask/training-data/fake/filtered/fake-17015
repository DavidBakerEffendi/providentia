I live about an hour away from this dump...thank goodness.  Our experience here was not as I expected it to be.  Don't listed to the people who always say PF Changs is the "place to be" because it's not.  I had to wait well over 2 hours and 45 minutes to get 3 seats at the bar on a Wedensday night.  The hostess was very rude, and when I asked when our table would be ready, she told..."either wait or leave"  The food, must I say, was EXTREMELY salty.  The portions were ok, but not to my liking.  I have also found out that no food is produced on the actual site, and is frozen and shipped. truly discusting.  I won't be returning
