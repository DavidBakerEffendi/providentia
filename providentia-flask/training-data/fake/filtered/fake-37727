I have dined in at Puerto Vallarta twice, and though the food was not spectacular (their rice is incredibly bland and dry), it was adequate. The reason for my 2 star review today is because I ordered dinner from the restaurant through the Silver Spoon Delivery service and received the wrong order. What I ordered was 2 of their chicken burritos (pollo asado). My receipt says burritos on it. But what I got were two trays of fixings for chicken fajitas and fajita wraps. Even if these trays were supposed to be burrito ingredients, they were completely different from the description of the Pollo Asado burritos that I ordered, so either way, they got my order wrong. This, paired with the fact that the delivery came an hour later than it should have, left me very dissatisfied with the food and service I received from Puerto Vallarta today.
