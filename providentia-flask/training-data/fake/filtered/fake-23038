Was in NYC for business, invited two friends for lunch.  Wasn't very impressed with the food.   Felt it was rather bland or tasteless.  Location was great, But value for the dollar wasn't.  I ordered the EggPlant and Pasta.  I did enjoy the Dessert.   The staff seemed  untrained.  Picked up food and removed food from the wrong sides.
