This place is great! One of my favorite breakfast spots in the area, especially if you want to avoid diners.  Pancakes are truly delicious here.  Always seems like a long wait when I get there (lots of people waiting) but the line goes quick.  Service can be a little better though; sometimes great... sometimes really unattentive.
