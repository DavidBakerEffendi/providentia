I was just recently in North Brunswick, NJ for a business trip from which i spent a total of 4 days in between our corporate location in Manhattan, NY and NJ.  I pretty much ate fine cuisine throughout my entire stay and i must say, out of all the 4-5 STAR establishments i had the pleasure of indulging in, Labebe restaurant was the most tasteful and outstanding in service with wonderful staff that makes an executive feel right at home!  I only wish this type of fine cuisine would make its way down south towards Charlotte, where i live.  Highly recommended and the pricing is very reasonable, hope you all get to enjoy!
