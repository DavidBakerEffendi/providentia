Hot damn! I finally made it down to Red Hook for a DeFonte's infamous sandwich and was not disappointed, even with all the hype. It's basically the best Italian deli style sandwich you've ever had, even if you were raised in North Jersey. I am a big fan of sandwiches with pickles and DeFonte's really knows how to pack them in-- the giardiniera is killer and saturates the bread with briny, salty, vinegary goodness. I ate half of my fried eggplant and mozzarella, then did a couple of laps around Ikea, skipped the meatballs and polished off the other half. Oh god, so good.
