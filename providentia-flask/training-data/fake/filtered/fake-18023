We love MOB, a restaurant  serving healthful food without compromising on taste, or on ambiance - this place is fun-ky.  The prices are reasonable, the servers are so friendly and nice, and we are all about the local/organic bit (but this is Brooklyn, so - DUH).  We were regulars as soon as we walked in, and we bet you will be, too.  See you at MOB!
