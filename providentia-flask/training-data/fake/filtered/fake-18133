This place is an absolute 10! The ambience, decor and of course the food!   Absolutely, my favorite place in town!  My favorites are the crispy clamari salad, chilean sea bass with wasabi mashed potatoes and the chocolate pogoda dessert. Their cocktail drink selection is unique and different.  This restaurant is definitely a treat; I have been there about 5 or 6 times and was never dissappointed. Highly recommend it!
