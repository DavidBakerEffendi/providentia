So many great things to say about this place, I don't even know where to begin.  I had the steak with chimichurri and yucca fries.  It was incredible.  My date had the snapper wrapped in this plantain shell and it tasted amazing.  Spanish Harlem sangria is great.  We're definitely going back to try the sangria bar.  Loved the donuts for dessert and the coffee in the french press pot.  Don't really have any complaints.  Maybe a little pricey but given the reputation it has and the quality of the food, it's worth it every once in awhile.  And I imagine brunch is a much better deal for the price.
