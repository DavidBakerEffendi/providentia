Well, their new "thing" is that they "can only split tender between two credit cards". The wait staff blamed it on their "manager" and the fact that the credit card companies charge money for every transaction. I was in the restaurant with a group of 5 people-- all trying to pay with cards...needless to say, this new "rule" caused a lot of drama when it came time to pay. It is frustrating that a group of people spending well over $100 had to be inconvenienced in this way. And the worst part is, the staff acted like it was OUR problem. It's 2012...get over it...credit cards are pretty common. The truth is-- people are likely to revisit a restaurant with bad food and good service, but most people will never return to a restaurant with such utter disregard for convenience, respect, and just plain good business practice.
