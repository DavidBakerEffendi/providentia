This place is always packed, but if you can go during an off-time it is fantastic.  In Italy you can just buy some dry pasta and some sauce, take it home, boil the pasta, heat the sauce, and it is shockingly delicious simply because of the amazing ingredients.  Eataly allows for the same sort of experience in the US. I think that is important to note.  Great imported foods, and fresh delicious ingredients as well.  I get the fresh pasta to take home once a week.  You don't want to do all of your grocery shopping here because of the cost, but for a few nice ingredients to spruce up a meal, this is your place. I have eaten at the "vegetable restaurant" inside, and it was delicious.  I mean, really really wonderful.  I split three dishes with a friend and they were fresh, complex in flavor, and meat-free.  There are various restaurants inside, all look divine.  But again, go at a strange time if possible - like lunch at 11:30am, or dinner at 5pm.  It's just insanely crowded during prime-time. I think Eataly lives up to the high standards of Batali's other ventures, but yes, it is crowded and a bit of a free-for-all.  I still think it's worth a visit (or ten) though!
