My friends and I went to the Yuca Bar on Saturday evening.  There is NO MORE happy hour on the weekends- but it is on their website.  The waiter said we should have checked first (I thought going to the website was checking...what do I know...) The food was blah.  The drinks were blah.  We were charged for a lobster quesadilla when in fact we ordered and received the mushroom.  The mamager said we were lying and hoped none of us were alergic to seafood.  Which I am glad none of us were because then WE WOULD BE DEAD! The mamager talked back to me and my friends.  Um.....dont do that.  I do not want anyone else to ever have such a bad experience as I did.  I am going to tell everyone one of my friends what and awful place this is.
