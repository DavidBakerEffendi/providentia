For those who are health conscience, please be careful eating food from this restaurant. When one orders SHRIMP IN LOBSTER sauce, one expects shrimp and lobster. Watchung Restaurant Cinese PUTS PORK in this dish. Is pork the substitute for lobster? This is a dangerous situation for those allergic, for those who do not eat red meat or for those whose religion forbids to eat filthy pork The ingredients of the dishes are NOT listed in the menu. When we called to question mysterious chunks in LOBSTER SAUCE we were told by the restaurant's personnel that EVERY CHINESE PERSON knows that this dish has pork in it. Well, wake up: WE ARE IN MONTCLAIR, NJ, USA Â not in CHINA.
