My wife and I have eaten her countless times. We used to order several times a week, but since they opened their second location in Gowanus, the owner has disappeared and there's been a marked decline in the quality, quantity, and service. It's worth trying once, o. We strongly suggest dining in vs. taking out. Not because it's a wonderful dining experience, but because the food doesn't travel well and they tend to be really stingy or get things wrong on to-go orders. Makes sense when you consider this is food truck cuisine, meant to be consumed immediately. Favorites: falafel, chicken soup, pizza, pulled chicken tostada. Nachos look good too. Just be aware that the spicy is really spicy! Sadly, we crossed this off our go-to list for the reasons mentioned above.
