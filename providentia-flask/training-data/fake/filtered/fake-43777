Definitely a good spot for a nice atmosphere, diverse and delicious tapas selections, and great sangria.  I like this spot because it's more overall european/mediterranean tapas instead of strictly spanish like some places.  The food was excellent.  The brussels sprouts side was even more wonderful than the enthusiastic waiter suggested.  We had a great duck breast dish with a foie gras mousse that was perfectly prepared and delicious with the duck breast wrapped around scallion (like a negimaki at a japanese place) and a big artistic smear of the mousse  on the plate... very nice.  Also a sea scallop dish with caviar, artichoke puree and a lemon beurre blanc was beautifully prepared and perfectly cooked.  Prices were reasonable, and so was the wine list.  Will definitely go back, but FYI they are cash or AMEX only.  Good date place, very romantic with lots of candles and cozy atmosphere.
