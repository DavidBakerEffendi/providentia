Ever had a Guinness shake before? Yeah, me either till I came here. Just as one would expect from the perfect marriage of milkshake and Guinness....pure awesomeness! Accompanied the shake with bacon sliders AND fries, my eyes were bigger than my stomach. They really give you a lot of food for the price.
