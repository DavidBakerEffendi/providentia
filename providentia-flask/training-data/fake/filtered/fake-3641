This was the best dinner I've had in a very long time. We wandered in here by complete chance on a cold Saturday night. Although we should have made a reservation (it was really packed), we were invited to eat at the bar which served us well for a cozy impromptu date. Illuminated by warm candle light with oldies ringing in smiles all around, it was a delightful reprieve from the winter cold. As a gluten free diner, it feels like a true privilege to walk into a restaurant and feel invited -- they would mix and match anything I'd like! Between the winter greens, warm lamb and romaine salad, and New England Hake (all slightly modified so I could enjoy), we truly had a perfect meal. Dessert was a treat! Go for the special whatever it is. I have full faith in their creativity. Hats off to Buttermilk Channel for superior and friendly service (smiles and pleasant conversation go a long way). Delicious cocktails to top it off. Thank you.
