Over priced and terrible food. I've lived in New York all of my life, and I've eaten food from all around the city. This food is way too overpriced, and it's nothing amazing or even delicious. It's not worth the price. There are cheaper and more delicious places in the city. Mamouns falafel is better, especially for the price. Taim means delicious in Hebrew, and the food is the farthest thing from it. Leave the Arab food to the Arabs.
