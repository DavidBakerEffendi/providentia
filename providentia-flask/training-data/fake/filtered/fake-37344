Wow! Great service and even better food! So glad that I found this gem in Northern Liberities and grateful to the owner and staff that took such great care of us. What a great change in the usual brunch fare. Parking was not a problem for us since it was a Sunday during the holiday weekend. The portions are large and filling. This restaurant is not big but it is well worth the wait if you want to try something different. We will definitely return to this cafe'
