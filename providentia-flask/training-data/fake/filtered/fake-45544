Went for dinner last week with family.  Was very disappointed with the food.  Bread was terrible, shrimp was tough, pasta was just ok.  Server tries to push extra food and owner was very rude, asked us to hurry because he needed table. Chicken was best part of meal as were the clams     I guess spending  $325 without a tip was not good enough.  Been to many better restaurants  and would not go out of my way for this place
