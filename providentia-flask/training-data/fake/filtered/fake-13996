I really like Frankford hall.  It's really beautiful and rustic, the backyard in the winter had fire pits and heat lamps.  It feels so outdoorsy and manly.  Obviously they have tonnnnns of beer.  I've been to Oktoberfest in Germany and I have to say their beer and food is spot on.  I like that they provide Jenga at the tables inside, and there's multiple areas to sit, depending how loud you want to be.  3 separate bars and the service is good.  The pretzels are amazing and I've liked every beer I've had here.   A little more expensive than I spend on a typical night, but it's really good beer.  This isn't the place for PBR and french fries.  It's a really nice mellow place to have a group of friends hang out.  I've been several times and I'm sure I'll be back!
