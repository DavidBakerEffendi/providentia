The only word to describe Salute would be wonderful.  I took my wife and 4 other members of my family there to celebrate her 30th birthday party.  They were very accommodating and put us in a private room in back.  We all enjoyed the privacy the room had to offer.  Unfortunately two of the family members were going to be 45 mins late due to a miscommunication and the dining room manager convey very professionally how the room needed to be free by a specific time because there was a party of twenty that was going to use it and would we mind being moved to a different area of the restaurant, we completely understood.  If all of our party was there on time there was ample time allotted for  dinner in the private room.  Our sever was wonderful, she kept the drinks full and was very easy to talk to.  We finished dinner just in time for the party of 20 to sit down.  The dining room manager gave us biscotti to take home with us, we thought that was very kind of him.  I look forward to going back and will let everyone know how great of the restaurant is.  BTW the food was delightful and every bite was delicious!!!!!
