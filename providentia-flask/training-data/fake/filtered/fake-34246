Sushi Yasuda is a temple of fish. THe place is immaculate and the fish is fresh and the service and execution is impeccable. I would give them 5 stars except on a recent visit, on a date with my boyfriend for his birthday, the sushi chefs took off their aprons, packed up the sushi bar and started scrubbing and cleaning while people were still dining. Keep in mind, this was only at around 10 PM on a Friday night! I certainly would NOT book after 8 PM for this reason. THe last customer of the day deserves the same uniform quality of experience as the first, especially at those prices!
