5 Stars for the avocado toast. 3 stars for the rest - over the years the cous cous (their other specialty) has been dryer and dryer - with reheated chicken. Don't like that. I've had everything on the menu at least 5x and the only thing I've never been disappointed with is the avocado toast. Love the vibe, love the location, love the kinda bitchy hostesses.
