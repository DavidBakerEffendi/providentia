Easily the best bar in New Haven. Cocktails are uniformly exquisite, and though some of them are quite pricey, the pricier ones--for instance the delicious gin-based Chantme ($14)--tend to pack Â two drinks' worth of a punch while remaining balanced, subtle, and surprising. The oysters are great, and at half price (about a dollar forty) every day before seven, actually quite affordable. (Compare that, for instance, to the oysters at Union League--also excellent, but 3 bucks a pop). The much-maligned because allegedly overpriced cheeseburger slider is made, frankly, of the best ground beef I've ever had, though of course it'd be nice if it were larger. The vegan terrine is as delicious as it is beautiful--a bright varicolored collage of pureed beat, spinach, and carrot, held together by what I believe is a base of ground nuts. And the djs actually play good music. My one complaint is that the larger tapas, from which one can make a meal, change too rarely--I'd love to see new dishes a bit more often.
