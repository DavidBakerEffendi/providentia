I loved Ai Fiori.  Chris Jaeckle does an amazing job as the chef here.  The lobster appetizer with black truffle was fabulous.  We had a pasta appetizer that was delightful.  The lobster dinner was sweet and delicate.  The filet was outstanding.  This is one of Michael White's best yet.  Outstanding!!! Don't miss it!   The service was flawless.
