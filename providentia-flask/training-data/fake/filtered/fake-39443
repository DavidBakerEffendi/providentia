This place is very much a family favorite!  Whenever the siblings are in Vermont for a visit we make sure to go here with our parents.  I live in Minnesota, where Vietnamese food is extremely authentic and plentiful, and the food here lives up to that standard.  Spring Rolls are great, as is the Pho.  However, their real specialty is Vermicelli Salad.  Get any of those and you will not be disappointed!  My only complaint is that the food can come out of the kitchen at variable times within a party, but that doesn't detract from its taste. Besides, docking points for such things seems a bit entitled when delicious food is this affordable. Additionally, this part of Burlington is very cool, and there's an interesting bike shop across the street and a great coffee shop a few blocks south!
