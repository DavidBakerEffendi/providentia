they are ok, ''not really authentic italian''.    the lasagna is horrible, they fill it up with so much mozzarella cheese and ricotta cheese u cant even eat it, barely any meat. where is the lasagna..... i run a big company near by, and we always call with big orders. they are on time with delivery, but too expensive, and food is not that great. me not being italian, i can make a mean lasagna. but everything bescide's the pizza is ok.. all my guys love food, but when we get something that is half assed, then we try something new... i give it  2 stars , experienced better.
