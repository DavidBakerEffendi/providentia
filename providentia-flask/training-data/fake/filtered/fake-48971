I have been to three other smash burgers this one is the worse and does not tastes or have customer service poor. I had to send my order back three times cause one the mangers did not care about how I liked my food. So sad good place but nothing like the rest . Not mention dirty any manager who cares about his customers would clean up trash on tables a real manger would clean tables especial with no where for customers to sit .
