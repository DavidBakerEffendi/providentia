I doubt this place needs anymore reviews, but here goes... I first tried Cafeteria within days of moving to NYC, I was looking for someplace to eat after a run to Bed Bath & Beyond down the street, and given the Yelp reviews and the crowd inside this place it seemed like the best option. I ordered the waffles and the blackberry lemonade, the waffles weren't very memorable (not really bad, but not good enough to stand out), but I still get cravings for their lemonade at the oddest times. Returned here a few months later with a friend and it was about the same. I had three eggs any style with the typical breakfast sides and it was good, but didn't really wow me. Sure, it's loud, crowded, and the food isn't perfect, but what really makes this place four stars instead of three is the fact that it's pretty cheap given the type of crowd it attracts (the first time I went Danny DeVito was sitting in a booth in the corner, the second I was lunched in between two tables of fashion industry types) and it's open twenty-four hours! What's not to love?
