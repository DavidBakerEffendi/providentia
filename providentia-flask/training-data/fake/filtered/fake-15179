This restaurant is just awesome.  From the high quality delicious menu to the amazing staff (including their chef who cares so much and is passionate about what she does!), I can't say enough.  Every time I come it's just a pleasant experience and I would highly recommend to anyone.  It's not often you come across a restaurant that cares so much about the integrity of the food they put into the menu!  Great prices, great happy hour...what more do you want for some incredible aussie food?  One of my favorite spots in Astoria:).
