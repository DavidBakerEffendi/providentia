This is the best sushi restaurant I've been to in New Jersey (and I've been to many) Despite the unassuming exterior and that it literally looks like a hole in the wall, once you step inside, you are treated to excellent sushi that you don't have to drive or take a train into Manhattan for. There is free miso soup and salad with each meal.  The miso soup is very good and you can get seconds. The fish is very fresh.  In particular, the yellowtail and salmon have consistently been good.  They also have specials occasionally like the fatty tuna or the bluefin tuna. They have very good special rolls as well.  I especially like their Kim's Special roll which has several different chopped fish on top of a roll. Finally, the service is excellent.  They often give you a special roll or sushi on the house - the seared tuna that was only recently added to the menu is a treat. I've been here 10+ times since I've moved to West Orange, and will keep going back!
