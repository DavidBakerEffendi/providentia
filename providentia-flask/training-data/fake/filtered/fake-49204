Good place for drinks, good food, bartenders, Ashley, Michelle, Kasia and Josh will definitely take care of ya! Busy as hell Saturday nights they have a DJ. New manager is kinda wierd and makes you feel uncomfortable. They are building a new addition right now but will be nice when done. Asian food but also have alot of American food on the menu.
