I love the place. To avoid the long wait, I usually come here for lunch. My favorite dish is the pork bun.  I have tried various ramen dish here, all are excellent.  The service is friendly, genuine and fast. The restaurant is always buzzing.  A little on the loud side, but I don't mind.  I will definitely continue to visit here, again and again.
