BORING DISHES- UNSUITABLE FOR VEGETARIANS.  Even though I live around the corner from Market Table I do not intend to go back there for a second time. The dishes were boring and loveless. food was stockpiled on plates and ingredients on the menu almost made us walk out again  (how many more beet root salads do you want me to eat?).The desert, some sort of chocolate mouse was not bad, but does definitely not make it worth going there.
