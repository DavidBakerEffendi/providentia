Tasty ramen, very friendly people--all the waitresses and the kitchen staff wished us a good night as we were leaving.  I had the Tonkatsu ramen, which was rich and flavorful, with a huge piece of lovely, tender pork, noodles of course, pickled ginger, and scallions.  I also appreciate that it is vegetarian-friendly (they have vegetarian ramen, and some other veg sides/ mains).  The prices seemed reasonable ($8-15 depending on what ramen you get), and I would be happy to go back.
