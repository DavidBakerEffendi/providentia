I've eaten all over New York city, and Rubirosa is my favorite restaurant. From the appetizers (unreal rice balls) to the pizza (best pepperoni in the world), I've never seen this place have a misstep. You'll want to save room for dessert too. One time three of my friends and I split four appetizers and everything we tried was absolutely unreal. The place has it all. Cool digs and friendly staff too. Definitely, definitely check this place out.
