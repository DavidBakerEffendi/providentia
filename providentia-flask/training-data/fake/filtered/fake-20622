The pizza and the pizza makers. It is awesome to see the relationships Scott has cultivated with the owners. I enjoyed trying the different kinds of pizza and comparing notes with the other tourist It was interesting to see what pizzas New Yorkers on the tour liked vs others from different parts of the country. completely different styles of pizza and talking all about pizza from how to make it, ingredients, history, where to go and anything else you can think about pizza. scott has the perfect amount of energy, pragmatism and pizza knowledge to make this tour exceptionally great. Â would recommend this tour to anyone.
