Tucked into some serviceable pulpo here late one recent night. I enjoyed the grapefruit and fennel accessories with the 'pus, and its $13 price tag doesn't give one much leverage to complain about the modest portion. Stars of the night, however, were definitely the patatas bravas, which came slathered in a rich, smoky (pimenton?) sauce, just traditional enough, and the sweet corn, which definitely did have pimenton. Put pimenton on raisin bran and I'll ride. One problem: the wine list completely negates the supposed affordability of this "heavy tapas" Batali-affiliated Irving Placer. Instead of wines by the glass the place offers wines by the glass-and-a-half, which means no tippling for less than $15-or-so bucks. I'd happily pay $9 for a few ounces of txakoli, the rare Basque pseudo-fizzer, or even $40 for a bottle if splitting with a fellow alcoholic. But please, get rid of those ridiculous little carafe things. I was wavering between three and four stars but then I remembered that our waitress actually did us the favor of stomping a huge disgusting bug that my freaking-out friend noticed crawling on the glass OUTSIDE the restaurant.
