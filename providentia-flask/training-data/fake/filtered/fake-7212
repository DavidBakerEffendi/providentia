My special lady and I went here for our anniversary dinner. We made reservations. Once we arrived we were swiftly lead through the dining room and bar, past a few open 2-tops, down a flight of stairs into -you guessed it- the basement. Greeted by a faint smell of bleach and the closeness of our booth counterparts Â (literally almost sitting at the same table) we took our seats on the back wall directly on the other side of the men's restroom; appetizing to say the least. The service was great, the food was very good, but the vibe was quite odd. As the customers came and went from the bowels of Tinto we noticed a trend, most of the cellar dwellers seemed to be slightly less fabulous than the bourgeoise on the upper decks. We couldn't help but feel a bit profiled. If you plan on going to Tinto I suggest you bust out the Prada slacks and the gold tipped cane or face the possibility of being the steerage SEATED IN THE BASEMENT!
