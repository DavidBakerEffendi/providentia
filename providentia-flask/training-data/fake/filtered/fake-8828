The service here is a joke. My fiance and i like supporting local business,but the pizza stone pushed me past my breaking point with poor service. Our waitress slammed drinks down, and acted like we were a total inconvenience. On another occasion we ordered wings,and after asking several times for our wings, the waitress looked at us like we were crazy. Our pizza came out,and when we inquired about our wings she said 'you still want those?' We were also told that last call was at 9, when there was a band playing that we drove 20 minutes to see. Their door sign and website said they were open until 11 or12. My best advice? Pass on the pizza stone. We certainly will never return!
