This was our first and for sure the last take out at this restaurant ( Paradise ) we were appalled by the food served. The food had a piece of meat in Chilli Paneer, our constant reminder to the person taking the order over the phone didn't help either. The person taking the order on the phone had no customer service skills, we were put on hold four times while being dropped from the call once. In a casual discussion about this issue among our friends we learnt that one family had experienced the same problem when they ordered the Vegetable Biryani. I seriously wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. I am going ahead and filing a complaint with NJ Office of Consumer Protection immediately after posting this review. Can't tolerate NON-SENSE.
