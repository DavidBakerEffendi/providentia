The food here was very good. I went with a large group of friends and found the staff very accommodating. The place seemed pretty busy when we got there, but the waiters were all very attentive and friendly. The food was authentic, and I would highly recommend trying the Beijing duck and the various soups they offer. A great experience overall and I'll definitely be going back.
