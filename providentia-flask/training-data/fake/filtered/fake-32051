Food was okay but over rated.  Good steak but very fishy lobster.  We were having a great time and had a huge tab.  However, not even 5 minutes after we paid, (generous tip too) we were asked to leave our table and go to the bar because they needed to clear out the table.  (10pm? with no lines and other tables open?)  I was very upset and spoke with the owner on the way out.  Unfortunately, he could care less and I am sure he was the one that told the waiter to get us packed up and shipped out.  Our total stay was only about an hour and a half so it wasn't like we were just hanging around.  We had 4 appetizers, 4 main courses, 4 deserts, 2 bottles of wine, and cocktails.  I will never return and the end result completely ruined my night.  My guess is that greed has gotten the best of this place and the owner.  Over rated and Sysco quality food.
