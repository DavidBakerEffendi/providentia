I love coming to Maialino, whether it's for Sunday brunch or a late night date at the back tables the staff are always responsive to the mood and the only time the food has disappointed me is when they take something I really liked off the menu (*ahem*, Olive Cake!) - then again, what they replace it with always makes this restaurant a venue I want to come back to regularly!
