I have definitely experienced better. We went to check this place out because it had a michelin star. It is very tight inside. The tables feel on top of each other. The waiter poured by husband a 1/3 of glass of wine instead of a full glass of wine. It is somewhat overpriced for what it is. Alta is better.
