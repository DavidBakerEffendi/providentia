I never really noticed this place existed since last night. On my way home from my daughters house, I stopped in with my husband and for a place that in my opinion hasn't had much exposure, it is doing pretty well. We were surprised by the large menu it had and the prices are good. We both ate sautee specials and I must say i found them quite delicious. The server was also very attentive and maintained a smile . I'm very happy that this diner is in our area because we truly needed something else besides another pizza place. Keep up the good work JD!
