Met two friends for dinner and drinks, tried a flight of beers to sample a few of the many choices, staff was helpful and fun. Expected good beer and was not dissapointed. Was surprised at quality of food, incredible bread basket, awesome mussels, everything we tried was top notch. Will return and try some of the other things on the very interesting menu.
