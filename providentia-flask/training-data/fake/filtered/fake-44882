Hostess was a little scatterbrained, but waitress and host had full knowledge of the menu. I was in a seafood kinda mood, so I sampled their oysters first. AMAZING. They had an amazing oxtail pasta. Â They also have great shots (try the chocolate martini shot instead of dessert. Seriously). I went with a friend, which I thought was perfect. We didn't get to sit in the back, but I think I'd feel the same either way-- not a place for people to get to know each other. Good for going out with coworkers, friends, or family. Menu changes every month, and a lot of the food is organic. Be forewarned-- no full bar (wine and ricewines) but the waitstaff is equipped to help you find the perfect accompanying drink for your meal. Two thumbs up.
