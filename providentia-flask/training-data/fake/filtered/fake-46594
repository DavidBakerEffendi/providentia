They got it right here.  The food, service and atmosphere.  Sure I'm a sucker for feeling like I found a speakeasy and the way into this place sure does make you feel like you've taken a time machine to get there...  But the food is fantastic and people are so nice.  The service was perfect.  Really nice night.  Go, go, go.  Worth every penny.
