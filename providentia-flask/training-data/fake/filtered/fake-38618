I dont know  what the two people  below me are talking about! The Shannon Rose is one of the greatest  restaurants I  have  ever been to! I had  the greatest experience. The staff was so friendly and helpful!  I  dont think I have ever met  a more  amazing  restaurant staff. The food was absolutely delicious! Their Chicken  Ranch Sliders are  so tasty!  The inside is absolutely beautiful! And although it may sometimes be a  little dim and you  may not be able  to  hear a  pin drop, it  was an amazing restaurant!  It is an irish pub after all! There is always  something going on that caters to  every crowd. Mondays they have beer  specials; tuesdays  they  have a trivia  game; wednesday and fridays they have a  great dj;  thursdays  they have bands and ladies  night!! my favorite! half price drinks! they  also  have a band  saturdays. then sundays they have great traditional irish music.-they gave us a calandar with all  these events on  it. I cant  say enough about  it! You  have to check it  out  for yourselves. And  you  wont be disappointed!
