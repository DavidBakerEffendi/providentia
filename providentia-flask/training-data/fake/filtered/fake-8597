It's a cute place.  I live very close so I used to come here a lot to meet friends and have a nice early morning meal. Then I learned more about the French cuisine.   The food is perfectly good but I value a good croissant & a French baguette above all else.  So, if you want really good French food travel into town for Metropolitan Bakery or Meil Patisserie. Otherwise enjoy!
