What a hidden gem! It's located right next to the famous Grimaldi's but what most people don't know is that this place is owned by Patsy Grimaldi. Thus, you can skip the long lines at Grimaldi's and come here. I went on a Sunday at 6 pm and there was no wait, unlike Grimaldi's which had about 30 people lined up on the sidewalk. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. We ordered the margherita pizza and it was DELICIOUS. Although they should technically be the same, I enjoyed it a lot better than when I ate at Grimaldi's, which is still good also.
