Came in on a Saturday night with a hockey team and to our surprise they had the whole front dining room dedicated to us...this was awesome because we came in with 30 ppl or so and definitely needed the space.  now the food was great I had the shrimp scampi recommended by our server sebastian and it was delicioussss.  It was pretty hectic and some food came out a bit late but this was understandable with such a big party.  Thanks nolita!
