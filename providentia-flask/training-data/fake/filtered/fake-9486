I have come here several times already. I love love looooove their chicken ceasar salad crepes and their dulce de leche everything! But that's about all I eat whenever I go, with a variety of other desserts to satisfy my sweet tooth. The environment is just awesome. It's very chill and well designed. Even their bathrooms are clean and beautiful haha. I was really impressed when I first walked in. s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com… s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com…
