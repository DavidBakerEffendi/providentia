I went back to Atera a couple of Fridays ago and had another amazing time.   I completely agree with previous reviewers that the friendly staff really make the experience.  There is a significant problem at NYC fine dining restaurants with staff and chef (even at some venerable counter-seating fine dining establishments where chefs are right in front of customers) rude/cold/annoyed/nasty/hostile behavior.  This shocks me.  A restaurant is not a food temple. I am coming to eat dinner, not to pay homage at the altar of anyone's ego.  Thankfully, I cannot say enough nice things about the staff and the chefs at Atera.       I estimate that more than half of what I had this time was different than the last time I visited in March (both new dishes and "old" dishes with new components).  This is impressive.  Of the new items, I especially liked the "lobster roll," the halibut with whey and chamomile, the pork with wheatberries, the frozen strawberry shortcake, the ice cream sandwich, and a cold crab and crab/shrimp/lobster? gelee dish.  I also really enjoyed the butter which was house made and flavored with Winnimere cheese.   I did not like the squid "noodles."  I imagine that if I liked squid in noodle form, this would have been great, but I don't, so it wasn't.  The broth was nice.         Just a couple of brief comments: 1. The milk punch cocktail that I had for the "snacks" portion of the meal was great.  I would love more cocktails incorporated into the beverage pairing.   2.  I opted to have the additional cheese course: the apple bread was fresh and flavorful, but I am used to a more composed cheese course.  That being said, the selection was well chosen.       Parting thought - lots of things were even "better" than my first visit.  The foie gras "peanut" was soft and spreadable, not rock hard, etc.  I can tell this is a team that cares about getting a little bit better every day. I appreciate that ethos.
