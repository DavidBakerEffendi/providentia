Loud and a bit chaotic, with energetic vibe & mostly fun music.  The owners & staff were so nice.  We went for "no utensils" night  - SOO much food, all pretty tasty and we all ate way too much.   We were with someone who grew up in Manila and said the food was authentic. i was also impressed with their Jeepney's ingenuity for bringing Kamayan night - advance reservations for specific items, no dishes to wash, more biz & bookings.   the table is covered in banana leaves which are in turn covered with heaping mounds of rice and food, and all are just wrapped up and neatly tossed when you finish.
