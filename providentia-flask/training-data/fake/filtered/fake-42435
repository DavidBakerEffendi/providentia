If this is the place I think it is (I don't know who that is in the picture but uhh..), then this place is crazy good.  Chicken and waffles.  I'll say it again, slowly, chicken, waffles.  That's hot sauce, and syrup.  You have to get there early on weekends or they run out of waffles.  Then it turns into a chicken and pancakes restaurant.  Imagine that?
