Their brunch is phenomenal.  The brunch menu is extensive, delicious, and rather effective as a quick hangover cure...which is convenient because that opens up the opportunity for a bloody mary, which they also have a knack for doing well. That said, I'm not terribly big on the nightlife there.  Being in my 20's I'll even admit that their music can get too darn loud.  But if you can withstand that, don't let my comment stop you from going at night too.
