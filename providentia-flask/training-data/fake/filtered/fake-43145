Veal Parmigiana was good, but the ziti was room temperature, as though it had been run under hot water to reheat?  Wait staff was yelling back and forth to each other, felt like I was at a High School football game.  House dressing was oil for dipping, or so it seemed.  Canoli was ONLY filled on either end, 2 inches of the middle - no ricotta!.  Coffee not great, had to ask 2 times for cream for our coffee.  Our bill came to almost $70 and we left knowing that we would never return.  Very disappointing.  We had a coupon from Restaurant.com and were looking for a nice night out.
