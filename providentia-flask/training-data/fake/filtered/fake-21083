I have been dining at Chengdu 46 for over twenty years.  Last week I dined there and there is a new chef. Unfortunately the food was not very good and was like very expensive take-out Chinese food.  I am so disappointed since this was my absolute favorite Chinese restaurant in the NJ/NYC area.  I hope they bring back their chef.
