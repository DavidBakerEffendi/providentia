This is a great place for delicious, inexpensive, fresh lunch. I love going here when I need a quick sandwich, quiche or soup. The guys behind the counter probably have the best customer service of any lunch spot in Princeton and the food is consistently good. The only thing I'd add are more salad options (spinach, mixed greens, etc), but otherwise this place gets a BIG thumbs up!
