A group of us visiting Hartford for a conference had dinner at this place for the first time and again for lunch, which was recommended to us by several local residents.  We are glad we followed their recommendation.  They have an impressive menu with a variety of appealing and unique cuisine.  The weather was great, so we opted to sit outside, which has a great location.  Our server was named Sean, who was friendly, knowledgeable of all the menu items, attentive to our table and others, and overall ensured that we had the best possible time while we were there dining and conversing.  He also was helpful in providing information about the local area, including other types of venues to visit.  The service was prompt, the prices were reasonable, the food was delicious, and the ambiance was excellent.  Near the end, a couple came and sat at one of the outside tables and subsequently left, apparently since they were not "getting service".  The problem was that you cannot just seat yourself at a table outside and expect to get service; indeed, there are clear signs posted letting folks know that they need to go indoors first to be seated.  Moreover, by that time, Sean had already been closed out and not serving any more tables.  Despite their comments, he was still very polite to them.
