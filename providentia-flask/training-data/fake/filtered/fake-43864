Best place! Waitress was so nice to us on Friday night. Food was great and they make you feel like you have been going there for years. Food was hot and so good. Portions are so big we have left overs for tomorrow :) I really love going here. You will too. It was just really nice to feel like they know you. Most places don't do that anymore. Prices were great for what we got. It was just overall good. Make sure you get the girl waiter ha she was just very sweet
