Had a great dinner there tonight.  I had poached egg & frisée salad - was perfect.  Another reviewer complained she didn't know how to mop up the egg yolk - I just used the delicious bread that was served.  My wife had the goat cheese & potatoe starter.  Good - but maybe a bit too much goat cheese & not enough beets.  Pork chop was fantastic - outstanding flavor and perfectly cooked - one of the best I had in a long time.  My wife had the chicken and she really liked it. Apple bread pudding With home made vanilla ice cream for desert was perfect ending.   And the price for the quality of food was very, very reasonable.  I can highly recommend this place.  I'll be back.
