Went to Brooklyn for the first time recently and Yelp helped me find this amazing restaurant....Wish there was a place like this within 100 miles of DFW! Had the Polish Platter and it was both delicious and quite the value. I went there looking forward to the pierogies and discovered the galabki and bigos. The galabki was similar to the galumpkis (stuffed cabbage) my father made when we were kids but I found that a bite of them combined with a bite of the bigos (Hunters stew) tasted nearly identical to that favorite of my youth. (I'm making bigos in the crock-pot ASAP!) Perhaps my DNA reacted to the food or maybe it was just the combination of great friends, food and decor that did it but I was very pleased. My father (the Polish hunter) would have been in heaven as soon as he hit the door and saw the garland strung from stuffed and mounted deer head to deer head. ...Na Zdrowie (cheers), to Lomzynianka Restaurant!
