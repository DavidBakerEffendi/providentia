I am applaud by the reviews that I'm am seeing. The bis is a bar with great staff and great food that is very reasonable, I go there often and I always have a great time. The service is good, sometimes shit happens and you deal, you have a couple of beers and enjoy your company when did everybody become so friggen uptight......
