I Was disappointed in this place due to the service we had. Our server was the worst and unattentive. I can tolerate a lot but being slow for no reason is not cool. The food was great but on an a late weekday night when not a lot of customers are in, it shouldnt take 45 mins for nachos. She was a short girl with blonde almost white short hair. One of hair friends came in and she was talking to them....for a while. I am gonna give this place another shot because those nachos were really awesome but i dont want her as a server! The bartender was awesome, brunette heavy set woman with tattoos. A little over priced but beer was good too.
