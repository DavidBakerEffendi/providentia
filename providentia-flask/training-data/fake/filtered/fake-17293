i know the place is called burrito box but i always get a quesadilla or tacos, and they always hit the spot! it's pretty tiny and can sometimes get crowded, but that adds to its charm. the complimentary chips are nice while you wait for your food, which never takes too long. they give you lots of dips and extra chips, which is a nice extra snack. if you got a hankerin for some filling mexican food it doesn't get much better than this.
