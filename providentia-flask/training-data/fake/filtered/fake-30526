Recently, my husband and I were looking for something other than pizza to get delivered in South Philly.  He remembered the Amalia's menu that had been left at our house a few weeks earlier, and we decided to give them a try. They are only a couple of blocks away, so we went to pick it up. We each ordered a platter - I got falafel and he got the beef kabobs.  They both came with tzatziki sauce and sides of yummy pickles and olives. We also ordered a dish of pita with hummus, and a lemon/mint fresh juice.  All of the food was absolutely delicious and plentiful. I ended up splitting mine into two meals.  And the fresh juice - delicious! I only tried the lemon mint so far, but it was perfectly refreshing on a hot summer night.   I really appreciate the prices at this restaurant.  Other Middle Eastern restaurants in the city generally have affordable pita sandwiches, but charge double to have, basically the same thing but served over rice as a platter, because pitas are for lunch and platters are for dinner (and therefore ok to charge more?).  Amalia's prices are absolutely fair no matter what you order off their menu. Everyone working there was very friendly. I'm planning on getting more take-out to bring for lunch at work, but hope to make the time soon to actually dine in.
