These classy guys make some classy pizza. This had already been a staple of our Sunday nights when we swung by to pick up our contribution to a friend's "pizza party:" a feast-cum-battle royal tasting of local pizzerias. We turned up at the restaurant a bit later than we let them know we would do (our bad), and the guys behind the counter would not let us walk away with a less-than-piping-hot pie. They sent us off with a brand new pizza. At the party, all of the big movers and shakers of the New Haven pizza world were there - Modern, Pepe's, Sally's, Bar - along with lesser-known but genuinely tasty offerings. The judgment was more or less unanimous. Go Da Legna! Thanks to you, glory was ours for the night. Go for the deliciousness, stay for the stand-up service.
