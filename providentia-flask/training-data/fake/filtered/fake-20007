Food, service and ambiance  is consistently great, and I go there since 2007. Wasn't disappointed even once. Duck breast I had last time  was the best I ever had and dressings their chefs make work wonders on simple salads. their chocolate desserts are always heart stoppers, sometimes I go with friends there just for desserts, impossible not to crave them!
