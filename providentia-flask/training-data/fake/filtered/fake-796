I am partial to these types of places. I love diners and diner like places. First off yes there is a line......moves quick and you get served food while your in line! While waiting they gave us an orange slice, a piece of sausage, a cup of coffee, and a sugar cookie. They squezzed some lemon on the sausage and it was very good. Down to business I had the sweet potato pancakes and pork sausage. Never had sweet potato pancakes before.....they were pretty good. Not exactly what I thought they were going to be but tasty none the less. Sausage was great.....good snap to it. My wife had the challah french toast and that was a big hit too. Service was fast. Everyone was friendly. I shall return!
