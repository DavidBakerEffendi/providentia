Love this place! Â Crepes are a great change from my regular diet. I usually get the sirloin steak with the feta cheese sauce. Everything is super fresh and large. I have yet to finish one in one sitting. The fruit crepes are good too but don't hold up to well. For 5 dollars you can get a crepe of your choosing and any drink...that's a great deal.
