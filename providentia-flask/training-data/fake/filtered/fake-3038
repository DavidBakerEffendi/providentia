Love this place!!! We had great tapas and my dinner was very good! I've been there on numerous occasions and It is a great place! The atmosphere, especially on the patio is wonderful! They have ample choices on sangria and mojitos. But since it's BYOB, I recommend bringing a wine and adding to their sangria since theirs tastes like there is not alcohol in it. Overall... a great experience! I didn't give it 5 stars bc I feel that their food varies is taste sometimes.Sometimes the food and tapas are phenomenal, and sometimes they are very good.
