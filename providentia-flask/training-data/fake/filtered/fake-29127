I've had dinner at Don Pepe (3) times in the last year.  Each time was on a Saturday night.  The first visit as in August of 2013 and the parking lots were empty.  Everything went well.  We were seated quickly, the food was very good and the sangria was delicious.  The one thing I didn't like is the waiter grabbed a second picture of sangria in record time when my wife said she wanted more.  I objected but she said let's get another one and the waiter blew out of there and was back in 90 seconds with a small pitcher.  We could not finish it (at least without being officially declared a drunk driver) and we couldn't take it with us so that was a waste.  The 2nd visit both parking lots were packed.  Not looking good but we walk in and there's plenty of people around.  We're greeted by the Hostess and she says a table for 2 will be 10 minutes.  I'm puzzled but optimistic.  I'm thinking how can it be only a 10 minute wait?  Well it turned out to be almost an hour.  Half way through I gave thought to leaving but it was already pretty late for dinner and to start over at another restaurant is not a chance I wanted to take.  It was apparent that we were LIED to.  Again the food and the sangria were very good.  The third time we take my kids and parents for a party of 6.  We ordered appetizers and then the entrees.  We ordered (4) items figuring that would be enough.  There is no way one person can eat the whole portion of the items we ordered not to mention my two daughters.  When the bill came we were charged for sharing two plates which was $13.00 when tax & tip are included.  This irked me because when the appetizers are included there were (6) items in total ordered.  I did not want to make of deal of this because we enjoyed having dinner with my parents but couple this with the sangria which was subpar and I won't be coming back any longer.  There are plenty of very good Spanish restaurants very close by in Newark.
