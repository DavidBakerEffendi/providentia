So terrible! The food was ready about five minutes after we ordered... you know what that means. Delicious microwave-ready pad-thai, complete with overly oxidized grease on the outside and chalkiness on the inside. Shrimp was powdery and the furthest thing from fresh possible. Service was awful too - the waitress added an additional service charge on the bill without telling us yet still accepted a tip (given before we realized there was already a service charge) AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE
