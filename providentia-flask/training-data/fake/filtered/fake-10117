Craft Beer, Craft Beer, Craft Beer  The absolute best Craft Beer tap selection on Staten Island. they rotate 8 of there 12 taps constantly and are not scared to experiment and bring in cool creative beers that other bars simply dont know how to market and sell.. from mikkeller , eviltwin , alesmith, maine brewing, cigar city, westbrook, local option, to some of the better more commercial crafts like firestone, sixpoint, smuttynose, southern teir, left hand, stone and founders.....  to top it off then have brisket ribs and pulled pork fresh out the smoker daily and limited if your get there too late it will be sold out... angus burgers , fried chicken, chicken n waffles, mac n cheese, diablo shrimp and many more cool dishes... which for me is just a huge plus to the amazing Craft Beer selection.... great spot! p.s  - dont expect to find any bud coars or miller products there
