Ive been to this caf√© some times, the food is good, especially the date cake, the staff is nice and smiling. The atmosphere is really amazing it feels like a transition into another world, they have the most wonderful musicians coming in to play old jazz etc. I really really like this place and want come here every time Im in the city!
