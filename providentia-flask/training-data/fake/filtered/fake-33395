The worst service I have ever seen. Came there for lunch with a co-worker, stood for 15 minutes being completely ignored by the guy who was counting receipts right in front of us. When asked if they can sit us, he said "I don't think so", and continued counting reecpits, even though there were tables available. The waitress who barely spoke english, was running around, smiling and saying sorry. Not sure what was going on, but they clearly didnt want to serve us. My coworker, who is Japanese was as shocked as I was. We left, don't think will be going there again.
