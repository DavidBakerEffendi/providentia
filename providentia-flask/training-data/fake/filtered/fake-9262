OMG! We were not through dinner and Â we're almost pushed out by a mob on a birthday party. Our table was crushed. Spent $700+ on a not so good dinner with bad service. This is a bar NOT A RESTAURANT. No apologies from any manager. Never seen anything like this happening on a reputable restaurant. The manager is a complete moron!
