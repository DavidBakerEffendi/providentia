Had dinner at Sorella tonight (Sunday) with my family and we all thought for a restaurant still in its first week everything was very very good. The decor is a huge improvement over the former Zula and the addition of a good casual restaurant to the downtown dining scene is greatly appreciated. The staff was friendly and helpful, the pizza from the brick over was top notch and the pastas we sampled were delish. The wine list had a nice selection of moderately priced bottles and glasses. I look forward to a return visit to sample the rest of the menu. A def place to check out.
