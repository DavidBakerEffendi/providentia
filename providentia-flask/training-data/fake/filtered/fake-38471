This was my first time in this restaurant and I must say that it was a fantastic experience. The atmosphere was charming and gave me a Caribbean feel. Music was playing as I ate, but it was not intrusive but soothing and enjoyable. Now to the food........it set my taste buds on fire!!!! On this day, I ordered the stew chicken. I was impressive with the salad in that it was hearty and not filled with iceberg lettuce. The main meal was presented well and the flavor was extraordinary. I am a rice fanatic and the rice and peas was to die for! Another part of my experience that was great....the owner was on site helping with preparing the meals. I love that personal touch! I am thrifty person and like to watch my spending, but the cost of the food in this restaurant  did not break my budget.  Treat yourself and take a friend!!!!  Kudos to Kelso!!!!!! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion. I will definitely be back with family and friends. Credit cards are accepted as my friend and I used a card.
