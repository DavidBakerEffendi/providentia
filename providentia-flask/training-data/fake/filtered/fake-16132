The mac & cheese here is amazing, the decor and atmostphere is very nice. However my partner and i seemed to be "under dressed" at a place where they sell mac & cheese, chicken and waffles, and fried oreos... Ironic. The drinks were okay, the non alcoholic lemonades were better which was a bummer, and they serve them in these really cute jug glasses... Which they should consider for the alcoholic bvgs. Service was pretty good, until our server who wasnt all that good decided to complain to us about the tip she received. Which was too good for the crap service she provided... The nerve! Would only return for the mac attack!
