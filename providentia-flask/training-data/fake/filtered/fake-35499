Really excellent Chinese food-- they have an extensive menu, items are reasonably priced, and they even offer alcoholic beverages, unlike most Chinese restaurants. I have loved everything I have ordered, except for the sweet and sour chicken, which contained small pieces of fried chicken that were just too greasy. The service is great for dining and take out.
