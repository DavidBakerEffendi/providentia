Amazing, Rarely are there any places I find necessary to post about, but zahav has become one of my favorite establishments The food is outstanding!  Creative yet traditional middle eastern fare, in which Chef Michael Solomonov delivers some of the best interpretations of classic dishes from my childhood. Cauliflower:  Deep fried and tossed in citrus with herb aioli, Great portion size and amazing flavors Stuffed grape leaves: served cold but still amazing, no meat makes them a versatile dish for the whole table. Kibbeh Naye:  One of my true loves in life, however zahavs version is not spicy(fine by me) instead it  is served with blistered peppers (great idea) The meat is finely minced and mixed with perfectly cooked bulgur as well as some spices I am sure.  truly a great interpretation. Grilled chicken livers:  First and foremost I am a sucker for livers. But these where so tender and creamy it made me rethink my execution of livers in my own kitchen.  served with barley and lentils the whole dish comes together elegantly. I wish I had eaten more but i will just have to wait until next time. The staff is extremely polite and well informed. Chef Michael was an amazingly humble individual and a pleasure meeting.  I would recommend this restaurant to my friends there friends and there friends.
