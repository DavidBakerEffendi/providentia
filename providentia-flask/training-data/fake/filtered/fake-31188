Terrific food and a warm, friendly, casual atmosphere.  I was new to Lebanese food and have tried  almost everything on the menu and really like it all.  I love the Fattoush salad,  all the veggie appetizers  (esp the okra-- I wouldnt have thought it was okra in there, but it was delicious) , the lamb and chicken standards and the desserts are great too.  If they have a fish special, give it a try.     Don't be shy about asking questions about they food -- they will take their time and explain .   The place is clearly a labor of love from Wafa (and family) and it shows .    Go and enjoy !!
