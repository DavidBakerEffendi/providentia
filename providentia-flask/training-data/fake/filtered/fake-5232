BEST GRILLED CHEESE EVER! The women who work there know my friend and I by name now.  As soon as we walk in, they always know what we're getting - the usual grilled cheese and fries!! Always a great time there.  We found this place by accident and have been going there monthly (sometimes more than once a month) ever since!!
