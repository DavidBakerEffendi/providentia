Unique is the best way to describe the scene at Spumoni Gardens. Outside looks like the food concessions at Coney Island in 1960. People standing and sitting around holding their pizza and/or spomoni, eating and enjoying the summer in Brooklyn. I liked the Spumoni but it wasn't anything that special, just good. Inside the dining area reminded me of Lundy's in Sheepshead Bay. Very busy, tables close together, lot so waiters hussling around. It's a food factory atmosphere. Even tho the wait staff was a bit in a rush, they were curteous and proficient. The food was very good and the main ingredient in each dish was ABUNDANT! Prices are a bit high until you see the portions and amount of the main ingredient, eg. shrimp in the shrimp fradiablo, veal in the veal scallopine, etc. Overall a hit. I'll be back!
