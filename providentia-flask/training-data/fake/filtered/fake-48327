The cheesesteaks here are ok I guess, but certainly not deserving of the hype they get. However, the thing that sticks out about this place is the piss-poor service. Are all new hires required to take a course on how to be the biggest pricks they can possibly be to customers? The asshole taking orders had a real attitude and refused to give me the change I was owed. He didn't even count the money before putting it in the register, and kept trying to move right on to the next person and insisting I gave him the exact amount. I figured it wasn't worth holding up others from ordering their overrated cheesesteaks to keep arguing with that douchebag. Oh yeah and God forbid you don't place your order using their stupid lingo. Seeing how it is more of a tourist attraction than a place for locals, they might want to try not giving people who are unfamiliar with their lingo a dickish attitude if they're not perfect at ordering. They're obsessed with keeping the line moving fast, yet it probably moves slower because of the confusion created by requiring people to order using their pointless, made-up lingo.
