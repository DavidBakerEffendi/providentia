Came here just for their astonishing reviews on yelp they have gotten, I can certainly say I'm not too impressed with the food, it was alright.  What ticked me off was their customer service, I don't get why I have to try so hard to get someone to take our orders and it was even a wrong order.  I'm probbaly not going to come back.
