A step from the threshold of hell.  The owner Mike is a TOTAL buffoon.  If he isn't falling down drunk every night he works, he's running a gambling operation with the degenerates who frequent the establishment.  Typically seated right at the door.  How this place remains open is beyond the scope of reason.  If you can get past that - then maybe you'll notice the dungeon like atmosphere, or perhaps the bathrooms that feel like you are in a subway station complete with blacked out homeless person smell.
