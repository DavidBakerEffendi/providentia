So many restaurants on this street to choose from! The endless amounts of rating stickers (Zagat, Yelp, ones I can't recognize) on their windows convinced me that I should at least give them a try. They have a portobello mushroom appetizer that was amazing.  We had the campagnola and the rigatoni alla vodka.  Both dishes were great and the portions were good.  Just enough to make you full but still have room for dessert.  The host was very solicitous and made us feel like we were really being looked after. Would reccomend people to come here if little italy is their destination, but not the best place to be for italian food.
