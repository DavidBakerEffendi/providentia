My 5 stars are based on my imagination!! Have been to NYC 5 times in the past 4 years and have NEVER gotten in to Rao's, ...so I bought their cook book! I have used it regularly and everyone loves the dishes I've created from their guidance. We'll be back and hopefully one day, we'll get a reservation!! Loved reading all the comments!
