Our first question was....Is all the food here frozen? The rice had frozen vegies in it and the rice seemed like minute rice or frozen/old. The chicken enchiladas had old or maybe frozen chicken as well. The corn bread is for a child's pallet, it was like sweet white cake with a sprinkling of corn...just enough to call it "corn bread". The unsweetened tea was tasteless brown water YUCK, at least the water (we had to ask for) tasted like chlorine! The food is made by someone who if once had a passion for serving excellent food has clearly lost his or her way on a sad path to below standard food. The chef may have lost his way but the owner allows it. Oh one last thing my wife actually vomited five minutes after the meal. The Salsa was good. Never again.
