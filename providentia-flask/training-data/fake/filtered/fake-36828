BEWARE!!!!! My coworkers and I have been here MANY times. It's super cute, awesome place and made even better on Tuesdays with their two dollar taco special. Seahorses was always one of our most highly recommended restaurants downtown and go to place to take out of town guests...but now it's been ruined! What could be a mere coincidence but seems likely not...we know of two separate individuals that after charging their meals on their credit cards at Seahorse the very next day had $8000 each (!!!!!!!!!!!!) charges to out of state places (one in Maryland and the other was in Vermont). Such shady business we cannot enable so we'll be finding a new spot...and reported the incident respective credit card companies and the NYPD 5th precinct. If you've charged your credit card at Seahorse check your statements immediately!!!!!!!!!
