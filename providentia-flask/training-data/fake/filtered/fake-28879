This is about my third time going to this diner it does get busy depending what day of the week you are going like a saturday morning forget it take tons of patience and time with you and know it would be a rushed service. Each time I ordered.eggs taylor ham ans toast i did not like how they made it toast too much butter and just the look of  the food i did not like  Service was ok .
