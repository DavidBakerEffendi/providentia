The hostess here is the worst in Manhattan....seriously...she is a shrill witch. I have never been treated so poorly to gain access to food that I would describe as a B+ at best. While the owner did try to make up for her bad attitude he never got her to apologize which is the ONE thing that would have gotten me to at least change my mind on the restaurant. The owner is a nice enough guy but that hostess is just the absolute worst. There is an argument that this place is good for their drinks...not really. If you want drinks of that quality go to one of the dozens of "specialty Â cocktail" places nearby. Whatever, I am just venting now...hostess...you suck. Food B+ on their best day...which is almost never.
