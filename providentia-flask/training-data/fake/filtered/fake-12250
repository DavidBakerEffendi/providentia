Bob, I have been a long time fan, patron, Â and unofficial spokesperson for C. O. Jones. However, last night and was met with the horrible realization that Parrothead, Peach or Love Potion #9 margaritas are no longer offered. It appears that nothing else has changed on either the bar menu or food menu. I enjoy the food, but go to C. O. Jones for the above mentioned margaritas. Please bring them back, I do not even care if the price is doubled. Thank you!
