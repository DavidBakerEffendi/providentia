I've been going to Matthew's for many years and it pains me to see the quality of service and food portions decrease, while the prices increase. I have to agree with another reviewer that the food is mediocre at best, but not good enough to justify the high price, cramped tables, and very small portion size.  I don't know if it's because the restaurant changed owners or just a gradual degradation in service, but it pains me to see a restaurant that I grew up with go down the toilet. Warning! for those of you who have been going to Matthew's over the years it's not the same restaurant!.  For those of you who are new to Matthew's try either a cheaper Italian restaurant for (larger portions affordable prices) or another high end Italian restaurant for (higher quality food) But DO NOT GO TO MATTHEW"S because you will get neither.  I can not and will not recommend this restaurant and I do not want anyone to waste both their money and time on overpriced food that will not get you full.
