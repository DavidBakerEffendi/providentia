My wife & I took a dear friend here for a birthday dinner. Our group enjoyed our entire experience at this restaurant - the funky atmosphere, a great server (Oscar) who gave terrific recommendations & checked in with us regularly, several additional check-ins by the Chef Hong herself (who is a delight!) and a fantastic dinner filled with a combination of tastes (sweet, then savory follwed by a surprising & delicious kick!) in each course we ordered, even the dessert! Our friend's favorite cuisine is Thai and she stated repeatedly to us that this was the best she'd had in NYC. We have to agree! We highly recommend this place and will return for sure!!
