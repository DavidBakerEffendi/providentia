We joined friends for dinner in Manhattan recently and, upon recommendations from Yelp reviewers and a Zaggat review, we decided to try Mighty Quinn's Barbecue for the first time.  None of the four of us was disappointed.  The barbecued meats (ribs, brisket, pulled pork) were some of the best barbecued meats we've ever had --  ANYWHERE.  They were tender, juicy and flavorful, though the portions of brisket and pulled pork were small for the a-la-carte price (hence the four-star review instead of five-star).  We ordered extra portions of meats to compensate.  The sides were equally delicious, especially the burnt-ends baked beans and the sweet potato casserole.  We left with contented smiles on our faces and talked about the food the rest of the evening. Hints: 1)  Be prepared for cafeteria-style dining.  There is no waiter service here, and everything is a la carte. 2)  Go early or late or at an otherwise odd time.  The line can be long and seating is limited. 3)  Order large sides and share.
