This review is based on a few brunch experiences. Planning to go back for dinner soon. The good: Super nice staff, quick service, really really delicious drinks (try the mango margarita or bloody maria), and fantastic food (the chilaquiles are to die for). The not so good: value for your dollar. The place isn't exactly cheap, nor are the portions huge. It is definitely a place I will keep coming for brunch when the craving strikes, and I am planning to try it for dinner, but given the pricetag it is only going to be an occasional trip for me. The food could also be a good bit spicier. They do have good hot sauce you can get to add to the food, and I understand not making things too hot for people who don't like it that way, but the food is too mild on its own.
