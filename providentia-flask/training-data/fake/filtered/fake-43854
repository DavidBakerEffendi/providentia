We had an experience that doesn't fit with the reputation of this restaurant chain. We were at a table that wasn't set-up when we entered and the three(?) servers that said that they would be taking care of us, never set the table until we asked for utensils.  The food, when it arrived was cold, over cooked and not all brought at once.  We had to ask for condiments, after the food was on the table for 3-4 minutes and then watch servers walk past us as we were trying to get the check. The portions were small and priced over the average for this area.  Besides the terrible eggs and cold home fries, my friend's steak wasn't edible and my corned beef was full of gristle.  This company needs to re-manage the food, staff and procedures!
