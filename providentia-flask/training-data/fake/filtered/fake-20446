The best brunch and brunch experience in my entire life! I know this sounds excessive, but I assure you it was just great, hence I felt compelled to write my first ever yelp review. I was meeting up with friends early Sunday morning and we decided, seeing as we were downtown to go to Jack's Wife Freda. we had heard good things. There were quite a few people waiting outside, even at 10.15am. I popped in and spoke with the host who took my name and told us the wait would be 35-40 mins. After a quick visit to the MoMa store we went back and as the host finished taking the details of a couple standing beside us, he turned to me and called me by my name and told me he would have a table for us in a matter of minutes. I then noticed as he walked over to several other groups  - how gracious he was and how he remembered everyone. Every single face and name.... and at this stage people were being told the wait was 1hr 40mins. We were soon seated. We all struggled to make up our minds on what to order - but we took direction from our server, who was just lovely. Good calls all round. I ordered the steak sandwich and it was perfect. temperature, seasoning, flavour. Multiple refills of coffee just made my morning. The fries were so crisp and not the awful skinny fries that you usually find in NY. We tired the duck bacon and its pretty great. It's small, cosy and busy and buzzing and even with the most picky and fickle NY  crowd (which Im sure can really get tiring) every person I spoke with in the restaurant that morning was charming and a delight. So, the service was faultless, the food was faultless... and I really was impressed by the wonderful details such has the illustrated menus, sugar packets, pens, and postcards. Faultless.
