Having done a good bit of searching for a decent Mexican restaurant in north Jersey and had really unsatisfactory experiences, I wasn't expecting much.  Parking is a problem in this part of Montclair; we had to walk 4 blocks in the cold, and when I saw we were walking down into a basement space that at best is weirdly decorated I wondered out loud if we were going to have another bad meal. Then the chips came, warm from the fryer, with a salsa that although a bit thin was bright, with just the right amount of cilantro, and obviously freshly made (not carried over from last week or poured out of a jar) and my spirits began to lift. The appetizer we chose was mussels in garlic sauce.  Fantastic!  The mussels were perfectly cooked and the sauce beautifully balanced between tang and richness.  I followed up by ordering the hurache.  You have a choice of meats with this, one of which is lamb.  I can't think of another Mexican restaurant I've ever been to that had lamb on the menu in any way, shape, or form, so was surprised to see it at all and a bit sceptical.  But I'd been wrong once already about the place, so decided to trust they knew what they were doing with the lamb. When the hurache came it had big chunks of perfectly cooked lamb, along with the other good stuff.  By then I'd eaten so many chips that I couldn't finish the hurache; took it home and finished it off for dinner the next night. The rice and beans are the weak elements here, as as they are at most Mexican restaurants.  Not bad, just forgettable plate-fillers. We've been back to this place four times and everything we've had--which has always included the mussels and sometimes the hurache--has been consistently good.  Except the darn rice and beans!
