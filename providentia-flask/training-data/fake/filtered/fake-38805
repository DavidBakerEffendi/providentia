Just went to Iris Cafe for the first time a few weeks ago. Can't really figure out what all the hype is about. Coffee was good and I had the Avocado on multigrain toast with soft boiled eggs, which was good but nothing special and probably something I could make at home. As for the no laptop rule, if I am willing to spend almost $30 on breakfast with a friend, not sure why the presence of laptops matter so much to the owners. I won't be back.
