I was so excited to try this restaurant as I love Filipino food.  I got the grilled pork chop with fresh lumpia from their lunch combo.  I was extremely disappointed!  How can you go wrong with grilled pork chop and fresh lumpia sauce?  Maybe the pork that day wasn't fresh that it had this odd smell that I couldn't bear to eat after 2-3 bites.  The Lumpia sauce looks like they added some soy sauce that it tasted like the typical lumpia peanut sauce  with soy sauce--wasn't good at all.  I was so disappointed because I brought lunch from home for work that day but decided to go for Pandan Restaurant. The food was so bad that I had to throw the rest of them and didn't even get to eat half of it.  For dessert, I had pandan delight which was thankfully good.  The Pandan delight was pretty big that it was basically what I had for lunch that day as the combo was unbearable.  I will definitely order pandan delight again but skeptical to try other dishes.  Try them yourself, maybe you might like them just like some other but definitely not for me.
