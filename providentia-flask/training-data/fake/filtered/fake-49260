This place is around the corner from me, and I've given it several tries over the years.  It's been consistently bad.  I'm surprised to read the rave reviews left by others.  I've lived in California, I've been to Mexico, and the food here does not seem "authentic" to me, nor tasty.  The beans were bland, and seemed to me as if they had come from a can.  My shrimp enchilada was edible, but blanketed in raw cabbage for no apparent reason (a few strands for garnish would have been fine).  My main reason for disliking this place is not the sub par food, but the high prices they charge for it, which are not justified by location, service, or decor.  A true mystery to me, and one I hope that others avoid.  There are plenty of better places, I prefer Baja's in Orange for "authentic" or Whole Enchilada in New Haven for "healthy", or any of the other Mexican places on State Street.
