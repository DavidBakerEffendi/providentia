WOW! This place can be summarized in just two words: Flavor and service! I went there with my husband and my daughter last night for the very first time and we had a fantastic time. As soon as we walk in we thought we wouldn't be able to sit because we didn't have reservations and the place was packed. However, the staff was cordial and told us it wouldn't take more than fifteen minutes. After we sat we ordered the sangria pitcher which is delicious! For appetizers we shared the Salpicao, this flavorful Brazilian salad with shredded chicken and ham, yummy! For main course I had the Bobo de Camaroa, sorry can't spell the name of the dish, but what does matter, it was simply great. My husband went for the Picanha, and he was extremely satisfied and happy with his choice. Then came dessert. Our daughter tried the passion fruit mousse, which is unique and very delicious. Our experience couldn't have been complete without the excellent service we were given, the staff was attentive, friendly and prompt. Even with the restaurant being so busy, we never felt neglected. Overall I give this place A++!
