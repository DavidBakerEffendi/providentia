I'm confused why all the reviews for this place are for the pizzeria. This is a restaurant. A darn good one at that. I regularly visit it, and go out of my way to do so. The menu is extensive, and would be foreign, if it weren't for the knowledgeable wait staff to guide you through it. And the pizza? An easy and guaranteed choice if you're not an adventurous dinner. If you're looking for fine dinning with a casual feel, this is the place. Great music, great food, professional and attractive wait staff, and delicious food. My only quandary is most of the time I eat here, the "head chef" is most likely in the dinning room or wandering around. I don't know who's actually cooking the food, but they're doing a darn good job. Kudos to them and the establishment.
