After reading all the positive Yelp reviews, we decided to check this place out for dinner the other night.  We had high expectations.  Although the prices are cheap, the food is not good.  The meat and tortillas are too dry, the salsas are insufficiently seasoned, and the food is generally bland and not exciting.
