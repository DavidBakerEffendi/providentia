My wife and I stumbled upon Da Andrea a few summers ago after a long day of apartment hunting in the West Village.  Once we finally moved to the neighborhood, we became regulars at this very good Italian spot.  The food is reliably fresh and tasty and the portions are generous (they seemed to increase the portion size but not the price a year or two ago).  In the winter, it can get very tight inside with people waiting for tables practically standing right on top of those sitting near the door.  But in the warmer weather, they add about six outdoor tables and everyone waiting to be seated can wait on the sidewalk. Some of my favorite dishes are the grilled calamari salad, the pappardelle with sausage, the artichoke ravioli, and the penne with eggplant and mozzarella.  The spaghetti bolognese is satisfying, although occasionally too salty for my taste.   A pleasant neighborhood spot with a usually very friendly and attentive staff who are not intrusive.
