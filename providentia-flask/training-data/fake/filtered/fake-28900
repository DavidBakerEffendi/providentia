It's actually on Drury St. not Drury Ln ... but Drury Lane sounds so much better and is more appropriate once you find this place. It's in an alley, it has a gaudy neon sign proclaiming its presence and it's 150 yrs. old. Basically a sports bar with an excessively loud juke box and lots of microbrews on tap. If you're into beer (I'm not talking Coors Lite or Bud) then check this place out. They serve the usual pub grub but it's a lot better than the norm. Wings and burgers are excellent. The guy sitting next to me had the special $5 sirloin steak dinner (6 oz. which he said tasted pretty good). Great atmosphere and everyone is friendly (especially the two sailors that were going from table to table making toasts while I were there. I especially like that they serve real glass pitchers of beer.
