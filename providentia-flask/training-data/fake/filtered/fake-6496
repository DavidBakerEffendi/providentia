Honestly, I have been going here for years, but lately on weekend nights (when it is really busy) the staff has been unbearably rude. It's as if we are all so lucky to even be eating there we should tolerate the mood swings of the staff. I mean the food is good, but it doesn't deserve a cult like status. I tried last night to get a table, was given a 45 minute wait time, then the hostess added 20 minutes on, which then became 30 and by 1:15 we left. After I expressed a little frustration with the inaccurate wait time, she told me that "there were still people in front of you" as if i don't know how a list works at a restaurant. When I told her might be better to give people a more accurate time so they could go have a drink and plan better her response was "thanks for the tip." It just seems completely odd to me that even if a restaurant is busy and popular being rude would be an acceptable business practice. I am not expecting sunshine on a slammed, Saturday night, but really? The last straw was when the barista bumped into me and then groaned. He was also overheard insulting any number of clients.
