I just moved to New Haven and came upon Caseus after mentioning to a friend how much I love cheese. I had dinner with a friend the other night and we shared a few things.  Everything I tasted (scallops, mac and cheese, etc.) was done really well.  I like the casual atmosphere, as well as, the use of local organic ingredients.  A little pricey, but well worth it in my book. I will be back soon. I definitely want to check out their cheese shop!
