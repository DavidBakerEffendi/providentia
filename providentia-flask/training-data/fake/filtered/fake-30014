We had been to Hurry Chutney for a quick lunch. It is one of the self serve place (which should be no surprise if you have lived in NJ long enough). We were on a run and the food came pretty quickly. My husband really liked their dal (lentil curry). The staff was not only friendly they were honest too - I had forgotten my purse there with EVERYTHING in it (yeah dumb of me i know!) - but the owner somehow managed to find me online and connected through linkedin. I got my purse back and sure enough, everything was intact! Totally recommend this place :)
