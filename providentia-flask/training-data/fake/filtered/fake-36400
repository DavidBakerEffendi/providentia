I've been in twice, sat at the bar both times and had the same Bartender ( I think her name is Pamela). The food was fantastic and our bartender gave perfect service. I know next to nothing about wine and she knew exactly what to recommend. If you can't snag a table reservation, try getting a spot at the bar!!!
