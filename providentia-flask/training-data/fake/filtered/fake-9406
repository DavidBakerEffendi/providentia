Had dinner yesterday with two friends and we all loved the meatball sliders and ricotta cavatelli appetizers. I had the cod with a delicious butternut squash risotto. My friends had the pork chop and crispy chicken and both were also fantastic. The pumpkin panna cotta finished off the meal nicely. All in all, it was excellent!
