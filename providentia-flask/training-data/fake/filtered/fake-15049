I have gone to Subs & Bites a handful of times and each time I go into the store, I am immediately greeted. The fact that I don't have to initiate the greeting when I come into their store is not a huge deal, but it is really nice to see that people are still friendly (instead of the usual blank zombie stare you get from some people for two seconds and then they go back to doing something else). I usually come in for a Monster or that Neuro Bliss drink, but when I get food (usually a cheesesteak and fries for lunch or a steak and egg sandwich for breakfast), it is a relatively good portion. The prices can be a little high depending on what you order and how much, but I have enjoyed my food every time I order from them. If anyone is going north towards Rt. 1 from Brunswick Pike and is hungry, grab some chow from these guys.
