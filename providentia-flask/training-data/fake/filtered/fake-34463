Went there Friday night for the special dinner night. Best prime rib in a long time. Took the leftovers home and ate lunch for 2 more days! Even reheated it was still tender and juicy.. Yum! Plus, of coursem the best part, lively, spirited staff to make the experience fun. We love the people and the place.
