We had SUCH a god-awful experience at this restaurant after such amazing things about it that we wrote Bun personally because there was no manager anywhere in the restaurant!!!  WHAT?!?!  Clearly, no one runs the place. These were a few of the complaints we told Bun about... 1) We arrived at 4:55pm on Saturday May 21.  There were plenty of tables available but we were seated at table A in the front corner.  It took 45 minutes for someone to finally acknowledge us.   2) Our food was not served until 6:00pm and each of our dishes came about 10 minutes apart even though we requested our sushi served platter style. 3) We tried to avoid a long wait by calling ahead earlier that day and were told that no pre-orders or reservations could be made for a party of two. 4) Rachel was kind enough to give us a complementary "salad," one meager plate of lettuce and dressing (clearly not a menu item) for two people to split. 5) When our waiter, Sidewalk Dave, finally came to wait on us after Rachel had taken our order and brought us our "salad," we asked for more water.  Sidewalk Dave poured from the pitcher into the glass, overflowed the glass, and then poured the water from the glass (which I had already drank from) back into the restaurant's pitcher.  Luckily he caught this blunder but it makes one question the hygiene of your establishment. 6) As for specific dishes, we ordered the milk and honey roll which we can tell would have been great, except that someone added broccoli to the roll.  This was clearly a misplaced ingredient for such an over-priced specialty dish.   7) The Devil's Black Fish Sampler which the menu highlights is meant to be served immediately in order to experience the contrasting hot and cold sensations of the dish sat at the sushi bar until it was served to us luke warm. 8) After eating our dinner, Sidewalk Dave cleared all of our dishes and utensils before bringing dessert so we were forced to eat our ice-cream based dessert with our hands.
