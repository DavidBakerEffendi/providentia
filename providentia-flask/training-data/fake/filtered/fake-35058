I wish I didn't have to give this place a perfect review, because the lines keep getting longer, but this place is just delicious.  I've been coming here since Spring 2011, which must have been around the time they opened, and they have stayed great the whole time. The pho is among the best in the city, primarily because of the quality of ingredients.  Sometimes the broth is not crystal clear, which is a downer, but the flavor profile is still the most reliable in the city.  Also, their sandwiches are awesome, and the vermicelli bowls are also spot-on.  Really this is the best you can get for the price. For a perfect meal for two, start with the papaya salad (with Vietnamese chili dressing), and then try the pho and something with pork chops, either a sandwich or a vermicelli bowl.  Share and enjoy!  Note: Pho is hard to share unless you're cool with sharing utensils and having people slurp over the bowl you're eating out of.
