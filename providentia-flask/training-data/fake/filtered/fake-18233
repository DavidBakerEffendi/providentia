thought it was time to stop into this new pub in Montclair. The greeter a young gentleman asked how many , we said 2. He directed us to our table by the kitchen entry. I told him no we would not sit there, he slow rolled his eyes and stated they have reservations. The were more than 10 table empty at that time. I proceeded to say fine we will leave. On our way out he selected another table by the entry and we said ok. We waited as no waiter service showed up. Finally the waiter appeared and informed us no one told him people were here to be served. Anyway, so let's move on. the lobster risotto was warm, risotto was hard and 4 small pieces of lobster. $30.00 for a small portion also. Look, go at your own risk Overpriced, mediocre food, small portions, slow service And snobby greeters. Spend your money somewhere else. Oh and on our way out there were still 5 empty tables!
