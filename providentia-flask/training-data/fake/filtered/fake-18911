All of the fairytales about New york Style pizza have come true.  It's here in Di Fara's!   Forget the rumors about how terrible the wait time is.  Yes, sometimes it may accrue to an hour, but be calm!  When your time has come, you'll be using your taste buds the way God intended you to. All of the ingredients are fresh.  You're aware of this the moment you bite down.  Fresh mozzarella, or 'moozareLL' as the gentleman behind me helped me to pronounce.   Thankfully, the trip here isn't so bad since I live in Brooklyn.
