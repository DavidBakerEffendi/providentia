I always get curries from these guys and can't beat the taste and feel like they are cooked by my mom and very tasty home made food.I like biryani also obviously their style is different and i like the taste and i recommended my friends and they also like the food from them.Cook is very passionate and can't get these type curries from any other place in Oak tree road and their food 100% tastes like home made food.Best food for curries like home style.
