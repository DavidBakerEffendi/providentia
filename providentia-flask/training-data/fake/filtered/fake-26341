I ordered a Pizza and Pepperoni Roll. Took almost 1 1/2 hours for delivery. When the doorbell rang, I answered it to find the delivery guy with just the Pepperoni Roll. I asked about the pizza, and he said we had already received it. I said, ne we didn't. He asked "me" if i had the number to San Vito, I gave it to him. After he told the person on the other line we haden't received the pizza, he asked again if we received the pie, I said no, we didn't. He hung up the phone and said, ok, he'll go back to get it. I said, wait, you're going to go get a pizza and come back with a cold pepperoni roll? He said, if you want, we'll put it in the oven again. I said, well, then it will be a burnt pepperoni roll. He gave a half smile. So I politely said to forget the order and thanked him.
