I just had threw a surprise graduation party for 30+ people there, and I couldn't have asked for a better experience for my group. It was a very diverse group in age and most had never been to Stagehouse before. They were all wowed with the food and service. Everything was perfect from beginning to end, and the staff went above and beyond to make the night memorable. The attention to detail that they put into the party was incredible. Event planning is something that I do on a daily basis, so I have pretty high standards. I appreciate it greatly when others run an event flawlessly. I would definitely recommend holding a catered event there to anyone looking to host a party for a large group.
