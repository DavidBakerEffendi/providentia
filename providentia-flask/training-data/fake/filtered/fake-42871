This restaurant was the worst indian restaurant Ive been too. My first experience there started with a delivery order where the 2 liter bottle was already open and half empty. After calling them to let them know they half heartily apologized and said the driver must have been thirsty. After trying the food, two out of 4 of my friends ended up with food poisoning. If you craving indian in the area go to satish palace or aroma cafe, much better food
