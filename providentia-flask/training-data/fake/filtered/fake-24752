I'm in love with this place. Sure, I've been to many restaurants with more space and a better atmosphere, but I have yet to find a lasagna elsewhere in the city that can rival Bianca's. While I usually tend to avoid cash-only establishments, (mostly out of laziness,) I will happily make a point to hit an ATM before heading to Bianca. There's frequently a wait there, but fortunately, there's a great wine bar next door (Von) where you can enjoy a few drinks before the host pops in to collect you to be seated. (Tip: if it's super crowded at Bianca, I'll just order from the bar at Von. The host will actually bring you a full place setting, your meal, and a bread basket, right at the bar. Unbelievable!!) I've been enough to sample almost everything on Bianca's menu, but I keep going back to the same highlights. The gnocchi pomodoro (available by request,) is simple and classic and always done well, and they're always happy to throw some extra basil on for me. The deliciously creamy gnocchi with gorgonzola is equally impressive and tasty, (though I wouldn't recommend that one on a date night). The lasagna is my ultimate comfort food. Not even my tiny Italian grandmother could make better - it's just unreal. It's made Emilia Romagna style, with bechamel and one of the tastiest meat ragus I've ever encountered. A giant slice for $12.00?? It just doesn't get any better than that.
