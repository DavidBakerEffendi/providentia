We northerners don't get the variety of barbecue available in many parts of the country, but I'm confident that this pace could hold its own in Kansas City or Memphis.  The tangy ribs fall off the bone, the cole slaw is crispy and crunchy, and collard greens hot and fresh.  BIG portions! The owners also operate Maple Street Catering, where the beef brisket melts in your mouth.
