So here's the really skinny on Jose Tejas.  Food is ok and inexpensive.  Drinks are fairly priced. Atmosphere is noisy like a bar or saloon.  Restaurant is always crowded and not really  a good place to enjoy a meal with friends or family, especially if you would like to have a quick bite and maybe see a movie.  We waited close to an hour and a half for dinner because when we initially asked about the wait time, they misled us and said 25 minutes.  So then the wait is going on 45 minutes or so with no place to sit or at least be comfortable and the baby starts to cry.  So you ask how long it's going to be again and they say at least another forty more minutes.  And you lose it and feel like they just don't care.  And if you leave, they could care less because to them you are cattle.  Don't waste your time at this five and dime excuse for a restaurant.  They don't need your business and they surely could care less how long you wait to be seated.  There are plenty people waiting to fill your seats..  Go some where where the experience will be memorable- in a good way.  I will never waste my time on this restaurant doorstep again and I urge anyone that has one ounce of self respect to do the same.  Protest Jose Tejas until they start treating people like customers, not freaking cattle.
