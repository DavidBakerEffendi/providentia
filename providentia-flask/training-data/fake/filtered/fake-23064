Everything was delicious, and the service was good, the setting is lovely and friendly. I had the warm beets, the butternut squash ravioli and the broccoli rabe, and would completely recommend all three. We went on a Tuesday night, didn't book and only had about a 15 minute wait. The only thing I wouldn't recommend is the sangria.
