While this is my first review, and my yelp credibility may be lacking with this being so, I thought it was proper timing to give Da Legna a review. Having grown up in the restaurant industry around New Haven, and being a huge advocate of the city's pizza, it is difficult for me to even consider a pizza establishment with less than a 25 year history under its belt.   That said, Da Legna pizza is worthy of New Haven brick and mortar.  After our traditional Christopher Martins road race this past Sunday, friends and I gave it a shot when we saw Modern was closed. Poised and ready to move on to one of the next NH pizza giants, friends had already been sat. The artisan pies, craft beers, Edison lighting, reggae, and smiling waitress beat my skepticism into enthusiastic acceptance. The bartender delivered the last pitcher of Green Flash West Coast IPA (score!), along with a detailed description of its tap replacement. Dude had some good beer knowledge, which goes a long way with me. Not expecting much from the pies, the margharita, rustica, Clark street and a pork and cheddar were all outrageous. Service, product, and atmosphere are essential to a successful business in the new haven restaurant scene and Da Legna has it figured out.  With a very cool bar room, and it's somewhat outskirt location, I will no doubt be back.
