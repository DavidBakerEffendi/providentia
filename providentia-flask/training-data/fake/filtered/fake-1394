The food is absolutely 5 stars and the waitstaff absolutely friendly & accommodating. Wish I could say the same about the manager. We had booked and prepaid for a large dinner party (approx. 20 people) at Pig and Khao. We were celebrating a birthday and may have been a little rambunctious. So when someone dining at another table shouted over to our party to "shut up!" I was a little disappointed at how the manager handled the situation, almost in favor of the guest that told us to 'shut up.' I believe one of our dinner guests even caught the head chef roll an eye at our dinner party when we were singing Happy Birthday. Â I guess Pig and Khao is just a little too cool for big birthday parties that patron them with a large bill in the middle of the week. If that is the case, then do not take such a large dinner reservation. A large majority of our party was Filipino themselves and excited to see Filipino cuisine to made well and enjoyed by people who normally would not. This place could be more authentic in attitude.
