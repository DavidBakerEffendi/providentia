I went there yesterday, which was Mother's Day, with a 4:30 reservation.  They could not seat us until we were all there, but once everyone arrived, we were seated promptly. Really cool spot with different seating options for various party sizes- booths, big tables, bar rounds,outdoor seating, etc.   Our table for 4 was nice and roomy.  The white sangria was great, as was the lightening lemonade.   Dino poutine was outrageous.  Outrageously delicious.  Wow.  I am still thinking about it.  I ordered the original brisket sandwich with a side of harlem potato salad.  The brisket sandwich I will give an ok too...it wasn't horrible but also not the best.  Somewhere in the middle and edible.  The potato salad on the other had was amazing.  It seemed to have some kind of mustard spice in it that really kicked it up. Portion sizes are huge so plan to take away.  We had zero room for dessert, so can't comment on that. Our waiter, Chris, was awesome.  Overall a great experience for a Sunday afternoon, and a holiday at that.   We had apps, drinks, and meals and it came out to about $125...so $30 apiece was a bargain.
