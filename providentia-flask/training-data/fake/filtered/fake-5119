Will go back again!!! They weren't even open for breakfast yet when a large group of us arrived for brunch after a charity walk. Unlike Lemon Hill Restaurant, (where I will NEVER go back, for a lot of reasons!) Figs accommodated us *immediately*, even though they didn't even have servers there yet! Â The cooks hustled around to get us seated and served us warm coffee and a delicious breakfast. I will tell everyone I know about how great FIGS was, and I will certainly go back!!!
