I was skeptical about eating in an urban outfitters and the fact that the sign is barely visible almost had me miss this place all together. Im glad i didn't. After we were promptly seated and poured our water, we were told the chef recommended sharing. We complied. Our server was extremely knowledgable about the menu and was able to answer all the questions we fired at him. The first item we had was the fermented celery broth. sounds strange, but the flavors totally work. Although i thought the dish was missing something (couldn't put my finger on it), i would recommend it. Next was the bacon wrapped matzoh balls. A must order. They were better than my grandmothers, but then again, she wouldn't wrap hers in bacon. After that we had the beef tongue. This blew my mind. The tongue was melt in your mouth tender, the tomato romesco sauce tangy, and the croutons crunchy and citrus-y. I debated to my self if i would come back alone the next day to have it again. For our final course, we had the lamb neck with risotto oats. Although the portion size was huge, we could not finish it, and it was quite a heavy dish, it was impeccably cooked. The oats were super creamy, and the finish of mint added the slight lightness it need to not be too heavy. We liked everything so much, we decided to truck through one dessert. We opted for the chocolate brownie with onions. Although strange (my two companions enjoyed it more then i did), it was good. The stand out being the charred scallion ice cream. In short: Great service, great cocktails, great food. Highly recommended. Im glad this was my first Yelp review
