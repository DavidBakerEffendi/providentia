First off, it was hard to beat my last visit here- quite a few years back was having dinner with a few friends and Mr B B King and Lucille decided to stop in for a set, so I have fond memories of the place. Came by for a meal the other day and it was almost as good. The food here is just great- finger licking good smoky barbecue, and sides that cannot be beat. Started with Burnt Endz- beef bits tossed in bbq sauce, and I had to try the corn and chicken chowder- it was a little thin, probably because it was early in the day, but the flavor was awesome. Followed up with Southern Fried Chicken - Colonel has nothin on this, and Beef Brisket which is my favorite bbq item- i am a brisket whore to be shore. Mac and cheese, greens, red beans and rice, coleslaw, what a freakin feast! Washed down by glasses of fine iced tea. When it's over 90 degrees in Hartford and humid, nothing else hits the spot like Â great Southern Barbecue in a dark, slightly dive-y place with some coooool jazz. Service was great considering the crowd and the heat. I hope it's not another couple of years before I get back here again.
