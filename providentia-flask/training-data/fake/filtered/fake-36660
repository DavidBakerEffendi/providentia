If I could give it zero stars I would. The service sucks like everyone mentioned already so I am not even taking that into account here. I went here with my fiance and our 5 year old daughter for dinner, since we were in the area. I will leave all the "minor" negatives out and just get right to the MAJOR problem. My little one ordered the kids mini cheeseburgers. First off for $6 you are getting ripped off, they give you two half-dollar sized burgers. Anyway, the problem was I looked over as my daughter was about to take another bite of her second burger (she already ate the other) and it WAS NOT COOKED. Like, not even alittle bit. The entire inside was pink....not a little pink, totally pink. I began silently freaking out and waited for our waitress so I could start verbally freaking out. I was worried that she was going to get sick. The waitress looked at the burger and said "wow, thats not cooked at all."....wow, thanks, I see that Ms. Obvious. So now how are you going to handle the fact that my child just ate raw meat? No manager came over to apologize, no apology from the server...rather, she offered to give us two new mini burgers to-go. Thanks anyway, I will pass on possibly poisoning my child even further. And the best part THEY STILL CHARGED US FOR HER MEAL. Never will I come back here again. The hipster servers all smell bad to.
