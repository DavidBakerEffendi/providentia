Everything we ate was incredibly delicious. The service was quick, attentive and informational. Our server explained each new dish as it came out. We loved Feast and we'll definitely be back. Also, great for bigger groups of 6-10, which isn't always easy in the small & quaint East Village / LES restaurants.
