My wife and I got take out on a Friday evening and the staff was very nice to me, so I feel guilty saying the following, but I would feel worse not posting this warning. I could hear people in the kitchen yelling at each other while I waited 10 minutes longer than the 15 minutes they said I would. I got home and opened my $25 dinner for 2 and realized that there was something missing or wrong with each item I ordered. It was so bad we got about half way through our meal and had to throw the rest out. All the meat was completely dried out, everything was bland and the overall quality of the food was worse than Taco Bell, and tripple the price. They should have payed me to haul this garbage out of their restaurant. I will never go back.
