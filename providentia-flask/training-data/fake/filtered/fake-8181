Went there last night with a couple of friends, and ended up having a reaaaaaally hard time choosing what we wanted because everything looked so tempting. It's a really well-rounded menu, and they offer a healthy array of drinks ;). The sangria i had was amazing, as was the guacasalsa tapa i shared and the fried calamari i scarfed down. Its got a great latin vibe, and it gets busy, so there's a bit of a wait. absolutely worth the wait though.
