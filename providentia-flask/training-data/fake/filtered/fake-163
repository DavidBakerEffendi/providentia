I've been here twice, once to say I've been here and the second time to see if the steak was any better. Sadly, it wasn't. Pat's isn't any better really. Geno's, first of all, has the most obnoxious staff. They're almost downright rude. The Philadelphia image struggles as it is, and these guys don't help it one bit. The meat was greasy, and the cheese-wiz on it could be used to fill pot-holes. The bread was better by itself. To have heard so much about these two places, and end up feeling like I ate a brick will not bring me back here again.
