Great place but the worst customer service....After spending over $100 at the place, being there around 3 hours the manager told us to leave because they had someone else waiting for our table. Â She did not care that our wine/tea was not done yet......very rude attitude.....almost like an expensive fast food restaurant....You eat, you pay & then you have to get out after 2 hours max......I would not reccomend it to people who want to enjoy & hang out with friends a little longer....
