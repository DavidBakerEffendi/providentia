This place is really good and I have eaten A LOT of Indian food! It is my all time favorite food! We have only ordered from here once, but given the other reviews and my excitement at finally finding a GOOD Indian restaurant in a neighborhood full of Indian restaurants, I wanted to add to the reviews and say that this one is DEFINITELY worth a try! The website was clear and professional looking, the woman was really nice on the phone and the food was tasty and not too greasy. They supplied all the condiments you would usually expect for indian food and they even delivered on a really rainy night. The delivery man was soaked and was still really nice, we gave him a healthy tip! Anyway, definitely try Gandhi if you get a hankering for Indian in Ditmas Park or any of the surrounding areas!
