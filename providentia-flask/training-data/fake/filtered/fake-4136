What?! Is it just me? I very much looked forward to the opening of Brooklyn Commune. Windsor Terrace needed more good food, closer to home. However, months later... Yes, the prices are high. That could get a pass if the dishes were inspired or the food expertly prepared. But it's an unfocused menu and what is there isn't made especially well. It's a beautiful space but there isn't much reason to want to dine in. Also, I find the service weird. Like I've crashed somebody else's conversation to ask for soup. Awkward.
