PLEASE do not go to york street. My best friend and I were attacked by the owner. We were in the bathroom when he came flying in to tell us it was out of order. Before we could even apologize (which we did) the owner actually ATTACKED US!! literally grabbing us by the throat and throwing us out of the bar. This was my 5th or 6th time there and i never enjoyed the place. Its a hole in the wall where OLD and UGLY gay guys gather. PLEASE do not ever go there, the owner is a serious coke head who will attack you for using his restroom lol! Im not the kind of person who writes reviews about local restaurants and clubs, but trust me this is NOT the place to go if you are looking for a chill, good time. Go to partners right around the corner, the owner wont attack you....
