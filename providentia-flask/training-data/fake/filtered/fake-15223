I attended a social event catered by Day by Day and the food was quite good; the people who had arranged the event noted that it was also reasonably priced.  I was planning a party and checked their website and decided to place an order.  Their online catering menu notes that for "easy personalized party planning" you can order a full menu, boxed lunches, hot and cold buffets, ala carte, etc.  It also notes they need 48 hours before your event to fill the order.  However, when I called to place the order, I was told that they could NOT fill my requirement, the 48 hours notice was only for certain events/menus, I could not order some items ala carte to be ready within the time frame, etc.  I told the person I was speaking with that the menu was therefore extremely misleading and got a lot of attitude for my troubles.  The catering info states NONE of the limitations and they are snooty and  unaccommodating.  This left me quite in the lurch.
