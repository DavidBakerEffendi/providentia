This is by far my favorite restaurant. Yes its very small, very crowded and waiting time during peak hours. However, the food is absolutely amazing. The sangria is fantastic, I can drink a pitcher of it by myself. The servings are very small but unforgettable. Every time I eat there, I order the different ways they make paella. I loves croquettes de hamon. My boyfriend loves their emapanadas. its a different atmosphere compared to other restaurants. its overall one of the best places to eat in nyc.
