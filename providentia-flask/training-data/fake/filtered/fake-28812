Because of the street fair, we got to the Tavern an hour late for our reservation and they made us feel right at home there without an attitude and STILL  got us to the theater on time (Party of 7 plus).  I will definitely come to this establishment, again.  We had a wonderful dinner and an amazing time. Very comfortable, nice and reasonably priced.  Their pasta is made right on the premises.  Great service. Thumbs up!
