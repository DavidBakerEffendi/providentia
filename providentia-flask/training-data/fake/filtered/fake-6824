Given the option in Bed Stuy to do or don't dine here, I'd opt for don't. If I wanted to eat deviled eggs, drink a rolling rock, and blast Jay-Z to a conversation killing volume I would prefer to stay home with leftovers from last Sunday's softball potluck-- and I wouldn't have to wait 45 minutes, or have to consider a $3 Rolling Rock a novel treat. Perhaps it was a moment of poor ordering, but my octopus taco was lackluster and inferior to most New York taquerias, the nachos tasted like frozen gyoza expertly pan fried , and the E666, besides being fucking obnoxiously titled, failed to pair rich and salty flavors in a way that was more than the sum of their parts. Honestly, this restaurant is one of the more over rated experiences I've had in Brooklyn. The food was whatever..., the wait was long, and Do or Die's hyper cultivated image reeked of a swaggering pretension that borders on offensive. Given all the dining options in Brooklyn, or even all the dining options one has in general in this world in a lifetime, there's no reason to make this restaurant one of them.
