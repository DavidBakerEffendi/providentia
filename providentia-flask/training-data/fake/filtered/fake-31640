I ate here right before I moved to Chicago.  The office girls threw me a going away party and the wait staff did not disappoint!  They made sure we had a great experience.This place is new, and I wish it had opened years ago so I could have gone more often! First, The atmosphere:  Very cozy and quaint, sophisticated. You smell the food as soon as you are in the door!  Loved the amuse bouche offering. Food;  We split several appetizers and not a one disappointed us.  There is a lot of mushroom on the menu and in the ingredients, and one of my girlfriends is allergic.  The staff was happy to help her choose something suitable.  I had the pasta sampler, which was to die for! I highly recommend this for a nice adult gathering or first date.
