There are 2 drawbacks to this place. 1) the menu is on the wall which is a pain if you're seated with your back to the wall. 2) it is small which is somewhat of a double-edged sword as it makes this place cozy and intimate but also forces you to get cozy and intimate with the table next to you. The food however is more than enough to make me come back. The creole wings were the best wings I've had in NYC by a long shot. Everything else we had was delicious and they certainly gave you enough so you won't leave hungry. Had the chocolate pudding for dessert which was awesome and the perfect way to cap off wings/gumbo/bbq etc. Great place.
