so good. it's hard see from the street, Roberta's blends in so well with the rest of the neighborhood but once you locate their door you're in for a world for fresh-awesomeness. the pizza is killer of course but the people that work there really make it. everyone is super kind and chill. they grown a lot of their own produce on their roof! and are constantly showing up places with pop-up location like at SXSW and Art Basil miami. cool people do cool things and making kick ass pizza... what more is there to ask for?
