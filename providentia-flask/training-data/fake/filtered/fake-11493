I went to Baby Blues In April. I always stay in University City when I come to Philly. I love BBQ ,However I have never experienced a staff quite so Friendly and Attentive in all of my travels. Our Server "Nicole" was so on Point and accommodating with recommendations of the menu items (Rhino Steak PLT w/ Banana Pudding) I had to come back the next night for the Banana Pudding. The Food was Good needed a bit more seasoning but that may have just been my taste. I will for sure be back. The laid back vibe of the place also adds to it's charm... Â PS. If your looking for a quiet romantic spot.. This place isn't for you and I love it more because it not...
