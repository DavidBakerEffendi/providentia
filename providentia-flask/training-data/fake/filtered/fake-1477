We went for brunch today and it was one of the worst dining experiences in years. Seated in the small room with us was an extended family with a toddler and a baby. The baby didn't stop crying and the parents changed the toddler's diaper twice -- once on the floor and the other time on a seat (had to be a health code violation). When we complained to our waiter and to the manager, the response was disinterest. They did not offer to move us or to compensate us as many other restaurants would have done in this situation. I will NEVER go back to the White Dog.
