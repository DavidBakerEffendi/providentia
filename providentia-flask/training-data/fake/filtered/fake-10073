The Spotted Pig has lived up to it's name as quite the "spot" for the past several years; filling up with crowds of 30-somethings+ every Thursday thru Saturday night well before most folks have even left their offices, homes, and/or mid-afternoon matinee. I've gotta tell you, while the burgers and gnudi (pronounced nude-ee and therefore often referred to as naked gnocchi) are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the long waits and (hopefully) unintentional elbowing at the bar can be a bit vexing. The next time I head to Spotted Pig will be on a day I've opted to play hookie from work. While I love the bustling crowds when I'm on the prowl, the long waits for a table can be a real turn-off. It's a good thing the food is tasty enough to merit taking a special work "holiday" -- this may just be the only way you'll get to sit down, relax, and enjoy it!
