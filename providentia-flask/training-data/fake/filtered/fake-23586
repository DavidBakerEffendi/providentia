The food is NOT WORTH the 1 hour 15 minute wait for a table, and then almost an hour for the food to arrive. How long does it take to make hash and a Cuban sandwich? If crowds make you think the food is really good- go for it. I guess it makes good business sense to have people order lots of drinks while they wait and wait for a table or food while cheery smiling wait staff promise it will happen. Otherwise, stay away. Better food and drinks can be had at other solid restaurants without the hassles and hyperbole at 1/2 the price.
