Tough time to start a new restaurant let alone survive the economy, but when something new and different comes along with live entertainment, outside fire pits and horseshoes...try it.. The half rack of ribs are "awesome" any way you want them, but traditional rub, smoked to perfection thick with meat..juicy and falls off the bone..damn, wish I could do that. Carrots in butter, cornbread that is "moist" and potato salad with chunks of ham. Nachos loaded with ground beef, the way I like them..too much for I so bring a friend...Enjoy...Maybe MM works for another local competing restaurant...check this out for yourself
