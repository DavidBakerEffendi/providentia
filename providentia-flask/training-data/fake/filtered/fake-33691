Excellent service, very good food, nice atmosphere. Perfect for a business dinner or for a date. The rest of the review is a little picky, but the bottom line is that this is a great place; I'd definitely go again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to a friend. The rest of the review: not the best Italian food I've ever had, but pretty good. Had a house salad and a monk fish special. The salad was very fresh; the fish was tasty, but could have been more flavorful. I like the sauce they put with the fish, but would have preferred a little more. The vegetable mix underneath the fix included braised spinach, and it was out of sight. Followed dinner with some hazelnut gelato; good flavor, but it contained some ice chunks, which made me wonder how fresh it was. Now about the service: stellar. Unbelievable. Very attentive without being intrusive. Sounds cliche, but they really did supply me with whatever I needed before I realized I needed it.
