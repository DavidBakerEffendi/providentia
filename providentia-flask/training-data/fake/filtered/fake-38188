I'd like to make some suggestions. For the employees of Greek Lady: You shouldn't work there, nor anywhere for that matter, if you are going to give every customer a horrible attitude. Haven't you people heard anything about GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE. Second, you guys got my order wrong like 5 times already. Come on guys, give me a break. And lastly, you're food is pretty good. Not great, but good. However, it's not good enough to make me wait 50 minutes. I even ordered ahead of time by phone a few times. And when I got there to pick it up, I ended up having to wait another 50 minutes.
