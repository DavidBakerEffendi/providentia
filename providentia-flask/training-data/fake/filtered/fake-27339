My friends and I have already gone back!  Besides the great location - two blocks from Grand Central, the food was amazing.  The décor feels old class, with funky wallpaper and chairs hanging from the ceiling.  A huge flat screen TV in the back is the perfect place to gather a crowd and watch a game. The staff was nothing but friendly and the bartenders (also dressed old school) were attentive and always available to get you a drink.  The circular bar really adds to the place, and for the ladies, there are hooks for your bags!   While the downstairs is for a larger crowd with another bar and beer taps at your own table; cool pictures hang on the wall that make you feel like your reliving history.  We'll be back again!  Thanks for making a cool spot in midtown.
