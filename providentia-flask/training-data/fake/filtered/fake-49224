OMG this place was fantastic and will be there every weekend. I was sceptical about going at first but my friends convinced me to go. I was iffy about partying at a restaurant. I was wrong. The atmosphere was amazing, the music was hype, there was a dj and the blue long island was the best I've ever had. Drinks were reasonable priced and there was a man circling the place with bottles of henny to replenish people's glasses! He was the life of the party. If u haven't been, go check it out.
