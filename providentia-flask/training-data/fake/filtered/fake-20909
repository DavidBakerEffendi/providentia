Been there a bunch of times and the crowd gets older and skeevier.  Their food is really good, but the ambiance doesn't make for a great dining experience.  Went to the Montclair location and was told that "backward caps" are not allowed at the bar.  It's a bar!  Seems like they are trying to attract a more uppity crowd. West Orange location has a better setup for watching games, and has a bit more friendly of a vibe.
