I love going to Sakagura when I need to unwind, find that peaceful place away from the bustle of the city and when I am with a close friend. I find it's atmosphere to be so pleasant and the Sake selections are outstanding. I tend to eat very little here so I cannot give a fair review but everything I have had has been very fresh and delicious. To me, Sakagura is a refuge and a place for experiencing the warmth of Sake and good friends..highly recommend
