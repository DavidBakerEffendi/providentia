I LOVE SUSHI PALACE You will leave this restaurant feeling so satisfied. The sushi is all freshly made. include sashimi ,sushi, roll,hand roll,special rolls. And for those people who don't like sushi (I don't know these types of people but I am sure they exist), there is high quality food for you all as well!  They have all different kinds of teriyaki  tempura soup sald noodles also dessert. $18.95 for all of these.it is a super deal.
