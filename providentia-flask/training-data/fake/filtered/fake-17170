Love this place. You are generally seated within a decent amount of time, and while you wait you can watch television and snack on peanuts with no clean up necessary. The steaks are a pretty good quality and you can choose your own upon being greeted by a server. The food is tasty and served in a timely manner. We have been going there ever since they opened up in West Haven. A special mention to our server of the night tonight, Tripp. He is an Austin, TX native and has a wonderful way of establishing a friendly rapport with his customers. He managed to make everyone at our table smile, from my 79 year old grandmother to my 2 year old son. He helped make our dining experience an incredibly pleasant one! I don't have a single complaint!
