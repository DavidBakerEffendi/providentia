Having only one kid-free night while we were in the city my husband and I headed to the Village...being from TN we know nothing about the hotspots, so Yelp reviews in hand we set out for the Red Lion...well they had a cover and were packed and we were looking for a place we could have a conversation without shouting, so we found The Malt House next door...and what a pleasant surprise. If you're looking for your dime a dozen piss beer selection this is NOT the place for you. Serving mostly craft beers (draft in mason jars! or straight from the bottle) combined with a friendly bartender, Owen, who took time to talk with us as well as every other patron we saw enter meant a lot on our night out and made for an awesome evening. The total ambience of the place - from music to warm wood tables and very clean bathrooms was great. We wish nothing but the best for the Malt House (which just opened a few weeks ago) and hope to one day return. Cheers to Owen and his staff!
