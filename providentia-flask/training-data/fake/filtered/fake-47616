Great charcoal fired pizza. The small size is adequate for two people unless you're really starving. Get something standard and enjoy. Oh and remember... you're not there for the service, but for the food. (All told the service is okay, but certainly not a high point). Take a few minutes and stand just inside the entrance watching them make a pizza. From throwing the mozzarella slices at the dough, to kneading and tossing manually, to masterfully navigating pizzas through the huge oven with only one door, you'll learn a lot and gain sincere appreciation for the art. These guys know what they are doing. Worth the wait. To work off the grease and cheese you'll enjoy so much, walk back to lower Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge.
