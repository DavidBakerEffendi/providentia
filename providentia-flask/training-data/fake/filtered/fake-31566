Came to Blend on a Saturday night for a little get together for my best friends B-day Dinner. Had a reservation for eight and lost the table since we arrived a couple of minutes late, so I do assume responsibility for that. We then had to wait quite a while for a table so we got a little impatient, but it was  understandable since Blend is very popular, therefor a very busy restaurant. Carlos, However, one of the restaurant managers (or assistant Manager not very sure) turned our night around. No one went up to him to complain, he simply was very observant and noticed that we looked a little uncomfortable. He greeted us kindly and joked with us a bit, he even got us all light vodka shots while he expedited our wait for the table. After we had our dinner, he came to our table with a big bowl of Sangria and a birthday card for the birthday girl..:D..made her night..Must say Carlos the reason why I give Blend a 5 Star rate because at the end of the day Customer Service & Satisfaction is what's most important and he really outdid himself, both in service and personality. Food: Food was simply amazing, hats off to the kitchen staff and chef. We had the Guacamole, Crispy Arepas (  Must Try), and the Tostones Nachos for appetizers. All very delicious. I had the Pollo a La Plancha as my entre, sounds simple right? It was incredible, perfectly cooked, settles very light on your stomach, and the marinade with the lemon butter sauce gave that melting in your mouth effect. aaannnndddd, the food came to us very fast. Drinks: The shot, the classic mojito, the coconut mojito and the Piña Colada were all very good, yes I tried them all ;} I'm looking forward to visiting Blend again, next time on  a regular night when is not as busy. Till then, I will envision that perfect pollo melting in my mouth. Thank You Carlos!!!
