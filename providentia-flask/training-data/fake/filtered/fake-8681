What a bust. Five of us shared salads and pastas, and everyone had a cocktail. Cocktails were overly sweet and imbalanced. The spinach salad had NO dressing on it whatsoever and the arugula salad had only a tiny bit of oil. My squid ink pasta was overcooked and flavorless, with rubbery calamari. Desserts tasted like something that comes out of a display case at a diner. And it wasn't that reasonably priced, for such mediocre food. We came here only because we needed to grab a bite before getting drinks at awesome Dynaco. We will definitely not go back.
