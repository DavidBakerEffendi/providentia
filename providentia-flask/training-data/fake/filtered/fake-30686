I gotta say I loved it!   Went there last night with a friend who lives in the neighborhood and another buddy.  Was impressed by the ambiance.  Finally a pub that isn't overlit or looks like more was spent on interior design than working on the food.. I wasn't sure what I wanted because the menu all looked good.  It all came down to the Sheppard's Pie or the Fish and Chips.  Fish and Chips won out but my friend got it and I tried it.  Delicious, real potatoes (not out of a damn box) and not oversalted like many do. The fish and chips were amazing!  Not too overbattered and much more fish than most in this city make.  Obviously, someone in the back knew what they were doing and the aioli that it was paired with I could've eaten a bucket of it. Tried a wonderful dark ale with a crispy chocolate backnote.  Thank God, there wasn't a national brand of crap on the taps.  All were different and unique. The server we had was fun and knew her stuff. Only thing that didn't get the 5th star was the food was dragging for a long while but the company and the conversations we were having didn't make it seem as long as it was.
