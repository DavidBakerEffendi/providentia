Went to City Steam on a Saturday night with another couple and had a great experience. Upon entrance, the staff (manager, hostesses, wait staff) treated us like old friends. Between all of us, we ordered a roma pizza, peppercorn steak, fish tacos with a side of macaroni and cheese, and sweet potato tater tots. They were all DELICIOUS! No wait at the door and tons of friendly faces. Virginia, our waitress, was super helpful and very accommodating to my wife. Also, Omair even checked in on us to make sure things were going well and gave us outstanding recommendations. This experience knocked it out the park!}
