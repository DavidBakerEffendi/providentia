Beautiful bar. One of the nicer bars I have been to in the area. It's a shame that the food is so overpriced. The price wouldn't be a problem if the serving sizes were reasonable or if the food was fresh. The sanria is watered down and I have been served well vodka when I have ordered top shelf. Terrible service. They are gonna lose a lot of business
