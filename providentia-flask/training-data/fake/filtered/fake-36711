I have nothing but love for PYT. Great food and drinks. Great Music. Great People. Great prices.  It's sort of like Cheers, where everyone knows your name. The staff is super-friendly, super-cool, and super-stylish. In the summer, it's the spot to BE because of the outdoor seating and the great location at the Piazza. The burgers of the week are PHENOMENAL, and it just has a great vibe. The grilled cheese is kind of amazing.  It's just the place to go for a drink, have a bite, and chill with friends. Who doesn't want to do that!
