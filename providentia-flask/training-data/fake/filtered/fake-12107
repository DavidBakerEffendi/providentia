Has a sandwich ever made you "weak in the knees?"  Well, the richness of Diner's open-faced Rabbit Terrine and Chicken Liver Pate sandwich will make you "swoon."  Thin slices of rabbit terrine and chicken liver pate sit on a grilled baguette, drizzled with house-made Cayenne Mayonnaise and sprinkled with pickled Seasonal Vegetables.  Not a single element of this sandwich is superfluous.  Each ingredient was the perfect compliment to the other.  This is a sandwich that must be tried whenever it appears on the menu.
