There's a reason this place has been here since 1939... Don't even think about it, just go, get some square slices, sit down at one of the outside tables and eat. You never had a slice like this one: sauce is on top. cheese underneath so it looks like a marinara slice, but don't be fooled. Dough is tender and delicious. After, go to the middle counter and get the best spumoni on the planet.
