As a local resident I am a regular customer of Big Fish and am happy to have such a fine restaurant in my neighborhood.  We have been regulars for the last 5 years or more.  My husband and I look forward to the fall specials as we LOVE the duck with pumpkin bread pudding.  Their early bird special is $15 per person for an app, entree and dessert.  Love the fresh fish, fabulous scalloped potaoes and the jalapeno cheese biscuits.  Great relaxing atmoshphere.
