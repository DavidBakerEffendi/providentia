Favorite place in the city so far! My boyfriend and I had a date night there last night after not having been there since the summer. We started with the avocado tartine on whole grain toast which was so good and such an easy 'at home' idea (fresh avocado on a toasted whole grain toast with fresh squeezed lemon juice and chili flakes on top). I ordered the smoked trout black lentil salad which was so delicious and packed with so many healthy ingredients (avocado, arugula, lentils, goat cheese, walnuts, dried cranberries, cherry tomatoes, smoked trout) leaving me completely satisfied and not feeling gross afterwards. He ordered (like always) the vegetarian couscous that comes with a huge dollop of fresh hummus on top and a pesto type olive oil around the tower of couscous. In the past, I have also tried their salmon pot pie which was also delicious, but honestly anything on that menu will leave you with a smile. Over the summer this was our go-to spot. The location is perfect, the European feel it gives to you is so charming and the cute little cafe style seating outside on a hot summer day is the best part about it. Cash only though and expect a wait. Next time I am trying their breakfast.
