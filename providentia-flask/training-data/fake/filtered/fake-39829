We had to wait a bit at this tiny Thai on Ninth Avenue, but it was worth it. Food is fresh and spicy and tasty, and service excellent. We had papaya salad, roasted spare ribs (yummy) a roast pork soup (terrific but a bit spicy) and a great roast pork and crab and noodle concoction. Best of all, they had a rice pudding with a pumpkin custard for dessert. A really terrific place, but also tiny. When we left the line was out the door.
