I love this place! I called them about an hour before on a Saturday night trying to get in for dinner with a group of 6 people. They said it was busy, but they would try their best to accommodate us. I mentioned that one of the people in the party was elderly (my grams!) and they said that they definitely didn't want her to wait, so if we could be there in a 30 minutes, they would hold a table for us. We ended up being there in more like an hour because my grandmother isn't as quick as she used to be, and they immediately sat us at a big table in the back. I was so sure they would have given our table away as the place was packed, but they honored our reservation ..even though we were late! So impressive. Everyone was so warm and friendly, and the food was delicious! I had the pasta with walnut pesto (I don't even like pesto, and I loved this!) The best was their tomato salad with potatoes and greens. The overall vibe of this place was just so warm and cozy, lit up by candles- we all felt so at home. I would highly recommend this place to anybody looking for a cozy, quaint, no frills rustic italian spot!
