I eat here almost three times a week. The food is delicious, well spiced, and I appreciate the fact that all the utensils and take out materials are biodegradable and environmentally friendly.  Try the Ba'al salad - fennel and chickpea, it's spectacular.  Also- the homemade Za'atar bread is really pretty tops; Supposedly the owners mother hand roasts the spices and mail's them weekly from the middle east-  You can really taste the difference!
