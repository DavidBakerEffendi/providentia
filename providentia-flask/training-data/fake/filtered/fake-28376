Have been going to Kyklades for decades.  The octopus is always unbelievably tender and it seems like the grilled red snapper is better than the last time.  The wait is awful but then again that's why it so busy, just because it's so very good.  The owner makes a point of recognizing you and saying hello.  Once I saw him in the bank and he remembered me and gave me his usual warm greeting.     Sometimes they sell out of the galatobouriko...but that OK too because most of the time we are so full we can't eat another bite.  They are truly the best place in Astoria, hand down.
