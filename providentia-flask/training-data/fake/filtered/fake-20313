Worst meal I have had in a long time. We waited 20 minutes after our reservation time to be seated, because they seated a group of walk-ins first. Staff speaks minimal English and did not understand our allergy requests. The food was tasteless and overcooked. Steak that was requested medium rare was served well done. They were out of most of the fountain drinks and juices and were only able to offer us diet coke and water... Without ice. Overall, the meal was very disappointing. I will not be eating here again.
