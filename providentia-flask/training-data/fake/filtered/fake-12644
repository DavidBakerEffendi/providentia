This is my favorite steak in brooklyn. I would take a meal here over peter lugers any day. Get here early or be prepared to wait a couple hours, but with the movie theater on grand just a few blocks away it wouldn't hurt to put your name down, see a movie, and return for a fantastic dinner. My favorites include the axe handle rib eye for two, long beans, and bib salad. Also the octopus is exceptional. Service is mediocre but that doesn't effect the overall satisfaction the food provides.
