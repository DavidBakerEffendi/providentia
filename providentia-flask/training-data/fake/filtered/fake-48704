We wanted to grab a quick dinner after a show this past winter.  I found Empanada Mama online and it was close to the show so we decided to give them a try. We got a table quickly, though the restaurant is very small.   We got the guacamole and fried banana chips and they were out of this world.  We ordered a variety of their empanadas and they were all fantastic. Every one we tried tasted fresh and delicious.   I can't wait to go back and taste of more hot pockets of deeeelicious meats!   They had an amazing variety of the basics and some creative ideas.
