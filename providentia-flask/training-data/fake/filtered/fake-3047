About a week ago, on a Saturday night, I had gone to Cuban Pete's for my boyfriend's mom's birthday. We were refereed to go by numerous people that we knew. We were also warned to go early because it can get packed. We went about 5 pm and we were instantly seated. BUT YOU NEED TO GO EARLY! The place is BYOB and we brought come Cornonas. We started off with the fried goat cheese balls and chicken empanadas. Delicious! We each ordered a different entree. I had the pollo con mango. To DIE FOR! The dish was served with coconut rice and yam. The flavors complemented eachother beautifully.      The atmosphere was incredible. Very fun and entertaining. The waiters were a bit hard to understand, but we made do, and the little hats that were apart of their uniforms were cute.      I absolutly will go there again. As long as you keep in mind that it's a busy place, so the wait may be long, you will have an excellent time.
