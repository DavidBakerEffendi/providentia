I will begin by saying that our decision to dine at La Sirene was based solely on great reviews and I am shocked to see how many people found this place acceptable, to say the least!  Foie gras had no flavor, goat cheese tart was not memorable.  Roasted lamb leg with white wine creme de garlic confit sauce was sliced lamb with overpowered gravy sauce!  Seared duck with cherry sauce was swimming in sea of cherry jam as it grasped for life!  Worst, when ordered side dish of potatoes together with main course, the potatoes never arrived and we were notified "It takes time to cook potatoes!"  If potatoes cannot be cooked in time with lamb and duck, I am not sure what more I can say for  La Sirene.
