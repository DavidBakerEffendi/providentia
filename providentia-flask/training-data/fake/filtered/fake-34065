I have been going here for 3 years and never had a bad meal! Whether the place is packed or empty - the food is fresh and delicious. This is the official home of the FOODGASM!  Your mouth will water with every bite.  We tried a bunch of appetizers today forgoing the entree and could not have been more pleased.  Stuffed calamari - I was skeptical at first, but WHOA!  This hands down is one of the top 5 restaurants in North Jersey - should not be missed.
