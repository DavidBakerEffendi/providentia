Amazing prices, very affordable... the owner (Emir) will go out of his way to make your experience pleasant.  It's a SMALL restaurant, but it really has charm and they use the space quite well.  It's in one of the best areas of the West Village. I recommend the Chopped Salad... excellent dressing.  And the French toast is the best in the city! Don't come here expecting "Mexican"... the chef is from Mexico City and this is excellent cuisine, not a taco joint!
