Tried this place based on yelp search and reviews. Went early (5:30) on a Sat night. Easy parking on the street. Seated at a small round table for two, four would be cramped. Waiters and waitresses were attentive but knew nothing about the menu. Didn't even offer to find out the answers to our questions regarding menu ingredients. Bar menu was excellent with great beer choices. Specialty drinks were excellent, but on the small side and expensive. The tapas were great and the portions adequate. We ended up taking leftovers home. The meat/cheese platter, chorizo, calamari, tres leches were all excellent. Â As we were leaving the place started to fill and the bar was more active. Overall, excellent food and drink in a lively bar atmosphere. Waiters could be better informed.
