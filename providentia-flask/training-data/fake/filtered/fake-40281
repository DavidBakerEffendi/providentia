I took the Q from midtown and kept wondering how long this journey was going to take. "Where is this DiFara's?", I wondered. "Is this the pizza nirvana I was promised"? YES. Period. Every pizza place has it's good and bad days. The best ones have more of the former and less of the latter. DiFara's is just great pie. Maybe not always perfect, etc. but it's damn good. Unless I ever make it out to the Phoenix area to see my brother and sample Pizzeria Bianco, I'm going with DiFara's as the all time best slice joint in the country. The two slices of pepperoni I had were among the two best I've ever eaten. There's a long wait? Bring a book. The pizza was too oily? It's good for you. The price is too much? Sorry, baby, there's only one original.
