Some of the best pizza I have had! I was working on a cruise ship for 6 months and my bf came into town to meet me each time. He told me about this place and after the first time I went there, I made sure we went back each time I was in port - and then made sure I had extra to bring back on the ship with me! The pizza had a thin and crispy crust, with just the right amount of cheese and sauce! My fav is the margherita pizza. I hope it didn't change like the previous reviewers had mentioned - I plan on going back next time I am in the NYC area!
