This place is a gem, but I already knew that because they also have locations in willow grove and montgomeryville and I go there all the time too so it's about time I write my 1st yelp review ever for Vic! The fish is fresh, rice is cooked perfectly and the simply elegant presentation makes me smile when it's ready! The 3 rolls for $11 is awesome. Tiger roll is the bomb!
