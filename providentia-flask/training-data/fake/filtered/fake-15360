First off I just want to say that my wife and I were really enjoying ourselves here and this would have been a five star review if it wasn't for the very unprofessional manager.   My wife and I were visiting New York and some friends had recommended that we try this place.  We went on Saturday and after reading some reviews about how busy this place gets on the weekends we figured we had better get there early.  We were there around 5 pm and we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  The restaurant is very cute and cozy and the menu looked great.  We ordered the calamari to start and then I had the stuffed pepper and my wife got empanadas for our main course.  The calamari was good.  They use a cornmeal crust which we really enjoyed but the dish was a little dry.  After finishing our appetizer and waiting a while for our main course we asked our waitress to check on our food and she apologized for the wait and went to tell the manager that we had been waiting.  The manager angrily said that this isn't McDonalds and a 20 minute wait was more than appropriate.  She didn't even seem to mind that she was saying it in complete ear shot of our table.  Our food came up a couple of minutes later and our waitress apologized again for the wait and made sure we had everything we needed.  At that point we just wanted to get out of there.  The food was pretty good, the service was excellent from the waitress and the busboys, but the manager really ruined this place for us.  We got the check and got out of there and got a goodbye and thank you from our waitress and a scowl from the manager.  Scowling, unfriendly managers are a dime a dozen in NYC but a manager who openly doesn't care about her customers at all, that was a first.
