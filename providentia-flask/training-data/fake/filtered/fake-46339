Be there early (6:30 ish), otherwise your waiting time might be 1 hour or more.   I went there around 6:30pm Monday and waited for around 10-15 minutes.   Must try - Akamaru Modern & Hirata Buns - delicious!! My friend and I ordered 2 ramen, 2 appetizers and a beer and it's around $70 total.  I can't say it's cheap for ramen but it's absolutely delicious, so it's worth the price.
