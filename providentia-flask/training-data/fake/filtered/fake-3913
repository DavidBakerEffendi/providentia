Been here a number of times to eat and once for a show. The food never disappoints--fresh and well prepared, although a tad on the heavy side. The beers and liquor selections are lost on me. Upstairs is a mixed bag. It's kind of cramped and access to the bar is tricky. The balcony area is more civilized.
