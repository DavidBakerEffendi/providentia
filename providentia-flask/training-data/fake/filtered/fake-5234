This place is my home away from home.  If you're looking for good, hearty Italian food it doesn't get any better than this!  The atmosphere is warm, the wait staff funny and friendly and the owner is always sure to stop by your table to make sure your experience is the best.  The baked Ziti is to die for, the deserts out of this world and for those of us watching our weight the salads are as delectable as they are healthy.  My grandparents were from Italy and going to Marzullo's is always like being with them again!  ENJOY!
