Just went tonight after reading the good reviews.  Although a little pricey, the food was well worth it.  The crab cakes were wonderful, the fillet was perfectly seasoned and cooked, the desserts were delicious, and the specials were fresh and seasonal.  My husband and I enjoyed ourselves in the dimly lit atmosphere.  The wait staff was courteous and very personable.  I would recommend going there and plan on going again soon.  I'd also recommend reservations as the restaurant part of the banquet hall was completely full by 7pm.  We were lucky we made reservations for 6 others without reservations were waiting, but had a nice bar to do so at.
