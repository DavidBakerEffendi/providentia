I need to post two thank-you's here. The first - to chef Michal Anthony for crafting a meal I won't soon forget. The second - to eateryexpert.com. This website has given me excellent restaurant advice on multiple occasions - with Gramercy Tavern topping the list. Just an all around fantastic meal. The wine list is extraordinarily extensive, the food delicious and the wait staff attentive and precise. We went for the tasting menu which proved to be an excellent decision. Next time I want to try the tavern (I've heard the pulled pork sandwich is worth the price of admission)
