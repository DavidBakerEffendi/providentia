before i decided to write about my experience in Gramercy Tavern, I looked through and so so many high ratings. that made me to give them even less stars for the following reasons. 1. all the 4 and 5 star reviews appear like that the chef or any other employee himself wrote it. The food and menu descriptions are so detailed that it raises suspicion that Danny Mayer hired few professionals, who's full time occupation is to write a review, for himself. 2. food and service was good but non of it was worth the bill in the amount of $480 for 2 people. for that money I don't want to look for the waiter so I can have my white wine refilled, neither I want my white wine so much in the glass, that by the time I get to half of it it is already warm. I will be back there for lunch only because it is close and convenient to where I work.
