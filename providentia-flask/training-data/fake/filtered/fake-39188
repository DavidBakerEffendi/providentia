I met some girlfriends here for a happy hour a little while ago and we all had such a great time.  The bar does get quite crowded, it was happy in Times Square, so maybe the other location doesn't get too bad.  But, even though it was crowded, we didn't feel like we needed to fight all the other patrons for the bar tenders' attention.  I also tried their wings - so tasty!  Definitely give this place a try and order the wings!  They aren't your typical bar food wings either!!
