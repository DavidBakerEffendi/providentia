I sat at the bar with 1 of my friends..waiting for our other 2 friends to arrive.. It took a long time to get anyone to acknowledge us. The bartender finally did and was clueless..took our drink order.. broke a glass and got distracted and forgot to bring our drinks..he was tending to someone else. DUH!!! We had to flag down another barserver who made excuses for the first one.. When the other 2 guests arrived and we ordered an app..we asked if it could be transferred to our table.. that didn't happen until I had to ask the hostess (again)...That was our 2 Star bar experience. Also, not very good beer selection and when I asked the bartender what they had he was so lazy and he responded with well, just the "usual stuff.."DUH!!! Dinner was better but nothing spectacular...I much rather would go to Triumph next time!
