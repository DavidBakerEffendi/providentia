Awesome curries and they have this amazing dish that I love and can't really find anywhere else called Chiang Mai Noodle..also love their Thai iced tea and coffee..good prices and great service. The server is always so sweet and comes by in a timely manner. Would recommend this place to anything looking for awesome Thai food in a nice, quiet atmosphere...can't say enough about this place! :)
