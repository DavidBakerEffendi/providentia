i tried bluebird for the first time last week, i hadn't been to the old location but i had heard so many good things i was excited to try to new location closer to home... right before i went, three people told me horror stories about their service and the food... BUT IT WAS PHENOMENAL. the waiter (dont know his name, blondish brown haired guy) was super friendly and nice but not pushy but still attentive... the food was DELICIOUS. yeah ok, overpriced... but the burger was not even $13 dollars if i remember and it was a half pound of meet. i couldn't even finish it. i've spent $20 dollars on a meal i've dominated, so in my mind if i couldnt' finish $13-worth, that's a good deal. delish. OH and if you check in on foursq for the first time there, you get a free block of cheese which is worth like $7 normally!
