unique, delicious organic foods excellent presentation. I would go back in a heartbeat. When I went, I ordered a bison burger. It's something that isn't typically offered at many other places. I prefer eating organic, and Bare Burger shows that healthy foods can be tasty. The only negative thing was that the place was hard to find because their sign is difficult to read.
