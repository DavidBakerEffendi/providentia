Wasn't thrilled. The waiter was running around like a chicken without a head. My dish, sesame chicken, came out cold and I had to send it back. The chicken sate appetizer wasn't served with peanut sauce, and the waiter said they "didn't have any." I was charged for two beers when I only ordered one. The ambience was nice, but I wasn't at all satisfied with the food or the entire experience.
