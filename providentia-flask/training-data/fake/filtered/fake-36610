My husband and I visit Burlington every summer.  With all the rain we had Big Daddy's deliver to our hotel room.  We ordered a dozen wings and more than 1/2 HAD FEATHERS ON THEM!!!  When I called and spoke to the owner he offered to send me another dozen.  Um, no thanks, we couldn't eat the ones we had.  When I asked for a refund, he pretty much hung up the phone on me.  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!!
