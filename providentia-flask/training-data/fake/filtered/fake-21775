I went with the reviews and Â had it on my "must see list"...the first night I was in there a gray baby rat ran across the floor I screamed and left. It took me 2 days to go back. Basic 4 Vegetarian Snack Bar is great! Their vegetarian cheese steak is as close as you can get and don't forget to add on the sweet potato fries. Tried to go to Delilahs but during the lines are insane! Went to the Crepe spot across from Delilahs but I wasn't impressed with the service. The lady taking the orders left us standing there for 2 minutes. Another customer came and she was quick to ask them for their order, they asked if we ordered already, and she had the audacity to say we already ordered!!! WE NEVER EVEN SPOKE TO HER!!! In all, its a def a foodies dream come true...def a big variety of foods. Oh and not all places take credit cards.
