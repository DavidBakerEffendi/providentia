THE FOOD: Their fries are delicious, hand cut and crisp, really enjoyed them. The sliders were "ok" to me. Tried their pulled pork one which was good, good taste. Then I tried the bacon slider which was more of the "eh" one. I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't go back and have it. Tried their chipotle - really good. Loved loved LOVED their BBQ sauce, added flavor to the burger. SERVICE: An extra star for the top notch service, lovely waitresses and great attitude. ATMOSPHERE: The music is brilliant, loved the whole diner feel. Not really suitable for a large group but it's great if you and 2-3 friends want to try something new. Sitting at the bar adds to it.
