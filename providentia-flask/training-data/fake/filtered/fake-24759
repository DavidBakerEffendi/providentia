I love this place. It has a total lack of pretense and the food is cheap and superb! Our waitress was charming, my Gramigna con Salsiccia e Peperoni was spicy and delicious and only 9.50! wtf! . My only problem was Â the lighting in the place...a bit too dark and the fried artichoke although an interesting novelty lacked substance and was a bit too bitter. but i will definitely be returning.
