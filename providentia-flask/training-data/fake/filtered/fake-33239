Yesterday we were on our lunch break and decided to try out the Front Street Bistro. Up until then we had only seen movies there.  We sat outside on the sidewalk and ordered ice tea, I had a turkey burger and my friend had  a ceaser salad and salmon. The server checked on us twice as we were enjoying the nice weather. The turkey burger was big and cooked just right. I also has fries with cheddar salt. My friend could not finish her salad so they put it in a box for her to take with her. We are always looking for a new place for lunch. I think we found a nice one. Next week the Capital Grille Mary
