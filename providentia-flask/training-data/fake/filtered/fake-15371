I went to El Almacen recently on a Saturday night and although it was a bit Â too "cozy" (as in the tables are very close to one another and it gets very crowded), I actually had a great time. The food was amazing. I had the Entrana steak and it was cooked to perfection. The truffle fries were delicious. And overall, the service was good. I would definitely go back.
