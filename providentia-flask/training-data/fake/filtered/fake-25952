A high end surprise experience when we expected a 'grille'-like casual restaurant. Service extremely professional and knowledgeable on menu and wine list. Oysters and a truly al dente pasta app made for tasty starters. I had the whole branzino- grilled and flavored to perfection and the wife had the lobster which she thought was excellent. Milk choc malted cake seemingly deconstructed along with a brioche bread pudding closed out our meal. Comfortably full and extremely satisfied albeit for some big$$$- but felt it was completely worth it. Right next to the Conrad main entrance on North End Ave with very limited signage- we were actually standing right in front of it but looking at the maps app had us circle the block completely on a subzero night- but upon arrival it was all good!
