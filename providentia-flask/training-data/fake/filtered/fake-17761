Our favorite restaurant/pub.  The food is amazing and service is exceptional.  Best Reuben's by far in the New England area.  We are frequent customers to the Hanover location, our favorite stop before a hockey game, they always accommodate our larger group with smiles and laughter every time!!  5 stars every visit!!
