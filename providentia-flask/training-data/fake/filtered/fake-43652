October 2008 Came a long way to pay our respects to Heath Ledger's project and enjoyed 4 great bottles of Bud at 4pm in the afternoon. We would have eaten but the cooker was out of action! Would have loved Â to have stayed into the evening but only on a four day trip to NY. We headed off into the rain with two donated umbrellas. Thank you Granville.
