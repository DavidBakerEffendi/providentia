made a reservation for a party of 15 a day in advance - reservation accepted - then several hrs. later get a call that for a party of more than 8 they only offer a prix fixe menu for $75/person - i told them that this was never told to me and that it is not on their site - they acknowledged that their restaurant sites are not updated - at this late time i cancelled and easily made a reservation at another Park Slope restaurant - there are too many good restaurants in Park Slope and nearby neighborhoods to be treated like this
