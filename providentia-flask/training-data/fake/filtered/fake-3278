While it is outwardly unassuming (only a small, green sign hangs outside the door that puns "KEEP CALM AND GROW ON"--a nod to their commitment to use fresh, locally-grown ingredients) inside it has real presence. The atmosphere is refreshing: a sleek design reminiscent of Momofuku (crack pie!) with lots of light and a surprisingly tasteful music selection. ( I heard both Al Green AND Smokey Robinson!) The staff was helpful and charming, eager to answer any questions I had without sounding condescending or annoyed. There was a palpable sense of comradery among the workers, which translated into a more pleasant experience for me, as a customer. The food was tasty. I ordered the Spicy Garlic, which was, as the name suggests, spicy, but very dimensional--certainly not overpowering. Paired very well with my orange-banana-lemon smoothie, which was clean and refreshing! Am likely to return on a regular basis.
