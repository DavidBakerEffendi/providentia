These guys SAVED me this Sunday. I had a meeting with 10-20 people happening on 43rd when the original location cancelled on me 4 hours before the start time. Bea was on the same block as that spot. When I gave them my sob story they gave me the atrium, closed and reserved for us for the night, no minimum or deposit or anything. They assured me that it wasn't a big deal as it was a slow Sunday night, they don't mind, etc. but really, they did me a huge favor and were really accommodating of all our little requests and arrangements. The servers and the managers I interacted with were all really Â lovely, even though we weren't the biggest ticket party they've ever had, I'm sure. On top of that, the food was really, really good! I got the mushroom pizza - it was a delicious vegetarian option (in addition to being one of the cheaper items on the menu). Everyone else was really enjoying their food and drinks as well. They told me that normally there's a 25 person minimum on that atrium, so if you have a party of that size, I'd definitely recommend it - they close the doors and windows so you have a very private space with lovely decor, and apparently you can also arrange to have access to their projector. So yes, sending a big THANK YOU and five stars to Bea!
