I went in to the flying meatball for the first time today i am a frequent customer of the restaurant they own "il capriccio" and i love the food there so i decided to check out the store. I loved it? great atmosphere , clean and everything was neatly placed and the employees all greeted me and were very pleasant. I purchased some cookies imported from italy and they have great sauces i bought the pesto and marinara along with some pasta and of course the meatballs they are excellent i'v had them at the restaurant was so excited to know i can get them in a store and bring them home to enjoy. I also picked up a sandwich the chicken cutlet with arugula and parmesan cheese just the right amount for me. i am a strong believer of quality over quantity!! Most people aren't educated on how much garbage and chemicals is put in the foods we buy the flying meatballs carries quality products cookies i bought don't have any bad stuff in them so i don't feel bad eating them or giving them to my small children everything on their shelves it free of lots of bad things you may pay a little more but you are doing yourself a huge favor in the long run.
