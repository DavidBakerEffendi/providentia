I am sitting at Genos at this very moment, eating the absolute worst excuse for a cheese steak.  This tastes like microwaved crap, on spongy bread, topped with canned onions, and horrible cheese whiz, served to me  by the rudest counter person, that mumbled to me because her mouth was full of food while taking my order.  This will be my last time wasting my money here.  Off to get take away from the place across the street, for later when my stomach heals from this culinary attack.
