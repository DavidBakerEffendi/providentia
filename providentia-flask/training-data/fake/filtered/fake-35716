My family has always been here after my sister's dance recitals when we were younger and to this day, this place serves amazing pizza. The whole place is nice and casual with a great local family feel to it. Pizza is always well done. The crust is a bit hard but delicious to snack on after the meal when you're just talking with the rest of the table. The cheese isn't too thick but isn't thin at all. And there's something about that sauce that makes me love them so much. I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for some nice pizza to dine in with. Food 5/5 Service 5/5 Atmosphere 3/5 (it's a great place but hard to avoid the noisy kids)
