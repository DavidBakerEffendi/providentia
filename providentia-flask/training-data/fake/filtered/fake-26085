Amazing original cocktails and exceptional vegan food. The food is delicious, satisfying and approachable by non-vegans / vegetarians as well. The atmosphere is like stepping into an old-time 1930s movie scene, whilst remaining hip and trendy. This is a must visit bar and is sure to be one of the hottest spots in the city.
