So far, this place has the best pie in Bayonne - We have tried many locations over the past two years, and they knock it out of the park. The sauce is great, and they make it just how you like it. Delivery is super fast, and they get the order right the first time. The heroes are OK (nothing special), and fried calamari is really yummy, though a bit on the salty side - but great if dipped in the sauce that comes with it. Only downside is that they only offer one liter sodas, rather than the standard 2 liter bottles, which feels a bit like a rip-off, as it's over $2.50 per 1L bottle. Overall, I am very happy with Pizza Masters - if you want a great pie - this is the best Bayonne has to offer! I will definitely continue to order from them.
