Several weeks ago I was appalled by the service that i received at the morning glory diner. i went to the diner before my grandson's basketball game at Palumbo's playground on a Saturday and only had change on me because I was in a rush. I asked the waiter how much was the coffee and he replied. i told him that I would be back after I got a dollar from my wife. He replied to me while another waiter was there, "you must be looking for Wawa's, this is gourmet coffee". I was taken aback and left the diner furious and embarrassed. I thought about it and decided to go back the next day and talk to the owner, or manager. Â I was able to talk to Sam, who is the owner and she replied that the waiter in question was, "like a family member" and she was surprised, although, "he had some issues" and was not at work that day. i felt that i was appeased and have been a patron of the diner since they opened. i had probably been their biggest spokesman to my friend about their food since I first started to go there. i am a professional, however on the day that I went there I was in sneakers, sweat suit and as Sam stated, "she had not seen me in there before". I will NEVER patronize the morning glory diner again!!! I will tell everyone that i have recommended to eat there along with anyone who asks about the quality of their service my experience with their service!!! morning glory diner, thumbs down ...
