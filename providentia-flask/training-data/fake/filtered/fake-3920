Went to silk for a SICK Absolut Tea Tiki Party-The food was super appropriate for the theme of the party & unique in the most delicious way. Philly2night did a stand up job with the decor & Absolut made some pretty bangin coctails- who woulda thought VitaCoco & Absolut went through a flower straw with such harmony.
