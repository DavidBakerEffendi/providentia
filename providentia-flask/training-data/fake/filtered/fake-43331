Liked the food here....Dhaba food usually has bold flavors and Sonu Da Dhaba does not disappoint...I liked their take on salad...larg pieces of onions garnished with tangy masala and cut green chillies...Naans were fresh but Tandoori Roti was the real deal...whole weat flour and fresh from tandoor just like they would serve on GT Road back home...
