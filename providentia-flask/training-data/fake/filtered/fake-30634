Pretty good pizza. This place has a fun atmosphere and the price isn't overly expensive at all. The staff is pretty friendly and quick. When my pizza came out it was really good. The crust was nice and crisp and the entire thing was great. It can get pricy depending on how much you get as it adds up decently quick. Had a great meal and experience overall though.
