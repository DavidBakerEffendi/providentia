Great place.  I've been going here since college in early 2000's and have been recommending this place to everyone I meet. Their noodles are great, their portions are big.  And most importantly it's very cheap.  A dinner for two will run you $13!  Can't get better than that. Now, with that said I'm giving them 4 stars for two reasons.  Their prices keep going up, slowly but surely.  And two, their quality went down a little bit since early days.  Not enough for me not to go there any more, but I'm hoping I wouldn't have to downgrade this place any further.  After all this was and still is one of my favorite places in the city!
