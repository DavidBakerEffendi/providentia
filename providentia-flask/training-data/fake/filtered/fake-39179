So delicious. Everything here was uh-mazing. I'd say order everything but that's unrealistic. Â  Love the ambiance, pretty cozy with soft lighting and the requisite candles. The seating may be a bit claustrophobic for some (my girlfriend included) but you're not in danger of constantly bumping elbows. Now for the important stuff: the food. The ceviche was mediocre; I feel like I've had better elsewhere. Everything else was great. Based on the fantastic food and service we enjoyed here, we will definitely be back.
