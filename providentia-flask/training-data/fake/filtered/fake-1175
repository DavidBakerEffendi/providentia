Rather disappointing lunch. I hadn't been here in years, then had lunch here today and the food didn't live up to my memories. Food quality seems to have declined!  Boring chicken sandwich served on soggy, flavorless bread.  Mushrooms and guac combo didn't work. Strange, uninspired ingredients that didn't taste fresh.  French fries were overloaded with salt.  Dishes, glasses and even decor are old, worn out and tired.  Maybe this was on an off day, but I think it's declined. Hope I'm wrong, used to love this place, a long time ago. Today it was sub par!
