i've been to the spotted pig a few times and have experienced THE WORST customer service over and over again. Me and my work friends literally tried to get hamburgers there 3 times and there was always some issue - usually their beef was so precious that they had run out of it. i think it would be better if you were a small group and didn't mind waiting while they obviously forget to seat you or when they randomly bring you food you didn't order or it takes 3 hours to finally get your burger when they do have it... but that's a lot of ifs. we did complain and i think they comped a bunch of the food, but still. i eventually had the burger and it was very good, but for $17...never again.
