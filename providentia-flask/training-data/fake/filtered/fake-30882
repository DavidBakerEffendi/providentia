We have eaten here several times and initially we were quite enthused about this restaurant. Now, we are done with it and won't be returning.  Many of the dishes you will eat at Le Salbuen are cooked ahead of time and reheated in a microwave oven before serving. Diners would be able to overlook this were the cooks actually taking the trouble to use the handy labor-saving devices thoughtfully, but they aren't. The last three times we have eaten at Le Salbuen, soups, appetizers and entrees have arrived piping hot in some parts and lukewarm to cold in others. Who really wants to spend more than twenty dollars for a small portion of 'short ribs'--  no matter that it comes from a local farm -- when the cooks can't be bothered to reheat it evenly? Ditto the soups, several of the appetizers and the entrees.  And really, isn't it a little creepy that a restaurant that makes a big deal about getting its organic food from local farms is so reliant on a kitchen tool that may have questionable effects on people's health and nutrition?  Finally, on our most recent visit, the service reached a new low, with rudeness that the server blamed on the owner. It's a small restaurant run by amateurs, which could be charming or at least unimportant, but now the laziness and arrogance have ruined our experiences there.
