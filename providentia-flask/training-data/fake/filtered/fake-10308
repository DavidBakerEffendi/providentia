I eat at this fairly new restaurant almost every week since mid July.  This open Kitchen style restaurant has a very freindly atmospher and the smell of authentic middle eastern (Afghan) food would make you order everything on the menu!!   The owner used to be a butcher and they have a butcher shop in the back of the restaurant.  No Frozen meat packages in this place!  So the meat is very fresh which makes a big difference if you are a Kabob LOVER!!   Their homemade dessert are delicious too.  Ferni and Baklava are my favorite.
