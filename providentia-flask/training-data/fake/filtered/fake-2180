THIS PLACE GIVES JERSEY DINNERS A BAD REPUTATION BY NOT PROVIDING GOOD FOOD IN A FRIENDLY SETTING. Some how on our order, someone within the staff didn't process the complete order and things had to be ordered again and at that point we removed the item from the order. Then my daughter was not eating her egg whites. I tried them and they were SOUR. I figured they were the carton egg whites. When I confronted the waitress she confirmed they are NOT from fresh Eggs. I asked them to be taken from the bill and she said the manager was upset that because the other food was taken from the bill could I ask him. He would not take the SOUR eggs from the bill since he lost money from the other food being taken off and the eggs weren't sour. The Eggs were, the other food was never served and I will not eat or recommend this place to anyone. If you have a problem with your meal they will not correct it as they didn't with us.
