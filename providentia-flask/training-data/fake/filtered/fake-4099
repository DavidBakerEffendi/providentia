This review is for the restaurant - I've eaten lunch at this place four or five times now, and its fantastic.  I get bored easily with the standard lunch fare around, but these guys come up with two or three new specials every time I'm in there, and they have all been wonderful.  Duck sliders - dynamite; pork osso buco - divine.  Even the soups are out of this world - try a cream of tomato soup with the grilled cheese sandwich, trust me your mother never made it like this.  Waitstaff is knowledgeable and pleasant, and while the place is a bit crowded, they make it seem fun and social rather than stuffy.  Modest but quality selection of reasonably priced wines by glass or bottle, which is refreshing.  Nice place!
