The food here is great!  I love that they have vegan and vegetarian options on their menu.  I have had food from here twice.  Once for brunch and the other for lunch take out.  Service was a little slow for brunch, but it was early on New Year's Day.  Take out was quick and easy.  i highly recommend the vegan tacos, YUM!
