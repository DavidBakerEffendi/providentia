To say I was disappointed in this restaurant would be an understatement. I had high hopes for a new restaurant to take over this space after Scoozi's left, which was one of my favorite restaurants in New Haven. The service was very attentive and professional, but the food left MUCH to be desired. I ordered salmon, which was OK, but it was topped with beets, which was an odd combination. All of the accompanying vegetables were undercooked. One of my dinner companions ordered the Mac and cheese, which sat in a pool of liquid. My other companion ordered the steak, which was very tough and chewy (not to mention it was one of the most unappetizing looking plates I have ever seen). The broccoli rabe was terrible. The coup de gras was that my coffee was stone cold when brought to the table. Unless I hear from someone that they have really stepped up their game, I will never return - too many other good choices in the New Haven area.....
