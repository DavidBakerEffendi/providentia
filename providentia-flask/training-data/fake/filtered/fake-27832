The setting is a bit too dim for my liking. Not enough lighting which I guess is fine for a bar but for a high-end pizza joint, I'd like a smidgen more light. So my associates and I got a regina (the closest thing to a margherita pizza) and a arugula drenched pie with prosciutto. While both were okay, they didn't wow me. They were actually very underwhelming, even though this place gets rave reviews. The pizzas are about, give or take 11' inches in diameter which is very small and not all that filling between four people. Not all that artisanal compared to all the fancy pizzerias out there but I wanted a good NYC-styled pizza. Instead, I got two tiny pies pretending to be something more akin to Motorino without the puffy dough. Just fancy ingredients trying to cover up for a very depressing dough that failed in every department. Dough can make or break a pie and Paulie fails terribly. So yeah, they were bland at best. Totaling about 31 dollars each, you could do better. That and the pen they gave me didn't work, so I feel they charged me a bit more on the check. Eh. Sorry Paulie, not coming back. Enjoy your mediocre pizza. Also, they're only open at 6 so don't both schlepping to this dead-end of Greenpoint for lunch.
