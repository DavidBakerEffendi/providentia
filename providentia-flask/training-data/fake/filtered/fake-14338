Huge dishes for extremely reasonable prices. I got the curry and received a huge bowl full of a mild curry, noodles, and all manner of interesting inclusions (whole hardboiled eggs, fishballs, scallops, etc.). It was awesome, and only $6.50. I was hard pressed to finish it. Between 2 entrees and a split appetizer, we grabbed the bill at 15.50 before tip. Unbelievable. The only thing that keeps the rating from being 5 stars (and this may be my fault for what I ordered) is that there were absolutely zero vegetables in my dish or my girlfriend's dish. I'm a big veggie guy, so who knows if you can ask for them as extras, but that'll be something for a later visit, maybe once the know me :)
