Everything about Tom's is what I want in a diner - a classic menu, old booths, and counter space, stuff littering the walls (in a good way), and UNBELIEVABLE service from all involved. I love the small touches, a cookie or slice of orange if you're waiting outside on a busy weekend brunch service,  cool LARGE coffee mugs so you don't have to ask for a refill every 5 minutes,  and fries with chipotle mayo! I take off one star because of the eggs.  For whatever reason, whenever I've ordered an omlettte or scrambled eggs, they are overdone.  When i've ordered sunnys-side-up, they taste great.  So think twice before getting an omlette. Even if you do come on a busy weekend, the line moves quickly so be patient.
