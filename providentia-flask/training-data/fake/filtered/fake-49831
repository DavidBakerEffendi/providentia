When I was at Adriana's I watched the incidident mentioned below unfold (2/6/2011).  A women complained about the service to someone in the resteraunt and the maitredee started screaming at her!! She stood there like a deer and headlights, while he called her classless!! The waitstaff in there was rude all night and didnt want to be bothered with customers.  Not a place I would ever go back to.  Weak performance.
