Without a doubt, some of the best asian food I have ever experienced. You wouldn't expect to find this place (filled with Chinese patrons) in Old City. The food is extremely spicy in general but it's also as good as it gets. Our waiter was inistent (true to the other reviews) about what we SHOULD eat, and he was right. Have the fish, it's the perfect balance of crisp, spicy and super fresh. Cumin lamb-- unbelievable. Dumplings in chili sauce are a must too.
