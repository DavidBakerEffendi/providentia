Stunning interior decor. Very friendly and welcoming waitstaff. Service is quite fast and on par. Very affordable menu. I tried the pho dish and ribs on sugar cane. The pho dish was different and unique from all other phos Ive had. It's actually worth a try. The ribs on sugar cane was a surprise. This place makes any food look sexy. And the taste...it was just simply heaven in my mouth. It gave me a hard-on. Overall the place is dope. Expectations surpassed. Got more than what I asked for.
