Vesta is a gem. Great food, great atmosphere (though sometimes too loud). The service is amazing and the pasta is great. Unfortunately, it's hard for a gluten-free person to enjoy most of what's on the menu. So how about this, you guys add a gluten-free pasta and welcome us hungry wanna-be-vesta-ites to the modern age of dining!!!! Please feed us! Great brunch, delicious coffee, could use a few more options though. All in all, a swell place, in fact, great vibe, really friendly, and best of all, everyone eating there looks really happy and you can just call, they're all going to come back again as soon as they can.
