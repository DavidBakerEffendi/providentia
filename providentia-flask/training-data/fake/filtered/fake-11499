We were walking along 34th and out of the corner of my eye I see a neon BBQ sign 20yds or so down an alley...I said, "Wait a minute....What have we here?"  We were hungry and were discussing options.   First off, it's HOMEY...feels like you're home here.  The staff were fantastic (I was wearing a Seahawks ballcap/jersey...there for the game...they gave me some good-natured ribbing, but all in good fun.   The waiter...now his name eludes me...but, that guy was exceptional.  Walked us through the menu and made things feel like it was quite ok to be strangers in a new city.  He gave us a few wings and mixed a couple of the sauces together to make this divine concoction--on the house!  We (my daughter and her husband) drove up from Virginia Beach, VA...there we get a pretty good North Carolina Pulled Pork Sandwich.  Baby Blues does North Carolina better than North Carolina does North Carolina!   Had a locally-brewed ale (Yards Brawler), which was delicious.  The food was so darn good....even the baked beans were beyond what anyone would reasonably expect from such a simple dish...theirs had 4-5(?) different beans, a great baked sauciness, chopped onions...heck, I don't know...they were awesome!  My daughter and I each had a pulled pork sandwich.
