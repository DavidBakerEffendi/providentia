I joined Yelp specifically to share this experience. Tonight I ordered a typical sized delivery order - two main dishes and two pieces of naan. After being over an HOUR late (to deliver only a few blocks!) I called to ask where my food was. I was told it was on its way, so I continued to sit by my phone waiting for the phone call. Finally a friend called me to the front door where the delivery guy was waiting and proceeded to YELL at me that he was trying to call me. I explained to him that I had been sitting by my phone and actively watching it - I was, after all, starving after waiting for over an hour! Why wouldn't I be actively waiting for the delivery phone call?! He insisted that I was ignoring him, that I must think he was lying and continued to yell at me for ignoring his calls for several minutes. Even after I informed him that I would no longer be ordering from Jewel after that interaction, he laughed at me and continued to yell until I shut the door. I then called the restaurant to tell them that I did not want to pay for such treatment only to be brushed off that they would "talk" to the delivery man - they seemed to have more important things to deal with than an upset customer. DO NOT ORDER FROM JEWEL. They have no respect for their customers - both dine-in and delivery promises poor customer service! Instead opt for Taj-E India, based in White River Junction, which will deliver to Hanover and has MUCH better food anyways!
