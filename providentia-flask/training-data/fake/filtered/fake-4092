We had the most amazing experience at Caseus tonight! The service was excellent, the ambiance was enticing, and the food was indescribably good. We had a cheese plate appetizer (the bread on the cheese plate was perfectly warm), the mac and cheese, and the special made up of potatoes and scallops (it melted in my mouth). Needless to say, dessert was unbelievable but yet so simple I wish I'd thought of it first! Finally a very nice gentleman from the restaurant brought us some port. One of the best dinners ever in New Haven!
