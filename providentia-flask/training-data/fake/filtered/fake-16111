I decided to have lunch here because I always passed by, but never tried it . I decided that I would sit and have a nice lunch at the bar. My order was taken right away. .As I waited for my food I was so shocked to see servers that were digging there bare hands in the ice box and putting it in glasses foor people to drink out of .EEEWW as well as picking up the lemons with the same hands they juss finshed using to touch everything else with. I decided to see how far they would go with me just sitting there and it was like nothing to them. I was sick to my stomach watching them time and time again. As I watched them use their bare hands for things that definetily required gloves or for CHRIST SAKE a pair of tongs. So i got up and left vowing never to attend this place again.
