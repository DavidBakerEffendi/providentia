Cast Iron Soul offers a delicious variety of soul food entrees and sides, with a little New Orleans kick. After two recent visits and a lot of plate sharing, I'm confident each dish they serve is cooked to perfection, including their seafood dishes. Each generous entree and every side is uniquely flavored, not one thing on the menu is served up bland and no two items taste alike. Rich flavors meld nicely together whatever your choices are. The meats are well prepared, never dried out and amazingly seasoned. They offer all of your soul food favorites... I was about to list everything that was good, just look at the menu, so far it has all been amazing. Both recent visits with different groups of friends has left everyone stuffed and impressed. They say don't judge a book by its cover, that's the truth. It may not look like much from the outside, but inside the family staff is welcoming and hospitable, happy to make your take-out or dine in meal an enjoyable and memorable experience.
