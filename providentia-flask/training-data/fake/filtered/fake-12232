I live just around the corner and they deliver  ....I walked in one day having never tried the waffles. I chit chat with the sweetheart who works there and she serves it to me hot and on a GLASS plate....ON THE HOUSE...I order 4 more to go....then decided to eat the rest they next morning they were still light and fluffy and hadn't lost there flavor...They are hospitable,courteous,friendly and just kind...and its clean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love it. OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  HOT WINGS ARE OFF THE HOOK!!!!!
