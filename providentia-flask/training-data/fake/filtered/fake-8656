i love this place! i've tried almost everything on the menu at least once, but my all time favorite is the crispy fish kimchi bowl. the staff is always friendly and i know pretty much everyone by name--that's how often i go. there's only been one time i was disappointed, and that was when i was given a burrito on a diet. that has never happened again and i've not seen the individual responsible since. all around, great value, great food, nice staff.
