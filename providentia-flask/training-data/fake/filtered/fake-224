I had high expectations when we went to Geno's. The people were rude, and it wasn't busy when I was there. The cheesesteak had onions and cheese that was all. My husband wanted fries, had to order at another window, and they were like $4, way to pricey and they were lukewarm. I was very dissappointed by what we got. I will stick with our cheesesteaks in Balto. Capt. Harvey's has them totally beat!
