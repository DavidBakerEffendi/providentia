This place is a find. It is located a so close to my office, I don't understand how I never noticed it before. I picked it to have dinner with a very dear friend based on location, having a hankering for French and the reviews. Everything was delicious. We stayed for hours, no rush. Great food, great service. Can't wait to go back!
