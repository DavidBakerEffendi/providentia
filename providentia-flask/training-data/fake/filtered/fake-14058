Excellent! After my friend had gushed for months about this, her favorite restaurant, a group of 6 of us went the other evening to try it out. "Fresh" was the word she kept attributing to the ingredients, and ultimately, I think that's the best description. Everything was.... fresh. We ordered a bunch of the small plates and mixed and matched, which I think was the best possible decision of the evening. Bruschetta, brussel sprouts, cauliflower, kale salad.... all of it was incredibly flavorful. I even tried lardo! Entree-wise, I had the burger and stole a bit of my friend's chicken and it was a toss-up which I preferred. I definitely have to hand it to my friend; the praise she'd been heaping on this place was well-deserved. Can't wait to get back.
