Wedding Reception Catered by Pitruco Pizza Pitruco (along with Spot Burger) catered my wife and my wedding party at our home near Media, PA last weekend.  We and our guests could not have been happier with Pitruco.  They made an already great day for us even better and relieved us of the logistical issues associated with traditional caterer.  Pitruco's pizza and salads were far superior to what we would have received from a caterer attempting to serve 150 people at our home.   We learned that Pitruco did private events through its website and made arrangements through a couple of short emails.  The price was more than fair and Jonah was flexible and responsive to every question and request.  The Pitruco trailer with its wood fired oven showed up at our home on time and set up quickly.  They took orders at the trailer and delivered pizzas and salads to guests' tables while constantly keeping several pies at a table outside of the trailer for people to take slices as they wanted.  We preselected three types of pizza and one type of salad.  All were wonderful. This was not an overly casual event and most of our guests were in suits or jackets.  And while we loved the idea soon after considering it, we were a bit worried about how some of our guests would react to having only food trucks at the party.  As it turned out, Pitruco was a perfect fit.  We received nothing but positive feedback from guests. The trucks freed people to get up and move around and generally made the party more fun.  After watching how well this worked out and how excited our guest were by the idea, our feeling is that Pitruco could work for a wide range of events of varying degrees of formality.  We will definitely look to have another party with Pitruco.   You guys were great!  Thanks.  Micah and Carrie.
