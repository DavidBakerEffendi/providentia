This was our second visit to Parc (2/21/14), and I have to say it was even better than our first! Amazing food, great ambiance, and awesome service. Their menu includes a large assortment of French classics, and being one of Stephen Starr's many restaurants; they really know how to make it feel individualized, almost as if it was a privately owned bistro in France. Can't wait to go back!
