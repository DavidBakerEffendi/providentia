My wife and I had dinner here on Wed., Feb. 2.  We arrived about 8:00 without a reservation and were immediately accomodated.  By 8:30 there were no tables left.  My wife had grilled octopus salad and I had the soup of the day, which was zuchini puree (with no cream added).  Both were excellent.  We then shared an artichoke and prosciutto pizza.  The pizza was very think crust, which was light and well seasoned.   This was enough food for us.  We shared a half litre of wine and then had two additional glasses, all sangiovese.  My wife then had a decaf cappucinno.  Our bill was approximately $90.  Service was attentive and very good.  Room is small (this is the West Village) and probably only seats 35 - 40, with an additional 4 - 6 seats at the bar.   Decor and ambience are excellent - a quaint little trattrio with exposed brick.   Noise level was moderate.  We heard one older (in their 70's) couple debating the noise level when they left - he thought it was fine and she thought it was a bit noisy.  Makes me think it was about right then.  I am actually surprised by the negative reviews.  We live a block away and will be regular customers.  A great little trattoria, which will be our inexpensive Barbuto.
