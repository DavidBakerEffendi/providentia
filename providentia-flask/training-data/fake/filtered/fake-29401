Absolutely amazing, stunningly delicious, i have been Â at Turkish Kebab House first time last week, i had Iskender Kebab, it was unbelivable tasty veal-lamb slices came with special sauce and yoghurt on the side, i will defienetely go there back at first chance and try their different dishes, if the other main courses are the same, i guess i found the haven on earth!
