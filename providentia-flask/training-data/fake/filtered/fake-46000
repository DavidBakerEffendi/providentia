I came for the burger since they've been advertising themselves as a best burger candidate. However, they did not live up to expectations or advertisement. There was no thick tomato, and I think they may have run out of normal buns as the bun with my burger resembled a cheap, thin, 8-pack type of bun you buy at the grocery store. I ordered the burger medium and it came out a strong medium-well with no pink at all. I really wonder if this was an off night because I can totally imagine this burger being great if it was executed well.
