Stop reading and go before there's a long line. Food is great. Had the barbacoa de ris, my wife the chicken enchiladas...sublime. Get going. If you've been to Mexico City, you'll return gastronomically. If not then just know that this is a example of why Mexican cuisine is one of the best in the world. Vamos!
