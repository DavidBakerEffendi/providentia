My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to go for a late night dinner and we stumbled upon Mominette. The friendly bartender greeted us the second we walked in (and somehow remembered me when I came in 2 weeks later!) and told us we were welcome to sit in the garden for dinner and he would let the server know we were back there. Garden? Whaaaat? We waited about 10 minutes for the server to realize we were back there (and my boyfriend ended up tracking him down and asking for menus). Food: Delicious! Absolutely wonderful. I have been back twice now, just for the food. The mashed potatoes are INSANE, asparagus covered in garlic and butter and a perfectly cooked steak. But, the mushroom truffle risotto was what made me come back. I craved it and when I came back for the risotto, they had taken it off the menu. I almost cried. Why, Mominette, Why? My steak was still delicious but that risotto needs to return. Also, I have asked about the cheese plate each time I come in and each time I was told that they "don't know what's on the cheese plate but I'll go ask" and then when they come back, "we're not doing the cheese plate tonight." Service: I am a server so I understand that people are rude and usually demanding assholes, which takes its toll on any server. But some advice for the future: I wasn't sure who our server was. We had 3 different (not so friendly) servers coming up to us at random times and helping us. But their communication must have been terrible because we ended up having to order the same drink 3 times to our 3 different servers. Overall, I will definitely be coming back here. The food is incredible and I'm such a bitch for a garden.
