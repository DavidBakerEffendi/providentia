Read the reviews and was a little scared, but since it was not far from home and Fairway is right there for shopping after eatting, I took the plunge.  Loved the food.  The Mussels and broth was some of the best I've had, I try mussels everywhere, and these were top.  Had the blue crabs 1/2 dozen and thought that would not be enough since the week before I was at Hammer and Claws all you can eat crab bash (pricey, but worth it if you can eat crabs like a master and get every piece of crab meat).  Anyway, with the corn, mussels, key lime pie for dessert, the 6 crabs were enough.  My friend ordered one of the steam pots with the King crab, snow crab, shrimp, corn, potatos and she was happy and satisfied with her meal.  I have no issues with the food or service for the day and I have priced eating crabs around town in NY and the prices were not out of line unless you buy and cook them yourself.  I want to see how this place moves into the colder months time well tell.
