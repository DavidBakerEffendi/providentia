I planned a retirement dinner for 25+ people at Max Downtown.  A bit on the expensive side, but well worth it.  The food was great.  But it was the service staff that took care of us that really made the night.  25 people, all chatting and wondering around, then ordering dinner, more drinks.  The wait staff never missed a beat.  All the food and drinks were delivered correctly and promptly. Outstanding organization and professionalism.
