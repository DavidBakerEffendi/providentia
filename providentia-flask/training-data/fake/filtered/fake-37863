Tonight we decided to order once again from Starlite.  Our phone call was answered quickly and we were told our food would be ready in 20 min.  they were very accurate with the timing and our pizza was ready within 5 minutes of my arrival for the pick up.  Pizza has a very nice thin crust and doesn't fill you up with alot of dough.
