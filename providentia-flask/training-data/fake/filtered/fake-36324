This place is way overpriced  , i had 24 dollar spaghetti  and I asked the waiter for meatballs with it and he looked at me like i had 2 heads,all that he said was is that is our signature dish and it doesn't come with meatballs....well excuse me and because you are paying so much i guess that the owner tells the waiter and hostess to stare at you all night and make you feel so uncomfortable that you have to whisper . The only thing i could understand on the menu was spaghetti everything else was ducks dick ,octopus balls or rooster vagina . I went there once and tried it ,but you will never see me there again and anybody else that goes there more than once should have there head examined
