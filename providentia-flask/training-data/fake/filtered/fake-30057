I wanted to update my review of Johny's, so everyone knows the truth and knows just how good this hidden gem is.  If you love breakfast, then you will love this place!  I came here today and had the new King Kong. Omg it was amazing and perfectly made!!! The French toast bread with back on, egg and banana, to die for.  You must try this!!! :)  Hopefully this will get posted since Yelp seems to make the good reviews disappear!
