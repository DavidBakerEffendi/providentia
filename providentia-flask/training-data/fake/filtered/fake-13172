Best hamburger on the planet, IMO. Served between two slices of toast, choice of cheese/tomato/raw onions and if you value your life, DON'T ask for ketchup. Once the owners/workers know you, you might garner better service and a smile. I've gone here for years. Those without taste or taste buds who whined, just stick to your McDonalds - that makes more room for true aficionados!
