My friend (who just moved to E. Houston St) and I were looking for a cute place to catch up in her hood.  After walking around a bit, we settled on Mezetto, a new Mediterranean tapas-style restaurant in the space that used to be Oliva (which I didn't love).     We ordered a few different things between the two of us to share....the mezetto trio appetizer (with really delicious dipping bread), the grilled avocado salad, falafel buns, lamb meatballs and the truffled gnocchi.  For drinks we got a carafe of sangria and I tried the limonana (which is perfect if you love black licorice like I do!).  Everything was so flavorful, innovative and different-- delicious! I can't say enough about this place...the staff was super helpful in explaining the options on the menu, the drinks were strong, and vibe was really laid back, but chic!   I will DEFINITELY be back.... I'm craving the falafel steamed buns and limonana as I write this review!
