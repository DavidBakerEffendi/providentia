Great food!  Unique and tasty!  Great service, fast and kind.  I have ordered small to large quantities of food and never had an issue.  I had a small issue with my most recent visit when my order was incorrectly entered but the worker in the kitchen quickly corrected the order.  You can call ahead and pick up which is nice during the busy lunch hour.  A nice amount of seating and they always have good music.  They also have beer. I have gotten a lot of thing son the menu and everything is really good form the spicy tuna burger to the tuna tataki salad to the sweet potato fries its allllll goood!
