WORST SERVICE AND FOOD I'VE EVER HAD!!!   Food was awful (and took 45 minutes for a chicken wrap), and their CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS THE WORST!  Had one bite of a crappy sandwich and asked the waitress politely to take it off my bill.  She said, "you ordered it, so you have to pay for it".  I politely asked to speak with her manager.  She said they were all busy and would tell me the same thing. I went to the kitchen and asked to speak to a manager and only a chef would speak with me.  He was rude and unprofessional.  Never going here again and I WARN OTHER TO STAY AWAY FROM KENS PIZZA!
