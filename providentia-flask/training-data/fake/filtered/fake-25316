I just wanted to thank Yelp for isolating obviously rigged reviews. Honestly people, I was happy to try your new bagel shop but that you planted ridiculously biased reviews in such an obvious and stupid way makes me question what methods you're using for baking and selling food at retail. If you cut corners like this, I don't trust your food. Wait for real customers, and if you get a bad review, ask why. Our bad reviews have helped us improve. Planting reviews just makes you, and by association your business, look bad.
