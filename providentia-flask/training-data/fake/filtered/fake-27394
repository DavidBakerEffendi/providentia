I have been a loyal customer of the Restaurant for many, many years and I'm really sorry to say that the restaurant side of this establishment is seriously slipping.  The food is really outstanding....however, the waiter's helpers really suck!   The waiters, who I have relied on for years, are literally having to pick up the pieces after there helpers ignore tables.  No place settings on sitting.  No set up of bread, basic condiments, water....etc., until the waiter is alerted.  Appetizers were served almost 10 minutes apart.  Water and coffee refills again have to be flagged for by alerting the waiter.  Dessert came with only partial coffee order and again the waiter had to be alerted.  All in all, what could have been a delightful eating experience becomes aggravating.   As expected from this waiter staff, they apologize profusely and offer wonderful desserts.   Granted, it was a Saturday evening and it was crowded, but they should never have to apologize for their help.    More diners....more trained help needed.    This has happened several time.   What a shame.
