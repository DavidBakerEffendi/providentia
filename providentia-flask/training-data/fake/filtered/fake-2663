I get the tight space, no big deal unless you are big-boned...I say that because if it is your first date and your date is such a person, beware.  Look, the food is not bad, but the bottom line is if you care enough to have a clue you can find the same dishes, better quality for a third of the price. For instance, the  dumplings with grapefruit; if you have ever had fresh dumplings in your life you will be disappointed with this place....don't bring your Asian wife to this place! I did and she was not impressed. And when we ordered, the owner said that they "are tapas style so we recommend you each ordering two dishes." Well, each dish is $12-$15 per dish...since when did tapas reach such prices? I guess if you are used to paying $30 for a pizza at Artichoke on 14th St, then this is right up your alley. Otherwise I'd say to go the extra mile and move beyond a first-date place to something that you can build a long-term relationship with. Bottom line for the men; if you are with an authentic Asian woman born outside the US, make sure she doesn't order the dumplings. If you are some NYU dude taking a college date out to an off-the-beaten-path place, then this place is money.
