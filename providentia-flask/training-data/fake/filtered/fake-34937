Was worried when we booked here as the reviews were mixed.  I was concerned the staff would be rude, etc.  I was very pleased.  We went on a Monday evening and got a table for four immediately.  The taxidermy was not "in your face" as other reviews had led me to believe.  The staff were  friendly and pleasant.   Food:  Artichoke dip was amazing- a must try.  Devils on horseback were also very nice.  Fillet Mignon was good. My husband ordered the venison and really enjoyed it- tender and tasty (I do not like game meat)  Our table ordered all four desserts-- the bananas foster was the best-- excellent and worth experiencing, the brownie took second place.  The apple crumble and the carrot cake are not worth trying.
