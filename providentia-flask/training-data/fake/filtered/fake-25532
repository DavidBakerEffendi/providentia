Get to Fiorina for Sunday brunch  before it ends!  Went yesterday and had a wonderful leisurely meal. While waiting for our fruit cup (ample with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries and crispy apples) the staff brought extra muffins that had just come from the oven.  My Adriatic salad was brimming with lump crab, calamari,, scallops and shrimp-all but the crab nicely grilled. Portions are ample and staff attentive.
