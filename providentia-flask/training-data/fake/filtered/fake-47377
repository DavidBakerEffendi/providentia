My family and I have been going to Park Ave for more than 25 yrs and until the last few Â years or so have been happy customers. I am not sure what has happen over the past few years but there has been a steady decline. I don't know what is going on with the sauce but it seems old and pasty. I ordered the lasagna dinner and I had to dump 80% of it because I could not give it away. We ordered pizza the other night and it tasted as though they opened a container of salt and dumped it all over. This was always the go to spot in town, now it always seems to disappoint.
