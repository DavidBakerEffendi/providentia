Oh Noodletown how much I love you. I love that you tempt me to leave boring bar nights and dates at 2am. I love that brusquely efficient service. I love that almost everything can be ordered as a $5 "on rice" platter. I love your roast chicken on rice with ginger scallion sauce - which I always buy to keep in my fridge. I love your roast pork with hoisin sauce. I love your $4 plates of baby bok choy sauteed in garlic, your $4 steamed chinese brocolli with oyster sauce, and your $10 pea shoots (Lol a "splurge"). i LOVE your Salt and Pepper fried shrimp (or soft shell crabs). I love that nobody knows you are a BYO (wine only, they have beer). Do you know that I would still love you if you tripled your prices? Or that when I consider leaving NY, you are on the short list of things Id miss? Your soup brother is bad (shrimpy/fishy), your eggplant on rice is inconsistent, and your Ma Po Tofu just isnt szechuan at all (but of course neither are you). Seriously, 27 stars. Possibly my fav restaurant in NYC. There is no room to disagree. Anyone who gives this place a bad review is bologna on white bread bad.
