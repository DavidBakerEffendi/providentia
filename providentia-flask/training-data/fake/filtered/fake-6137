My wife,son and I decided to try the Stone Hearth since we drive by all the time on way to Yale. It was a WONDERFUL experience. The waitress,Laura, was an absolute delight. She was very informative,upbeat, and explained each entree in detail. From the homemade bread with dipping oil, to our entrees and the fabulous dessert, it was an Ideal night out. The atmosphere was NOT loud and boisterous as most Restaurants downtown tend to be. We got to spend a lovely evening with our son.     We are  planning on going again one day soon! Prices tend to be a bit on high side,but worth the price. :) Carmen
