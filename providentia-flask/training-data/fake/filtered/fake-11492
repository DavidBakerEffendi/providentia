Aight peeps this truck is the best breakfast truck in UCity, no doubt. I'm tellin you gotta rock the steak egg and cheese with bacon it is the absolute truth, feelin me. Plus it is super cheap man. Bui is quick like lightning I ain't lyin.  Don't forget the special sauce boy.  Been rockin this place out for years and they still slammin breakfast out with the best. This place is the truth you won't regret going here.
