Went here this beautiful Sunday afternoon.  We arrived late afternoon and were given lunch and brunch menus.  Our table of four ordered, chatted over drinks while awaiting  our food and then while we ate.  When the waitress/bartender rang up our tab, each of the dishes were more expensive, for example the Shepards pie was $13.50 instead of $11.99. I questioned the waitress/bartender and her response was I rang it out at 4:04.....,in other words we were charged dinner prices rather than lunch prices because of the time we rang out. I would have argued the point, big the rest of the group didn't want to raise a fuss. So, are the portions the same? Either way. End result is that we will not be going back!
