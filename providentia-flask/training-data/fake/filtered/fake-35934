Ordered some delivery, as I have many times in the past, and like in the last I was told over an hour. Tonight I was told an hour and a half and on ringing to see when it would arrive I was told another 20 min which would make it 2 hours. I love the pizza but they need to either quote an accurate time or sort out the capacity of the kitchen. I wish I could order more often but this sucks.
