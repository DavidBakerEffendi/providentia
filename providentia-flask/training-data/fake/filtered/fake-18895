Artichoke pizza was amazing but the staff was RUDE... and the slim guy tried to charge me $10 for 2 slices that clearly states $4.50 each. I walked back in because 1 of my friends wanted a crab pizza and the guy said to me rudely " what do you want miss, I already gave you back your change... Â so I walked out and that will be the last of my money they will EVER SEE! bloody RUDE!!!
