If you want home cooked Italian meal than Scotto's Pizza is your place to go the sauce on the pasta is wonderful and I had the veal which I would normally stay away from in a Pizza joint but it was fantastic just melted in your mouth like Ma Ma used to make best pizza place I have been to in a long long time. and since it is located in a strip mall you always have a place to park
