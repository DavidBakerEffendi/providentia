Lets talk the restaurant itself. Old outdated and just looks terrible. Cobwebs dust duct tape along the windows, we should of just turned around then. As for breakfast. Bacon was burnt, ham was more fat than ham, eggs didn't seem like they were fresh. On the plus I think they got the toast right. Needless to say I won't be back.
