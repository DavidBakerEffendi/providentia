This is a small unassuming place located in a strip mall, but don't let that scare you away. The food is fresh and their salsa is great! You can usually choose from about 5 to 6 different salsas. Their margaritas on the rocks are delicious and you only need one. The ceviche appetizer is one of my favorites and I've fallen in love with the Shrimp Enchiladas. The enchiladas are not covered with sauce but lightly covered with a sour cream sauce, with lettuces and cabbage. Most likely you won't have room for desser if you've finished your meal because Baja has HUGE portions. Come with an appetite or leave with a doggy bag.
