omg........this diner is awesome. from service to food amazing the portions are hugh but worth everybit, i love everything from the soup to the desert it was amazing fresh and tasty. no other diner around can compare to it. the wait time on weekends is mad crazy but so worth it cuz everything we ordered was perfect, luv it there.
