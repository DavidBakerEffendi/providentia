My wife and I take the kiddies out every weekend, so we frequent a variety of restaurants, both good and bad.  Spuntino is definitely in the bad category. This may the most ill-conceived restaurant we ever experienced. The decor is confused and the menu dis-jointed. We ordered a variety of items including a Caesar salad, calamari, Salsiccia Stromboli, Zuppa de Pesce and Chicken Milan. The salad was warm and the crispers were soggy. Both the chicken and calamari were fried to death and the Zuppa de pesce got my wife sick at her stomach. The Stromboli consisted of mostly onions and peppers and two measly pieces of Italian sausage and a sliver of mozzarella cheese. The only two positives were the server, a young man named William and the polenta fries.  Overall, the food was terrible and about 30% over priced.
