Gato is the cat's meow! If you like great food, great service and dim lit/cool NYC ambiance, Gato is the place for you! Â  Our waiter Mo was the man! He walked us through the food and wine menu with confidence that is rare nowadays! What we ate: Starter: Roasted Octopus Mains: Charred Beef, Kale and wild mushroom risotto Dessert: walnut brown butter cake All dishes we ordered were great both in presentation and taste but not huge portion wise. Side note: The bartender made me perhaps the best dirty martini I have ever had! This is truly a restaurant for those who enjoy great food - lived up to the hype!
