Ok, the ramen here is great. There's no denying that. I've gone to the East Village location many times before. Today was the first time I tried the Westside location. It's just as good as the one in the EV... But more importantly, I'd like to point out that the redhead hostess (the one that seats you) is absolutely, stunningly gorgeous. Stopped me in my tracks as I was walking in. I think her presence made the food taste twice as good. So yeah. Dear redhead Ippudo hostess: just wanted to say you are beautiful.
