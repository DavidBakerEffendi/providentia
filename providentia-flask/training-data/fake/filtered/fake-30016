Finally one decent Indian restaurant where the taste is good. My first visit on Sunday was a good experience as we were not very hungry, wanted a bite but ended up leaving full! Being a veggie, we tried the chilly panner, navratna korma and garlic naan.....loved the food taste. Quantity is just about OK but I find many complaining about it. I would definitely visit again whenever I am around the area.
