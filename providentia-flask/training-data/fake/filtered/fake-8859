WARNING!  The atmosphere sets the expectations of nice food, but the food at this restaurant is SO DISAPPOINTING! Probably the stand out event was discovering cardboard in our mushroom shepherd's pie - it tasted fine but was an unusual choice of ingredient.  However, the real issue was the excessive salt levels in just about every dish.  We were unable to complete either of our pasta dishes or our mains. The service was great, perhaps to make up for the cardboard in our meal. The Gander knows how to pour a drink.  But as soon as you're hungry, go elsewhere.
