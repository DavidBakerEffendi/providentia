This place never bounced back..it was Great once, now Mediocre at best. Lousy phone ordering employees, orders arrive always wrong. Pizza orders seem like re-heated pies that have been sitting around, chicken wings soggy, fatty and greasy. In search of new place....Maybe Ruthie's in Montclair we hear they make a real coal-oven pizza.
