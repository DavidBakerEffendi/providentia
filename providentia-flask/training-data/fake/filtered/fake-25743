This was my first time eating at Katz'd Deli. I live in Longmeadow, Ma and my sister just moved fron Carlsbad, Ca. to Brookfireld, Ct. I was looking for a place to meet & eat and Woodbridge is about halfway(1 hour) for both of us. I have a friend who lives in Woodbridge and he suggested katz's to me. He had just used them to cater a party that he had for 20 couples. I asked him to describe in one word how Katz's was and he responded "awesome." He was correct. We arrived a 10;30 A.M. this past Saturday and got seated right away. The waitresses"s were all fantastic.  Right away thet brought over a large bowl of the greatest cole slaw I ever had. Also a large bunch of pickles. Already I was in heaven. All 7  of us loved our breakfast and brought addition food home. I just had a hamburger on the grill and topped it off with the creamy cole slaw. O.M.G. The taste was so good I may not brush my teecth for a day just so the taste will stay in my mouth. We akso bought rugula. I had some last night with a glass of milk just before I wnt to bed.Fantastic. We can't wait to go back and try some deli sanwiches. Well woth the drive. We have nothing like this in my area.
