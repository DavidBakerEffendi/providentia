When I arrived my family and I were greeted at the door by two young girls at the same time. One took charge and was speaking very fast I couldnt grasp what the hell she was saying? Â In a high pitched giddy voice, we just nodded and follwed her to our seat. Our server was pleasant must say, and her hair was just beautiful. She was detailed about the food and her suggestions were right on! Since we ordered everything she said we should. Lettuce wraps :) very nice! My husband had a sushi tasting, never seen him so happy eating sushi?! Haha. One thing I was observing was this older Asian woman constantly starring at us and sometimes over our table? My husband and I also watched her argue with management staff? And Chase them around the resturant... Very weird and annoying to be honest, not professional at all.
