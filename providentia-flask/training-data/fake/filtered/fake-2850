Friends & I just left the restaurant  - at home, called to say I lost a sterling silver cuff, probably there at my seat - "Can you please go our table and look on the floor - it's bright and could be seen easily - PLEASE, it was a gift" The hostess, on the phone, was short, & abrupt  - said she was way too busy, but would look later. I was so put off and felt so badly, I called back to ask to speak to the manager. Being put on hold, a man returned back  on the phone. He was crash and rude as can be. He said "You lost a . . .silver bracelet? It' raining, why don't you come back and look for it - get a LIFE! Can you imagine being treated so poorly?What horrendous customer service - I was aghast. I had to call back and ask WHO spoke to me like that. Turns out it was the OWNER, Gregory, said the hostess on the phone. I've NEVER been treated so badly at a "favorite " eatery - I will NEVER go back and will advise all my friend in Montclair to do the same. What nerve to treat customers that way. I guess they just don't need us anymore!!!! "You suck - fellows! Food doesn't matter that much!"
