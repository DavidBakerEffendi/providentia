I had the Pressed Turkey and Brie sandwich. I was expecting real turkey not corner store deli style fake turkey. Its like wearing an evening gown with my most worn out gym shoes. I was disappointed. Kids had the pancakes, which they loved! If by chance I do go back, it will specifically be for the pancakes!
