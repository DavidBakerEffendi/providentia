Waaaay over priced for what you get.  Bf order scallop and for $5 they took one scallop, cut it side way twice (nice blade work there) to make 3 very thin slices of scallop-paper and grilled that.  My mind was filled with ????? when I saw that sad little skewer. The kara age is just fried chicken wings.... Tasteless and too greasy. Skewers are ok, nothing to write home about. I like oh taisho better. The place was small and cramped and the crowning moment was when the waitress spilled a bowl of udon dipping sauce onto my back.    Thank god I ordered cold udon and was wearing black. I would probably had been very unhappy if it was hot soup on a white shirt. Ps. For my trouble (having to rinse my top in the ladies' and then putting the soggy, cold soy sauce smelling thing back on)  I got my sad little 7 dollars drink for free.  It'll cost me more than that to dry clean my skirt.   The food honestly isn't bad, but it's not that good either.  Feh.
