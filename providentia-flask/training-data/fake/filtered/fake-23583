TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!! Don't bother. Doesn't live up to the hype. Doesn't offer any brown liquor cocktails. A well whiskey Old Fashioned was $13. The burger was the only reason it got A star. I asked for lettuce and tomato for my burger and was told I could order a salad on top of my $21 burger if I wanted lettuce with it. Completely unacceptable. Bottom line ... Will never go back!!!
