Exactly what I seek for in a good neighborhood restaurant, with an interesting menu and comfortable atmosphere.  The kind of place you go to every week.  Waited at bar for friends to arrive and thought it would be nice to eat at the bar if ever solo.  Staff was perfect - knowledgeable and attentive, not too intrusive and not too casual.  Menu has something for everybody - hard to choose between entrees but stuck with the calves liver which was perfectly cooked.  Will be back again.
