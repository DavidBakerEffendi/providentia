I love 202 Bistro! The food is excellent, and they always have the best specials. I have been to a lot of birthday parties here, and been to a few bridal showers and My meal and the experience is always wonderful. I have a big group of friends, and they cater to large parties very well. The restaurant is family owned, and the service is excellent. Bonus: its a BYOB :-)
