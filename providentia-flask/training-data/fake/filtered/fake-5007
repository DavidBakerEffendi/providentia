One of the best emails I have had in NYC.  We went and had the tasting menu to celebrate an anniversary.  Everything was super high-quality and you know a place is good when it's hard to name your favorite dish.  Service was great too.  I also liked that the tasting menu filled you up but wasn't too much to eat. Word to the wise - tasting menu is a much better value than ordering a la carte.
