Continental is a very cool place.  The rooftop bar is great and the drinks are amazing but pricey.  I had lunch here, which were on the smaller side.  The food was good and staff was very friendly, they even gave me a free cake for my birthday when I didn't even ask for one.  I do plan on gong back for dinner, which I have heard has larger portions and more worth the price.
