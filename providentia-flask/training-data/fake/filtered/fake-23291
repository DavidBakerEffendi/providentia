Yes the large pizza is like 20 bucks but seriously, its freaking good. Its gourmet pizza people! You get what you pay for. I certainly wouldnt pay the same for pizza anywhere else, thats for sure. But the fresh mozzerella, sweet but tangy sauce, and chewyt dough make it all worth it. Maybe thats why theyve been in business all these year. Ill be back.
