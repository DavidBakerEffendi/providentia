If you want diner food this place is perfect... I'm not a huge fan of the huge line - although i do love the free cookies and sausage - so I always just get it delivered. Â It's just as good and gets there in like 15 minutes... my favorite is the eggs benedict with the french fries... the fries are some of the best i've ever had and the sauce it comes with is incredible... their coffee is also delicious and staff is super nice...
