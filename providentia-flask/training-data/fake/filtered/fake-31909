Look O_0 you want a spot to hang out at? CALLE OCHO IS FOR YOU! They have this awesome Sangria bar with a ton of varieties. And I love me some sangria but you can NEVER get enough at Calle Ocho. All you can drink Sangria? Mannnnnnnn it's get no better but the food just nailed it! Man listen if I could eat there every other day I would. the wings are off the hook delicious. Let me tell you, let me tell you!!! The chicarron de pollo is like death on a plate its sooooooooooooooo good. You will want to eat 6 plates of this meal. Cmon red and green chimichurri?!?!?!!? Seriously its so friggin awesome. And the Pollo peruano........... How can something so good only be on one menu? I mean I love it. Calle Ocho is so good I told my boss about it. And he is leery about trying new things let me tell. But Calle Ocho is his new favorite spot. And he didnt think it was gonna be that good but now he's HOOKED!!! Im telling you Calle Ocho is the new "wave" if you havent been on this ride yet.
