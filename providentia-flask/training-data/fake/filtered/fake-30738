I visited Leone's this weekend!!! It's an amazing place, great location, great people, great service and hospitality. You feel like you are part of the family. We ordered the Ginger Calamari and the Balsamic Calamari with a house salad! The Calamari plates were the most outrageous taste you can have in your mouth... Amazing flavor that you can suck all your finger and eat the plate if you could. Then followed by the Shrimp Scampi- Jumbo Shrimp on top of baked buttery potatoes and side of Asparagus! Everything was perfectly cooked and presented well. The owner Mike and his staff were very pleasant. The best part is that is BYOB. You can bring your own liquor... I can totally recommend Leone's as the perfect restaurant to take anyone!!! why not that special someone!!! Thank you guys for the great experience!
