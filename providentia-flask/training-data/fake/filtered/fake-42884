This place has made a steady decline since it switched from Life Cafe to 983.  The food has always been inconsistent, but at least before it had some local charm.  Movie nights, game nights, good music playlists chosen by the bartenders, nice vegetarian choices...it was a cozy local spot.  Boy, have they changed.  The food is mostly fried now, there is constantly sports on the tvs, the prices have gone up, the beer selection has declined and (aside from Andy) the staff cares less than ever.  The last time we dined there, my burger was literally inedible.  How do you mess up a BURGER that bad??     We've been going there a long time, but finally, we're giving up on this one.
