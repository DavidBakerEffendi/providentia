An Italian wonderland.  Everything you could find in Italy (which I have been to several times).  Beware it is very crowded on the weekend, but a very vibrant place.  It is really fun to see them making pasta, and checking out all the freshly made Itaian bread- which they generally have 1 or more types you can taste.  If you want a less chaotic experience go during the week, probably not for dinner.  There is a great rooftop restaurant that my daughter said is great for having beer, wine appetizers.  Some of the best Wood Burning Pizza and Calzones can be found at La Pizza- La Pasta. Having been there twice and our table getting  the same food- mozzarella,  pizza, calzone.  My expectations were met again durrung my last visit. When I was there  the 1st time with my family we shared the short rib pasta which was also spectacular. If in NYC I would take the time to visit,  especially if you enjoy all things Italian. 4 stars is only because it can be so crowded and difficult to enjoy if visiting on a weekend.
