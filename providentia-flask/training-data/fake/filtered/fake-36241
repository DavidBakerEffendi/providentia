Living near by Isabellas, i would always walk by and was enticed by the smell of the food and how good it looked! Finally got to try isabellas and it was soo good! My husband and I both ordered and shared, and each dish was very good. The flavor was great and we finished it all! Next time we want to go just for dessert! I plan on going back to Isabellas and plan to bring my family the next time they are in town! Good job Isabellas!
