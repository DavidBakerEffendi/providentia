Came hear a second time on a Sunday afternoon. The waitress was great and the food was awesome. Had the combo platter again. The creamed spinach was awesome and super fresh, the mashed potatoes are totally fresh and home made. I read the bad reviews and I am so glad that every time we come it is phenomenal. I WILL BE BACK. I love the dry rub seasoning and the smoked wings and the 4 or 5 different side sauces. LOVE THIS PLACE.
