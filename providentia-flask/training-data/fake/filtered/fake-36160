I have visited this truck at the Summit Farmer's Market. It's a home run. My 12 year old daughter begs me to take her over on Sun mornings in the fall for the breakfast taco. The tacos are made after you order them so sometimes you have to wait a little bit, but it's worth it. Agree that the key is the quality of the meat. It's excellent. Don't think $5.25 for two tacos is bad at all though for great food. Best of the food trucks I have tried, including a number in Manhattan.
