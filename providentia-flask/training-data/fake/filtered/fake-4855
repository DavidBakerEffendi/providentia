The food was good. I have been to places with better food. I cant believe they charge $3 for a SMALL CUP of orange juice! Thats insane! I probably will never go there again. I would much rather go to ihop! Â At Ihop, you also get more bang for your buck. Additionally, The restaurant and parking lot are both small. If you have more than four people, the wait will be quite long.
