The pizza there is fresh, tastes great, and has a reasonable size. The sauce is hand made and the crust isn't hard like many pizzerias. It's cheap and the owner is really friendly he befriends me on my second visit there. I usually have a pizza a week and it is satisfying. I had a friend go there and he LOVED the pizza there. If I could go there everyday, I would. I recommend this place to all who love pizza.
