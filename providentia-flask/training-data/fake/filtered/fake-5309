My favorite restaurant in the West Village. I love this place and I take everyone of my friends from out of town into Malatesta to experience the SPINACH GNOCCHI because there is nothing like it!!!!! The atmosphere is exceptional because it is comfortable and makes you feel at home. I would recommend it to anyone!!
