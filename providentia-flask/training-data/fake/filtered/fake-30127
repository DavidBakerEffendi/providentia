This place is great! The Mediterranean cuisine is delicious and healthy. I took my friends here for lunch who were visiting from Germany. It was so conveniently located in midtown, yet didn't have a touristy feel. Exactly what we were looking for. The roasted eggplant and zucchini soup was delicious as was the root salad with feta. Almost too much to eat. My friends loved their Fresh Mozzarella sandwich and Chimi Chicken sandwich. Prices were great and we arrived right after the lunch rush so we were able to sit for a while and they did not seem to mind.
