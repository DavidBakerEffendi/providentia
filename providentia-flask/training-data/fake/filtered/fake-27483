This place is like the hot yet vapid girl you're out with.  A pure status symbol that you can tell everyone about but when you do finally get what you came for you end up thinking to yourself that was good but when you consider the amount of time, effort, location (seriously this isn't even convenient for someone from Brooklyn!) and money put into it, was it really worth it?  Maybe if the wait was reasonable.  Maybe if the price was what it was before tour buses started showing up.  Maybe if it there was someplace to sit.  Yes, the pizza is good.  Very good, even.  But  there are countless other places out there that are solid 8s without all of the drama.
