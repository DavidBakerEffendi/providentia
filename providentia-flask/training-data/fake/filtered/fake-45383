I went to this restaurant last night, and the scene was just amazing...gives off a great vibe. The menu isn't exactly extensive, its a small menu but the items I did try was fantastic. I had the mussels with andouille sausage(sausage is optional) and it was great, for my entree I enjoyed the blackend salmon with the roasted plantain and my boyfriend had the buttermilk fried chicken with the red velvet waffles....he did find the waffles dense but it was good...delicious food and great staff and atmosphere.
