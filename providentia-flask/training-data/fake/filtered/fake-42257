So, I signed up for Yelp because of Traif.  Went for the second time last night with the missus and had a second flawless meal.  How they get away with only charging $8 for a Hamachi plate I'll never know, but damn is it good.  As were the sweetbreads, peach salad, spicy squid, and scallops.   Dude in the kitchen can seriously cook.   Service has been excellent both times as well (for those of you who live in W'burg, that can be difficult to find) Kudos guys, keep up the good work
