The food was pretty tasty for what it was. but my waiter decided to swipe my card for the amount of the bill and promptly gave himself a $60 tip!! so, for my $51.31 worth of food and drink, my husband and I paid $111.31!!!! To make matters worse, i have contacted the restaurant numerous times to have this rectified and have my money refunded to me... they don't return phone calls and its been over a week since I made the first call and I STILL haven't been refunded my money!! I will never go back to this establishment again! And if anyone reads this i suggest you pay with cash or just avoid going there all together.
