Last Saturday evening, we had a group of 12 people to celebrate my sister-in law's birthday. Had a GREAT time!!!! Our server Josh was very nice and professional...We order our martini's,( which by the way were strong and delicious) to start, we ordered delicious appetizers:( a couple of each orders of ) mussels sauteed with hot cherry tomatoes in a white wine sauce, the traditional fried calamari and what blew us away was....a Â huge martini glass filled with crushed and a bowl cocktail sauce in the middle, on top of the ice, 4 raw oysters, 4 large clams, 4 jumbo shrimps and a half of a steamed lobster... WOW !!!! DELICIOUS..... For entrees, we had some out of the regular Menu and some of the evening Specials, and they were all GREAT, well cooked and spiced, great presentation and again very tasty. I'm just going to mention a few, that I recall: Vitello al Mare, Gamberi Livornese, Salmon with lobster stuffing, Grouper, Filet Mignon with lobster, etc..... My husband and I will go back, and you should too, you'll not be disappointed.
