Don't bother. This place is just crap. This is about as Mexican as Old El Paso products. I feel like most of the products are frozen and just reheated. I'd hope when I order from a Mexican restaurant I'd get better quality then what I'd get at a Bar during happy hour, or what I could throw together myself. Seasoning was non-existant. Basically you can expect the same quality "Mexican food" that would be served in an elementary school lunch. Better meal at Taco Bell.
