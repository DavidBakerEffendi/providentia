My son and I had dinner here a couple of days ago.   It was an  excellent experience, and I am sure we will return for more! Very friendly atmosphere, greeted by the owner, with an instant welcome. Food was good too, the  Asparagus Salad was served perfectly chilled on an extremely hot evening! Tuna melt and BLT panino, both first class, and the young waiter very helpful!   Thanks Ghia, welcome to Bushwick and good luck for the future!
