Guru Palace is such a great restaurant! I recently threw a party there a surprise 40th birthday and it went great. They help us set up so well and everything went planned perfectly. The Banquet hall and the whole restaurant is so nice of how it looks. The food is so great tasting and perfect. The staff is great they helped us out with anything we needed to make the party great. We had many decorations and stuff and they helped us a lot and treating us great. The food tasted very perfect it was well cooked and fresh. They had many varieties of great food it was hard to choose which one to pick for the party. The surprise went great and every guest enjoyed the night to the fullest. They loved the food and just the atmosphere being in guru palace. They danced there heart out and couldn't ask for a better night. Everyone went home with a full stomach and a very memorable night. I couldn't have asked for more because it was just the best. I am definitely going to have a party here again. The hall is great for any type of event. I would prefer Guru Palace than any other restaurant in New Jersey.I been to many Indian restaurants for some party's and also to dine and Guru Palace was honestly the best.
