Finally... a quiet, enjoyable meal with my family without whining and complaining!!!!! Even though we don't have any known gluten allergies in the house, I decided to try Chef Tony's gluten-free chicken tenders! They looked so fresh and delicious I couldn't help myself! My kids devoured them and even my fussiest eater asked for MORE!!!! I will definitely be back!! Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!
