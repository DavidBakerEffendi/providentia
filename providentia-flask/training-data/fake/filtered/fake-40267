Okay. I knew the place opened at noon on Wednesdays so I thought I would get there close to that so I wouldn't have to wait long. That was a good idea. I had a square slice ($4) and I saw Dom make it in front of me, I saw the pizza go in the oven and I saw it come out and him cut a healthy amount of basil on top. About 15-20 minutes from order to mouth. I thought the slice was really very good. Maybe the best I've ever had. I wanted another but there was no room in my gut. I did wait another, oh.... 10 minutes? for a slice to take home to my husband. I will go back there with friends. It is one block of the Q train at the Avenue J stop. Easy to find.
