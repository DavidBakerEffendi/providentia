I like this place better than Chevelas!! Chevelas is cute but I think their vegetarian options are meh. The fried avocado/jalapeno taco is super tasty.  Also really good marghs -- not super cheap, but that is because they are fresh -- none of the fluorescent lime crap.   The people who work there are also nice and obviously pumped to be making delish food.  It's also open late(!!) which is a very exciting thing in Crown Heights.
