WHAT A RIPOFF! As a white guy getting seafood w/rice to go they put only 3 shrimps and 2 clams in the $17 dinner, then after a call to the manager by my spanish wife who always gets a ton of seafood, they claimed to be the owner and said thats all you get. NOT TRUE! This restaurant discriminates against white people as opposed to spanish or peruvian people. What a disapointment for a restaurant with such a good reputation in the hartford area. Obviously things are not going well at PIOLIN!
