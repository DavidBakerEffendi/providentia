Horrible service for an upscale place. The waitress was in a zone...waited about 15 minutes before I asked her for service. Wasn't busy at all she was totally in attentive. She brought us our drinks and never came back to check on us. We wanted more wine and app's but became frustrated and asked for our check. Upon leaving I chatted with the manager. She was detached as well. She didn't encourage us to stay nor tried to understand our service issues. SO IF GOOD SERVICE IS WHAT YOU WANT ... BEWARE OF THIS PLACE !!!!.
