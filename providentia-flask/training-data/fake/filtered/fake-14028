This was pretty disappointing, especially after all the praise.  The food was blandly prepared.  It lacked both careful preparation and design.  My girlfriend had the watermelon salad, which sounded like a nice idea, but in the end seemed more like an experiment by a college student.  My burger was terrible, totally undercooked and unremarkable with the english muffin as a bun.  The whole place reminded me of being a kid and trying out "new" ideas for foods by mixing things that simply do not go together, in spite of best intentions.  The only thing that saved this restaurant from a lower score was that the wait staff could tell how disgruntled I was and brought along a dish of chocolate mousse, on the house.  And that was actually rather tasty.  But the overall experience was not deeply improved.
