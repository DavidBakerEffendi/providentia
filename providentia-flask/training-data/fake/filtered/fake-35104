I am not a fan of Ramen by any means, so I was dreading the thought of having to spend money on food I don't even like. Last night's meal though was quite unexpected -- in a good way. It was packed..(duh! It's a Saturday). Waited less than 20 minutes (Shocking, I know!), then seated. The service was attentive, and the ambiance was chill in a so-not-trying way, which I appreciated. Pork buns, tasty. I mean, it's really hard to get pork buns wrong, so I'm glad they didn't. I ordered the Spicy Ramen at my friend's behest. And I found it to be super flavorful. Past experiences have shaped my biased views against Ramen compliments of super oily broths (Michi Ramen @ Austin), too-tough-to-chew chashu (Ramen Tatuya @ Austin), ridiculously salty everything (Daikokuya  @ LA). Goldilocks of Ramen, sure why not...but Ani Ramen was just right for me.  We only ordered one bowl since the servings are massive. Good call since they don't do take out boxes or bowls, which is kinda silly but oh well. I would definitely come back and try their other dishes and maybe comment on those at a later time. Honestly, if you are remotely curious about this place, give it a shot, before it  gets featured on those traveling Foodie shows. After that, who know what the line and wait times will be.
