Cheap and great dumplings! 5 for a buck! A pint of fresh soy bean milk for $1. Please note this is a hole in the wall place in NYC. Please don't  complain about the surrounding as not clean and potential rodent problems in the area...after all it's NYC. The place got rated an A  by the health department and the folks at Prosperity know what they're doing.
