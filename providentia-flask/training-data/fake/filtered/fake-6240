As a cuban, I wanted to share part of my culture with some of my friends. I chose this place and honestly I was a little nervous 'cause I wanted them to take a good impression. The experience couldn't have been better. As soon as we got there, the decoration, the music, the friendly staff, and the best of all, the food! We brought our own wine and they served it very kindly. My friend was delighted with vaca frita. I also tried the tilapia with lemon sauce and it was amazing. Everybody had a great time, and we even got to know the chef! I'm definitely coming back and I highly recommend this place for a nice Saturday night.
