I've been to the bar for happy hour several times (once even on opening night), and I've eaten in the restaurant. I will admit, both bar and restaurant got off to a rocky start regarding service and timeliness of orders. However, everything seems to have been smoothed out and they are running a lot more efficiently now. Â The staff is extremely friendly and helpful: we were even offered a free drink token one evening if we could answer some movie trivia correctly (we did). The food is definitely interesting and unique, though I have only had a few of the sandwiches. It is decidedly not "theater food" as they offer cheese plates and hummus, but at the same time it seems to be a bit playful (I think I remember seeing waffles and chicken on the menu). This is definitely my favorite place for happy hour as they have a great drink menu and pretty good bar food at great prices.
