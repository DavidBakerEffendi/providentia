This is the best restaurant in Newark really. I just ordered the combination platter and it is very delicious combination of chicken, beef, kebab, shish, rice, pita, and salad. The portion is very generous and I can see myself talking 3 days to eat it all. The delivery was very quick as well. Thank you very much guys.
