One Word: Yum I was on a first date last night who took me to Grimaldi's under the Brooklyn Bridge. I've been to the Hoboken, NJ Grimaldi's before, but never the original. It was seriously delicious. We ordered a pepperoni pie to go, sprinkled extra cheese and red pepper flakes on top, and took a walk to the river. Sitting and eating the a Grimaldi's pie by the water was a fabulous first date! Loved every minute ... and every bite.
