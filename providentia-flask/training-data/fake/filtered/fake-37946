meh. too cool to satisfy the average joe. but as far as i have seen there is only one italian car parked there routinely. and when it boils down to it, seems to be targeted at the fake bake eyetalian american hummer set who are in abundance. deserts are superb. bar food fair enough - decayed since opening, when was much more carefully prepared. entrees mezzo mezzo. brunch pretty good with some odd and interesting dishes e.g., eggs purgatory.
