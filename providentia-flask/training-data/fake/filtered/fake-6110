Vietnamese and Thai cuisine is my top favorite food choices and putting these two together was the best idea ever. I had thought they had run out out of fusion combinations, so going to OBAO was a complete treat. I was introduced to OBAO through a friend and it has officially become one of my favorite late night, late breakfast and blunner meal spots. It came to my surprise to find out that they allowed large group seating upstairs, so I decided to have a party with over 20 people. I was nervous that they would not be able to handle a party as big as mine, but ultimately I was impressed at their attentiveness, recommendations to their favorite food items and impeccable customer service. My friends were also pleased to find the food to be tasty and their drink menu. I order delivery regularly and enjoy going there for after work happy hour, not to mention taking my out of town guests there. I've been asking for them to bring TITOS to the bar so hopefully upon reading my review they will take my request into consideration. :) The staff is good looking, knowledgeable and really helpful with any questions you may have. Not to mention, it's a great place for people watching and celebrity spotting. xoxo
