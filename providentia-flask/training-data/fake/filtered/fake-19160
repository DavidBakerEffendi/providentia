I go here very often when visiting my son in Burlington. I introduced him to ika here. Pleasant atmosphere, cute waitresses, some of the best prepared sushi i've had at a restaurant. The staff is very cordial but sometimes could use a little lighheartedness to pep em up. Nicely designed place that makes you want to be there and be served. I highly rescommend it
