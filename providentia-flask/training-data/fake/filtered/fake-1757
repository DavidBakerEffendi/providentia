Came her with my wife the other day and enjoyed ourselves. She had the regular chicken and I had the spicy. Tried a couple of side dishes, the mac and cheese was good but not great. The cornbread is very good, same as at sister restaurant Smoke Joint. The spicy is really hot, but bearable for me. The regular was tasty but had no spice whatsoever. Perhaps a happy medium might be a good menu option to add. We also split the raspberry apple pie, that was really good and a nice way to end the meal. Decent beer selection is also worth noting. I would go back and bring friends, but I think I would prefer to go to Pies and Thighs for the biscuit and the location.
