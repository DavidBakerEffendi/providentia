I had an extremely disappointing experience this past weekend for breakfast.  I was part of a group of six having breakfast on Saturday morning.  Two of the six orders were wrong.  Our waitress vehemently insisted that she entered our orders correctly, but that the kitchen had been [insert expletive] all morning.  Despite the obvious dissatisfaction, she had to be prompted to correct the situation - i.e., return the incrrect orders and see that the correct orders were placed.  Her inability to problem solve made more sense after we were approached by the manager - and I use that term in the loosest sense - who reluctantly told one of the members of our party that her breakfast would be complimentary.  When the other member of our party with an incorrect order (which was being re-made by the kitchen as the manager was standing at our table) politely inquired about her entree, the manager told her that the fact that she had asked dissuaded him from removing it from the bill.  He then proceeded to go into a detailed explanation on two more return trips to our table about how complimentary food was his decision, at his discretion, etc.  Needless to say, all six of us were baflled, having never experienced anything like that before.  We made our opinions known to him, and, as we were walking out the door, the manager sarcastically wished us well.  The waitress ended up profusely apologizing and we tipped her in excess of the standard amount because we felt so bad for her.  All in all, it was a horrible experience, and our group made the consensus not only to never return, but also to share the negative experience by posting reviews.
