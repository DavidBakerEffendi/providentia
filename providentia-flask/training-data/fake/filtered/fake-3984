Get Fresh is seriously huge for those of us who are trying to eat locally-grown, organic food whenever possible, but are too busy working, raising kids, etc. to grocery shop and cook from scratch as often as we'd like (or ever). Like the store's name, the ingredients are always fresh, and depending on how much time you have, there are a variety of prepared meals to choose from--some you just have to heat and serve, others require you to mix and cook the ingredients, which makes you feel as though you're actually cooking a real meal. I'm a veggie/fish eater, and all of the seafood dishes I've tried have been great--and sustainably caught/harvested. My husband loves the pork and chicken dishes, and has his eye on the steak for next time. My kids dig the mac & cheese, which is a more sophisticated offering than our usual Annie's from the box, and we all love the soba noodles, which are super-easy to prepare. Oh, and the homemade hummus is truly the best I've ever tasted. Seriously. Delish. Great place for a kids' bday party too.
