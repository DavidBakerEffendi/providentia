I love this place.  I've been coming here for breakfast every couple of weeks for the past year and a half and it's always been a good time.  Any time I have friends in town, I recommend this place to them.  Everyone there is really nice and friendly, the food is always great and made right in front of you, and the prices could scarcely be better. To people complaining about the small size of the place or "parking difficulty": I don't think you understand what this place is.  It's not meant to be a diner or a large chain restaurant.  Instead, it's a very cozy place to stop and get a home-made breakfast or lunch.  Parking isn't "relatively convenient," it's actually very convenient.  There is a large lot in the back and a few metered spaces on the street out front.  If walking a short distance from your car to the door makes the difference between a place being "very" and "relatively" convenient... you've got problems.
