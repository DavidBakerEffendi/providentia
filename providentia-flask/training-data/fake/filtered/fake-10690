Easily the most annoying place on the planet. Tried it for the 3rd time last night. Strike 3!! Aside from the annoying guy playing sound affects after every score he uses his microphone to call over a bus boy during the national anthem.  I tried, I thought maybe I was missing something but my friend felt the same way.  Left before the 1st qtr of the GB game was over went to God fathers and watched the game without the annoyance that is the owner. I will say the waitress Jamie was very nice and the food was not bad at all, but it would have to be gourmet and free to be worth listening to that guy!
