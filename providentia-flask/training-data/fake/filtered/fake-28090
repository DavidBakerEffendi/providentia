My friend was only in NY for two days and had been craving NYC pizza for months.  We went over to the east side only because I told him this place is supposed to have phenomenal pizza.   We weren't extremely hungry and shared the 15" ortolano and had two drinks.  The waiter seemed upset that we didn't other anything else. Well, when the pie arrive, I was shocked...for $19 it is reasonable to expect to get more than dough topped with a table spoon or two of tomato sauce, a dash of cheese, and LESS than a quarter cup of zucchini and eggplant (we asked for no mushrooms).  I am NOT exaggerating!  Seriously, only the very middle had cheese and veggies...would have taken a picture as proof but didn't have a camera.  What we got looked nothing, and mean nothing, like the pics posted.  And the pizza wasn't even tasty.   Very, very disappointing experience. Ah, fellow yelpers, you failed me big time!
