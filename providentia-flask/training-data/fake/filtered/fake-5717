OK. Been to The Wishing Well quite a few times...  I went back on Saturday to find that they had changed the entire menu and menu format.  Normally, I would recommend against this, except they have COMPLETELY changed the already great menu ideas into a much nicer, much more reader-friendly format, with a TON of great new additions.  I really like how they have expanded on their burger selections and added some more outside-of-the-box options for burgers than you can get anywhere else in the city! I had the Chicken Fried Steak Burger, which was amazing.  I love chicken fried steak, and it was simply a burger, but breaded and fried like CFS, and topped wtih the usual peppery cream gravy I was expecting.  The only thing was I wished it came with Mashed Potatoes, since that's how I always eat my CFS.... but still, Kudos to the team for pushing through the opening hardships and coming up with a more friendly, more stable menu format that most should enjoy.
