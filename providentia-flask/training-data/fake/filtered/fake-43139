I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm going with 4 because this place is such a welcome addition to the neighborhood, and the folks who run it are so nice. I've lived in the area for 4 years and we really, really needed a place like this. It is lovely and as I said, the owner/chef and his wife are great. I think the food is good BUT the service is often SOOOO SLOW, even when it is not so busy. And the wait staff seems to not have much experience, so simple things are sometimes forgotten or requests need to be repeated 2 or 3 times. Love that they use lots of local ingredients. Love that their adorable daughters are often there. I'm hoping that the service kinks and slowness will improve with time. I'm really rooting for the Lebanon Diner!
