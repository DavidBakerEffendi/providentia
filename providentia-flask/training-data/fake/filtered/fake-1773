A decent attempt at Venezuelan food (according to my Venezuelan boyfriend), I usually like the food very much. We always get tajadas, which are the fried plantain with cheese - the cheese is definitely yummy! We generally just stick to the arepas and avoid the dishes/salads/etc. We also always get the passion fruit juice. The service is pretty good and the place is always pretty full on weekends.
