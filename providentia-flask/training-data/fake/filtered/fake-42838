Nyonya exceeds expectations across the board.  The decor was very much asian fusion and chic.  The food.....absolutely delicious.  Growing up in one of the most asian areas in Queens, my family has probably tried just about every Malaysian restaurant available to us......and Nyonya is one of the best I've had.  Some of my favorites are: Sotong Goreng - You might think this is just asian-style calamari, but try it and you'll be amazed by how light the breading is and the how tender fried quid can be. Beef Rendang - I've been to many other places where the beef is tough and your jaws hurt by the time you've finished chewing.  At Nyonya, the meat is tender and you just want to lap up the coconut curry. Kangkung Belachan - Belachan sauce is probably an acquired taste, it is a shrimp sauce that is fermeted (I believe).  This is something I've grown up with....I love the water spinach with the sauce.  It is a must-have for me whenever i go.
