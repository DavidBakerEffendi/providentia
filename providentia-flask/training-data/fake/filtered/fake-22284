Speedy, courteous service. Friendly for kids but adults will feel comfortable here too. Sushi can be a Little pricey, but nothing beats their lunch box meal. Probably the best value of any meal in the area, includes a variety of authentic sides. Hard to get to if you've never been, but that just makes it more of a gem for the locals. I would recommend Yama's to anybody
