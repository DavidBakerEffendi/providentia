I'm in NYC on assignment from Tokyo, where I've lived for 12 years. If you shot me with a tranq dart, blindfolded me, flew me to NYC from Tokyo, took me into Sakagura, and then woke me up, I'd have no idea we weren't still in Japan. The only giveaways are the English signage! Sakagura is absolutely my favorite restaurant in NYC.
