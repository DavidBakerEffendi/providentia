I went for my birthday, and I had a FABULOUS time. I went on a Thursday, so the rate was discounted nicely (about $25/ h for a private karaoke room instead of I think $50) Â . The service was fast and friendly, and so was the food, except for the takoyaki. Call me picky, but it was a little over done for my taste. Everyone else in my party thought it was fantastic and a fun new dish, but I had real takoyaki for the first time in Japan, so that's my standard. Also, the song selection left something to be desired. I mean it was alright, but a lot of songs and singers you would expect a decent karaoke place to have they didn't, (only 1 Utada Hikaru song? really?) and they sped up some songs and screwed up the lyrics to others. For the type of money they charged, I expected better, but I give it 4 stars because all in all, it was a great time with great friends, AND since it was my birthday, they gave me a free bottle of flaming champagne. Woohoo!
