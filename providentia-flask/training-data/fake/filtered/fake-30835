Hands down my favorite thai restaurant in all of brooklyn. When we lived in Carroll Gardens and my wife was pregnant, we ate so much Joya we joked with the owners that our son was composed nearly entirely of a combination of Kang Panang Ghai, Spicy noodles with chicken, and Pad Kee Mao. Couldn't recommend highly enough, for either a casual night out, or as a place to impress your visiting out-of-towners while not dropping a bundle.
