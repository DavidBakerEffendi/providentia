We were kicked out. I went here this evening with my girlfriend and daughter. Previously they had a $10.00 minimum to sit in the dining area, and no minimum to sit in the bar area. The owner had the waitress come over to tell us that there is now a $25.00 minimum in all areas. I told her that it is 11:15 (I think that the group tonight played only until midnight), and said that it would be ridiculous for me to pay $75.00.  We decided to leave, already having heard horror stories about the owner from both patrons and members of bands that play here. As we were leaving, the owner came over to explain that the group performing tonight is very popular, and therefore she charges the minimum. My girlfriend reiterated that it is ridiculous, and the owner went ballistic, asking us to leave "right now".  I wonder if this woman knows how many customers she has lost since her dad passed away. What a poor business person. By the way, the food was always just fine, nothing special. Ray, one of the waiters was always terrific, though.
