Onomea....It should be called Offomea the only good thing about the place was the 2 server. My wife and I decided to finally give it a chance after passing it a bunch of time and seeing it empty and now I know why. We were 1 of 3 tables in the establishment. I ordered the Loco Moco and my wife ordered the Kalbi short ribs. The ribs had a little flavor but the Loco Moco did not taste like much and to top it off the female cook who I belive is one of the owners looked like she didnt know what she was doing. she was running around like a chicken with its head cut off. I guess all I got to say is servers keep up the good work and the female cook should get some schooling under her belt.
