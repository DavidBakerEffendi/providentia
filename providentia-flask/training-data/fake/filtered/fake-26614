Went for brunch on Sunday and was disappointed- it was crowded, loud and the service was terrible. The food itself was okay-- I had the quesadilla's and I've had much much better, they were boring frankly. But it was really the service that turned me off, yes they were busy but that is no excuse for taking 20 minutes to bring me a cup of coffee! And worst of all they overcharged my credit card and even though it fixed itself in the following few days it was a hassle that I truly didn't need.
