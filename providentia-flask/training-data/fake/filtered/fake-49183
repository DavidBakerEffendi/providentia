HORRIBLE! I don't usually go out of my way to post reviews. If I have a bad experience at a place I just chalk it up as a loss and move on, BUT in this case I have to say something. This was the worst dining experience I have ever had in my life! I was invited to a birthday party for a friend at this "resturant/lounge" and I was completely disgusted with the fake ass security, the "service" and mostly the crowd this place attracts. The ONLY tolerable element of this place was the food , but even that was not enough to even make me want to return. As my fiancee and I dined, we were surrounded by over weight Nicki Minajs and Rick Ross doubles attempting to mate for the evening. If I wanted to eat in the middle of a club or rap video I would have done so. The "lounge"area and its attendees spilled over into the dining section and I flipped out. I spoke to the manager and she spilled her guts on her dissatisfaction with the unruly partygoers and the "promoter". It was so bad that I did not even stay to celebrate with my friends because I was truly disgusted, irritated and out right disappointed. My suggestion to you Dragonfly - ditch that after hours lounge, and stick to trying to run your restaurant , because the service was as horrible as my general experience at this trashy place.
