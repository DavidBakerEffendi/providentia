On a recent trip to New York City, I used Yelp to try to find a good Mexican dinner at the last minute. I am so glad that I chose based on the reviews because this was exactly what we wanted. Thought it's not a traditional American Mexican restaurant, it's still fantastic. A quaint, intimate restaurant that offers a small menu, but delicious food was the perfect place for a cozy dinner. I also thought it was a good value for the price of both the food and the wine. Would love to come back again for brunch.
