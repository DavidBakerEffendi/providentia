Sushi "snob" here. Lived in Japan.  Family is Japanese.  Eat sushi... all. the. time. I'm REALLY picky, and I tend to have a method for testing out sushi restaurants.  Salmon I can handle when it's not extremely fresh.  Most other fish I don't even touch unless it's a great restaurant. Now that we got that outta the way----this place is fantastic.  Listen to the sushi chefs and eat what they give you and as they tell you to eat it... this place is authentic.  Sushi is fresh and delicious!  With Yasuda, I was feeling adventurous because I felt I could trust the sushi chefs to do their thing and impress me (and my taste buds). Absolutely delicious.  Pricey, but there's a way around it.  Go for lunch... If you're looking for big portions, my advice would be not to go to authentic sushi restaurants.
