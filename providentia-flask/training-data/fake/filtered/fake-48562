I love the food here but customer service is an important part of my rating. Management was on vacation, and the individual left in charge decided that the restaurant would charge a prix fixe meal for a reservation. For all those that have ever been here, you know that such a thing doesn't exist for this small restaurant. Like all set meals, you are then charged a flat fee per person, but how do you know how the price is determined if it comes from the top of one's head? That to me means I must give Bedouin tent a below average rating. It's unacceptable.
