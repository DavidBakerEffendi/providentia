Decent experience ruined by thoroughly unpleasant treatment by server. Last Saturday, I ordered a beer, which poured warm.  The server's reaction was, "a few ice cubes would solve that, sir."  To his temporary credit, he brought another.  When that one poured warm as well, I realized that the reason was that the glass was hot.  The server's response was to tell me that the restaurant was "very busy" (always a valid reason for sub-standard fare), and to then explain that the restaurant washes glasses after patrons use them. The ambience is otherwise decent, and the food is generally acceptable,  But, I have no interest in warm (or diluted) beer, or lectures from snotty servers.  My large party and I will not be back.
