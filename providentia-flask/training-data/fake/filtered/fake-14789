One of my favorite places, regardless of the occasion. Went there with a group of colleagues and had a wonderful meal start-to-finish. The service was fantastic and they accommodated our group of 10 very easily. Appetizers were excellent (the Sweet and Sour Calamari is the best anywhere ... really.) and the entrees were perfectly cooked and generously portioned. I've read some other reviews here but must say that I've never had a issue with service and I've never been disappointed with the meal.
