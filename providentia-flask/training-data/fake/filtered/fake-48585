We happened upon Rail House this evening while out for a walk and decided to grab a quick drink on the patio.When we entered the patio we were greeted by the owner, Michael, who made us feel at home. Although we had already eaten we decided to get a drink and an appetizer. We ordered the Buffalo Chicken Satay--wonderful! It was so tasty we ordered seconds.   For dessert we had the gelato trio and passion fruit panna cotta. Both were exceptional. The gelato trio comes with a light vanilla with shaved almonds and a dollop of peanut butter, pistachio and coffee with chocolate covered crisps on top-all made at Rail House. It's obvious that they use high quality ingredients and have an experienced attention to detail chef. The passion fruit panna cotta was incredible, I repeat, INCREDIBLE.  It comes with a fruit salsa, finely chopped mango, raspberry puree, fresh raspberry. This is a must try. We will be spending lots of time on their patio this summer. It is well landscaped, intimate without being cramped and the fireplace adds to the ambiance. Tasteful music was also playing but wasn't too loud.  Attention to detail seems to be their specialty. Although we didn't have an entree  the appetizer and desserts we had were fantastic, couldn't have been better. We highly recommend The Rail House and will be returning very soon.
