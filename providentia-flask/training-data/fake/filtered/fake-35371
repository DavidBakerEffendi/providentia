I agree with other reviews that the average rating is too high.  This is a dive bar with overpriced, bland food.  A friend asked me to join her for lunch here to celebrate St. Patrick's day.  I ordered a Guinness which was served in a plastic cup and the pour was shameful.  Come on now!  It was not like they were so busy that they should have been pardoned for the use of plastic cups.  At the very least, pour a Guinness correctly!  Have some pride!  The service was as bland as the meal we ordered.  We ordered off the special menu and our food wasn't even hot when it arrived. The website said there would be live music all day, but none was played during the hour lunch we spent there around noon.  I didn't give them a 1-star rating because nothing was THAT bad, and sometimes they have good drink specials during the week.  This place usually attracts a middle-aged crowd.  I am surprised anyone would choose to go here with Vaughn's only one street over.  If you are looking for a real Irish bar and a proper pour, head over there instead.
