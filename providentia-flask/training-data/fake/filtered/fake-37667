i have been going to Istanbul Kebab House since it first open 4 years ago. Ahmed was there alone....he cooked me a chicken shawarma....The chicken was the best flavor I ever taste in my life, (produce) vegetables was so fresh....That was 2009 sometime....Today I get 2 chicken shawarma's every time I eat here because it is that GOOD...I'm so for real this restaurant is my number 1 in NEW YORK CITY.....after you eat, your stomach feels so GOOD....no bubbles in ya guts, no gas, you just wanna lay down and relax...I have brought all my kids here, they love it!....I have brought friends there, they love it...They remodeled the place so its bigger and more elegant with surround sound tv and whatever you wanna watch....People if you are in this area, times square, you should go here if you wanna eat healthy and you want good tasting food! Trust me, you will be addicted.....also the red egg plant is marvelous.....peace to all, 1 love.......@teegilly141......THANKS
