The service here was great and the staff was extremely friendly. I had the spaghetti e popette and It was absolutely delicious. Everyone working there was friendly and accomodating and we got our food within 10 minutes of ordering. Panini's is also in a very nice and lively area close to the 5th street SEPTA station so getting there was a breeze. I'll definitely be back soon!
