The food is tasty, but nothing stood out as particularly tremendous and it was overpriced.  The service was efficient and very friendly, and it certainly wasn't a bad experience, but not worth repeating at these prices.  The tables near the end give a nice view, but if you're seating farther into the restaurant there isn't as much to see.
