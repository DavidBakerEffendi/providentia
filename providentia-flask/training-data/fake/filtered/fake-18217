Hands down my favorite pizzeria in Montclair . I love this place, the decor is amazing and the food is delicious, from specialty slices to your favorite Italian dishes , just like mom use to make! I eat here at least three times a week and will not go to any other place in Montclair , that guy spencer is full of it, my advice is to go there and try it for yourself! The staff is very friendly and accommodating , and the pricing is just right. I would recommend the grandma pizza, but it's all delicious!
