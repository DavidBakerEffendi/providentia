i like being ahead of the curve. when it comes to food in NYC that can be hard. but i used to be a regular at the hallowed halls of Pommes Frites when i first lived in the city. after being away for a few years, i found it again. apparently so had the Food Network, but this time i was first. one late chilly afternoon i was dying for a snack. salty. savory. hot. those nasty street pretzels were not going to do it. then, i round the corner and stumble on my old friend, Pommes Frites. it was different but the same. small, kind of dingy but cozy. the original owners seemed to have vanished and sold it to (i think) a Filipino family. well, wherever they originally hail from, they know how to do begian fries like the founders. fat, crispy outside, tender inside and each order is more fries than you really need to eat. i always end up getting a large and regretting it. but how can you resist the crispy goodness? served in the traditional paper cone a regular cone the regular is $4.50, the large is $6.25 and the double is $8. service is super fast. no matter how long the line outside the place, you're inside in a few minutes. this gives you enough time to decide what kind of dipping sauce you want. there are a lot of choices! i've never ordered the free ones--ketchup, mayo, malt vinegar. too plain. i like the wasabi mayo (which could be a little kicked up for my taste--i like my sinuses to open up!) and on the Â other end, the peanut satay. mildly sweet and tad spicy. canned and bottled drinks are available, but if you want something harder than Brisk Iced Tea, then you need to do your drinking before you get there--which a lot of people seem to do. VERY limited seating--this is best a grab-and-go place. when the weather is warm it's a great local hang, especially after the pub crawl. it's open until about 3am on the weekends and 1 am other nights. oh yeah, there is outdoor seating--two big stools chained to the storefront. this is the definition of comfort food!
