Stopped in Egg Harbor facility today for lunch. $ 29.90 plus tip lighter, should have went to Wendy's. Was going to order the lobster roll untill I saw the $ 19.95 price. Will someone tell Pete the market price of lobster has dropped dramatically. Â Went with seafood chowder, cheeseburger , crab fries, 2 drinks. Chowder-1 shrimp, 2 clams, 2 mussel and loaded with potatoes, terrible..the so called famous crab fries-famously overated..cheeseburger-again, should have went to Wendy's. Coors Light was excellent though.
