Went to Almond for brunch today and had a lovely, low fuss meal. We walked straight up around the time it opened (11am) and got a table for 2 outside. It was a beautiful morning and so we were very happy. It's really nice to have a good brunch without the anxiety of knowing when or whether you'll get a table. We were probably lucky with the outdoor tables (there's probably 10 or so outdoor tables) but Almond has quite a large capacity inside so I would expect that getting a table fairly quickly would be the norm if you're not fussed as to whether you're indoors or outdoors. I had the croque monsieur with tomato which was yummy and just so huge - you could definitely share it between 2 I think. Â My husband had the omelette and was happy with his also. The best bit about the whole experience was the complimentary scones (perfectly baked) and accompaniments - yumbo! Service was also efficient so no complaints there. We will return.
