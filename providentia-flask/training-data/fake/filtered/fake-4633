Pretty restaurant, nice light, service ok. The cocktails are not serious and must be ignored. Excellent wine list that covers all the different regions of Italy. Better know what you order though, prices for bottles goes from $60 to $995 from what I remember. Food was good but the gnocchi I ordered were slightly overcooked. The portions served are very small and the pasta entrees are the size of an appetizer. Better have at least an appetizer + two entrees and dessert or you'll stay hungry. (Advice good for men with a normal appetite), portion might be enough for a girl. I would recommend to spend a minimum of $70 per person (only for food). Overall: Not worth It.
