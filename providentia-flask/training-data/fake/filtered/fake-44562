I went there with a few friends last night for dinner and everyone thoroughly enjoyed it.  The decor was cute, the service was good and the food was truly excellent!  I enjoy really spicy food and was pleased to find that the food marked spicy is quite spicy and extremely flavorful.  This is by far the best thai food we've had in the area, and we plan to go back very soon.  Prices are reasonable relative to most area restaurants - dinner for 4 including multiple appetizers was under $100.  BYO.
