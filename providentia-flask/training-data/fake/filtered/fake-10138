Love this place. We brought a case of beer  order wings, nachos, tacos and a couple of rack of ribs. Go figure ribs at a Mexican place but they were perfect. The owner let us put a couple of table together on one side of the restaurant by the TV. They brought over 2 big buckets of ice and then we watched the games pigged out and drank beers. Food was banging and saved a ton on beers. Going back next Sunday.  Go Giants!!!! Go Yanks!!!
