I think the volume of 5-star ratings here should serve as a warning sign -- namely that vegans, and those pretending they're carnivores to impress you with their love of MOB, have come to Yelp with an agenda. I can only guess that this agenda is to support a great-looking neighborhood vegan restaurant, which is obviously trying very hard. And I'm all for supporting new and vegan restaurants! But literally the only way you could think the food here is any good at all is if you don't know the difference between good and bad food. It's like when my vegan roommate thinks she "cooks" - when really she just stir-fries vegetables in coconut oil, every single night. I love vegetables! I barely eat meat! But I do not think that mixing stuff with cashew butter is cooking, nor is it delicious. To the food: what is an "MOB"? It's a super weird, gimmicky, made-up flatbread that doesn't taste good. (It's like someone tried to grow pizza in a pietre dish, out of artificial ingredients, and failed miserably.) The "burgers" here, also, are gross. Honestly, this is NYC and there are delicious burgers and fries on every corner, and you just cannot claim the MOB burger is good. It's not good! At all! You know who makes a delicious veggie burger? The Brooklyn Public House! MOB makes a really bad, sloppy and soggy tempeh/mushroom/something-or-other burger, which is just straight gross. And the fries are limp, tasteless and puny. The only thing to order here is unadulterated vegetables (a salad or something would probably be fine) and the ginger beer, which is great. In sum, this place is cute, bright, has an amazing backyard, nice service, and my vegan friends seem to love it. But they also love spelt bread and cashew butter, so they can't be trusted. Send an actual food critic here and I will bet $1,000 they say the food is disgusting.
