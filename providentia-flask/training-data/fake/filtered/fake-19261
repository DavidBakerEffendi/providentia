This place is great. There kale salad is the bomb! I think that I am addicted and it is in my neighborhood. Between this place and Cafe Rue DIx I think that I will not leave the hood ever for food. If you have not experienced the fish and chips here then you are seriously missing out for sure. Delicious. The bathroom was a little untidy but it was a busy night, otherwise I would say 5 stars.
