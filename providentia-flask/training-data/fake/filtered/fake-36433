Terrible customer service and extraordinarily rude, even when the restaurant was half empty.  This restaurant needs to get over itself. The hosts are rude/pompous "you can't sit at the bar unless you are ordering food. If you want to drink you can go next door",  the food was disappointing (too salty, small portions for the price). Plus the items I used to come back for have changed, for the worse.   And to top it off, my waitress basically ignored me, to the point I had to ask the chef/cook for my check. My recommendation is to skip this place!!! It's gone DOWNHILL and there are too many amazing restaurants in NYC to waste your time and money here.
