I really loved this place and it became a usual pho restaurant in Philadelphia. Â The food is great and the place is really clean. However, a few weeks ago, I found a rock, the size of a nickel, in my fried spring roll. The cashier refunded my order but the rock should not have been in my food. I have not and will not return because of that experience.
