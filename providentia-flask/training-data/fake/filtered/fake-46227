It's not worth the 45 min wait and $14 price tag. It's not bad, just not good enough. Chicken wings had great sause to it but had distinctive taset/smell often from being frozen for too long. And $7 for 3 wings, 3 pieces actually, not 3 wings was a bit expensive. For noodle, the soup base was pretty good, very thick and flavorful I am sure some ppl like it very much, it was just ok for me. My biggest complain is the noodle, I have had ramen in many places including Japan and other Asian localations, what they have at Ippudo was not top notch stuff. It lacks the cheweness should come with ramen. The place around the corner on St Mark's suits my taste better.
