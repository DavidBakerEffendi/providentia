Awesome place to get huge authentic Italian sandwiches. I have been here numerous times now and have never been disappointed. I also have never finished one of there sandwiches in one sitting either. All the meats and cheeses are imported from Italy and the bread is baked fresh every day in Brooklyn. The most recent sandwich I had was the Pisillo panini. Prosciutto, porchetta, bufala mozzarella, arugula, roasted peppers and balsamic. Absolute perfection! I can't recommend this place highly enough.
