Best pizza I've ever had (better than Pizzeria Bianco in Phx - PB was voted #1 by many publications)! Worth the 15-25 minute wait. While waiting you get to watch Domenico DeMarco and his daughter, Margaret, make beautiful edible art! I would take the local Q all the way to Avenue J just for a slice. I will return.
