Service is so slow. waiters are rude because they are so busy.  One waiter ( he is one of the owners) sent the wrong order and insisted that is what I ordered. At the end, the receipt  confirmed  that he got the wrong order,  Food is good though. but they are short of hands.  that is why I have to give them one star. Food is good, but service leaves a bad taste!!
