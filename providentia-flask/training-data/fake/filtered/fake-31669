I am flummoxed by all the bad reviews here.  I think it comes down to a question of expectations. Don't expect a fancy tablecloth meal. This is a quick-bite-to-eat place, but a serious upgrade from fast food or the local hoagie joint. Everything is made to order with fresh, seasonal ingredients. The ambiance is laid-back casual -- just a few tables, paper towels for napkins, and yes, you get your own drink from the cooler. (Gasp!)  But the service is always friendly, the place is always clean, and the food is prepared with care. I have never ordered anything here I didn't like, but I'm a particular fan of the flatbreads and the salads. Some of the menu flatbreads can come out a little greasy depending on the cheese they use, but the crust is light and crispy, and the toppings are interesting and good.  And there is always the build-your-own option. I've been here a million times and recommend it to my friends often.
