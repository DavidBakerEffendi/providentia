My friend had recommended this place and I was up for it. Really good sushi is hard to find, esp. those that focus on the real stuff - not just rolls. This was as good as everyone says. Everything melted in your mouth. The toro was by far the best toro I have EVER had. My friends and I thought it was so good, we had to order it for the a la carte part. The crab roll was also an excellent ending. As for service, we thought everyone was so accommadating. We were always being helped. This is def. a place to go. No frills - just really great quality sushi.
