If you come here on a night when they are doing karaoke, be warned the service will be horrible. I was recently here on a Saturday night and once the karaoke started it became clear that this place was horribly understaffed. The restaurant is quite large with a medium sized bar. They only had 1 bartender working and it took about 20 minutes to get a drink. Also of concern is that they cannot process credit cards at the bar. When a customer pays a bar tab with a credit card the bartender must leave the bar area to go to the cash register by the entrance of the restaurant then come back with the check. While waiting for my drinks at one point I struck up a conversation with a couple who said they practically lived at this place. They knew the staff by name and it seems that this is mostly family run and operated. This family happens to be rather old and not very fast at anything. The couple I was speaking with admitted that normally the service is decent but during karaoke it is horrible. Outside of incredibly slow service this is a decent restaurant. The restaurant is rather large and the atmosphere is better than average for the area. The food is average, but the prices are average too, so it works out. The drinks are above average, and obviously the karaoke is fun.
