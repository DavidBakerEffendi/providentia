While stuck on jury duty I ended up here. Line down the block, all locals. Must be good I thought. After 20+mins in line I finally get in the door and it's just one guy chopping up random meats and putting as much as he can into to-go boxes. Got the roast pork and duck per reviews. Huge portion, too much to eat, for less than $4!! The duck was good and crispy but cold by the time I got to it. The pork was great. Â Rice and veg, are just rice and veg. Definitely worth the wait if you have the time.
