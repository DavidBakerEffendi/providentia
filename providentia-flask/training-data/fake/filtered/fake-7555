OMG.....I just got home from this place and it SUCKED....I went there with the intention of watching the game not knowing that it was no longer The Scoreboard bar.....So I get there and there is a table full of men and women and I think they are just customers with guitars singing and playing guitar....Couldn't hear the game at all.....I ordered fries...The waiter comes and tells me that they are out of fries.....Ok...So I ordered the sliders....The waiter comes and tells me that they are out of sliders....So now I cant hear the game.....They don't have any food that I want...I was aggravated.....I can assure that I will NEVER go there again.....Prediction....There is no way that this place will be in business by years end...NO WAY...Also, not that there is anything wrong with it but I think its a gay bar....
