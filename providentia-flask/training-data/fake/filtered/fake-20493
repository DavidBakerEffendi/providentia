We ordered the chef's special prix fixe and the food was abundant, adventurous, and almost all incredibly delicious. We were especially amazed at how good the beet and eggplant mezze were (2 separate dishes) and one of the desserts (a shredded filo dough shell filled with ricotta and something else) was one of the most delicious desserts I've tasted in years. Too bad I was so full by the time it arrived. This was a really serious amount of food. Our server, Chris, was friendly, knowledgeable, and very professional. He even brought us some cava on the house for our anniversary! Overall it was a really nice experience. However, the reasons I didn't give Zahav 5 stars: 1) This will sound odd, but we needed something bland to balance out all of the strong flavors of the foods. They brought a freshly baked pita with the first course but it was not meant to accompany the whole meal, and the succession of one strong interesting flavor after another with no respite, in combination with how much food we were eating, Â became almost too much to bear. 2) I was disappointed by the ambience, especially considering it's a higher-end restaurant. The music was loud and obnoxious for dinner (including tracks such as Salt n Pepa's "Push it") and detracted from the overall experience.
