While I really enjoyed the garden atmosphere, the food was bland and completely unseasoned.  It was a relatively busy night and I noticed the waitress was being asked for salt shakers endlessly.  The couscous literally had no salt or seasoning at all whatsoever.  My boyfriend tried the salmon which was completely overcooked and flavorless. It almost seemed canned not fresh. Anyhow, the garden is beautiful, but the food could be much better. Please pass the salt.
