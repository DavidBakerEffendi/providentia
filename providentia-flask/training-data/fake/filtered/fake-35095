Manhattan prices, Montclair fare -- disappointing. My wife and I finally made it here for lunch with great expectations.  She's a ramen fanatic and frequents many in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  We ordered Shoyuzo and the wing appetizer--a $30 lunch here.  The wings were OK, the ramen was fairly average.  Specifically, the broth was pretty good, but you had to ration it.  The overall portion was nearly half a bowl, and the vegetable count was low.  Chicken was perfectly tasteless.  We were surprised and disappointed.  When we had to leave early and thought to take the rest home to the kids, Ani's policy is Bring Your Own Container.  We couldn't leave the money on the table and relented with a quick CVS tupperware purchase. Let's be honest.  Even a bowl of very good ramen should not cost $12 at lunch, and if it does, it should be ample and full of flavor.  This was truly mediocre at best.  I'm sure the rents aren't low, but the only way people are going to stop being gouged by Montclair restaurant pricing is to stop pretending the value's here.  This one is what it is: a $9 bowl of half-decent ramen.
