I've been there 3 times so far and after yesterday  I will not be going back. I thought I'd give  it another try but they just can't seem to get it right.  If you want to stop in for a beer, they have a great selection.  There's nothing special about their food.  Beware if you order the dinner salad, it's just a small salad and so not worth the $7.59.  My friend and I left still hungry.  What a disappointment.  There are much better options for food on the Post Road.
