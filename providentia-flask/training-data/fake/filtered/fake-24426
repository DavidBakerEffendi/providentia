the food was amazing! Very flavorful!  The service was great!  We had the shrimp appetizer and Gato salad to start... Both great!,,  then the halibut as our entree...also amazing! I highly recommend this restaurant!  And the cherry on top was that Bobby Flay himself was there cooking and talking to the patrons!
