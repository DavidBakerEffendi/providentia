After visiting the Museum of Natural History with our group of 7, we asked some locals for a good restaurant close by.  We were so pleased with their recommendation!  We went to Isabella's for lunch and were quickly seated (it wasn't busy at all).  After looking over the menu, we asked for the Parmesan fries for an appetizer (they looked really good!)  The waiter recommended the sweet potato fries so we got both.  Can I just say YUMMMMM! ?  The maple sauce with the s.p. fries was soooo good!  Everyone loved their entrees - I had the Hay and Straw pasta which has sundried tomatoes and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised.   This was the only restaurant we visited in a week's time that felt like the real deal, not a tourist trap.  We loved the food and the ambience.  The only thing I would have liked was to have been seated away from the kitchen . . . as there were plenty of other tables available. Great find!  Price (including appetizers) was about $15 per person.
