I walked by this place numerous times and finally went in. It was a Tuesday night at 10:30. The place was not that busy. I sat down at the bar and ordered my dinner. We had one small plate each and a glass of wine each. The waiter told me that it was not enough food and that if i wanted to stay I would have to order more. I walked out. So if you ever decide to go, be ready to order two plates per person
