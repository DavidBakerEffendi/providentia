Heard great things about this little Fairmont restaurant so thought we would try for ourselves! Loved the Guacamole with veggie chips and all 4 meals were fresh, nice size portions and delicious! Â Baked Alaskan dessert with mint chocolate chip ice cream, flamed with rum table side outstanding! We will definitely be back with wine and cash!
