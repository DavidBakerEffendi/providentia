I have been to Buttermilk Channel several times and in the past loved my dinners there.  Needless to say, I was excited to bring my family, who was visiting from out of town, to one of my "favorite" Brooklyn restaurants. Unfortunately, I was horribly disappointed by the customer service this time around.  The hostess was terribly rude to my 66 yr old mother and to one of my best friends (a fellow New Yorker) when we first arrived and asked for a table.  Because our party wasn't there at the exact same time, we were treated like 3rd class citizens.  We sat at the bar looking at free and empty tables while we waited the 10 minutes for the remainder of our party to arrive.  And, when we were all there, the hostess told us it would be 30 minutes (this was at 6pm on a Sunday).  We got a few drinks and an appetizer at the bar as we waited.  When my friend went back to check 15 minutes later, the hostess was rude again.   So, we decided our patronage would be more appreciated at a different establishment: we went to Prime Meats 2 blocks up and had an excellent meal.  Too bad Buttermilk Channel - you had a devotee and now we will never return.  Be careful and choose your hostesses better.
