Yes they opened on Lud and its bomb! Obviously great chicken and waffles, specials and all. Kale blt salad is a a must and the polenta is great. Always have an order of mac n cheese if you wanna leave happy. Queen of New York is my fave bev, but their cocktails are all tasty. Staff is great, everyone is fun and friendly, music is tight and whether you want to dine in or have a bar experience, its fitting.
