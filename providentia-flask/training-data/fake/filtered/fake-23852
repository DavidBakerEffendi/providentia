We were in town for an all-day music festival at the nearby Starlight Ballroom and wanted to get some dinner between bands. Thanks to Yelp we located this place and I'm very glad that we did! At 5:30pm on a Saturday there were only two other tables of diners and one waitress, but we were seated and served very quickly. I was impressed by the number of vegetarian and gluten-free items. We ordered a black bean and cheese empanadas which had a delicious crust and filling; my entree was the tofu pepiada arepa and my partner had the asado negro. Both were so flavorful and amazing! For dessert we split the churros and Cuaima (chilie and cinnamon) hot chocolate. The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent. I'd visit this place again in a heartbeat while visiting!
