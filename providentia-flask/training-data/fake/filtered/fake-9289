By far the most amazing Italian food i have ate just wow! Worth the hour drive, recommend the penne Alfredo with shrimp and the chicken parmigiana with penne la vodka also cant forget the gelato and the espresso. The atmosphere is very relaxing family oriented and the waiter mike (Michael) was very professional and funny had a great time here would definitely come back!!!
