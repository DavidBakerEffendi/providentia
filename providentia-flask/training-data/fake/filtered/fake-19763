Ordered twice from this place. They advertise free delivery with a minimum purchase - no prob. First time waited 3 hours for delivery ( in Hamden).  They kept saying - "on way,on way!!" Stupidly, we gave them another chance. The second time we ordered for delivery. An hour later they called and said " too far,too far, we no deliver!!! ( Also in Hamden) WTF!!! We asked for the manager . They say "He not here". We asked for his name, they say " Don't know!!!!!!!" Really, you don't know the name of your manager?  We ask to speak to someone else there, they say "they don't know his name either!!!!!!   Don't waste your time at this place!!!!
