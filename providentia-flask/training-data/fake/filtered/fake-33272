I first came to Rye to get a beverage...and I haven't stopped coming back since.  The first experience was one of sheer bliss.  The giant ice cube that perfectly fills one rocks glass is worth the $10 cocktail.  My suggestion is go with the classic Old Fashioned.  But make sure to talk to the bartender (Suther on a good night).  He will break down a history lesson for you on a variety of spirits.  Excellent entertainment without the show.  Stay for food, but I'll warn you...if you get the meatloaf, be prepared to take some home with you.  Big, delicious portions.  And unlike any meatloaf you've ever had.
