This was hands down the most disgusting slop I've ever been served and I refused to eat it. Soggy, runny, seedy, drippy, and wet eggplant parmigiana that I wouldn't feed to a legitimately starving person. I'd tell them they were better off not eating at all. Seriously, I can cook better than this and should open my own restaurant if this is what it takes, and I don't even like to cook. This was obviously cooked very fast, set aside and then microwaved later on; looked like vomit. I wish I could have taken a video of how runny and nauseating this eggplant looked. Whoever cooked it should find a new career and feel shame serving this and calling it food. Also, the tomato sauce was clearly canned and unseasoned.
