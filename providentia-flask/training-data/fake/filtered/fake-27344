After hearing rave reviews about Bunker I decided to give it a shot. I was not impressed. Telling someone to refill their own water cup in a small room where you may have to have 6 people move is a bit ridiculous. Can't they just put a carafe of water on the table ? The crab spring rolls were nothing more than average spring rolls. Far too greasy. I had the special, saut√©ed baby bock choy in garlic and dehydrated shrimp. Who uses dehydrated shrimp other than ramen noodles that are 3 for $1 ? I was surprised at this. They advertised fresh juice which I like, but it was merely chilled hibiscus tea and mint. I don't mind paying $4.50 for juice, but not for iced tea. The crab chips that accompany almost everything on the menu taste like Styrofoam. The pork in the pork sandwich was tasty, but the bread was an average hoagie roll that could be purchased in bulk at restaurant depot. Sorry Bunker, but I won't be back ! Though the servers were polite, they need to smile more and not act like their annoyed. If you don't like it, find another job !
