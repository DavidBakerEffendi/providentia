We loved j'eat jet!! Great spot, great food, great staff!! What else can you ask for?? Start off with a few orders of the pretzel bites...one is not enough!! They're fresh.  Then have the fried green tomatoes in a splendid sauce and don't forget te Mac and cheese balls!!   We also had burgers--amazing and fresh...couldn't stop talking about the pretzel homemade bun. I had a salad...perfect on the dressing and nice herbs. Topped it off with homemade doughnuts in a fresh fig sauce! Wish they were opened for breakfast...wanted me some pretzel bites!! Soon the liquor license...can't wait!
