We had an excellent dinner at SweetGrass.  The place is lovely and probably even better in the Spring and Summer when the terrace is open.  The appetizers and entres were all well-prepared and flavorful.  Their grits were excellent--the best I ever had!  My wife and I highly recommend this restaurant.  Definitely give it a try.
