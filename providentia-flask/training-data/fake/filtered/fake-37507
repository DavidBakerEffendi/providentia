I travel to NY quite frequently and will not ever set foot in this restaurant, since when is it ok for a manager to acost patrons regarding what he erroneously perceived to be under tipping. The spineless waiter did not realize that he WAS tipped the 20% the manager stated was customary so he sent the manager to acost my daughter and her friend as they were leaving the restaurant. When they stated that they did tip the 20% that the manager stated was customary, he did NOT apoligze for his mistake. I will NEVER patronize this restaurant, TIPS are earned based on the service given and if they had not tipped the customary 20% so what, then it wasn't earned. But they did, I have to wonder why the manager thought it was ok to confront them as they were leaving, obviously he does not want the business and he will never get mine.
