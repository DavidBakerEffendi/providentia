The place is really nice inside and the food is pretty good. I been there twice and have not been dissapointed either time but it wasn't amazing either. Actually scratch that, I went three times, and the first time I went was AMAZINGGGG!!!! I had a sushi roll called a banana mama and I have been DYING for another every since, but when I went the second time they told me it was no longer available. I was so pissed, I cant believe they got rid of it, seriously it was THAT good. But oo well, the 2 times after that were just OK, nothing amazing besides how nice it is inside. I would def recommend trying it out. All the times I went were early afternoon btw
