The two stars are primarily because of the rude staff!! No one attended our table for almost 40 minutes, they wouldn't even care to check. After waiting 40 minutes for a glass of water- when we politely expressed our grievance the guy throws around an attitude and was pretty rude to us! He was NOT apologetic one bit, instead he yells at us rudely- "Good Bye". To top it, he pre-adds the Tip amount in the check!! Wonder if that's the trade-off for good food in their restaurant!!!
