Good sushi at good prices. The person who is complaining about price increases here apparently hasn't gotten out much lately and noticed that restaurants have to occasionally raise prices to make money. I wouldn't want to get my sushi at Wal-Mart and I don't think you would either. Eck!   When people say that the chef will insult you, they should probably add that he'll only do that if you've been coming there for awhile. Otherwise, you can enjoy the good natured ribbing that he'll give everyone else in the place since they're all regulars. Other sushi places in Princeton are not nearly as friendly and lively.   The sushi itself is delicious. My wife swears by their spicy tuna and I enjoy everything they serve up. Sakura has an area in the back where you can get some salad with your order (free) which tides you over till your food arrives. The seating is all on stools to increase the capacity of the small dining area so it's not great for small kids(our 4 y.o. does alright) but there is also an outdoor plaza immediately neighboring that you can eat at in good weather.   Sakura is a wonderful place to get some sushi among a friendly crowd. I will miss it if we ever move away.
