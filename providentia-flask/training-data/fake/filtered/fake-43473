I was at Paisanos years ago and it has gotten even better.  Fantastic price for amazing food.  The service was great and the decor and feel of the restaurant made it feel authentic.  I would highly recommend the chicken parm and crab meat filled raviolis.  The soup was to die for and the chocolate lava cake that exploded with hot chocolate goodness was to die for.  You don't know what you are missing if you don't go here.
