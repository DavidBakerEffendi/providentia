This is the 1st review i am writing about any establishment because i am very upset with this place !! HORRIBLE..the men at the door were very RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL. it was freezing outside and there was a 5 minute wait (no big deal) within 5 minutes there was a few other groups of people waiting in line behind us (myself and 3 others) we would up waiting about 25 minutes and then left. THIS IS WHY: Â about 10 minutes into the wait the bouncer let a group in ahead of us because they "dropped names" OK fine everyone does it once in a while..but then it happened AGAIN! So i say something and the bouncer responds very rude and say "people know management" and continues to speak down to myself and my group..i couldnt walk away fast enough - TERRIBLE ESTABLISHMENT. I could not even believe what was happening. it was VERY VERY RUDE AND SUCH A HORRIBLE WAY TO RUN A BUSINESS AND TREAT CUSTOMERS. many others followed us off the line as well. I called after this incident and the next day but was hung up on numerous times. The owner should reevaluate how he runs this business. I WILL NOT BE RETURNING EVER AGAIN.
