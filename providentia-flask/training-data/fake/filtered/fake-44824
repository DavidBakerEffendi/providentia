I unfortunately have had a terrible experience at this restaurant. First, the server was rude when I was placing my order. She was not attentive and never checked back with our table until one of her colleagues notified her that we were unhappy. We were without refills for our drinks which had been empty for more then 10 minutes, and apparently other customers around us were having similar issues. Some of them ended up walking over to the bar for refills. The food was very underwhelming. I ordered a pepperoni pizza and another person at my table ordered a cheese pizza. The pepperoni pizza was burnt, there was hardly any cheese on it, and the small amount that was provided was dry and virtually tasteless. The cheese pizza we ordered came out wrong. A CHEESE PIZZA. Not sure how you could mess that up, but apparently it is possible. When we finally the cheese pizza, it was burnt and extremely greasy. Our waiter was incompetent and our food was extremely underwhelming. The entire experience was disappointing. I would never return to this place or recommend this place to anyone.
