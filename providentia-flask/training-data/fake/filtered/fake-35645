I work in the travel industry. I get around. (Don't...say...it.) One of my favorite things is finding good breakfast joints in my travels. Wow, how cliche does that sound? Also unoriginal, but incredibly earnest, is my newfound adoration for Penny Cluse Cafe. A friend who went to UVM recommended it, and holy crap is it the best breakfast I have had in ages! I am not Suzy Sunshine who never sees the cloud in front of the silver lining. I am as critical as the next girl about the places I eat. I have not one thing to say about this place that is not positive. Living in Boston lo these past 13 years, I was immediately disarmed by the easy friendliness of the people here, which includes, of course, the staff of Penny Cluse. We sat at the counter (after an amazingly short wait for a Sunday at 10am), where there was lots of cool kitsch to look at. We sipped coffee, (poured post haste), and devoured possibly the freshest fruit plate I have ever had in New England. I can't say enough about this fruit (mango, blueberry, kiwi, apple, grapefruit, date, strawberry and watermelon). Next I had the polenta and eggs, which was also first rate. It came with a whole mess of black beans, a bit of delicious salsa, scallions, and i added a side of sour cream. The combination of these flavors, colors and textures was exactly what I wanted for breakfast. My girlfriend, who is queen of the special order, had all of her requests met quickly and with a smile (not something that happens often in Boston, let me tell you). They serve top notch teas (Numi), and much of their menu comes from local farms. Not to sound too precious, but really, local food just tastes better. Also, this place is a favorite among Burlington residents, which is what sold me on it to begin with, even though it is a block or two away from tourist-laden Church Street. As long as I have working teeth and a pair of legs to get me there, I will be eating at Penny Cluse whenever I visit Burlington. A+
