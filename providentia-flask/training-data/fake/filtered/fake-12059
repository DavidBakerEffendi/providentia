So I ordered the burger medium-well, which, I know, is a very gauche burger order. That said, it wasn't terrible but was no Father's Office burger and I'm sure cost more (though you'd never know since there are no fucking prices listed). But this brings me to my real complaint: the waitress laughed at me. Not just laughed, heckled me for my burger order (which is due to an experience I had with undercooked meat recently). Let me go on. The whole ridiculous gimmick with the writing of the menu on the table is simply an excuse for one of these American Apparel glad bitches to shove her tits in the face of all men folk at the table. She was rude to me (the only female) so such an extent that even the men I was with noticed it. Between no prices, the idiotic table-writing bullshit, the neighborhood, and the crowd, I don't why anyone who isn't 23 and just got here from Ohio would go here. That said, the fish stew was excellent. But I would never, ever go back.
