This place may not offer the fancy fare that is expected in NYC but the quality is fantastic.  Came here with a group of 5 and at the suggestion of the owner Stephen we all shared a variety of the options on his menu. The ribs were simply awesome and probably the best ive had in NYC. The chicken wings were large, juicy and tasted awesome. The pigs ear lettuce wraps were delicious. We were also drinking quite a bit.  The girls thoroughly enjoyed their cocktails and the guys were drinking shots of homemade moonshine with a Dale's Pale Ale.  Now again not fancy but it matched so well the desired dining experience of the owner.  Would go back and have recommended it to many people.
