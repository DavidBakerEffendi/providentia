Bartaco is one of those pretentious restaurants that's so in love with its own image that it feels justified charging $10 for a so-so margarita and completely ignoring food quality. On our first and only visit, my group was seated quickly at a great table and the service was impeccable.  The "family style" idea is fun in theory, but I disliked having my side dishes arrive 10 minutes before my tacos.  The tacos themselves were a huge disappointment. The chicken was so spicy that no one at the table could eat it. We were told the spice level of the sauces varies from day to day depending on the cook. The fish and duck were just okay, but the sauces made the tortillas fall apart.  My husband's pork was very tough and undercooked.  The guacamole was Bartaco's only saving grace.   I was also incredibly surprised to receive the bill and see that a small carafe of margaritas was $50.  Bottom line: the food isn't good, and the drinks are too pricey. I will not return.
