Simple with just a soup√ßon of exoticism, Balaboosta is my go-to restaurant. Anniversary? Balaboosta. Out of towners? Balaboosta. Just want to eat well in the company of beautiful people? Oh yeah, Balaboosta. Don't bother ordering entrees, just order small plates and appetizers until you've had your fill. Then order a dessert. Expect your table to be wedged in close enough to accidentally pick up a stranger's glass. Expect that stranger to be a stunning Scandinavian model. Don't expect to get her number. If there's one must-try dish, it's the crispy cauliflower with currants, pine nuts and lemon. Tart? A little, but it's subtler than you expect, and the texture is exquisite.
