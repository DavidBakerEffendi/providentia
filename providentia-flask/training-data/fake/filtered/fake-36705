I went to PYT, after anxiously waiting for it to open at the Piazza, and was not disappointed :)  The burgers are amazing, and the chicken sandwich calls my name, once per month!  I was able to take my son (who is 9) with me, and we sat outside -inside there was a DJ spinning old school music, which both my son and myself enjoyed thoroughly!  If you haven't been, go check it out!  I only recommend bringing children in the summertime, as the bar gets a tiny bit loud...  PYT is a great place, with excellent service -I would have given 5 stars, but one of the servers was wearing next to nothing, and I was upset about it (only because my child was with me; otherwise, I would not care).
