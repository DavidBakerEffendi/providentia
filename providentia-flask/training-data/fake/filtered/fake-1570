love this place! best indian food in bk... actually, best in nyc! happy it's close-by. :) also, owner is the best. she welcomes you like family! recommendation: try any lamb dish... really great though in the rice dish. and the coconut bread is life changing. note- hot/spicy, means spiccyyyyyy!! i usually love spicy food, but here sometimes i request mild or medium. still yum though!
