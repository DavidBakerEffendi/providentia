Had the privilege of eating these delicious sandwiches at a menu tasting in NYC and what a treat it was. From the carefully selected breads to the terrific combination of meats and other toppings it was pure perfection all around. My favorite was the broccoli rabe with goat cheese, and not being a lover of broccoli rabe, you know there was something special about it if now I crave it all the time. Would highly recommend to anyone I know. !!
