A great restaurant- Very friendly staff that welcomed 5 walk-ins on a very busy Friday night opening up a private room to accommodate us ( and "us" was one adult and 5 teens Â - very brave....) Food was great - service perfect - and great vibe- I come from Northampton MA which is supposed to be a great destination for restaurants but has really gone down hill over the past 10 years ....Maybe Salute should open a restaurant here and remind Northampton how its done.....
