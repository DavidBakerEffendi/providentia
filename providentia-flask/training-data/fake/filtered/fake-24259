I went here for brunch with three of my friends 2 weeks ago. We were severely disappointed by the service during and after the meal. Our waiter was obtuse and had not sense of Â his customers' needs. Our 4 entrees were incrementally served, one-by-one, over the span of 5 minutes. Our table was charged for items we didn't order. Throughout the meal we were consistently ignored when we needed assistance. Nonetheless, we left a standard 15% tip. After we had left, our waiter surprised us by running to meet us halfway down the block. He flagged us down and blurted "do you have any complaints or have problems with the service?" It felt a little uneasy to be approached like that, but to avoid a conflict we said "no, not at all." He responded "Oh, I just wanted to make sure the shitty tip was on purpose." As we stood there in shock, he turned away and returned to the restaurant. Perhaps our waiter had just started, or perhaps he was having a rough day. But that doesn't excuse his astoundingly rude behavior. I have never been so inappropriately addressed by a waiter and that should never happen at any respectable business. Regardless, the food was wonderful. I highly recommend the Thai Tea French Toast. Just don't expect it to come with smiles and pleasantries.
