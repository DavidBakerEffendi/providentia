I have a love/hate relationship with Beyoglu.  I love their Mezze Platter and the warm fluffy bread it's served with, but I've never been happy with the service, except for once years ago.  I always feel like the servers are very rude and unfriendly.  And the host staff is definitely the most unfriendly on the Upper East Side.  They definitely have a downtown hip attitude, not at UES one. It's worth it for the Mezze platter, but just be forewarned on the service.
