This place is fancy, stylish maybe, always old fashion style, etc but the service is not pretty nice. We wanted to have only some drinks with our 10 year old son at 6:00 pm! For them really a problem b'cause the bar was not possible, even with almost all tables empty........Or you eat or you'r not welcome!! That is so often in NY......
