Are you sure that this place serves Mexican food????  Didn't taste like it.  It was AMAZING!!! I had a strawberry & something margarita (Yumm) My table had the chicken tacos (app) and (don't get me to lying on the names of the dishes) a shrimp and beans dish, and the grilled calamari & shrimp dish (served in a clay pot).  AWESOME!!!  Nuff said
