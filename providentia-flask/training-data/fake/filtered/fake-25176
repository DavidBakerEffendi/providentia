This place is my favorite spot in Brooklyn! Since they opened up ast year I came here at least once a month and am always impressed! The food is just spectacular! Chef always make incredible unique specials and I am always surprised by how perfectly everything in seasoned! Yes, its small, but who cares! ITS A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!
