I live in NYC but work takes me to Princeton every so often. I've eaten in most of the top-notch places in the city. If Princeton is Pretence-ville, this place is town hall. After waiting for the host to appear at the front desk, we were turned away, I kid you not, at 9:01 pm because the kitchen closed at 9:00! In Precious Princeton, it seems, another bad restaurant can get away with petty provincialism.
