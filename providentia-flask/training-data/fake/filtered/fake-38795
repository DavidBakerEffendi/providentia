Gooood... I've just moved from NY and I miss those New York places so much!!!! Well... Here is my review: First off, if you're excpecting to here about the food - move on - I'm on a diet!!! I only had one beer... I had a wonderfull time in the Ice - house. Â In fact, if you look for a "bar" definition in the dictionary, you'll probably find a picture of Ice house.... Though the backyard is very unusuall for pubs in general, it fits perfectly to this place. I'll definitly come back in my next visit to the big apple (and maybe even eat something next time... :))
