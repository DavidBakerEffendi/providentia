I love Fuel. The menu items are imaginative, tasty, and priced well. I think they have better guacamole than the famous Mexican places on 13th st! And I can eat to my heart's content (literally) knowing that I will feel fresh and invigorated for the rest of the day, and not laden with saturated animal fat-induced fugue. The service has always been good when I have been there, but I would agree with other reviewers that the frantic background music and videos can Â detract from an otherwise very pleasant dining experience. That being said, it is still my favorite place to go for a light meal in Center City.
