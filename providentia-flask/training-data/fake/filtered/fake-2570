I hear the food is great.  I go for the ambience, the great selection of wine and the great people I meet at the bar.  Stanton, the bartender, is a major plus for the place.  He remembers your name and is ready with a superb wine that suits your mood.  I love the music they play in the background.  Loungey funky cool.
