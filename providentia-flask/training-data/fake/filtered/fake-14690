Had my 30th birthday brunch here in their beautiful back yard which reminds of a small garden in the South of France. Was definitely not expecting it. I stumbled on it while walking down knickerbocker ave (full of it's hustle and bustle) to find a nice surpise! The owner was great. He worked with me to put together tailored "family style" brunch menu so all of my guest pretty much tasted most of the dishes and plenty of it. We had the french toast, mac & cheese, fried chicken, eggs benedict, southern fried chicken and florentine, Croque Monsieur & Madame and drinks. The chef came out and gave us complimentary sausages and gave a heartfelt speech about the garden and it's fresh herbs that they use to make the dishes. All my guests were more than pleased with the food. Like finger licking pleased. Definitely recommend brunch. Â My top 3 dishes? Fried Chicken is like heaven. Eggs Benedict and Croque Monsieur (gruyere and ham) simple dishes made to perfection. But I also have to give an honorable mention to the french toast ;)
