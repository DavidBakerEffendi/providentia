I have been there for many times and I am a fan there. I have tried the BBQ and hot pot, and both of them are worth trying. But I did not try them at the same time, because that would be too much for me. I think it is a good place to hang out no matter you go in a small group or in a large group. And the employees there are nice too. By the way, if you go there on your birthday, show them you ID, and you don not need to pay! Free birthday meal!!!
