Pizza is very good although sometimes when its TOO busy and the guys are distracted the pies come out a little too burnt for my liking. Salads are good too. Menu is short simple and to the point. Service is awful and is why we don't go there anymore (and we've gone many times just thinking we went on an "off" night).. The rude old man in the front just grunts and points where you should go sit. They've got unspoken rules about how many people can sit in certain spots so even if 5 tables are empty, if they say no, you can't sit and have to wait. Once you place an order they quickly bring drinks and then you're lucky to see another waiter for the rest of your meal till its time to pay. They rush you out if they've got a line (this is after you've already waited 30-60 min to sit down). And even through they're open till 10, if you show up t 9:20 they turn you away. Which is actually how we found the hidden gem down the street Gennaros, where the pies and antipasto are just as good and service is 1000xs better. So overall while the pizza again is very good, the service is the downfall here. I prefer places that appreciate me as a customer. Delo's makes me feel like they're doing me a favor by allowing me to eat there. No thanks.
