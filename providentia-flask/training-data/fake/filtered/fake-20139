Like most best finds,I stumbled upon this little gem whilst wandering aimlessly thinking about something other than food.It obviously struck a chord on my aesthetic radar as I walked past it and then did an about turn.Much the same as the Dean & Deluca / McNally places have done in the past..No longer a Manhatanite,I'm not (or have ever really been )into the latest hot spot,so i'm happy when a place has shed it's milk teeth and is comfortable in what it is and the scenesters have long gone.I had a light late lunch of espresso and faggotini.Perfect. Service unobtrusive.Presentation  delightful.Decor  ind-rustic.I hope it remains the same for my next visit.
