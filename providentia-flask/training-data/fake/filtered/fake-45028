my girlfriend and i went there last weekend for brunch on sunday, we heard that cafe henri has a great brunch. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING PEOPLE! WE HAD HE WORST BRUNCH IN OUR LIVES. the food was bad, waitress was nasty had an attitude , coffee sucks. then the next weekend we tried the place across the street which is called Dorian cafe, it did not look very appealing from the outside, but when we went inside and sat down we give these new owners 10 stars Go DORIAN CAFE!
