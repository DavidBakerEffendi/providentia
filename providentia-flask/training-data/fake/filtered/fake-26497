By far the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant.  Was there to celebrate my birthday and walked out wishing it wasn't my birthday!  Had reservations for 6 and when arriving the table wasn't set up yet.  We stood around in the middle of the restaurant waiting for them to figure out how they were going to adjust the table to fit us. Took 20 minutes to even place a drink order which was placed incorrectly, and then after placing our meal order a half hour later that took a hour to receive!!! On top of that mine didn't even come out.  Made complaints to the manager who was sitting at the bar enjoying cocktails, and his response was "Well I'd apologize but I didn't know about it so I won't." Well sir...that is why you're a MANAGER, manage your staff and check on your patrons to make sure everything is going the way it should.   The food did not even make up for it.  I suggest to go somewhere else when thinking about Mexican food.
