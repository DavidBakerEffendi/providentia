Bo Ky has been around for a long time, so don't be shocked if you go inside and it looks very shady. They literally do not care for construction. However, if you just walk past its store front, you can smell the aroma of their marinated duck and if you're like me.. that is enough to bring you inside. The pricing has actually went up drastically, and their portions are medium sized. Their food is very delicious (but has a LOT of MSG if you're going for noodle soup) Definitely recommend to try their marinated duck, their seafood guo tiu and their curry mei fun!
