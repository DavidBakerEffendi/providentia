Last Friday I with another 12 colleges went for lunch to Old Tbilisi Garden. It was absolutely amazing how tremendously people of different preferences and ethnic backgrounds enjoyed the whole experience - outstanding food (both taste and presentation), the d√©cor, which brings you back in time to Old Tbilisi, the atmosphere made of delicate combination of genuine friendliness of the owner and superb level of service of the waiters. We tried and shared quite a few things on the menu: Imeruli, Khinkali, Pxali Trio, Lula Kebab - just to mention a few. And what kind of Georgian cuisine would it be without famous Khachapuri and Shoti?! And, OMG, one was better than the other! There was not a single person who was not raving about the time we had at Old Tbilisi Garden. All of my colleges including myself we'll be very frequent visitors to this place. Thank you for bringing Old Tbilisi with its hospitality and the food meeting the highest demands of the true connoisseurs to downtown Manhattan!
