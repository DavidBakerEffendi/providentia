Our breakfast was a complete disaster here. Food was fine but service was terrible. They would not seat us until our whole party of 4 arrived even though restaurant was empty. While waiting at the restaurant I leant against a ledge that had wet paint but was not signed. It ruined my brand new shirt. They told me it was painted this morning! Why wasnt it signed! Took ages for them to agree to comp our meal. In the end they said the comp was only for my pancakes and a round of drinks. Not coffee or my friends. This was not what the manager had promised us. We ended up paying because the manager made us feel bad about trying to walk on our meal. Complete disaster. Avoid at all costs.
