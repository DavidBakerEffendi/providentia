Love the atmosphere here. It was busy and bustling and made you feel like you were at the center of something fabulous. The tables are tight but all the better to peer at your neighbors plates. Food was excellent, and left feeling satisfied on many levels. They are also responsive and sensitive to those with food allergies.
