After flying in from Australia on a shoot. My husband made reservations @ Yerba Buena.I was reluctant at first because this little place looked so tiny.We started at the bar with these spicy cocktails that were awesome it was also happy hour so that didn't hurt.We made it to our table and kindly escorted by a very stylish manager/Matre D' he asked if this table was good enough. Let me tell you the level of comfort i felt in this place felt right from the get go. I loved being pampered. I waiter suggested the picada and ceviche to start great choice though my husband wasn't a fan of the picada he opted for the calamari delish! We then shared the moqueca! Super hot! The other manager checked in on us which was a great touch! We were then in the mood for wine.The manager returned and bought out 3 bottles to taste ! Who does that now a days! I loved it! I didn't realize as I was in my own world how lively the place was great energy! Very charming. we passed on deserts next time i'll try it. Sooner than later!
