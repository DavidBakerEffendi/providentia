Taim rocks. I have tried a few things on the menu, but got addicted to the Hummus sandwich and haven't been able to bring myself to order anything else since. I get mine with Israeli salad, tabouli, and cabbage on a whole wheat pita. It is SO good and satisfying and also super affordable. I like eating in places where I feel as though I'm getting my money's worth. My only complaint is that it's nearly impossible to eat here when the weather's bad or during peak hours. When the sun is shining, however, it's lovely to eat outside!
