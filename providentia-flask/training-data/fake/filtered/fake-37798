Growing up in Brooklyn,I think that makes me a pizza expert.Pizza was very good...crust was very crunchy,and pizza had right amount of cheese.And being on a low salt diet...pizza maker assured me that he uses a sauce that is low in sodium...Also...hero sandwiches are nice sized...they dont skimp on the meat.
