Sad to say this place is not what it used to be. The food is subpar and the service is terrible. I ordered fish which was served extremely overcooked. It was inedible. The waitress couldnt seem less interested but said she would mention it to the chef. That was the last we saw of her for the entire meal. She never came back. She never asked me if I wanted something else. She never apologized. We had to flag her down for the check which, not surprisingly, included the cost of my inedible meal. Don't waste your money here. There are too many other great places in this neighborhood.
