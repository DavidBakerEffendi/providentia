When first open, this pizza was very good and service was good. Since changing ownership, it is not. Instead of white pizza, we received a shrimp, sausage, garlic. Called to say we were returning, and were told correct pizza would be made. Instead, we clearly were given the one from our original order, and it was cold though we live a short distance away. No apology, no refund, nothing.
