Is ABC Kitchen worth the 1 1/2 hr wait to be seated?? ....the answer is YES!   Our servers Daniel and Leandra made this dining experience exceptional.  They were able to answer out questions about the menu items in detail and took time to explain how the dishes are prepared, where the ingredients came from and gave tailored recommendations to suit our individual tastes. They broke the stereotype of NYC being cold and impersonal, and made us feel like friends who came over to their house for dinner.  Of course the food was great, but what makes it exceptional is the service!!! Thanks Daniel and Leandra! Adam
