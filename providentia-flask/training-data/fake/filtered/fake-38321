Nice and peaceful at night. Love the fresshis \in Phila, maybe ever?! I know that's quite a statement, but dang, it is so good. My favorite is the vegetarian platter: lentils, cabbage, beets, et cetera. So delicious and hearty, as well a great meal to share with someone. :) The lady Â owner/manager is so kind when you walk in, which makes you feel even happier to be eating there. h sushi and good atmosphere
