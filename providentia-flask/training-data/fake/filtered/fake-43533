Am I on an elaborate episode of Punk'd?  After hearing all of the noise about Han Dynasty, my husband and I went there on a Sunday around 5 PM. and were really disappointed.  After flagging down the waiter, we ordered the Taiwanese sausage for a starter, and it came out with some pieces hot and some pieces cold.  The main courses (chicken black bean and chicken crunchy rice?) were OK -- good, but nothing to write home about.  When it was time to pay, our waiter brought the check and then sat down behind us to eat.  He never came back to get our money or even looked at us again, but we eventually found someone else to take it!  While we ate, the people next to us had to ask to order; we watched people come in and stand around hoping to be seated but they were completely ignored (all while our waiter was looking at them and eating!); and we were subjected to silence alternating with dance music from the sound system.  I actually pulled out my phone during the meal to look at the reviews to make sure we had gone to the right place.  Bad atmosphere, terrible service, and average food. Am I missing something here???
