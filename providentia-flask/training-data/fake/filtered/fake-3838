This place is reminiscent of a storybook Vermont Inn- the interior architecture features exposed wood beams, fireplaces in almost every room, and lots of comfortable places to sit while you work on jigsaw puzzles or after you come in from a long snowshoe through the woods. The owner and his wife greeted us and made us feel very welcome from the moment we stepped through the door. We ate at the restaurant/tavern and that evening's live classical guitar music accentuated the already lovely ambiance created by the festive holiday decor. The Maine mussel appetizer was epic, libations were classic but innovative (good selection of local craft beers and quality wines) and overall, the dinner menu provided a little something for everyone- epicureans, vegetarians, carnivores and regular folk will all be pleased. Prices are on par with restaurants that serve high quality food- free range, organic & local are prevalent ingredients. The waiter was absolutely terrific- attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. We didn't stay at the Inn, but if we were tourists coming to ski at Okemo- we would highly recommend checking this place out.
