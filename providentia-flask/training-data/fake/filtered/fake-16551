Beware of pickpocketing!!! I went to Manakeesh to grab a quick lunch on Christmas eve. While I was eating, my wallet was stolen from my purse. I spoke to the waiter as well as the shift manager. They said  that "they spotted a suspicious man covering his face with a scarf, who sat behind my chair". They also said it was not the first time pickpocketing occured inside the cafe, so they posted a warning sign at the front door. Too bad on that day I entered through the side door! I was upset that the staff did not warn me to pay attention, after spotting suspicious activity. Moreover, both the waiter and the manager told me that when pickpocketing happened in the past,  there was always the same suspicious person present there. However nobody "caught him in the act or could see his face to describe them to the police". I was shocked: the management ADMITTED seeing the suspeced thief on multiple occasions and most likely had security cameras in the cafe, and yet nobody did anything to stop him or warn the customers. I used to be a loyal customer of Manakeesh. Never, ever, ever I am going to this place again.
