A friend recommended Yuca, so I went there Thursday evening with family visiting from out of town. The ambience was lively and upbeat, and not at all as noisy as I expected from other reviews. For food we had tapas, and my family and I were all enchanted. Incredible presentation, amazing taste. The service was prompt and courteous. The ceviches were out of this world! Â  An amazingly good night out!
