I tried so many items on the menu & I'm definitely coming back.  My favorites were the homemade tamales, brined chicken (moist & full of flavor), wafco, coleslaw, & kale salad.   The collard greens & dirty rice are especially yummy!  The owners are so welcoming & made me feel at home.  Everything is affordably priced & gourmet quality!
