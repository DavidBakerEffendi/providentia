This is nothing short of a fun experience, so many choices of beautiful and fresh food, sometimes a piano player near the tables where you can enjoy breakfast or lunch and people watch which is the best part. My boyfriend and I take the speed line from NJ and end up with more purchases than we planned and a heavy load to carry back home, but it all looks so good. I am learning from these other reviews to try some different stands in the market...thanks.
