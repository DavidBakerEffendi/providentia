Hangover Heaven. I was so blah one day and wanted disgusting messy halal food in my mouth. This place did the trick. The line is sooooo huge all the time, The meat is tender and I didn't have to reject any of the chicken. I would come here every day but I think I'd become a fat ass. This is the best street meat ever. These guys should get a prize.
