I work near Penn Sattion on 34th St and every day I have a challenge what I am goign to eat for lunch. There are not a wide variety of good and affordable places around the area. But I am so grateful to my friend who took me one day to Kobeyaki. He just said one thing: "you MUST try the best burger ever". Honestly I am not a fan of burgers cause it is quite simple american food: bun, meat, tomato, lettuce, ketchup. I should say my friend was completely right. I have never tried anything better. Kobeyaki burger was the BEST. It was juice, right soft bun, and kiss ass sauce that makes it so special !!! Now Kobeyaki has become my primary destination for lunch. Minimum twice a week I am there. Â Thank you Kobeyaki for great tasty food !
