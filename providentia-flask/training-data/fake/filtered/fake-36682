I love the food at PYT but lately I've had nothing but terrible experiences. The last few times I've gone, it has taken the servers at least 15 minutes to greet our table. I've received watered down drinks and food not prepared the way it was ordered. I went yesterday for my birthday with family and had the same awful experience. To make matters worse, it took over an hour just to get 3 burger. However, the young gentleman who hosted that night was so super sweet in handling my complaints. Unlike our server who seemed like she was always in a rush even though it was clear that no food was leaving the kitchen, he acknowledged our wait for our food and went out of his way to make us comfortable- the host ..not our server. Â I hope PYT gets back on track. I love the food but the service is gross.
