Warm attentive service without being intrusive. Good solid Italian fare. Great capolini putanesca, succulent Â veal piccata. We wished the chicken breast picante had been pounded more thinly, but it was very tasty nonetheless. Overall definitely a cut above average for food, with excellent service. We will make it a point to return next time in NYC.
