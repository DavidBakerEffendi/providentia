This place is a hole-in-the-wall gold mind. The food is great and you get your money's worth. You get paper plates, forks, knives, and cups (which I prefer rather than 5 star establishments occasionally even giving you "washed" utensils with dried on old stuck food). The simple menu is fantastic because you probably have your favorites picked out for next time. Who ever rates this establishment on the "college waitstaff" should be ashamed of themselves because their job is not to wine and dine you. Go to carmines if you want a butler to put your napkin on your lap. They put up with all the types of people that roll in the late night hours and for someone to ask for more than to be brought their food and a smile should re-evaluate their life and tone down the ego. I go here all the time, all times of the day/night and I am in my 30's so I've seen it all. The owners to the cooks, to the wait staff, they make it happen. Cheers
