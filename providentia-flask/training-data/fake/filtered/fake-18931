Forget about all the hype surrounding this place. Margarita slice is certainly good, but not worth waiting online outside for. The namesake Artichoke slice is very heavy, but tastes good. Better hope your stomach can handle the weight. Â Very little room inside means that if you've waited online to get in you'll be eating your pizza out in the street-not exactly my idea of fun. There is plenty of good pizza in the neighborhood so I can't understand why anybody would wait online to eat this average/above average stuff. Minus one star for overhype.
