Really fantastic, authentic, homemade Italian food. The cheese board I know is a weird thing to comment on, but they pair the cheeses with sweet tidbits like onion chutney and dried fruit and it's over-the-top delicious. Also love the zucchini parm appetizer and the gnocci with gorgonzola. The owner is very friendly and welcoming -- even to people with babies. Warm atmosphere, nice backyard in summer -- great addition to the neighborhood.
