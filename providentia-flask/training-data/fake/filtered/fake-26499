I have been a fan of the Turkish Kebab House for several years. The last couple of meals I've had there, however, have been disappointing. The food has become increasingly greasy, and last week (10/15/10) my friend found a still-alive cockroach in his lamb kebabs. The waitstaff was very contrite and did not charge us (!) for his meal, but I will not be returning.
