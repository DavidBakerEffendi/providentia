We had a company dinner planned at Alta last night and extremely disappointed. We made the reservations a month ago . Alta  did not confirm until 230p.m. the day of the dinner planned. My boss was at an event and did not get the voicemail until his event ended at 6:45.   When we arrived they had cancelled out res. Most restaurants confirm the day before or the morning of - 230 pm in the afternoon is a bit late for busy people in the middle of their work day. The worst part is that they did not even try to accommodate us. The truly did not care. We were all appalled at their indifference. Hence, we won't be patronizing this place again. It might be good food but if  the staff is not it takes away from the place. BTW - we went across the street t Piadina who  graciously accommodated  and had a fabulous evening.
