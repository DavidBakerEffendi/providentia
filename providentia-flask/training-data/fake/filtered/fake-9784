Simply the best Indian Food in and around West Windsor. We moved from Long Island and have been looking for a good indian place. The place is very clean and prices are very reasonable. The staff is very polite and helpful. While waiting we saw almost all the customers are regulars and are known well to the owners and the staff. We have picked up food many times and taste is always consistent. The food tastes like made from fresh ingredients because that what they use and advertise. At last we have found an alternative kitchen for us :-)
