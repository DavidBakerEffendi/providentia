Overall the food here is good.  You can get better Mexican food but Tortuga's has a creative menu and is definitely worth a visit if you haven't been yet. In this area, Tortuga's is bit of a local institution. They have another location in Lambertville as well as in PA. The restaurant is located in a nice, predominantly hispanic part of town however the resturant itself is a bit of a dive with basic wooden tables, and not much in the way of decor. The menu was somewhat surprising. I was expecting something more authentic and the menu has some of those but it's a strange mixture of american, tex-mex and mexican. Last time I was there, I had the spicy chicken wings - good but spicy, Chipotle Shrimp with brown rice - good overall taste with large shrimp.  All of the portions were large. The service here was slow and not too impressive but the place was busy so that could explain it. Bottom line, the prices are a bit on the high side, the food and service are okay, but there aren't too many great options for good mexican food in this area so Tortuga's is worth a try.
