I work in the area & was so excited when this place opened.   My co-workers & I went several times a week for awhile.  The pizza by the slice is good & fast, but be careful if you order anything off the menu. We've waited 20 minutes for them to make a salad before (while all the pizza we bought by the slice got cold in the bags).   The staff is friendly, but they can't multi-task. The pizza is decent, but the menu food is inconsistent.   I've ordered the roasted vegetable panini 3 times and each time it was different (one time they made it like a cold sandwich).   The last straw was yesterday when I called an hour and a half ahead and requested that an order be delivered at 1:00 for a meeting.  I called at 1:10 to check on it & they said it was leaving shortly.  It finally showed up at 1:30.   I stopped in later to order something for myself & the employees went back and forth about the details of another delivery they screwed up, while a customer waited 5 minutes to place his order.    I gave this place a chance for a few months, but I'm finally throwing in the towel.   It's disappointing b/c it's one of the nicer places in the immediate area (and the closest lunch spot within walking distance to work.)
