First attempt wasn't going to wait as the line was long and it was hot.  Went back two days later and walked right in.  Turned that this place is worth the wait.  Pizza was fantastic.  Cooked to perfection.  All the flavors came together like a well-rehearsed symphony.  Nothing too over-powering and nothing lost in the background.  I traded a red sauce piece for a piece of white pizza with my dining neighbor (although they spoke only chinese, we were able to communicate the exchange without a hitch).  I never had white pizza before.  I now know why. It was bland and had no "pop" like the red sauce slices.   I quickly returned to my pie for another slice of heaven.  This place will be a regular stop when I'm in town.  5 stars on taste.
