I am Italian by birth, an import.  My family and I went to Kim's on a whim, thank God for that whim. The food is excellent, (Italian food and soul food do not differ very much)  I was in my glory with the collard greens, and much to my surprise the Ox tail was super.  My wife and children, all enjoyed and the kids go visit on a regular basis. At times they are 8 strong bringing other friends, to my surprise, they all want to return (and they do)  the staff makes you feel like family, and dessert is awesome . I highly recommend you try Kim's.  Kids going again tonight with 3 or 4 other friends for their favorite dish - fried chicken and pancakes...  Go  Go  Go  and eat till your heart's content.....
