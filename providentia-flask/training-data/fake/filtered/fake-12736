As a Mario Batali restaurant, you expect a lot and Lupa does not disappoint.  We had the Roman tasting menu and everything was superb from start to finish.  The mozzarella was wonderful and so fresh, the pasta was delicious, and all the dishes were characterized by wonderful flavors and textures.  Definitely food that it would be hard to create at home.   The service was terrific, a combination of friendly and attentive without being intrusive and the staff seemed to anticipate our needs at every step.  The food and wine descriptions and advice were perfect.  Finally we loved the ambience of the restaurant, rich and warm and perfect for a romantic dinner We'll be back!
