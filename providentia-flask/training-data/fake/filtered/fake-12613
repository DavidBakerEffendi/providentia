From start to finish, an extraordinary experience.The decor, cooky modern yet comfortable.The staff, thoroughly professional, friendly and helpful. The food was of the highest quality (my duck was the finest I have ever been served), imaginatively prepared and presented, and the wine list extensive and inviting. I cannot think of a better spot for a per or post-event meal at Lincoln Center, located right across the street.
