I give this place 2.5 stars actually but ok. This was my first time trying here and I've heard nothing but great stuff about the food and the place so I had some high expectations. And they were not met. I didnt sit down to eat, I ordered to go so I dont know how dining here is. The people seemed nice, but this is strictly for the pizza. I'm an easy person and I always see the good but the food made me sad. I ordered the margherita, they said 35-40 min. I leave I come back 42 min later and get my pizza. I live about 3 min from here so imagine my distress when I bite into the first slice, and the pizza is cold. Lukewarm tops. I was sad. Besides being cold, the crust was burnt in places, there was no cheese on parts of the slices. Just sadness. I'm sad Roberta's. I will try you again because of all the raves my friends have given but your pizza made me sad.
