This is the place to go if you are looking for SUPERB Italian food and a casual (but slightly upscale) atmosphere. Prices are in the $15-20 per plate area. It's BYOB. I had the linguine with seafood. The calamari is literally to die for. I've eaten a lot of good seafood, and calamari is usually very hard to get just the right amount of tenderness. No chewiness, which I cannot stress enough how difficult to achieve such a delicate balance with calamari esp in a sauce type of dish, where the warmth of the pasta essentially continue to cook the seafood even after they are served. So it takes serious dexterity to get the tenderness just right as the person takes their bites. Osteria did it with such perfection it was sincerely amazing. Service was average. The staff members generally did their job well but nothing stellar either. The front desk lady was very efficient. She's really on top of her game. If she tells you 30 minutes, it will be 30 minutes. I'd go back there in a heart beat. Fantastic gem of a place!
