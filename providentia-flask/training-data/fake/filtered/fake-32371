I am hesitant to give Mr. Adams such a dismal rating because the food is really quite good, but the service was so inexcusably bad that it warrants one star. I arrived to a fairly empty bar area on a Saturday evening (around 8:30) and we sat at the side tables by the bar.  I was celebrating my birthday and a group of friends arrived about half an hour after my fiance and I sat down (we had ordered a couple of appetizers and drinks).  This is when things realllly headed south. Our servers came to check on us for food and drinks about once every 45-70 minutes without exaggeration. It took them about an hour to give everyone in our group (~12 people) just silverware and plates! I ordered a glass of white wine, it took 2 hours for them to return with my second glass because "they had to put the bottle in the fridge"...annnnnd because they forgot. These were my only 2 drinks for a 4 hour outing. At one point, my friend asked to speak with the manager, who never showed up.  3 of the 4 servers were all taking break simultaneously and eating at the bar at one point.  The busboy never cleared the plates.  I was so freaking hungry at the end (after the kitchen had mysteriously closed and we finally had one server who came over) that I just asked for a loaf of bread.  Oh and my friends had arranged to have a slice of birthday cake brought over to me but apparently they forgot and 'locked' the kitchen, so not a really happy birthday situation .  I honestly felt like I was on a hidden camera show, the service was so horrifically bad.  Oh and did I mention the bar area was completely dead all night?! Yep.  I have no idea what the service is like in the restaurant part, and I have no desire to ever return to find out.
