Delicious neighborhood Italian restaurant! My husband & I have been here several times over the past 4 years & the food is always amazing & never disappoints. The wait staff is friendly & helpful, décor is cozy. They change up the menu seasonally I think which is nice because it gives you a chance to try something different. We like a glass of wine with our meal, if you like martini's I recommend the bellini martini. For appetizers the fried calamari & the baby shrimp in garlic are wonderful. Soups are tasty & not heavy, well made salads also. Entrée choices are seafood, veal, chicken, pastas & steaks. I've had the veal piccata a few times, so tender & flavorful. Nice portions, not overwhelming. The dishes are well seasoned & full of flavor. My husband has had the seafood risotto & the whole branzino both were delicious. They also have tasty desserts & cappuccinos. I would highly recommend this restaurant for a quiet romantic dinner for 2 or out with friends. I almost forgot, the prefix menu on Fridays & Saturdays is a great value. You get an appetizer, soup or salad, entrée & a glass of wine for $29 a person! Enjoy!
