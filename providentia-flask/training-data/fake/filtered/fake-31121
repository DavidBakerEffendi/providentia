Went to the restaurant part and ordered the seafood combo. It was over $20 for the dish and I really couldnt eat much of it. It was so greasy and and lobster in it was overcooked. The service was good but there was no one in the place ( it was a Friday night ) so they couldnt screw that up. I actually had to go home and eat a real meal at home. Will not be returning.
