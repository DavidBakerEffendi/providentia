This place looked great.  Probably is.  I don't know.  Went in Friday at 10pm, no reservation with 2 friends.  Obviously going to wait at any place worth anything in West Village on Friday with no reservation.  I get it.  Little guy told me it would be 30min for a table.  Ok - had a couple drinks, 1hr 30min later still no table.  Asked about it a couple of times.  Said we were right up.  Nothing.  Offered us on ONE comp beer.  Walked out.  I'll try back, but no restaurant can ruin three guys' Friday night on the town.  We only get about 1,000 of those in a lifetime.  1 star until place redeems itself / will check back at some point.
