I'm new to the area and recently moved to Princeton. My sister and I stopped into Agricola today. The host was very pleasant and general atmosphere was great. We sat at the bar for about an hour and was served by a young gentleman named Zachary. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and made several good suggestions. The drinks were reasonably priced and overall had a good experience.
