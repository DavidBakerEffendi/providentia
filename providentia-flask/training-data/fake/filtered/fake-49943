I am some what a hot dog freak, I always try to find great places to go for hot dogs. In Gettysburg, the Texas lunch hot dogs there haven't changes 50 years, the same for the place in Harrisburg. There  also was a great Texas Lunch in Port Jarvis, NY and you used to have to wait in line to get a hot dog. Kids took over and made changes to an already successful business and now it's all but done and gone. About Rutts Hut, well for the past 55 years or so I have been eating hot dogs at this place. I live in Florida now but each year I travel north during the summer and I would always make it part of my plans to stop there for hot dogs. Sometimes, like I just did a week ago, I stay at the Howard Johnson's on the hill next to them just so I could get my hot dogs the next day. Well sad to say those days are over, the hot dogs I was served are not the same. They are not the ones you see on line in the pictures. The ones I got were much smaller and were pinkish in color. Even the buns were cold and I asked them to cook me a second one longer and it did have a split in it, it was still pink and small. When I asked the bat tender about it and why the change, his reply was "it's like you can't buy a pack of cigarettes for a buck anymore can you? Well I don't smoke so I don't know, but I do know, it's no longer worth my time to make Rutts Hut a definite stopping point on my yearly trips up north. The Rippers are gone :  ( Gosh sake, charge an extra quarter but don't change the hot dogs that made you famous. The old story is, "if it's not broken, why fix it" Phil
