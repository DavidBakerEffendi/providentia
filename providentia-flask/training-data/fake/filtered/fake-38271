I am from Italy, and I greatly enjoyed bringing my family here to eat. We order the gnocci and was fantastic and also filling. The wine list is incredible and contains many verities of wine from all parts of the world and country. The staff there is so warming and welcoming. Even though I only spent 2 hours there talking and having fun, my family and I felt as if we were apart of the Hidden Vine family as well. Every singly time I walk into the vine, everyone remembers my name and who I am. I recommend this place to anyone!!!! Best italian wine bar and lounge available in the Hartford region!!!!! A+++++++
