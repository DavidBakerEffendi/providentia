A friend of mine recommended Bluebird Tavern as a cool place to go eat, and I decided to try it out while I was in Burlington last week. I have to say I was very impressed. Its the sort of place where you will enjoy yourself no matter the mood you're in. The food is great, the staff are extremely accommodating, and the atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing. If you're looking for a really nice meal, be it brunch, lunch, or casual dinner with friends, its a great place to try out! Definitely recommend it very strongly, you will see for yourselves when you try it out.
