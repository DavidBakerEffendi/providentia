I went to their soft opening over the weekend and it was delicious! Their kimchi fried rice was great and their chicken thighs were awesome! The chicken was a spicy and tangy flavored dish and it really hit the spot! I cannot wait until they open. I will be here throughout the week! To top it off the chef said they're going to have BRUNCH!!! Simply perfect!
