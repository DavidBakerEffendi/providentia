I will tell you all that I have been going to Argyle Fish & Chips while I was in my mother's womb, so that majes it over 58 years. I was there when the lines went out and down the street in Kearney loaded with patrons taking out the fish 'n' chips, wrapped in newspaper, the way it was done. I have been to fish'n'chip places all over the eastern seaboard and there are none to compare with; quality of fresh fish; the batter, God yes, the batter; the personnel are wonderful, friendly; the desserts are to die for;the atmosphere-pictures, etc. are original and the same. so, if you want great fish'n'chips go to the Argyle in Kearney, N.J.
