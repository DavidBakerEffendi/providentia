My husband and I ate here a few months back and enjoyed our meal very much so we decided to return with our two children for a Mother's Day dinner.  I must say we were very disappointed.  We sat down to discover that three items on the menu were not available.  The food we did order took an impossibly long time to arrive; we sat down at 7:30 and our main courses did not come out until 9:00.  When the food finally appeared, my fish was cold and the other entrees not especially good. The panna cotta ordered for dessert was tasteless and bland, with some peculiar, Jell-o like substance at the bottom. The topping of the crème brulee was soggy. Both were overpriced--$12 and $14. We did not feel the meal or the experience was worth the $200 we were charged.  And when I wrote to the owner to express my disappointment, I did not even get the courtesy of a reply. I will never go back and will tell all my friends to avoid it like the plague.
