For people living in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood, I would recommend any other place than Bar Bruno. Â  As a local resident that's given this restaurant a ton of business since the first day they opened, it's disheartening that they take our business for granted and would rather use gimmicks to eek out a few more dollars from us and the other loyal neighbors. If this is how they want to grow their business then they can do it without our patronage
