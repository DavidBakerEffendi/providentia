Past Sunday, April 1, 2011, my friend and I went to Shabu-Tatsu to have their weekend lunch special -- pork/seafood soy milk/miso hotpot.  Mid-way into finishing the hotpot, my friend bit into something crunchy and very sour, and it turned out to be a cockroach.  My friend, who ate half of the cockroach was traumatized, and she ran to the restroom to throw-up everything that she ate.  The waitress apologized, and the manager called me later that day to apologize, saying he will inform the owner of this incident, and the owner will call us to apologize.  It is Monday evening, and the owner hasn't called us.  Shabu-Tatsu used to be one of my favorite restaurants in the city, but after this horrifying experience, my friends and I will never go there again.
