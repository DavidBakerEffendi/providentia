Charming little spot. We called ahead to make a reservation which worked out perfectly. Had the soup of the day which was delicious and had a bold tasting broth with very yummy fresh vegetables. That was perfect! The place was quite warm, though after having warm soup, I think I adjusted just fine. Also tasted both the chicken pot pie and the portabella mushroom pot pie. They were both appropriate size portions and were quite filling. The crusts (one whole wheat, one regular) were both flakey and very nice. The vegetables were fresh, the chicken was a blend of white and dark meat and the consistency was quite good. I enjoyed everything including a nice rich cup of coffee! Would like to go there again and try other options.
