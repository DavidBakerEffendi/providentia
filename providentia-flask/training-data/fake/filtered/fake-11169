It's crowded, it's pretentious, it's annoying. I'm sure the restaurants separated by cuisine sounded like a great idea when the place is completely empty and you don't have to pay, but for a customer is terrible and for a group of 3 impossible. It was noisy and overwhelming and embarrassingly overpriced. The signage is terrible. I have never felt so claustrophobic in my life.
