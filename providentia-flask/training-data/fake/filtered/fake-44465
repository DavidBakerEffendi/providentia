So I was looking through some of the reviews for this place and cant seem to figure out why people are so iffy on it. I was there on Wednesday night for drinks and was pleasantly suprised. I showed up at like 10:30 expecting the standard sports bar vibe ( domestic beer and crappy wings) . Instead I got a Pilsner Urquel and a very generous portion of fried calamari. Â While I was sitting there enjoying their tv's (and it needs to be noted that they are actually high quality televisions!!) this acoustic duo starting playing in the corner of the bar. I dont know why everyone is still up in the air over this place, I think its great and yes I will be back because it just feels right.
