6 of us dined here last night. Never again. First of all, my fiancé was there first, and he told the host how many of us there would be. She said she would seat us when we all arrived. We arrived, and the hostess very rudely asked, "Is everyone here?!" I asked our waitress before we ordered anything if we could have separate checks. I've been in the food service industry, and I know what a pain it is to try to have to figure it all out at the end. She SNAPPED at me, "It's going to have to be all done at the end." The portions are SMALL. I understand these portions are probably the amount of food that humans are supposed to eat, but not worth the prices. I got the skirt steak (Churrasco a la Parrilla). It was good, but it only came with some VERY salty rice that was supposedly stir-fried with plantain and lobster, but I did not taste either flavor. No vegetable. Not worth $26. My fiancé got the salmon. It was literally served on top of what looked like 2 pieces of arugula. $24 for just fish. He said it was delicious, but definitely would have liked perhaps a vegetable and/or rice! Everyone but me was finished, and she cleared everyone's plates while I was still eating and brought out dessert menus. That is a big no-no in food service. The entire time, the waitress seemed "bothered" by us, like we weren't worth her time. If 18% gratuity hadn't been included, I would have given her a 10% tip. As a former waitress, I usually am VERY empathic of other waitresses, but she just was not nice!
