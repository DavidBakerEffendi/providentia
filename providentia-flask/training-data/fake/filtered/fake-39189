You shouldn't pass up the opportunity to eat at Grimaldi's! They make some delicious pizza! What you should know -- you wait outside in a line until they can fit you at a table you'll likely share with others, you must pay in cash, you order by the whole pizza. With that being said, it's definitely worth it!
