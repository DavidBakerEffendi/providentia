The food is very good- that is not the problem. But if part of dining out is the company and conversation of those you are with, forget it.  The noise level on this Saturday night was deffining.  Everyone in there was nearly screaming, certainly shouting, and one table near us were actually screaming as they told their story to each other.   One problem might be the BYOB which means folks bring quite a bit that won't go on the bill, and they drink a lot.  The other problem is we called and made a reservation but that didn't matter. We still waited 45 minutes for our table and a party of two who the host knew, who had no reservation, we're seated in a matter of minutes. Once we were seated it took one hour before our entrees arrived. The salads that came before that we're good, but not enough to hold the wait and make up for the roar of noise in that tiny space. I never would have waited on the hot sidewalk for 45 minutes, for that audio torture had I understood that was what we were in store for. I'll never go back to Porcini's again.
