I never write reviews, but I about die for great Thai. This place is not to be missed. They also serve Sushi. They are across the street from the Ethiopian restaurant. The details: I was thrilled to come across this brand new restaurant while walking towards Seton Hall from the train station. I was greeted by Jenny, the manager, directly after opening the door. She served me some free green tea as I looked at their menu. Since substitutions are allowed, I opted to try the Mango Shrimp (replacing chicken.) Wow, was I surprised that the dish had about 7 perfectly cooked and cleaned jumbo shrimp, all swimming in my meal along with the delectable veggies and large chunks of mango. Yummy, sums this place up. The only issue is that curbside parking is in short supply. Enjoy, Tim
