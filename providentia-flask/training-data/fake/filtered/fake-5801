Huge variety, some exotic dishes as well. I did not like the deserts at all but the food is very good. the  price is well worth the quality of what you get. I would recommend it.  Its all you can eat and its a very good quality. I really enjoyed this place. I took my mom and my wife both agreed it was nice..
