I was here last Saturday and the place looked really busy. As soon as my fiance and I entered the waitress welcomed us with a smile and offered us to sit inside as she mentioned there was one table at the patio but it was reserved. After a while, the waitress came to us and explained us about the groupon that we had. It was our first time in an Indian restaurant and we had almost no idea about the food. For all our orders we took all her suggestions. For the appetizer, she told us the dumpling would be good and it was perfect. It was well cooked and the sauce was really tasty. When we had to order for our entree the waitress suggested chicken tikka masala and lamb spinach which were both beyond perfect. When I said spicy for the food, I was glad that the staff warned me that Indian spicy is really spicy. I ordered medium and it was the perfect spice level. The sauce of the chicken tikka masala was really good and the spinach was also really good. We loved the taste of the food. I am really going back to this place. The garlic bread smelled good and was just perfect. Overall, me and my fiance loved this place because of the service and the food.
