We've been here five times and gotten in only twice. The waiting time is absolutely horrible. It's too small of a restaurant for so many people to be waiting large amounts of time. We've left very disappointed the last three times we went there, because we couldn't get in and the wait time was over an hour! The lobby area was packed and the line was out the door. This is a pizza parlor after all! There's no reason for such a long wait. Their pizzas, sorry, tomatoe pies, are excellent but when the kitchen is overwhelmed, which is often, it's not out of the question to be waiting 45 minutes for your pizza! That's after you've already had two drinks and appetizers and you wait an additional 15-30 minutes for your main course! We like the food but they need to work on the speed of moving tables and food delivery.
