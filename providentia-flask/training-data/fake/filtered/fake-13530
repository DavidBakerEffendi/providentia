I got to Peaches Hothouse on a Saturday at 8pm. We had a party of 6 and the place is really small so we had a wait of almost 2 hours. The good thing is they let us order drinks and sip them outside on the bench. We finally got to eat i order the fried green tomatoes- delicious!. I got the fried chicken hot- it wasn't spicy to me. and the mac and cheese which was also really good. Ill be back just won't go on a sat. night with a Â large party.
