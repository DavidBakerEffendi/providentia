FYI FAMOUS MAMOUN'S NYC SHUT DOWN FOR LAST FOUR DAYS BY HEALTH DEPARTMENT !!!!!!!!! To my suprise one of my favorite places to get great falalfel in Manhattan Famaous Mamoun's (119 MacDougal St) in the village was closed by the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH with BIG YELLOW SIGNS ON THE DOOR -CLOSED UNTILL FURTHER NOTICE DO NOT ENTER BY THE ORDER OF THE HEALTH COMMISIONER ! For the last four days since 6/26/08 the health department has shut the place down. I arrived on 6/30/08 to find the inspectors crawling all over the place with the owner there it seemed he was argiuing with the inspectors the workers who work inside were outside starring at the front doors from across the street. When I asked what was the reason the DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CLOSED the place down every one went hush and would not give me an answer. I made a special trip into the city and there were people there who traveled as far as Florida who came into the city just to eat at Mamouns. This place has been around for 35 years + and just my luck I was starving and craved a great Falafel. Falafel & Shwarma are made at the right price at this place. Any one out there have a clue as to whats going on. Four days seems a long time to shut a resturant down unless the place is a serious health code violation. Anyone have any info on this one? I did notice one of the inspectors had the required CPR kit laying on the table and was taking numerous notes and writing reports. Please post
