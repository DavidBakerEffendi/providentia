This place is a one of a kind! I have been there over and over again and never had less than a great experience. The food is unique and delicious with playful twists that keep you coming back for more. And the drinks are awesome. All of the staff, front of the house and back are extremely friendly and personable. I recommend going with friends, sharing as many dishes as you can fit in your belly and then hanging out in the backyard by the fire. They have s'mores! I highly recommend this spot for a nice date or a great night out with friends.
