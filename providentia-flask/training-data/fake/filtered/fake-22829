Was excited after having tasted excellent pizzas in Memphis, TN 10 years ago. Disappointed !!. Not very clean. Staff did not know what was going on. We asked for veg pizza and the staff told us it would be at least 30 minutes before they could get one. They ran out of Jalapeno pizzas. They kept running out of items (breadsticks and pasta) and took some time to replenish. If you have a lot of patience, give it a try. To be fair, when we ran out of patience (after getting confusing answers from staff such as 2 hour wait), the manager was kind enough to refund the payment after we told him we are not going to eat.
