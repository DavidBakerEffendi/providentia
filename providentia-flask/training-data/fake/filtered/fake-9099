We stopped here one day after looking for apartments. The outside looks very inviting and cute.  I always thought the idea of a restaurant was to make food that tasted good?  This place does no.  The food is flavorless and is need of salt. Proper use of salt brings out the natural flavors of the food.   I am not sure this place even knows what salt is. All the food was bland. Our server was unable to make this experience any better.  She seemed  upset we came in so late (145pm).  I understand that is after the lunch rush, but I thought revers worked on tips and needed customers to make money. Mthen again I thought salt was part of all restaurants, well at least the successful ones. Stay away if you like flavorful food!!!
