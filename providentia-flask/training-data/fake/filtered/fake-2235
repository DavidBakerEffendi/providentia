Raised the ire of some bitchy locals next to us by taking a free table before waiting in line (sorry, it's not made in any way clear that that's how it's supposed to go especially when it's opened up to the street at the front - and the waitress didn't say anything when she cleaned our table before we joined the line). It was a mixed bag at our table - we had the wings, pulled pork and brisket with sides of edamame and spring pea salad, sweet potato casserole and slaw. The biggest hit was the brisket (my main, thankfully - but I was kind enough to share) as there was the general opinion there was a bit too much heat in the pork and wings. The sides were mixed too - they were fine but none were universally loved. I'm back in Australia now and fantasising about the brisket, so I definitely think it'd be worth making many return trips for. Maybe just a sandwich to takeout. Service was a bit brisk and we noticed a lot of confusion with people's orders in the line around us.
