Everything about this place is good, but especially the food, really the most delicious Italian food, simple dishes with fantastic combinations of flavors. The other night I had a special pasta an agnolotti type pasta filled with fontina in a black truffle sauce with brussel sprout leaves. Wow. I am not even a fan of truffles because I find them too strong but this dish was so savory with just the right amount of truffles,..the combination of flavors was special and made for a very tasty dish. Emporio is fast becoming my go-to for meeting a friend for a glass of wine and supper.
