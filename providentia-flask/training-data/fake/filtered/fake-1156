When you want to dine in style and not mess around, Amelie is the place to go! Especially when you're taking your boss out to dinner and you *really* don't mess around... The interior is like walking into your own personal parlour where you expect to see all your closest friends and loved ones cheersing cocktails and smoking cigars (of course, no cigars here...). There's only one word for the duck: succulent. The creme brulee: masterful. Lobster risotto: oppulent Ravioli: al dente! Merci, Amelie.
