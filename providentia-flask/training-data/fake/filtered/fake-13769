This is the best Chinese food place in Bayonne. Their crispy sesame/orange/Honey chicken are actually crispy. Also great sauce! Awesome egg rolls, and their lo mein is not greasy, which I really love. I order from this place on the regular, and would not even think twice about switching to a new place. I can't even order chinese food when I am away on business in another town , because Precious has spoiled me.
