In Hartford for a convention. . . tried this restaurant for the first time and the food was a hit but the customer service was a miss!  The waiter misinformed us regarding what our bill would reflect and we were mislead. We brought it to the management attention who informed us the waiter was incorrect but instead of putting the customer first and having an amicable solution, the manager was snide and rude.  His actions were completely out of line and didn't serve the best interest of the restaurant. . . none of us eating dinner that night ( party of 6) will ever chose to return to this establishment.
