I used to come here a lot, but on a recent visit was surprised by the change in the taco menu.  They no longer come with standard taco extras, only onion (???) and cilantro; everything else is extra.  Since the tacos were my go to, this stinks and feels like a way for cantina to cheap out on the extras.
