as a local who frequents Manjares for their very good cappuccinos on a regular basis, I am very disappointed at the terrible service and mediocre food we received yesterday. They should have had more staff in anticipation of Mother's Day. our waitress was lacking in professionalism and  was a real space cadet. we waited for a long time for service, then for coffee and drinks, then to give our order and  very long to receive our order.And it wasn't even that good. I had to flag waitress down for food update and for the basics, like water. During our time there, although she came into the dining room 4 times, she did not check to see how our food was, etc. And, after we dined, had to flag her down again to get the check. We were not happy and doubt we'll return. Manjares could be so much better. It would be worth it for them to hire professional wait staff.
