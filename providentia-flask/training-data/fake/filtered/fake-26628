I've been a fan of Stone Park for some time now- we've had wonderful brunches, lunches and dinners in their cozy dining room. However, over the past 6 months or so both the service and food seem to be in decline. During our last few visits we found tiny stones (yes, actual stones) in our potatoes/hash, many, many bones in the fish cakes, poorly cleaned spinach in the eggs florentine, Â undercooked cod and this morning we had eggs that were not only NOT cooked in the desired manner but were quite undercooked. This has been coupled with waiters that were both inattentive and borderline rude. Not checking on us, not ever coming by for refills of any drinks and then merely plopping down a check without even asked if we were ready to go. I really hope that perhaps its a phase where they're training new line cooks or new staff but i'm worried that it's not. I live right around the corner from the restaurant but this morning's visit has put me off returning for some time. Hopefully they can get their act together and find waiters that know how to actually wait tables and cooks who tend to basic steps like cooking things thoroughly and making sure basic prep steps (de-boning, rinsing completely).
