I came here for brunch with family, and I really loved the decor of the place, and although the tables are very close together, it wasn't too tight.  Staple breakfast items with little twists, like stuffed french toast and bacon hollandaise sauce.  The potatoes were great. The drink menu looked very unique, and had drinks that I haven't seen elsewhere. The food was well presented and was good, no complaints, but not outstanding.  Our waitress seemed like she didn't have time for our questions about the menu and seemed generally indifferent.  There was a good sized crowd but it was wasn't full so I was a little annoyed by the service.  Coffee refills were very quick. I would go here again.
