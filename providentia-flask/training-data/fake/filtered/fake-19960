For the amount of money these sandwhiches cost, I definitely won't be returning. I tried their Tasso Panini and was underwhelmed by the "spicyness" that it is supposedly known for, plus it was small and not worth the nearly 10 spot it cost. The pressed baguette the panini came on wasn't even cut all the way so all the sandwhich insides were only on one side and were stingy at that.
