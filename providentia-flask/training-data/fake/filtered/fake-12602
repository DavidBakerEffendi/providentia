Like the other reviews, the food is AWESOME!  I have gone to Pumpkin about three times now, and every single time, the staff has been super friendly and nice.   Definitely recommend taking advantage of their Sunday $40, 5 course tasting menu. Cash only, BYOB, a bit small so wouldn't recommend going with large crowds.
