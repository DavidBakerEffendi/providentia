I loved this place... Some of the best Mexican food I have had in the city... and the prices are brilliant for what you get. I only gave four stars because our waitress was unnecessarily snarky . Also, the place is tiny, which I think gives it a great atmosphere, but also means you could wait anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and a half to be seated, as they only take reservations for parties of two or eight. But that's not too much of a problem, you can just go grab a drink and come back, they are pretty good at keeping track of who's waiting. Their margaritas are also pretty fantastic.
