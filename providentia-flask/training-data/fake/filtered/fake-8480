A friend who was raised in Bayonne recommended Sarelli's when we first moved here a year ago and the restaurant quickly became our absolutely favorite place to go. The name and the family: Sarelli's was named after two of the daughters of the owners Sal and Kim (Sara and Ellie). The family runs the restaurant and are an amazing group of people who really make you feel like family whether you are just hanging out at the bar or are seated for dinner. Food: I work in NY City and Sarelli's compares to any of the best restaurants there (for much less!). The mussels is my favorite thing on the menu. My aunt visited from ATL (and she is very well traveled) and said it was the best mussels that she had ever had in her life. I brought several of my co-workers to the restaurant recently and from appetizers to desserts (OMG on the homemade cheesecake), they highly praised every course. They all want to come back! Drinks: Sal, the owner, or Caesar or Ellie can make you anything you want! My husband ordered a hurricane the other day and it's not on the menu and Sal said "just tell me what goes in and I'll make it" and it was yummy! The red sangria is one of my favorites. Sal makes it just right (a little stronger than the average). The Cosmo at Sarelli's is another favorite. Atmosphere: The place is really nice, but low key and totally chilled. It's not as noisy and loud or super busy like some of the other similar styled restaurants in Bayonne. Great place to bring your family. Our baby is 18mths and we take him with us all the time. Getting there: It is easy to get there from the light rail. Once you start approaching the last stop in Bayonne (8th street) you can see Sarelli's from the window. It's only two blocks from the light rail. Sarelli's really is a fantastic restaurant Â owned by fantastic people, with fantastic food and drinks and a super chilled atmosphere with friendly regulars. Highly, highly recommended.
