I am a grad student at Princeton and have now eaten at this place about 3 times.  Have tried their paninis and their burgers and have been cooked perfect each time with a lot of toppings!  Beats the same boring paninis at Panera. Its crowded around lunch and dinner time so they must be doing something right.  Staff is friendly as well and usually come by and ask about your food.  Now I have a convenient late night place to eat!
