I am in love with this place. They are amazingly cheap and sooo good. I moved to New Haven from DC a few months ago and was nervous about how good it would be because the storefront isn't amazing. But the service is great and the food is even better. Two things to know: - Their chicken is way better than their beef - You don't quiet know when it will be open because they have minimal staff. Sometimes it will randomly be closed or open 45 minutes late. It's such good food for so cheap, I have no idea how it stays open because it's that cheap!
