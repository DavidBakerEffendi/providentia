This is THE restaurant that I bring my friends from out of town to.  Even with the long wait, this restaurant always delivers. My new favorite Ramen is the Karaka Men.  I prefer it to the Akamaru Modern.  The pork buns are delicious as everyone else says, but other dishes, such as the octopus (Tako something) are incredible as well and worth trying. The only negative about this restaurant is the lack of good Vegetarian options. The Wasabi based vegetarian Ramen that is served is just not on the same plane as the rest of the Ramen dishes.
