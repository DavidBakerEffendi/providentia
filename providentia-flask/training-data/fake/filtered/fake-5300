Awesome italian food in an area with not-so awesome options (for any type of food) . The homemade spinach pasta with marscapone and sun-dried tomato is seriously one of the best dishes i have ever had. Â it melts in your mouth and you will become addicted. Good atmosphere and you can get a decent bottle of wine for a good price. Highly recommended.
