Thank God someone came to save South Orange from Toro Loco. This place is like a less fancy Chipotle. I like that the food is all fresh. The fries and the chipotle sauce is a must have. I've tried the burritos, quesadillas, tacos and wings. All of which were great. I am not a huge fan of their salsa, but they do give you a lot of options. This place is a great casual dinner place. Not pricey and great for take out.
