Things started off well enough with Mood.  The $60 for $29 Groupon deal had sold out, so only the $30 for $15 deal remained.  Ok.  I call the restaurant and the person answering the phone said no problem, they'll take two 15s in lieu of one 29.  Cool.  So we get there, make the same request to our server and again, just like the answer when I called 'no problem'. So we eat.  The food is decent enough.  Our waiter is nice and upbeat.  But then when it's time to pay, two $15 coupons are suddenly a problem.  'The guy behind the counter' says no you can't do that to my wife and our nice waiter comes over to us now with a really sad face saying, 'Oh sorry that was my fault;' but that was the restaurant's only solution.  I go to 'the guy behind the counter', trying to get my customer service concern rectified and his one-word reply (saying it as if he were talking to one of his kids) is 'MISUNDERSTANDING', like that was enough for him and that should be enough for me - that I'm losing out because of their mistake.   Now I have a 2nd $15 Groupon coupon for this place and it's gonna burn a hole in my pocket.  Like I said, the food was decent but the experience was poor.  With so many other places to try, why would we go back here?  If decent food were enough then we'd have stayed home and cooked for ourselves.
