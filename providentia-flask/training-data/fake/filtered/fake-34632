My family came up to Burlington while on vacation further south. We spent the day and stopped into The Farmhouse because of a local bookstore owners recommendation. It was super crowded and told the wait was 45 min. we were given a pager and we waited in the beer garden they have out back. The wait was accurate. The staff was very pleasant and you can see into the kitchen. The cooks were working hard to get the food out. Our food was fresh and delicious as they use all local produce. The restaurant is very loud as it is a former (Golden Arches ), very open. It's a fun place to have a nice fresh dinner! A nice selection of local beers as well.
