Best Sichuan in Philadelphia. Better than Chung King Garden, Szechuan Tasty House, Four Rivers. Fuqi Feipian - beef & trip appetizer. ok version although its far better than any other in Philly. Noodle (on the house). Not sure what this is; definitely not Dan Dan noodle. Owner serve it tableside by mixing the peanut butter plus sesame oil sauce w/ noodles. Not bad. Three pepper chicken. Chicken stir-fried w/ three different versions of peppers; quite spicy. Technique used is Bian which is basically sauteing for a longer than usually time to dry out meat more than usual but also enhance flavor. ok version. again better than others in Philly. Lamb in dry pot. Best dish of the night. executed very nicely with right amounts of Ma (numbness) and La (spiciness). The ratio of lamb toi bamboo shoots to pepper, etc is good. This rivals Wu Liang Ye, Szechuan Gourmet in NY. All in all, a satisfying meal. My only destination for Sichuan food in Philly.
