LETS START WITH THE GOOD Well let me start off by saying the place looks very nice the atmosphere is great i love the look. It is also is a good thing because it is open 24hrs so no matter what time you can get service, Unfortunetlly its not great service at all if you come with a group of more than 6, they will deny you entry , even if its two groups one of 6 and another of 2 they willnot accept you. We asked to speak to a manger because we had a group of 9 and came in seperate cars and the first group of 7 entered first and we were denied a table even if the rest of the party werent present,. we told the so called security or wanna be bouncer that we would have seperate tables and he said no i am not gonna seat you guys. No i feel he was profiling us not saying racially but it may be from something else why he did that his name was bert by the way tall fat bald guy. We then asked to speak to the manager and was told no we asked why and he said as long as you guys are in here i will not get the manager, we decided as young women that we came very respectable to this place and should not be treated in this way and told Bert we will not move until he gets the manager which he didnt and said it not about racial profilling or about black and white but this is our policy we just have the right to deny anyone we feel like and also allowed to kick you out if we choose. We went and got the manager ourselves and was even more surprised at what the manager told us after he seat only 3 of us and said the others cannot be seated, he said that Bert and there staff is trained to act in that manner to guest that are like that. very shocked at the treatment and felt that i should share this with everyone. restaurantso was outside at time when we decided not for just 3 people out of 9 to eat there and bert was smoking and decided to blow the smoke in one of our faces as we were leaving the resturant, which was totally disrespectful and rude EAT HERE ONLY IF YOU CAN BE PROFILED AND JUDGE WITHOUT A PROBLEM AND BE DISRESPECTED BY SO CALLED SECURITY AND MANAGER THEN THIS IS THE BEST PLACE FOR YOU ENJOY
