I have been to park central a few times but not since the recent menu change. Tonight I was delighted to see a fresh new menu full of delicious options! I couldn't possibly resist the lobster roll with hand picked lobster meat, and the server let me switch out the fries for a Caesar salad! After enjoying a few glasses of wine I got a bit hungry again and decided to take another glance at the menu. I ended up ordering the date and goat cheese flatbread and let me tell you it was the best decision of my night! It was absolutely delicious, a subtle lemon vinaigrette with fresh arugula. Really great! I will be back soon!
