Favorite dive bar, ever.  Possibly because this is where I routinely come with people from work and always have a great time, but also because there are $4 beers until 8, we get free bowls of cheese balls and pretzels, and there is a sweet old Irish/Scottish lady who is there all the time.  It's definitely a dive bar - small, dingy, no fancy drinks or fancy service.  But if you just want to have a couple of drinks with friends in a small, friendly, relatively quiet (unless you're there in the post-work rush) place downtown, this is the place to go. PS: The upstairs is nice when it's too crowded downstairs.  Also, the women's bathroom is upstairs.
