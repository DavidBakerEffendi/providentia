The Red Stone Tavern was an enjoyable dining experience. The quality of the food is simply amazing. Almost all of the products are homemade and the portions are huge. The dining environment is really soothing, with the water fall wall, and overall great layout. The price is extremely great for the amount of delicious food you receive. The brickoven pizza was one of the best I've ever had. All the meats that my party ordered were tender and juicy. I STRONGLY suggest this place.
