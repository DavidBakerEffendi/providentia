We went to Ofrenda last week and had a great experience.  We started with the jalepeno margaritas and the boconeros salad -- both of which were very unique.  For our main course, we had the fish and the lamb dishes, which were delicious.  Ofrenda is a great place to try a new style of mexican food with traditional flavors.   The wait staff was really friendly and attentive too.  We will definitely be back.
