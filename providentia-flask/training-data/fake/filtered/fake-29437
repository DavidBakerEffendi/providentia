I have been a patron of Adobe for years and they rarely disappoint. The chicken chimichanga and grilled steak fajitas are always a solid choice and there is a massive selection of beer to satisfy any palate. The drunken shrimp, a house specialty, can be hit or miss at times (shrimp and unseasoned rice slightly overdone) but a huge selection of tequila and delicious margaritas make up for minor mistakes. Service is always friendly and helpful. Music on weekend nights is entertaining but sometimes a bit loud for the small, crowded space. If you're looking for a sure thing, Adobe always comes through and provides a positive dining experience overall.
