I wish there were a zero star option because that's what I would give Sketch.  I came here last Friday with my boyfriend when it was downpouring.  All we wanted to do was get out of the rain, get a quick bite to eat and move on with our lives.  Coming from somone who has worked in the restaurant biz, I know what the worst complaint about a restaurant can be.  It's not that the food sucks, that the decor is tacky, that the location is bad, it's HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE, like Sketch. So we walk in and nobody greets us, offers us a table or anything!  Ummm, if you don't have a hostess, get a sign that says, "Please seat yourselves."  So, after five minutes of awkwardness and confusion, we decided to just seat ourselves.  By the way, the tables and chairs were really sticky, like there was a layer of grease all over them.  The place looked really dirty overall, probably as clean as a McDonald's.  ANYWAY, despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty (i.e. not busy at all) no one came to our table with water or menus.  This place was the most inefficient, embarrassing, unprofessional restaurant I have ever been to. Without a question, we decided to walk out (which I have never done before) and went to PUB AND KITCHEN instead--our favorite go-to burger spot, where we were greeted immediately, seated immediately and given excellent customer service. Who gives a SHIT how good your burgers are when you don't even know how to take care of your customers?  What kind of business strategy is that?  Obviously a bad one because I got a really big mouth and I made sure to tell every single person in my office this morning to never come here.  Honestly, places like this don't even deserve to be in business.   GET A CLUE!
