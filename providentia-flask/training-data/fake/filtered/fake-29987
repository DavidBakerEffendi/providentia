'Upstate' exceeded all expectations. The craft beer was great and the happy hour oyster platter was even better, but it was the service that made this east village joint stand out. My inexperienced oyster palate was overwhelmed by the variety of choices on the menu, so I was greatly appreciative when the server took the reigns on our slurptastic adventure. He set us up with a sampler of all varieties and explained in detail what the subtleties between each flavor/texture would be. While I might not have been able to fully grasp all of the briny intricacies, I enjoyed the experience very much. The staff were very attentive, but in no way trying to get us out of there. Some famed whisky cake on the house made for a great finale. I will definitely be coming back.
