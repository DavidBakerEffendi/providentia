Overall not as expected... Â I would not recommend this to anyone. Me and my wife went to this restaurant seeing 4 * on Yelp. But it was very disappointing.. We ordered non-veg platter that was pathetic.. Chicken Karahi - no taste at all, could feel raw onions and tomatoes. Lamb Birayani - not bad .. we could somehow manage to eat half naan.
