We ordered pizza take out.  I called and ordered a small cheese and large mashed potato (big Spud)  When I picked up the pizza they had only cooked 2 small pizzas.  When I explained I had called in a large big spud, there was no apology for the mix up,  no offer to correct the mistake.  I had repeated my order on the phone when I called it in.  When I was handed the boxes with the 2 pies, I had to look inside to make sure there was even pizza in them they felt so light.   I'm all for thin crust but, there was absolutely nothing to them.  I would not order again from there.
