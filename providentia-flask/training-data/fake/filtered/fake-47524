Pizza was ok. It had fresh ingredients but a little burnt around the edges. The staff was rude! I was asking if we can move to another table because Im a tall guy and the seats he gave us were cramped in a corner. He told me too bad if I didn't like it I should have stayed at home. Oh trust me I told him off and was a few second from walking out this overated place! Like i said pizza was ok, i've tried pizza from all over and I prefer deep dish to this. Go if u like thin burnt bread and rude drunken staff!
