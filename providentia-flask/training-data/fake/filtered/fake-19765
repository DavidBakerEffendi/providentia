We have been looking for a new chinese place for a while and decided to try China Chef this time.  We were not disappointed.  Not only was the food very tasty, but it was light and fresh tasting.  We tried some of our favorites so we could gauge it against other places and it came through with flying colors.  The dough on the dumplings was a little thicker than we like, but the flavors and freshness were fabulous.  The service was fast and the pricing was great.  This is now our new go to for chinese.
