I agree with (mostly) all of the negative comments posted here. Rude (actually more like indifferent) employees, random cleaning supplies at nearby table, filthy baking area, and of course the long line and longer wait once you are seated. That said, I will come back again and again for the pizza, it's just that good. Period. It's been the way it is for as long as I've been going, and probably always will be. They (literally) ONLY care about delivering the best pizza in New Haven. And there will always be people lining up to go through the torture. It's clearly not for everyone, but that's ok...more for the rest of us!
