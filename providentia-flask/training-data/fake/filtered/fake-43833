After reading the reviews my family and I were super excited to eat here.  So disappointed we ordered your typical diner food pot roast, fried chicken and Mac and cheese.  The pot roast tasted as if it had been microwaved, the fried chicken was as if it was marinated in oil and the Mac and cheese was out of the box.  Nothing was seasoned but even adding salt and pepper was not going to bring our dishes to life.  And the  tiramisu was so very dry as if it were days old.  The food at the hospital cafeteria would have more flavor.  I wonder do you have a new cook....new owners? Again Very disappointed.
