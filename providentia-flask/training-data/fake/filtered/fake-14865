I love this place, seriously. My fiancé and I have eaten here almost as a ritual every time I go to NY. But it only takes one bad experience to ruin everything. It was my last night in NY, and my fiancé and I decided to go ahead to Chinatown and eat here. We got the dumplings, fried wontons, pan fried seafood ramen, and shrimp wonton noodle soup.(we knew we wouldn't eat it all but it was my last night there). It was delicious. Until the next morning, we both woke up feeling horrible. We both ended up with food poisioning! We spent the next few days sicker than a dog and sleeping. We have never had a problem with their cleanliness. But something went wrong somewhere. ): We won't be returning after this experience.
