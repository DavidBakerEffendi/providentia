Ordered here sat night delivery driver called me saying he was outside but he was not. I tried to ask where he was and he just kept yelling 240 240. That number has no relevance to my address. I tried to give him directions but he hung up on me. I called the restaurant to let them know and ask them to call and give him directions. 10 mins later no one has called me so I call the restaurant back she says she called him...10 mins later he calls again yelling come outside come outside..i told him i did not see him outside and where was he he started screaming 91 91 91 I said I have no idea what that meant he needed to tell me where he was he started cursing at me and hung up. I called the restaurant back and they asked why couldn't i meet him outside well bc hes not outside I have no idea where he is and when I ask he just yells at me and then started cursing she told me I would just have to cancel the order. So I never got any food and Im waiting for them to refund my card. Stay away!!!!!
