I have never written a review on Yelp until after reading franklin m's review of Amis.  I felt that it would be irresponsible of me NOT to write a review, so here goes..... I have now eaten at Amis twice, since it opened back in early January.  By way of background I am a huge fan of Osteria and other Philadelphia's best restaurants.  I tend to look for the best food that will satisfy my appetite with accomodating prices.  Amis = all of the above. Here are the items off the menu that my girlfriend and I have tried.  We tend to eat a lot and always try each others plates. Smaller Plates & Appetizers: Ricotta Bruschetta Mortadella Mousse Bruschetta Eggplant Bruschetta Sal's Famous Meatballs Smoked Mozzarella with Pickled Vegetables Stuffed Clams Entrees and Pastas Bucotini Pasta Cacio de Pepe Gnocchi with Oxtail Ragu Turkey Cutlet Desserts Waffle with Nuttela Semifreddo(s) Everything I ate was extremely pleasing.  Everything!  My favorites would be the Ricotta and Mortadella Mousse bruschettas, the Turkey Milanese and the Gnocchi with Oxtail Ragu.  The gnocchi melt in your mouth.  I didnt want to take the last bite!  The waffle with nutella for dessert is a must.  Add an espresso and be on your way. Lastly, I have sampled several of the wines.  The house wine ($6) is a bargain.  The other wines I have tried were really good and moderately priced, which seems to be the theme at Amis.  Amazing food, amazing experience, amazing drinks for a moderate price.
