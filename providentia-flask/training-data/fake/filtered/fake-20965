I decided to try the original Bubby's last Friday, I was in a business meeting in Tribeca so I strolled in there for lunch after my meeting. I did have a bad experience at their Brooklyn location few months back but I was willing to give them a second chance. Â  Service: slow and very careless (took 15 mins to order and another 15 for my lemonade and than 20 mins after that my food came out). Thank god I was by myself. Food: old and stale bun on my burger, cold french fries and my burger was over cooked (I ordered medium rare and it was cooked all the way through). What is the point of waiting for them to ask me how my meal was and than wait more time for them to remake it. On top of it my lunch with tip, tax and everything about $45 (that is insane this day and age). what a disappointment, the cherry on top of the cake was, I noticed that they were getting their health inspection from the DOH, guess what? today I decided to check the DOH web site and they got 49 points in violations. I had a bad feeling about Bubby's and it got confirmed again. Good luck to all the other yelpers, dine in this establishment at your own risk.
