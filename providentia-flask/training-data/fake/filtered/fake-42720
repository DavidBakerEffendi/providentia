Let`s just say their tiramisu is to die for. I am not even sure if i compare their desert to another from another place. I live in the neighborhood, often pass by and it is always full of people. Their pizza is delicious and Italian meatballs are very good. i am not a huge fan of marinara sauce, but a sauce there was very tasty and not overly acidic. Service was very prompt and friendly. Great place.
