If Â you want chicken parts on a stick this is the place for you! I went here for my birthday to try some new foods. I started with fermented salmon, it was fantastic and one of my favorite dishes. My favorite yakatori had to be the hatsu (heart) I had to order seconds of that one. The skirt steak was fantastic and so was the oyster and skin. I finished with the bananna ice cream, a perfect ending to a great meal.
