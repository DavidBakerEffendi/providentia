This place used to be really good. But last time I went the hostess was very rude. She didn't even say anything and sat us downstairs near the kitchen... which wasn't flattering AT ALL. The food used to be really good but I received some really gross pasta. The waiter we had was really nice but he was kinda of slow. The bread is really good there and the butter but aside from that, its not fun a good environment to go out to eat to. I remember going there when I was a little child and I was so excited!!! Dissapointing :(.
