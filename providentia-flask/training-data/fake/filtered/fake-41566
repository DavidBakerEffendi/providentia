Excellent food, excellent service, good prices! Ducked in to Â get out of the rain today and had a wonderful experience. In from Florida for the holidays. We eat a lot of oysters there but the oysters at Fish are the best we ever had. The cod sandwich and fried clams were were great as well. Excellent value in a great setting.
