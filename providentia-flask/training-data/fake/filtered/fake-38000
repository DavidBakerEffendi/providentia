The food came quickly and was tasty, but the total lack of hospitality ruined the meal.  My husband and I went on a recent Friday evening and I met him at the bar. We were seated fairly quickly, however sat for 15 minutes waiting for a waiter, as a group of waiters hung out behind us near the bar seemingly just chatting.  We finally flagged down a waiter and asked if we could order. He told us that he was not our waiter.  I asked him to find our waiter since that person had not yet shown up and then he took our order.  The service after that point was fine, but I am never going back.
