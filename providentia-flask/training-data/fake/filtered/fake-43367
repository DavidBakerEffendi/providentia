Went to Outbacks this evening and was dissapointed again for the second time.  Last time my fillet was very rare after asking for medium well.  This time the same thing.  Waited for a half hour for the appetizers.  This is the last time I will go to the Outback in Hamilton or anywhere else.  Too many other restaurants that are better. Not good at all!
