This sushi hurt my feelings. TERRIBLE - TERRIBLE - TERRIBLE!! The Sashimi still had pieces of skin on it and wasn't cut nicely at all, some chucks were like huge cubes, some triangles and there was a unknown fish on the platter which smushed in your mouth like butter but tasted like rotten milk and the waitress has no idea what it was but only told us "you paid for it". The rolls were huge and sloppy and honestly the whole experience stunk. We got our soup and salad before the drinks and the appetizer of edame after we got our dinner. It is sad the sushi was so incredibly disgusting and the service sucked because they have great hibachi. I will never return for sushi here and will be sure to tell everyone it is GROSS, the selection is weak and we were advised no changes were allowed and the service was terrible. Waste of money!!
