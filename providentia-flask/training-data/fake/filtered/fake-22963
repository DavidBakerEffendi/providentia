Comfortable lounge, laid out nicely, ambiance is trendy casual, music doesn't get in the way and the $4 lychee martini on Monday's HH makes it a nice place to relax after work...  I say, go.  Oh, obviously they don't use top vodka for a $4 martini... but it's good enough, and 2 or 3 make me a happy dude.
