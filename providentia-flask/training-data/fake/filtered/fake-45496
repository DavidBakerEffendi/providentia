Alright sandwiches, good beer selection, but the service is terrible. You have well-dressed drifter snobby types who want nothing to do with actually helping costumers. This is especially unnerving when most of their beer selection is made up of the $4-6 beers that people outside of beer circles not know. When you are putting down this kind of money for a beer, you would want people who will help you out with getting what you are looking for. Instead you get aloof 20somethings who come off as annoyed that you are asking them for help. Also, sandwiches flimsily put together, making for a messy eating experience.
