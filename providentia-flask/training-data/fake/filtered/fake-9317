I recently had lunch there.  Mango juice was in a can. Couldn't they pour it on a glass to make it more presentable. Dumpling soup was  above average and had a strong celery flavor, which made it a non-Filipino soup.  Bipstik or beef/onions stew was bad.  It looked like bipstik but didn't taste or smell line one.  I would still go back and try the others, again, with a critical sense of taste and smell.  Just avoid their bipstik.
