Have had the pork, chicken, and shredded chicken sandwiches so far. The pork is hands down the best! The difference between the regular and shredded chicken is that the latter is all white meat and unseasoned. Love the ratio of meat product and the carrots - I think at other places they skimp on both. The bread is perfect. I usually also get the iced coffee. It's always crowded, but I've always managed to grab a seat. It's right off of the F train, so that is an extra plus. Much recommended.
