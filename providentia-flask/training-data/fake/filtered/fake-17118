This is by far my favorite Midtown hot spot.  With incredible food, and a lively atmosphere, you can't get much better than this.  The management is so friendly and extremely helpful with selecting wines!  I love how although there is a lot of seafood options, there are steak options as well!  While I loved my Bibb Lettuce and Halibut I cannot wait to go back to what seems to be an extremely popular happy hour to try the oysters!!
