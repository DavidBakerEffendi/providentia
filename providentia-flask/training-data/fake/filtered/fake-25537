We love Franco, his hospitality, and his food! We followed Franco from his restaurant just off Kelly Drive for the place at City Avenue. He's now back in East Falls, just two blocks from our home and we're thrilled. This, his newest restaurant, is a small yet comfortable place. Franco seems very happy to be doing his own cooking; the food looks great on the plate and tastes like it's been made with love. Don't forget it's a BYO. Good luck Fanco! XOXO, A and H
