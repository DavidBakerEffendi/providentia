Both times Ive called in an order for takeout ( Jerk Chicken and Pork) I was told 20-25 mins and it ended up being more like 45-50 mins. If you ever been to Jamaica you know thing move a bit slower on the island. But the food was definetaly worth the wait and I will continue to order from them, I just know itll take 20 mins more then they say.
