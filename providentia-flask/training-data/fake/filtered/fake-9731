Love, Love, Love this place...especially when someone else treats. I prefer less expensive places usually, but this is a great special occasion place.  We eat out a lot, so it is nice to have that kind of place on my map.   The food is amazing, and they always let their staff taste everything.  It is part of how they do business.  They want their wait staff to be able to describe the food. Because of their knowledge of the values of the restaurant and community of which it belongs to shines through.  I love their use of local grown produce.  GIve it a try.
