I never write reviews but I was so excited about eating at this place that I just had to write about it. This place is as authentic as it gets. Me and my husband are both from Russia so we are very serious about our food and this place felt like eating at granmas! This restaurant is all over Ukraine and is a place we visited on our travels back home so i was soooo excited to see this place open here in the city! The decor is traditional Ukrainian and very cozy. The place just opened so they let us try their infused vodka on the house. We tried the bacon vodka which was recommended by the waiter, I was unsure but after we tried it.. I was intrigued, this is the only place in the city I have ever even seen this on the menu.. Also tried strawberry infused vodka which was amazing.  We started with the pork sausage appetizer and Blueberry mors which was very refreshing (its a traditional russian berry drink). Ofcourse we had to have the pirogi or pirashki which were to die for and just as good as grandma made. I ordered the  Salmon Moscow style which is basically salmon cooked in creamy cavier sauce. Loved it and cant beat the $22 price for caviar anything. My husband had the mushroom and potato vareniki which are basically Russian version of dumplings and they were out of this world. We both ordered the sorrel borsht which is something even if we haven't had before and my taste buds were singing. The sever was very attentive and the manager checked in on us from time to time to make sure we had everything we needed. I will def be coming back with my family!
