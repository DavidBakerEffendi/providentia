Been here twice now. Once for a late breakfast/brunch and the second time was today for lunch. They have the best tofu scramble I have ever had and some amazing waffles and pancakes. The 'pulled pork' I had for lunch was incredible. I also loved the atmosphere at champs, they have an old school, diner type vibe and all the wait staff are super friendly. I would say this is a must visit for any vegans in the area and I would also recommend it to anyone else who is veg curious.
