Lots of issues with this new restaurant. Front of the house did not make any eye contact. Inexperienced wait staff, friendly, but did not keep water glasses full and just placed silverware on the table. Appetizers were great, entrees were fair, crispy skin bass was not and the short ribs appeared to be steamed, no flavor. Lastly, the restaurant uses iPads for your check and has predetermined tips listed. Â This place needs a lot of help.
