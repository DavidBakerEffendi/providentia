I took a friend here last name for her birthday. I did the research and it seemed to have some really great reviews, I went on the website and the pictures of the restaurant looked good so I said this is it.  As we arrived I saw on the door that it said "they love us on YELP" and saw all the plaques of awards they received, I'm thinking I made the right choice.  Don't get me wrong the staff there is very friendly.  It is a small narrow restaurant, very crowded, it was a Friday night.  Very nicely decorated.  We sat back doors, which was a wait.  It is very narrow out there too! That's my only negative thing about.  As for for the food, we ordered a chicken empanada with some type of cilantro sauce, now that was veryyyy good!  The rotisserie chicken was alright, I had better.  The cilantro mashed potatoes are very good, so are the sweet plantains.  As for the yellow rice, no flavor whats so ever.  I would go back here just not ordering the same thing. It's a very nice atmosphere and very friendly.  Just had better when it came to the food.
