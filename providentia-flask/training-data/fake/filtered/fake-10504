My husband and I were celebrating his birthday.  We chose a familiar place in Montclair... Culinariane...or so we thought.   We called the usual number and made a reservation.  Unsuspectingly, we arrived at the old location and then had to drive all the way to Verona, the new location.   When we arrived there was no one  at the reception desk.  It became obvious that this was not a BYOB as the previous restaurant was.  When the hostess arrived and saw us with a bottle of wine she tactlessly advised that it would not be a problem if we brought our own bottle but that there would be a small cork fee of TWENTY DOLLARS!!!   The ambiance of the restaurant is completely different to the previous restaurant.  The restaurant in Montclair had a classy feel to it.  There was a calming atmosphere where you could enjoy an exquisite and delicately prepared meal.  This new place (Arianne Kitchen and Bar) is the total opposite.  The environment is loud, busy, and the food does not seem as carefully thought as in the previous location. Bread was brought to the table long after we had ordered.  The bread seemed stale and not fresh at all.  Then came the appetizers and they were the highlight of the evening.  I had the pasta special for entree that sounded delicious but turned out to be a upscale version of Mac & Cheese.  My husband was looking forward to the short ribs which turned out not to be carefully prepared and therefore were chunk of fat!  At that point we decided to call it quits.   This restaurant may be appealing to some but it has nothing to do with the restaurant in Montclair
