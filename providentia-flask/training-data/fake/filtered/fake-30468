My first experience eating Korean food was somewhat subpar, so I've been hesitant to try it again. I was in the neighborhood of Cho Dang Gol and a friend recommended it for lunch, so I decided to give it another go. Cho Dang Gol changed my whole perspective of Korean food, right down to the Kimchi, which I've always been convinced I would never like. All of the small plates brought prior to our meal were so delicious! I ordered the Bimbimbap and the meal was superp. Although there was a slight language barrier, the service was excellent. Food came promptly and our water glasses were kept full. The restaurant itself is small, but beautifully appointed and very comfortable, warm and inviting. I really cant say a bad thing about this place.
