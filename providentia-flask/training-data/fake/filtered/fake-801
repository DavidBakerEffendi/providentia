The lines can be a bit long to bear, but it's worth it. Brunch is always awesome here with my girlfriend every week and we're ALWAYS happy. Speedy and friendly service has always been our exerience here, and I don't plan on changing my weekly brunch routine by going anywhere else. I'm hooked on Tom's!!!
