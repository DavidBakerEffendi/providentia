We were happy here, from the moment we sat down and were greeted as if they cared about us to the homemade chips and pureed black beans and guacamole that they presented.  I don't generally enjoy having ethnic food called "fusion" or gussied up, but this didn't lose anything in the translation.  The opening tidbits were promising, and we liked the choice of appetizers and sides, choosing to share the steak.  It was the right amount of food, and we were pleasantly surprised, both by the attitude and quality of the meal.  We preferred the quesadilla to the chimichanga (with fatty beef, I think), but there are plenty of things to pick from, including a wide variety of side dishes. The staff is cordial and eager to please.  Prices are fare. I had a beer.  My husband said his margarita was a bit watery.
