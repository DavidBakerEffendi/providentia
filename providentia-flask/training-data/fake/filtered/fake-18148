Do not waste your time. Service was ridiculously horrible, food was mediocre at best. Waitress was inattentive, lazy, and honestly disgusting. We has to ask for menus, silverware, we waited excessively long for our drinks and food to include water. She made no effort to ensure our enjoyment. That plus the sandwiches we ordered Temple crab and Temple Cubano were absolutely nothing to rave about. The pork in the Cubano sandwich was dry and there was no hint of Cuban anything. Also to add insult to my sandwich, the restaurant sells it on menu as a sandwich on sweet bread yet I received dry pork and yes dry ham on a pressed French roll :/ my husbands Crab sandwich was meat straight from the can and entirely "fishy" and dry (the sauce couldn't even mask the crappy quality crab). We were disappointed with the entire experience there. My apologies for the bad review but what can I say? It was BAD.
