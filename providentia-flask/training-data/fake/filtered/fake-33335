My husband and I picked this place as one of the few spots to eat on our trip to NYC. I loved every single bite!  We started out with the bruschetta and wow, was it good. I normally actually don't even like brussel sprouts, but these were really tasty.  For my entree, I got the Cavatelli and my husband got the skate. Both were melt in your mouth delicious. The pasta and ricotta are both made in house, so they were beyond wonderful. We were sad to not have room for dessert. I am so happy with my experience here, I would give them 6 stars if I could.
