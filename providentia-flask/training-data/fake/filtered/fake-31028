We have been here three times for lunch and have never been disappointed.  The burgers are thick, juicy and incredibly tasty -- substantially better than Plan B.  And the beer menu is fantastic!  If you can't decide on a beer based on reading the list, you can ask for a small taste of two or three to help you make a final selection. Our servers have always been attentive and helpful in choosing the beers.  The interior decoration has an industrial/steam punk vibe that I find interesting.
