This is by far our favorite restuarant in the Upper Valley,  My husband and I come here as often as we can!  Navartan Curry is his favorite and I have a few favs myself, Biagan Bartha, Aloo Saag, and Kadi Pakora Sihndi, to name a few.  Also give the indian beer a try,  Kingfisher, an excellent compliment to their cuisine especially if you go for the extra spicy choices. Also there vegetable soup, makes for great comfort food!
