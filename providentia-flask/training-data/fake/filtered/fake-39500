This place should be called Manny's Snack Shack because all you can get to eat in this joint after 3 months of their opening are still donuts and sandwiches. When I get off from work I would like A MEAL. The service is always so luke warm... me thinks it might be because they don't offer a hot good dinner since their kitchen has not passed inspection.  Serve up some hamburgers or suptin'!  Anyhoo, I have been there 4 times and I need more than a freaking warmed up frittata to get ever get me in there again.
