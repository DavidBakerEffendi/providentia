This "upscale newcomer" touts local and organic seasonal foods, and has a lot of pretentiousness upon entering the building.   The food was well below decent, and I will not return. The mushroom bruschetta, while tasty, was served fridge-cold, really too cold to enjoy. The skirt steak (at $36) was burnt and bitter, with stale corn bread and chard that was cold and, also, bitter. The super-hyped gnocchi was bubblegum-soft and bland, with cualiflower completely dominating the dish.   Desert (peach-cranberry cobbler) was plain, just decent, but can only be ordered for two. To top it off, the cappuccino looked and tasted like soapy water, and the espresso was cold, flat and tasteless. Both coffees were re-made, with only little improvement. The service was sub-par, pretentious, clumsy. The maitre 'd made us feel unwelcome for being 10 minutes late, repeatedly. The valet-only parking is clearly because they lack sufficient parking spaces. We could hardly get out of the lot. What a shame.
