Waited on line for 30 minutes line went all the way around the whole shop. I don't know about the other sandwiches but get the roast pork with sharp provolone and broccoli rabe. Provolone makes the sandwich don't go there looking for the worlds tastiest pork but all together the sandwich is really good everything balances each other out. Check out the other places there too good pretzels good cookies good ice cream i would live there if i could.
