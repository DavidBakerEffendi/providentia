The food was great, good tapas size to share between two people, amazing wine selection as well. I especially liked the s'mores for dessert. The chairs are a little uncomfortable, no back rest and the tables are low so you are bending over the table, my back was hurting by the end of the night. Would recommend it and I am definitely going back!
