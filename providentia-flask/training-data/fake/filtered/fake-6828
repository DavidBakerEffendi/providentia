meh. i dont know the whole bed stuy do or die thing kind goes out the window when you have a disco ball, tea cup lights, a skull in your crown moulding, and quail the size of a quarter over a dollop of polenta for GREENPOINT PRICES! couldnt really settle on what the vibe of this place is. just had a couple apps and drinks on a weeknight and everything was ok i guess. for those prices i could have balled out somewhere worthwhile. the only thing that really irked me was i only had a dollop of polenta to start and before i got to scoop that up the server came over and lifted the plate up! and said let me get rid of that for you. i know this isnt fine dining but please ask your customers first before putting your hands on the plate. the tartar was ok but they only give you one itsy bitsy little piece of toast with it. sorry guys i know you have good reviews and your trying, again you obviously had some money to throw at the place but it just seems haphazard in some unsettling sort of way. sorry i couldnt speak more on the food or service but when i go out to eat the ambiance and aesthetic has a lot to do with where i spend my money. the only thing salvageable was my date being cute as hell but we could have had a good time anywhere and i think we did next door at the bar with a fireplace in the back? and if your gonna spread love the brooklyn way dont let biggie just trickle out of your speakers. you clearly spent some time to make some speakers in the ceiling wether they work or not i dont care but i shouldnt have to struggle to hear biggie or wu tang coming from somewhere. thats like blasting kenny g or something.
