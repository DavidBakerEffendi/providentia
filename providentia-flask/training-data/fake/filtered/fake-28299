The wife and I finally got around to trying Traif and boy were we blown away !!! We ordered 6 dishes total : BBQ braised short rib sliders with sweet potato fries, jamon iberico on a knot type bread with fresh ricotta, baked muenster cheese, smoked chorizo, golden apples, seared foie gras, Yukon potatoes, bacon, sunny egg, salt & pepper shrimp in a spicy sauce with potatoes and pineapple and strawberry cinnamon glazed Berkshire baby back ribs. The BBQ short rib sliders and sweet potato fries with the smoked paprika aioli were the star of the evening along with the salt & pepper shrimp. We would have undoubtedly doubled the order had we known how great the two dishes were. The Spanish cured ham on the soft knot type bread with fresh ricotta was light and full of flavor. The muenster with bits of chorizo was good and the apples added a refreshing touch. The foie gras was ok but nothing earth shattering and the strawberry glazed Berkshire baby back ribs fell off the bone but were dry. The desert consisting of the bacon doughnuts earned an honorable mention. As a side note, the bartender took a bit longer to make my cocktail so they sent another cocktail to our table and comped it. The pricing was very affordable and the place although smallish was vibrant and super loud. Will definitely return !!!
