The bartender Steve has been rude and arrogant. No eye contact, arms in front of the heart all time, not answering basic questions about the wines on the board, trying to avoid the contact with customers, instead of engaging with them... I wanted to leave, when the manager that I called, was kind enough to move me to another part of the restaurant even if I was alone. She didn't seem though to have decided to take action against him, and she looked almost scared because she said that he was there for long time and untouchable... No more there with that Steve!
