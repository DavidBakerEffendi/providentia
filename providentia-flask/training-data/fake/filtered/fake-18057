Hi, My name Hinoria & I from Japan to write great review about Devil Alley Bar & Girls. First time I come to the Philadelphia city, I stopped in the Devil's Alley very hungry for American like food and pork like foods. I order the bisquit sliders and the pulled pork sandwitch for my wife. So sweet was the sauce and smooth and silky. The pork meat melted in my mouth so warm and tender, like baby bottom=) The bread rolls between the pork & bisquit sliders was also so fresh and so tasty, YUm in my tummy=) this something we not say in Japon. Next, we have ah the slaw. Yes, the coal slaw. Again, very filled with ah the vegetables and sesame seed dressing. Perfect, went like a shock matches a shoe sorta, what I mean is that the slaw compliment perfect the slider rolls. Next, I order the beer on the tap. I think it was a pumkin or squash season beer. Very different that Asahi, but smooth all the same. Kind of hurt my throat a bit, because of the bubbles. Next, I order another beer, something from the city. Maybe called Yards or not, I am not recall properly. This beer kind of make me feel a little sexy. The beer made me very happy & so I kiss my wife right in front of people. I never had the beer make me feel like a little funny in the trouser area. Whatever as you American might say. Who cares right? Next, we ordered a duck quesodilda. I think duck, maybe it was a chicken quesodilda. Still good. Cheese yellow, but taste like milk. This was different to me, the duck with the cheese smashed with onions and peppers. Make me want to drink tequila, but wife said no. I might want to kiss her again... or Â even make baby when we get to hotel later. Ha ha, I say to her. Last I think maybe we ordered the desert plate. Some chocolates. Nice. The waitresus very nice & something little sexy with a smile. Next time I come to the city Philadelphia, i know with or without wife, I come to the Devil's Alley. This time, I drink the tequila and make love to the bar stool.
