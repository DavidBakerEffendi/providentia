This was the first time my wife and I had been to Philadelphia. Amazing town. You can work up an appetite real fast. I had never had a Philly steak sandwich so our first day we went to the Reading Terminal and had one there. I wasn't impressed. We were told before we came to Philly that Sonny's was the place to go. So the next time we ate a Philly steak sandwich we went there. Great sandwich with perfect flavor. The one thing I would do differently, if I were them is, I would put garlic butter on the inside of the bun and brown it on the stove and then add the meat. But that's me. Other than that 2 thumbs up.
