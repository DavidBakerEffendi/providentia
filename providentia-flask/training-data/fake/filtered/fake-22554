I have lived in the area for about 3 years and around northern liberties area the pizza was bland to terrible and the cheesesteaks were nothing to talk. I would go to across town for one, but a new place just opened up 4th street called Del Rossis Cheesesteak  I think they opened  last  week. My friends and I had a large plain pie and 2 cheesesteak one chicken and one steak . I will say that was the best pizza that I have had in a long time and the cheesesteak were also great. I don't review much but its now my new local place to goto ,if they can continue to make food like that they will see me very often.    Excellent
