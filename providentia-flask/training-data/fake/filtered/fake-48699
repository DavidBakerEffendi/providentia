If you haven't been here before... What the hell are you waiting for!!!! I've ordered from here at least a thousand times, especially for those late night snacks. (They are open 24 hours!) I could name my favorite empanadas but it would probably just be the whole list. Even the breakfast empanadas are amazing! The guacamole & chips appetizer is great with fresh jalepenos on top and homemade plantain chips. The prices are affordable. Seating is limited, as it is a really small place but totally worth the wait.
