Absolutely excellent. Went here for a friend's birthday a couple weeks ago. The spicy cherry drink is very intense, but excellent. The pickles were fabulous and the burgers were incredible. I love burgers and these were probably my second favorite to Shake Shack! Service was great, and plus we had a bonus Broadway Star sighting! We actually liked the burgers so much we ordered an extra to split. Go Sweet Afton!
