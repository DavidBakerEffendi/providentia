The food was decent for delivery Chinese and the delivery itself was relatively on-time, but later that night I had the worst food poisoning I've ever had in my life (I'm not sure whether it was the dumplings, General Tso's, or Sweet & Sour Chicken... I sampled all three). Â I'm never ordering from here again.
