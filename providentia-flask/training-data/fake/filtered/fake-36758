Our waitman/server tonight was fabulous and on top of it . Good people watching with shout outs to Chris, an adorable waiter with an eye on our drinks till the end of the night, a true rarity in North Philly. Thanks for the great friendly service from the Experiment ;-) Much appreciated, till next time!
