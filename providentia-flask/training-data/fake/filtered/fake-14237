Ate at sWine tonight with some friends.  Without a doubt the best new restaurant in NYC.  The menu, the service, the food and the atmosphere were all worth the trip.  Even if you're not a big wine drinker, the menu alone - potato chip nachos, the burger, and the chocolate peanut butter mousse - is worth coming to this jewel of a restaurant.  I came on the early side which was a good thing because by 8 pm the crowd was growing in earnest.  The sooner you make it to sWine the better, because it isn't going to get any easier.  Then again, it will be worth the wait.
