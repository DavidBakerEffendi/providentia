I had little problem this morning around Lunch time I always liked the service but for  some reason today 9-1-14 i asked the server for turon but she told me it was not ready . Behind her was 2 tray of turon so I walk away then came back to the store its about 85 degrees and humid I ask the lady in front of the register to order the turon but she told me to don't get mad at her. she told me that the turon is to hot so I reply so you mean that  all the food you serve is hot also . I will still go but needs improve only 1 person serving 6 people .
