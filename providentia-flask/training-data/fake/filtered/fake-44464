Went this past Friday and had a table for five.  Was told before we ordered our three beers that there was a 10 minute "freeze" on drinks and they we would have to wait for beer.  Whatever.  Then we got our beers - one five minutes later, one ten minutes later, and the last easily 20+ minutes later.  Layout is terrible with no separation between bar and restaurant resulting in a ridiculously loud and cramped experience.  Food is overpriced and sub-par ($12 for skimpy serving of Irish Nachos with cheese). Was pretty excited to try this place out but was definitely disappointed.  Looks like I'll be sticking to the Half Door and Corner Pug.
