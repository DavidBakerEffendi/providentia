Geno's sucks so bad it is an embarrassment to food.  The only steak worse is Pat's.  I mean other steaks stink in the city but these two are supposed to be the king pings and they honestly stink!  Eat your sneaker before buying a steak; or for God's sake get a burrito or a snickers?  Save yourself and do #2 Tony Luke's - Everything he sells is fabulous.  Want the best period...Joes aka the old Ch!nks.  3rd banana is Steve's prince of steaks and in fourth is Dalessandro's in Roxborough!
