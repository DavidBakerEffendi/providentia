Can't wait to go back! The crab bisque was wonderful..Fish and chips fabulous. Huge portions. My friend had a pastrami sandwich. The pastrami is cooked on site. She said it was the best pastrami she's ever had. Lean, tender, and delicious. The staff was friendly, and efficient. We can't wait to go back. Thank you!
