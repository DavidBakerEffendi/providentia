One of the Top three worst evenings at a restaurant in my life.   The music was too loud and NOT appetizing.  We asked for it to be lowered but this did not happen. We waited 20 minutes for menus. They had run out of bread.  They ran out of meat one of my guests wanted.  The kitchen had no cream but served the lobster al fresco pasta anyway (did they think we would not notice). The wait staff must not have any training as they did not attend table or even do basics like cheese for pasta or  "would you like coffee?" When we questioned the "manager" he got defensive and thought excuses would work.  NOT. Poor ordering and bad management are not the guest's problem. I give the restaurant an estimate of closed before Christmas.
