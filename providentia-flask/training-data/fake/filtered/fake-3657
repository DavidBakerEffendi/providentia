Fabulous! I flew in from San Antonio to celebrate my son's birthday with his girlfriend and him. We started the evening of Oct 10 with dinner at BC. Jess and David had enjoyed the Fried Chicken and Cheddar Waffles so I ordered them.  Dining Al Fresco, hospitable and attentive server, and delicious food. The Butternut Squash Soup was wonderful! Definitely go and enjoy the Monday Menu!  Great everything, even the price. Can't wait to enjoy BC again soon!
