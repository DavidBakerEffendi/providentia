Good NY pizza slices and apple cranberry salad. Table and bar service was great. Food came faster than I expected. Server was friendly and helpful. Beer selection was strong. I had a local ipa that I didnt care for but I appreciated the selection. I would definitely return when in mood for easy atmosphere with good 'za and deep drink menu.
