Had a business lunch here not too long ago. excellent italian food.   Everything is home made and the owner/chef takes a personal hand in everything.  Love the personal service they add too from the host checking in on you to the chef coming after the meal to make sure the food was ok.   This kind of detail goes a long way for me because all restaurants will have have they're occasional off nights, when you might get a bad meal to bad waiter.  But this shows me that they're at least on site trying to offer a nice experience.   Great neighborhood family friendly place !!
