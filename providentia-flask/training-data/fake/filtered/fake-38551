I knew that it was a poor choice to come here for lunch before we walked in the door. I wanted to go to Olives down the street and sit outside, but unfortunately my group thought otherwise. I felt the food would be overpriced, mediocre at best, and way overrated. It definitely lived up to my (low) expectations. The food was bland and unappetizing. The server was slow and had an attitude. The bill without tip was over $70 for 3 people at lunch. I want my money back! The only positive I have to say is that they have a nice (but overpriced) beer selection, but you can easily get this at other better establishments close by. I will never come back here!
