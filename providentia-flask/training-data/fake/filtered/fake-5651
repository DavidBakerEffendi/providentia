Went out for an early Valentine's Day dinner and was not disappointed.  My wife and I celebrated our engagement at the original location almost 20 years ago so this was a big trip down memory lane for us. We had reservations; however, our table was not ready.  The staff was apologetic and we were seated after a short wait.  The service was excellent.  Our server was very attentive and did an excellent job answering our menu questions. Had an awesome shrimp appetizer off their specials list that evening.  A bit pricey - $13.00 for 3 shrimp, but the vodka blush sauce they were in was amazing! Decent bread served while we were waiting.  Refilled without asking as well.  Salads are a bit small, but the dressing and shaved cheese on them were very tasty. Wife had the chicken sorrentino and I had the steak fiorentina - both were very good.  Came with a bowl of pencil points - the gravy was yummy.  The steak was served with fresh chips - a bit odd and very salty. For dessert we had the ricotta cheese cake and the chocolate lava cake.   All-in-all an excellent night out.  We were very pleased.
