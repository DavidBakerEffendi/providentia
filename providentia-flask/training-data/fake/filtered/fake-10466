This is probably the best decorated restaurant I've been to in NYC. If you enjoy atmosphere, it is a reason to go out of your way. The food was delicious, authentic and with fresh ingredients. I ordered without looking at the menu because it was my first time and I like to gauge my Thai restaurants with spring rolls and Pad Kee Mao. Delicious. It was authentically spicy and portioned nicely. The spring rolls were also amazing. My favorite part was the service. They were all attentive and genuinely nice, which is a refreshing alternative to other places. We had their homemade ice cream for dessert, and I was full and happy by the end of the experience. It was pretty busy on a Friday night, but not once did we have to seek out a server for anything. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
