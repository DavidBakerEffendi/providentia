Although I have never before written a restaurant review, I felt compelled to warn others of the truth about this terribly rude establishment. We tried to order takeout on a busy Friday night, the lamb shawarma platter and a chicken shawarma sandwich. They informed us that the wait would be around 20 minutes, and we sat on an empty table in the back. After more than half an hour had passed, a large group came in, and they asked us to stand so that they may seat the group. We asked how much longer our food would take. We did not receive a response from 2 waiters. The last waiter simply told us that it would take 2-3 minutes without bothering to even inquire from the kitchen. Two people who arrived after us had already gotten their orders, while we didn't have so much as an apology for the delay. After 40 minutes of waiting, one of the male waiters rudely told us to wait outside of the restaurant on the first cold day of the year so he could better obsequiously cater to his tipping customers. We left feeling like unwelcome solicitors, rather than paying customers. Don't come here unless you want to be treated like shit.
