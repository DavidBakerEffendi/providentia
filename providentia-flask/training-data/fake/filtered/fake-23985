Bottom line - excellent food, horrific service. We made a reservation for a group of 6 and were sat immediately. The setting is nice, but if you go I would recommend sitting outside (weather permitting). While we were there the restaurant was about 75% full. Our main complaint is the service. The waiter was unfriendly and unhelpful. That may be because with 6 people, gratuity is included. We made it clear that we had not been there before, and he offered no suggestions with food or wine. He came back to the table very infrequently which required calling people to the table for refills, bread, etc. During our main courses, 2 plates came out and then we waited 15 min for the remainder of the food to arrive. This is some of the worst service I have received in any of Philly's many restaurants. The upside is the charming setting and excellent food. With a group you can sample a lot of the menu if willing to share. The portion sizes for primi and secondi are entree size. If you have appetizer and one entree, you won't feel gorged but will feel satisfied. Apps - Â I would skip the famed fried olives and try something else - just ok. Definitely order the Affettati misti - a sampler of their cured meats. It is absolutely delicious (particularly the spreadable salami). Primi - Taccozzelle all'aquilana - pork stuffed pasta - the hit of the night, absolutely delicious Maccheroni alla mugnaia - the single strand pasta - quite spicy, a little plain Gnocchi affumicati - the second best of the night - surprisingly smoky but excellent Tagliatelle al sugo di coniglio - melt in your mouth pasta with a rich rabbit ragu Secondi Polentone - creamy polenta with a fantastic giant meatball and savory sauce Brodetto - seafood stew, can't really mess this up, pretty good We may try again because the food was great. But hopefully the service is better.
