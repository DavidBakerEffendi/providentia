Can only comment on the management service as we left after 2 hours of waiting. The owner or manager was extremely rude and doesn't know the first thing about service. After 2 hrs he told us it would only be another 15 minutes. Ten minutes later he pushed it to another hour. He wasn't apologetic at all and basically encouraged us to leave. We were extremely patient until that point. Warning: They do not accept reservations and Dont even think about a large group on a Saturday night. Â People are literally standing on both sides of a stair case waiting until they get called. So overcrowded while you wait that I'm sure it's a fire hazard. But hey, if you ever get seated I'm sure the food is food.
