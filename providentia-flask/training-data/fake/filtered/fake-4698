We where excited to try this new spot for our wedding aniversary.  We arrived and where told there would be a 30 minute  wait. This was not a problem, however we waitedvanotherbten to  be approached by  the bartender. One we received our drinks we waited and watched several other groups get seated that where there before us. Still there was no problem, we watched as a table for 2 was cleared we  believed this would be our table , since there was no one else waiting to be seated.  At this point za couple walked in and began talking to the hostess and another staff member, another patron came out  they apparently knew this couple. Surprisingly they where. Brought right over to the table that we thought was ours.  Not two minutes later the hostes walked over to explain  that our table would be ready soon.  I have never witnessed such poor professionalism in a resteraunt , when we confronted her she couldn't even deny what had happened. We got up and left.  I will never return, it's a shame because I heard good things.
