Sanfords is amazing - both before and after the renovations.  All the staff came back (which really says a thing or two) and thankfully they did, as I ALWAYS find them very helpful. The food is here is amazing - Brunch Rocks - 2 drinks + a tea or coffee + your meal!  I had the mesquite chicken salad and my husband had the butternut squash ravioli - both came out in a timely fashion, considering it was packed with people and the fact that they just reopened! The owner said they are now back to normal menu and guess what - THEY TAKE CREDIT CARDS NOW!!!!!YAY!!! The Wines here are amazing and they have some great imported bottled beer too.  They serve breakfast all day and they still have that delicious chicken orzo!!! I give it a thumbs up and 5 stars -  GO THERE - HAVE FUN!!!
