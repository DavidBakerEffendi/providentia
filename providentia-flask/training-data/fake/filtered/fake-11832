The food was good but still not better than carmines and the portions were smaller for the same price. The customer service was awful though. There was an app and entree special that he kept trybg to push on us even though we said no. We said we wanted a lemon butter sauce over linguine. He told us the kitchen would be mad at him?!?! He also said they didn't have any lemon butter sauce. My mom asked what was the chicken Cacciatore. He couldn't lie so of course he said lemon butter. Then he said he would put the order into the kitchen and if they didn't say anything then it was fine!? Then he came back and said it was okay. Of course it is bc its on your menu. Off if they get extra for pushing specials but no means no.
