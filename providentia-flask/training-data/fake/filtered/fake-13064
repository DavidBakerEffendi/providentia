For brunch  the food is absolutely delicious - the green eggs are so good and such a unique, fresh spin on breakfast eggs. Everything tastes so fresh, and the serving size is filling. The brunch comes with a breakfast cocktail and coffee as well.  There is usually enough room to accomodate small groups, and you never have to wait too long. The atmosphereis nice and cozy/rustic , although there is no outdoor seating, which is always nice in the spring/summer.  The dinner food has always been very good too, but my brunch memories  stand out the most.
