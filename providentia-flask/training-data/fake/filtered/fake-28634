I don't understand why some people are so negative about a place that just opened a few weeks ago! I am a lifetime Yardley resident and I personally am excited that we have a place now that isn't the Continental (even though I love the Conti) and doesn't serve pizza or Chinese food. It's something authentic and lovely and the food and service were great. I plan to go back many times. I am happy to support and lift the spirits of local hard working businesses, not put them down for every little thing that goes wrong. We had a great dining experience. It was a very pretty place and the food was great and the servers were helpful and friendly and this little gem is a great addition to a Main St of a town that has consisted of pizza places and realtors for ,y whole lifetime. Best of luck to them! I hope they will be around for a log time.
