Went for the New Year's Buffet. What a joke! The buffet was $30 per person and so, so not worth the price. The whole experience was just wrong. First of all we had to take a shifty elevator up to the second floor, together with the frantic servers and bus boys. Then, the food was right there, in a small alcove right in front of the elevator! Upon getting off the elevator, we bumped into a few patrons who were getting the buffet food, because the space was very narrow and awkward. Then, I noticed one of the bus boys sneaking some of the food off the buffet and earing desperately, huddled by the elevator. The food itself was cold; the flimsy little serving tray warmers were not sufficient to ward off the cold air people were bringing in via the elevator. Honestly, the presentation of the food itself in that buffet looked like a make-shift continental style buffet you see at those hotel training seminars. I can only say that the food, had it not been cold, was actually quite good. Very good food. To add to the experience, somehow Champagne was sold only by the bottle, their Chai tea was all 'out' at 9pm. And the waitress we had was so busy that we were long done eating before she came back to bring our Coke, and tell me that Chai was all out and they were done making it for the night. I must have had high expectations, because even d√©cor upstairs seemed drab and a little creepy. There was no artwork no the walls, our table was one of the outdoor ones. I kept hitting my shin on a metal bar underneath. I can tell you, honestly, that was one miserable experience for the both of us. And the final bill of $79 was absolutely a slap in the face.
