Got a groupon (or was it living social?) for this place and thought I'd give it a try. The food was overall bland and uninteresting. It struck me as the type of place that might want to please people who may not really like Indian food. Any flavor was overpowered by salt in both of our dishes, both vegetarian. We ordered 2 appetizers, they completely forgot to bring one, and the samosas were average at best. They also brought me the wrong main course. They offered to make the correct dish, but I didn't want to wait while my friend ate their meal, it was still a vegetarian dish so I just settled for it. The decor is over the top for the lack of quality food. There are many authentic Indian restaurants in the area that are much much better.
