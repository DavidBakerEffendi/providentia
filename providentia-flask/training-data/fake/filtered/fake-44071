After frequenting this restaurant multiple times, a couple of these other reviews definitely surprise me. We ate there this past weekend, and it was once again EXCELLENT. We started with the calamari and also took the suggestion from the waitress for their buffalo wings. Both were delicious, but their wing sauce was outstanding. Next we decided to try their traditional pizza, which was definitely one of the best ive had on the island. Our waitress was extremely attentive and friendly, as was the bartender, who served us a drink before we decided to sit down. All in all it was yet again a great experience, and we will definitely continue to keep going back!
