The food was fairly decent. The owner is what brings the place down. She's is very miserable and is not willing to have a younger crowd at the bar. She always kicks people out when god forbid, they get a little loud. It's sad that her husband, the Irish bartender cheats on her with one of the servers. There have been numerous times where I've seen him act inappropriately after she has left the restaurant. I guess she's getting what she deserves!
