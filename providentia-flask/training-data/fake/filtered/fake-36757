I'm sorry, are you NOT looking for an amazing burger and thick boozey milkshakes that make your mouth water just thinking about them? Well too bad, because that's what PYT prepares and prepares well. I've had: -Baby Burgers - perfect amount of food if you just want a little something-something. The dipping sauce for them, rules. Tangy and spicy, but not overpowering. -"Plain Ol' Cheeseburger", phenomenal. -Onion Rings, probably best in the city. -PYT Burger - *drools* -Serious Grilled Cheese - heartbreakingly good. i miss you. -PYT Dog - definitely a delicious version of a chili cheese dog. -Fries - freshly made! (NOT frozen. I'm looking at you SS) Beverages: -Strongbow. Huge props on service. NEVER has anyone offered a glass full of ice with the can. This is the proper way to enjoy Strongbow. Ask the folks across the ocean. -John Valdez. Not a coffee drinker, but this coffee flavored ice cream, boozey shake hit the spot when i had it. -Jack Rabbit Slim. If you're no secure enough in your masculinity to get over having sprinkles and a cherry on top of your shake. Order something else. I, however, will be ordering this every chance I get. *high five As far as the crowd goes, show up with friends and have fun. That's what everyone else is there to do. You can't go there with an overcritical mind and be so damn serious. Loosen up folks. I was seated and eating within 30 minutes on a BUSY saturday (8/15/09). Be patient and enjoy having a very polite and easy-breezey staff to help you get what you want. My one critique. Hostess should be at the opening of the rope/barrier. I think that would help on the clutter of people searching for her and causing traffic by the door when it gets crazy busy. Oh and Tommy, put my Billy Idol CD in the jukebox please. thanks :)
