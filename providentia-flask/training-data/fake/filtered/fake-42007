I placed an online order through their official website, not Grubhub, for about $14.  When I called up to inform them I had been waiting for an hour and a half & to inquire about the status of my order I was told it was on the way and received a slight apology.  My order arrived at the two-hour mark to the minute, at which point the food was cold.  Two hours for a sandwich & an appetizer.  Unfortunately, this isn't the first time I've had issues ordering from Goodfellas.  About a year ago I placed an order online & paid in advance with a credit card.  In hindsight paying in advance was a mistake because I looked out the window to see a car pulling out of the driveway & a bag on my porch.  Sure enough it was the food I ordered.  When I called to complain I was told it would be handled and that I would receive a call back to be 'taken care of.'  I never received said call.  These two incidents are without a doubt by far the worst delivery experiences I have ever had.  It's a shame because I do enjoy the food (when it's not cold) but I can't justify putting up with the subpar service any longer.
