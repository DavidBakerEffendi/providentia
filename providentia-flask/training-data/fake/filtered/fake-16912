My boyfriend and I have been coming here consistently almost every weekend for a year now and have only on occasion been anything less than totally satisfied.  The service is always quick, the hostess is awesome and the food is great.  He usually gets the lox with potato pancakes and he absolutely loves it.  They also have one of the best cappuccino's in the city.
