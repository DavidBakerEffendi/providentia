Delicious, delicious pizza. Tuesday evenings are a great time to walk right in and grab a seat. Only complaint is don't try and sneak gratuity in on the bill without telling me. This is BS, and not everyone who eats their is a tourist. Don't assume that I'm a tourist. I'm local and would have given a bigger tip, but you decided to add your own to my bill. Glad I checked the bill twice and inquired what some strange scratch marks were with a cost associated with them. Love the pizza!
