This is one of my favorite restaurants.  I live only a couple blocks from the place, and although my friends and I are regular Manhattan diners, it's such a pleasure having a place like this so close to home.  I've taken my out-of-town family and friends here on a couple occasions and they always have a great experience.   The atmosphere is great... I don't think there's a single object in the place that is younger 50 years old.  Everyone I take here for the first time say they feel like they're in a movie or something (think Gangs of NY meets Edward Scissor Hands, meets Amélie).  It's definitely got a vibe, but it doesn't feel like one of those super contrived atmospheres.  The music is always nice (though sometimes a bit too loud for conversation) and is complemented with the Subway noise overhead which gives it a real old-NY kind of feel.   Dishes to try:  I've been here for both brunch and dinner on numerous occasions.  For brunch, my roommate and I always share the grilled doughnuts to start out with cappuccinos, then the baked eggs in ham is a must.. so delicious.  For dinner, the seasonal artichoke with saffron aioli is usually amazing (though I did once have a tough artichoke there), herbed chicken is great, as well as the mac and cheese.  For dessert the bread budding with toffee drizzle (i think that's right?) is wonderful! Service is usually pretty good.. friendly, not too in your face, but sometimes a little absent.  It's not one of those places to go to if you're in a rush.  But, if you're looking for a delicious, slow dinner with some close friends, good music and cool atmosphere, I highly recommend it!
