Went last Sunday with my girlfriend. Food was mediocre. We ordered off the "happy hour menu" she got a bloody mary and I got a couple beers.  Waitress was nice enough to add $2 for better vodka without asking my girlfriend.  The waitress seemed upset when I asked about it and took off the $2 by applying the happy hour food specials we should have already received.  We were in a little but of a hurry so I didn't really want to deal with complaining. We don't live in Philly but have friends who do.  There are just too many good bars in the area to choose Macs Tavern.
