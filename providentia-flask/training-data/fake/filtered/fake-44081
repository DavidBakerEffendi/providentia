A hidden jewel in downtown Glastonbury for a catered party.   I hosted a 50th birthday party at Pazzo's in Glastonbury on a Saturday night and the event was flawless.  Linda and Tony were superb and the rest of the staff was extremely professional and very helpful. Their back room is wonderful to put up to 50 people together for any event.  They were very accommodating to us for setting up decorations and some AV equipment. Prices were very reasonable and I received a number of complements, from guests at the party, that the food was great.  I chose the Banquet II menu which had plenty of choices of great options for all the guests.  (Especially the Short ribs!!!) Tony let a few people in early to set things up before guests arrived.  He was great. The staff and servers were always available, accommodating, and the food was brought out timely and they were almost invisible, unless you needed them.  Very professional. We had a couple more guests than we expected, but Tony and the staff jumped on it and made it work without a fuss. We had the room for the night and felt no time pressure.  The event started at 5pm and went until we were ready to go, about 9:30pm. We searched a number of venues in the area to host this event and there is no doubt that this was the best choice.  Other places have $1500 to $2000 minimum charges with 2-3 hour time limits and not as accommodating.  That is why this staff, the food, the options and the atmosphere makes this a jewel to consider.
