My wife and I had an experience at this establishment very recently that is just something we will never forget...........and that is in the worse way possible.  Luli, one of the owners, is an outright disgrace to the restaurant/hospitality industry and has absolutely no business being involved with it in any capacity.  To make a long story short, the restaurant was given multiple chances to prepare a simple plate correctly, which they were just completely incapable of.  And instead of making it right, Luli went to the lowest level that any human being ever could.  When I mentioned I was still unhappy with the product, Luli took it upon herself to literally rip the plate away from my wife that she was actually eating from at that exact moment.  Please note:  I was the one that had an issue with my dinner.....not my wife!!  At first, we honestly were in complete shock.  Then after about 20 seconds of back and forth with Luli, we realized she is an absolutely creep.   Stay away from BlueCat........they can't cook and the owner is a disgrace.  There are so many quality restaurants in Fairmount.  BlueCat is not one of them.
