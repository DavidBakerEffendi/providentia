This long-time once cool upper westsider never had great food -- plenty of over-priced "nouevelle" takes on traditional Latino dishes that were good enough, with an upbeat environment.  Service was never brilliant.  We live nearby and just revisited Calle Ocho tonite for the first time in several years -- and wish we hadn't.  It's still over-priced for what it is -- but the food is a horror show -- it ranges from insipid to downright awful and between our party we tried 10 dishes -- and couldn't wait to get the check and leave (and we are huge Latin food fans).   Calle Ocho's location in the Hotel Excelsior guarantees it a steady flow of tourists who think they're eating something exotic -- and locals whose palates seem to be conditioned by god only knows what.  AVOID.
