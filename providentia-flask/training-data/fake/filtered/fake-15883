I am the previous chef at Keeper's, so I could be biased in any number of different ways, but my family and I had a great meal at the new Keepers (it changed ownership on Nov.8, 2010).  Very solid food, I'll be back soon to try some of Chris' blackboard specials!  My son loved the poached quail egg on top of his Pastrami sandwich.  Fun!
