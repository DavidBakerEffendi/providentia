I love this place, and I have since I first moved into the area. I've had several of the very eclectic sandwiches like the turkey and brie and the crab quiche is SO good. A nice iced coffee and I love the fresh teas. When I first moved here in 2009 I'd come in and stay all day long. The chairs are great and I've had a few business meetings here. I only saw it crowded around midterm\final times. To everyone complaining about the time, last year I had no internet at home and I would show up at about 10am and leave there at 8 or 9pm. They'd host these late night movies too, but not too many people ever showed up. They didn't care cause I'd buy lunch and dinner there and drink tea while doing all my work. Only problem? I was the only person there at 8pm pretty frequently, so they shortened the hours. We're in a recession here people and 1 customer for 3 hours with 2-3 baristas working is not profitable. I still stop by time to time for a sandwich or meet people there.
