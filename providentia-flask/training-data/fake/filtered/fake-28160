I LOVE this place!  It is my favorite place to go in New York.  The music is great, the decor is nice, and the waitstaff is friendly.  You never have to wait for a table early in the day, but it gets crowded (and a bit loud) on the weekends.  I would recommend waiting for a table, it is well worth it.   This place is perfect whether you're going to lunch with friends, or out for a romantic dinner.
