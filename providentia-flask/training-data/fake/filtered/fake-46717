Monday, I was in this restaurant with my Mother for the first time to try Filipino Food. The waitress that was assigned to our table is so eager to take our order- she bombarded us with the "Specials" that we cannot understand what she's talking about,  I asked her to show me in the Menu if it's listed? with that she won't entertain to comply and gave  me a lingo that is not appropriate for anyone to experience in a place of dining- I was offended and lost my interest to dine with that we left the place disappointed.  Not all Restaurants in NYC and it's suburbs do not have their Specials excluded in their Menu, most New Yorkers don't just dine in anywhere without knowing what they will be served. To add as I quote this rude waitress " sorry, if I offended you...it's a Monday Thing"
