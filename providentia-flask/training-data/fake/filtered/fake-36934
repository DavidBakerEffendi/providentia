Hands down the best restaurant in Bay Ridge, and highly competitive with most other trendy Brooklyn spots like Cobble Hill and Park Slope. The restaurant is quaint, less than 30 seats I believe, and if it wasn't for the huge Key Food banners on the street, you just might miss it. The food is amazing. I've never walked out without being satisfied and impressed. How could this petit little cafe create such amazing food--in Bay Ridge?! And what a value! $35 for three courses. The menu is seasonal and changes at least once a quarter. One of their staples is the bread pudding with salted caramel. GET IT. Kat and Nicole, the owners are wonderful people. We've gotten to know them over time and if we stay away from Petit Oven for too long, it's almost like neglecting a good friend. One note to diners: as mentioned in some other reviews, the service can be a bit slow, especially on a busy Friday or Saturday night. But think about it, one chef (and a helper I think) serving nearly 30 people continuously. Could you do that and be speedy? You might wait a few more minutes than expected between courses, but that allows for better conversation on a romantic date. And guaranteed, that extra time makes every dish perfect, delicious and filled with love.
