took my wife here to celebrate her birthday.  saw a "B" right by the window just before entering.  let's hope it was for structural damage to the property and had nothing to do with the food. everyone was very courteous to us which is always nice.  bread basket had stromboli in it which was a pleasant surprise.  made the mistake of eating almost all the bread which didn't leave much room for the entire meal! :(   wifey had the polenta with mushrooms and i had the braised short ribs to start.  the polenta was great and my short ribs were cooked perfectly.  couldn't say the same for the risotto underneath it though but still very good.  in my opinion, my short ribs were just the right amount for an appetizer but both my wife and i felt that the polenta was too filling for a starter. my wife ordered the duck and foie gras ravioli.  i think she enjoyed the first few bites but after a while the saltiness just became overpowering.  i had the spaghetti and i must say, just for a plain no thrills dish, it was very delicious.  sometimes it is just the simple things that are the best tasting.   at this point we were both so full that we were almost unable to finish our main entree, the branzino with cauliflower which we shared.  the fish was cooked just the way i like it ... crispy skin on top and buttery fillet underneath complimented nicely by the sauteed cauliflower.  very well done.   i'll always have room for dessert so i ordered the coconut panna cotta.  it was yummy! coconut and guava go well together ... a great way to finish off a satisfying meal. i would give this place 5 stars but that would mean that it would be on par with my favorite italian restaurant, marea. but unfortunately, imho, marea blows this place out of the water.
