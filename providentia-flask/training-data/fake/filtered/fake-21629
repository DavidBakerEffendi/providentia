This was my third visit here. The first was a group event.. The second was a dinner for two on a gift certificate. I received a birthday promotion for an appetizer so I decided to take my family for dinner. I also noticed this restaurant was part of "restaurant.com" so I purchased a $50 certificate. Let me start by saying that the food was excellent! Paying extra for top quality food is never a problem. However the service was terrible. On a relatively slow Thursday evening waiting ten minutes to get menus and another ten minutes to get a bottle of wine (the first two were out of stock) is unacceptable. The prepared to order appetizers and entrees should take time but not beverages, desserts or coffee. The handwritten bill was difficult to read and interpret. It also became a choice between the birthday gift appetizer or the restaurant.com certificate. I chose the $50 certificate. This requires cash payment. Since I did not have $350 in cash I reverted to the free appetizer. Taking no chances at this point the waiter built in his gratuity and then promptly left the premises. We were left to handle a pricing error with a different person who was courteous and helpful in refunding with cash the difference which had already been charged to my credit card. All things considered I don't think we will return here or recommend it to our friends. Excellent food cannot always trump poor service. There are too many other good restaurants in the immediate vicinity.
