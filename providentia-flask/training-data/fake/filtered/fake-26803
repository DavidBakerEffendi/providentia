Wayyy too salty! All I could taste was salt. I am from Texas and this place is not good Mexican- not even close. I ate it for dinner tonight and am still feeling sick that I ate it since I was so hungry. The chicken was charred. The chips full of salt- I could actually scrape it off with my fingers. That is wrong! The carnitas were way too salty too- that is all i could taste when i bite into them. Too bad I had high hopes after the reviews. If you like junk food that is not that cheap go here. Cafe Habana, Calexico cart and La Esquina are way better than this place.
