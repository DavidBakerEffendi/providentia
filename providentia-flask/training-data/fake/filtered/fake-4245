Okay..so maybe it's not "authentic" Mexican food. It is, however, good food! I visit quite regularly and find that the food is consistent and very reasonably priced. I have my favorites but have mistakenly deviated to the specials menu before, only to be very disappointed. That being said, stay away from the specials and you should come out feeling like you had a decent meal at a decent price. The "Durango" is good, and so is the Vegetarian combo.
