Holy shhhhhh! All I have to say is tender, flaky biscuit with a massive, honking prime piece of boneless fried chicken breast slathered in honey butter sauce and complimented with Frank's red hot for an amateur kick. So damn good. All I have to say part 2 is the Pecan/Fresh Peach short stack of moist, fluffy pancakes with pats of melting butter and sumptuous syrup running down the sides. Killed, massacred, pillaged and consumpted...if that's even a word. This pic (if not here, in my profile cache) is proof that my friend Planet Pea actually exists, and my lovely gf appears as his blurry lunch companion. Apologies for my food coma camera skills. Go here. Tasty as...shut your mouth.
