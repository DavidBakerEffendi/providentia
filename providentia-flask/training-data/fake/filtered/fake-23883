The food at Brigid's is the best it has been in at least 10 years.  I have been there twice since management changed.  The food is delicious.  I've eaten at the bar there both times.  ON each occasion, the bartender served my food with no silverware.  By tthe time, he finally brought silverware, my appetizer was no longer hot.  It seems to me that if a customer orders food, one of the first things a server, in this case the bartender would do is place a set up (utensils wrapped in a napkin) in front of the customers.  The food is truly delicious; however, the next time I go I'll ask to sit in the dining room
