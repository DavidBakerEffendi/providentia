We live close to Keeper's Cafe, have been patronizing it regularly for several years, and it has been our favorite especially since Chris Loucka, the chef and owner, took it over about two years ago. Chris' background includes time in Key West, and he has a special touch for seafood. I have dined at some of the best and most well-known restaurants, and Keeper's is on a par with any of them. Over the years, I have had the best grilled grouper, swordfish, and salmon I have had anywhere. I had the grouper over a year ago and I still remember it - perfectly saut√©ed, served over creamy celeriac with an amazing fish fume. The tuna - grilled just right - and the scallops ... whatever the seafood special is the night you are there, have it - you won't regret it. This spring, Chris has shown that he can do the same amazing things with fowl as he can with fish. I had the single best roasted rock hen of my life a month ago: perfectly cooked, juicy, stuffed with a couple of garlic heads, and rubbed with herbes de Provence ... simple but magnificent. And this past Thursday I had about the best thing I have ever eaten anywhere - the duck a l'orange. A half of a large duckling, completely boned, crispy delicious and sinful skin ... just fantastic. And every bit as good as the duck was the soup de poisson - rich, complex, just spicy enough. Outstanding. So ... if you are in the area of Woodstock, Vermont and you're wondering if the 20 minute drive south on Rte 106 to Reading is worth it, do it. This place is a gem. One word of caution: get there on the early side so that you order before they run out of the specials - whatever it is the night you're there, you won't be disappointed. Keeper's would get five stars anywhere, not just in the upper Connecticut River Valley. We are so lucky to have Chris nearby and want to keep him, Gosia, and CJ here for a long, long time.
