Classic 80's Soul smooth grooves, $25 brunch, decent menu, a/c & or breeze blowing through the restaurant, sunny front seating, garden atrium rear seating, reservations preferred... and this is on Saturday afternoon. SoCo is the perfect slice of peach cobbler in a pastry display. Ladies delight and a mans pleasure.
