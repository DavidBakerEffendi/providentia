This bar is not what it once was. I've been going to Tattooed Mom's for ten years.  It used to be a crowded, kind of divey place where you could get some cheap vegetarian food.  Now it's an overpriced waste of time.  In the last year, the prices have shot up and with the same shitty, arrogant waitstaff, it's not worth it.  You can get much better food for less money and less attitude elsewhere.   My cheese fries were $5, came out cold, and had less than a spoonful of cheese stuck on top.  $7 for a shitty veg chicken patty on a bun?  You've got to be kidding me.  Plus I have to practically stand on my table to get the server to even glance in my direction.  C'mon.  There's so many other places to go around here, why bother with this place?
