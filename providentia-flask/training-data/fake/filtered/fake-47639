I can't say much about Grimaldi's that hasn't already been said. I finally tried it after being a native New Yorker for most of my life. I guess I stayed away because it was known as a tourist destination. But a friend was in town and I agreed to trek out there. I have to say that the trek was part of the fun. We took the subway and then walked the rest of the toward the water. Yes there was a line and we waited close to an hour at 3pm in the afternoon but we eventually made it iside and the pizza really did live up to the hype. Simply delicious and loved the thin crust. Â  After the meal we walked back to Manhattan over the Brooklyn Bridge to work off the calories. It's a nice afternoon thing to do on a leisure day and I'd recommend it to anyone.
