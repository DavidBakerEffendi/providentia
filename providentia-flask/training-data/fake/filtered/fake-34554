My husband and I were married here in 2007. We couldn't have asked for a more perfect wedding! The room we stayed in was amazing!  The food was amazing!! The atmosphere of this place is so relaxed and romantic we couldn't help but enjoy ourselves. Our parents and siblings met us up there and stayed in rooms in the wings at the back of the house.   The room we rented out for the ceremony and dinner was gorgeous.  It had a beautiful stone fireplace perfect for pictures. We were married in February and everything was covered in a fresh coat of snow adding to the beauty of our wedding photos. I can only imagine the beauty of this place during the other seasons. I hope to return here someday soon. If you are looking for a beautiful, romantic place to have a small intimate wedding this is the place!   I also think this is the perfect place to go for a romantic weekend!
