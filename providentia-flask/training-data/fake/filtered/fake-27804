This is a response to JP's review. I was your server that evening and would like to clarify a few things. First, your bill was around 70 dollars of which you gave me 30 in cash and a credit card towards the rest. I spaced out and ran the entire amount on the card. You and your date graciously pointed out my mistake and I deleted the erroneous transaction and corrected it. Upon checking the POS/credit system from that night, only the correct amount was charged. What happens alot with debit cards is that the credit company uses what is called an authorization hold on purchases made at gas stations and restaurants. This means that 20% over the bill is kept as a pending transaction for up to 2 business days. Only the actual amount is charged in the end. What I think happened is that you must have seen this authorization hold and thought I was overcharging you. As for my behavior that night, I was shocked to see what you wrote. Neither my co-workers or manager saw anything that amounted to bad behavior. I remember coming several times to your table to wrap things up and make more room. I have been working full-time in the service industry for close to 7 years and have never had such a false accusation made against me. I would appreciate if you removed your comments as you were neither mistreatred or mischarged. Sincerely, Niall McMahon
