Dinner there last night w/ my wife.  Very good burger.  Not the best burger I've ever had, but we paid for the dinner (including a 30% tip) the same that we paid in tip, at the best burger I've ever had (Minetta Tavern). So, it's an excellent bargain.  The atmosphere is neighborhood bar.  The service is solid (bartender triples as cook and server). Aside from the excellent food (loved the burger and the onion rings), it is VERY convenient to Newark Airport.  It's on the way back to the bridge, so it was easy to get to from the airport, easy to back onto the NJTP, and an overall very positive experience, I hope to do again soon. One thing, though.  It's been nearly 17 hours since I ate there, and I'm only now beginning to think about food again.  One burger and a half portion of onion rings and a beer was a big meal.  The burger was huge and the onion ring portion was huger. Update:  I've got this jones for burgers, and the next night I went to J.G. Melon, in Manhattan.  The Krug burger was roughly a million times better.  No kidding.  JG wasn't bad, but Krug was excellent.
