What a shame..  Such a beautiful place!!  Such potential!  Even after a review from LeBan about the coffee AND food being cold, 3 days later, still cold.  The polenta was room temperature and very small for $15.00.  The fries were great, but cold.  French toast, cold, and unexciting.  The Charcuterie showed with out bread.  Coffee was refilled with cold tea.  Dozens of staff were walking by us and avoiding our waves and eye contact.  Team work kids!!  Come on! Such an amazing chef, I hope that the staff can step it up to deliver the food as it is prepared...   If it all would have arrived hot, it would have been less of a disappointment. 300 seats is a huge undertaking.  Gotta step it up a little kids!
