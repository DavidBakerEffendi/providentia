Omigoodness! From Charlotte, in NY for the week and ventured to Amy Ruths. The ONLY reason this doesn't get 5 stars is because when the 2 of us walked in we weren't sure if someone was going to seat us or not, then when we sat down we didn't get greeted until we asked someone if we'd been assigned a server. Once we got a server, she was great and the food?...OMG! I had chicken and waffles for the first time and it could be my last time and I'd know I've had the best. The chicken is fantastic, the waffles are buttery perfection and together it just don't make no sense lol! There was a great atmosphere and even the restroom was nice and clean. Definitely one of my favorite experiences from visiting NY!
