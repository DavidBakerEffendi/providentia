For the price point, I found Traif to be a fun easy restaurant. The service was casual, but nice and very attentive. Our server was easygoing and if they weren't immediately around, another server or back-waiter was always there to help. The crowd seemed young (20-40 years old) and very Hip (Williamsburg of course). The music was current top40 stuff that played very loud and with an open kitchen the ambiance was very noisy. However I feel that the noise did not at all take away from my dining experience. The tables were all very close together, but again, at this price point I find that it was fine. The menu was simple but well executed. Smaller plates that ranged from $7 to $20 dollars. I would estimate that two people, a couple of drinks could get away with a $60 tab (no tax or tip) and be quite satisfied. We ordered about 9 plates. They opened with a demitasse of lentil soup for an amuse, a nice touch considering I wasn't expecting it with that atmosphere. A decent tuna tar tare bruschetta. A wonderful comice pear salad. Sweetbreads (of which I will always order if its offered) that were outstanding. That lamb loin was decent, but compared to the previous courses seemed disappointing. The duck leg confit was over done (in the fact that the meat was quite dry for a confit) and under cured (not enough salt or time in the cure process) but the barley risotto that garnished it was amazing. The dessert menu wasn't calling anything out to me because I was quite full. But they served us a little mignardises of a marinated pineapple something. It was enough bite of sweet that sent us out the door quite happy. I would highly recommend this restaurant. Down the street is a new sister restaurant aptly named Shiksa.
