Nasty bar owner/manager was EXTREMELY rude to me this past Sunday. After waiting two hours for a table during the busy Park Slope Irish Parade, I was told that I could not come in and feed my 1 1/2 yr old twin boys the food I had brought along with me for them. I was with a group of about 12 adults, all of whom were already seated and ordering food from HIS establishment (which I planned to do for myself as well). He actually yelled at me outside and said, "We serve food and alcohol HERE. They can eat what WE serve." I've never been so shocked or insulted in my entire life. To act so disrespectfully to a mother, who was obviously in a predicament. And did he honestly expect me to feed my children pub grub and alcohol? He refused to budge so I left and took my children with me - never to return again. If you have kids I recommend BLACKLISTING this place, which obviously has no decency when it comes to the trials of parenting.
