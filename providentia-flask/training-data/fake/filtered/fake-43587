THEY HAVE MICE!!! When I saw two mice playing in the center of the restaurant near closing time and pointed them out to the waitress she said - "what do you expect in this type of building?" !!! Also- terrible management- not letting customers sit where they would like. Mediocre food at best and awful cocktails.
