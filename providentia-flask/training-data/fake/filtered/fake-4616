We were wandering down 9th avenue, saw this place, and had a great dinner.  The room is beautiful, and on a Monday night we got a table without a problem.  It's a narrow dining room, but I felt like we could talk and have some privacy even though we were sitting in the middle of the room.  Nice design.  We like to eat at diverse places.  We saw at least one other lesbian couple and a few gay male couples, some straight couples, and then just people gathered for dinner.  People seemed pretty relaxed.  I was super underdressed since we hadn't planned for a nice dinner out, but it felt comfortable anyway. We loved the food.  The flatbread was brilliant (with honey drizzled on top), which we had along with a plate of fried vegetables.  Then we shared the sea bass, which was plenty for two of us.  We forgot to ask the waiter to leave off any nuts, so we asked kind of last minute and she went running to the kitchen.  She came back and said that it was all taken care of, but then someone else came out and served us the fish with nuts sprinkled on top.  Not a big deal, we just scraped them off.   My partner ate the scraped off stuff and thought it tasted a little gritty, we wondered if the fresh greens had been thoroughly washed, it was hard to tell. The wine was great. and the service was amazing.  Super friendly, super accommodating.  I bet it's unbearably crowded on the weekends, but for a casual  mid-week meal it was really fun.
