I was excited to go to Frankie's with my family for my birthday dinner.  While the food was delicious, the service and attitude were terrible - so terrible that I'm giving it one star.  Took way too long for everything. . .that plus really bad attitude = bad dining experience.  On top of that, the manager was rude when I spoke with her at the end of the evening.  We won't be back.  Fragole, just up the street, is just as yummy and much nicer.
