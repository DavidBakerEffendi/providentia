Started the evening with some drinks at the bar whilst waiting for a table.  The earl grey martini (I think that's what it was called) was TERRIBLE.  If you've been to Angel Share and had their infused earl grey cocktail, you'll know what I mean.  The drink essential taste like the bartender had dumped a bag of lipton tea in a hot cup of water, chilled it then dump vodka/soju (I just can't remember the base alcohol).  No way did it 1) taste of earl grey nor was the drink *infused* with the tea.  It was simply mixed with the tea.  This is probably the grossest cocktail I've had in New York.  The other drinks my friends had were all mediocre.  The wines were average. Food itself wasn't exceptional.  There is effort made in trying to be creative but the flavors and presentation doesn't quite come together for Emporio.  The pasta special we had with Uni (sea urchin), was disappointing.  Tiny of barely-there uni mixed with fresh pasta (which was good).  With the use of cream to hold the uni together and allow the taste of it to be consistently applied through the dish, the pasta turned out to be rather plain and tasteless.  The pizza with sopressata was good but again, nothing out of the world.  You can get much better pizzas elsewhere.  The watermelon salad was boring but the fried risotto croquettes were good.. crispy on the outside, rich moist risotto and fontina filling  done just right. All in all, a very average experience (more of a 2.5 star rating).
