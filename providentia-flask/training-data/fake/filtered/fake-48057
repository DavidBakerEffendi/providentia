I went to The Smith in Midtown last night as a recommendation from my hotel. The vibe was great but the service was very bad. They had a special on Tuesday "Lamb Shank" I ordered it. 20 minutes later the bartender comes over and tells me they are out of it, this was at 8pm. How can you be out of your Tuesday special dinner at 8pm? So I told him I was in the mood for Lamb and since they were out of the special what he would suggest. He said, I am sorry I will buy you a beer, and you should try the Lamb T-bone. So I took his advice and order the Lamb T-bone. 20 minutes later a server gives me my plate, I started to eat and it was BEEF T-Bone.... a 1/4 way through I told the bartender and he told me "I am sorry"... I didn't expect him not to charge me but I expected them to do something about it... NOTHING....
