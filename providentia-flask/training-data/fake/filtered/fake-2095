Had dinner with my wife last night and was impressed. I sat between some locals with an adorable screeching child . Noted not in an offensive way. The other side " developing foodies" We had the grilled flat bread. Well seasoned and tasty. Could use a little more color to my visual taste. The Kale salad was very good. The choice of three sides was my entree. All three were delicious. The chicken with Fava beans was a wonderful. Great taste. simple and done correctly. Skin was crisp. The lemon wedge added just the right acidity without demanding you have it. The pear tart was delicious. A perfect share. The room is decorated with taste and comfort.. The best part was the assessable service. Inviting with a professionalism that guides without selling. No wait yet and some enhancements will create a long wait in a few weeks.
