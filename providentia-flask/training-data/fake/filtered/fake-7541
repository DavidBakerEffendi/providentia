I came here for a friend's birthday because someone recommended it. Never ever am I listening that person's recommendation again. First off, they seated us in a awkward corner where I had to sit next to my friend at an angle (we were basically sitting on a right angle). My friend tried to move in front of me so we can be across from each other but APPARENTLY, we were in the way then so they asked us to move again. Food They charged ~$30 for a salad that was practically 4 bites. Nothing is memorable, to be honest. To top it off, the waiter and who I assume, is the manager had such a pompous attitude- not polite AT ALL. They kept hovering over us as if we were doing something wrong (Please learn about personal space). The only """dish"""" memorable was the monkey bread - funny how usually, restaurants give complimentary bread but this place decided to charge $8 for it. This place was completely unsatisfactory and I felt sorry for bringing my friend here on what was supposed to be a special day.
