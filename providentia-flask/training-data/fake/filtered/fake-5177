Walking by in Soho on Saturday night we stopped by this small bistro, it was a nice evening and their French doors were open. We  asked for a table and it was a long wait so we decided to eat at the bar. The bartender was very busy  but she was very nice and accommodating . We had a crab cake, escargot  and for dinner we had the 1/2 duck special and the monk fish. Food was delicious and  surpassed our expectation . Definitely will be back with reservation.
