very impressed with the ambiance and the food was decent. However the service was horrible!! Not only we're we left sitting for 10 minutes before anyone approached us, when the waitress came she was rude and abrupt. She came by the table a total of 3 times all night. At the end she gave us glasses of champagne "on her" then charged us for them on the bill?? She also tacked on 20% gratuity for a party of 2? We wont be going back!
