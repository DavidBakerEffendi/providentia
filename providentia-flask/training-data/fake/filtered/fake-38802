I ate at Â Iris Cafe' a couple of days ago and it will be the last!!! I found an insect in my food and felt sick shortly after... I was curious to check there ratings and if they had any violations and sure enough i found a whole list of them!! Not to mention a "Sanitary Violation".. I wish they would of posted there letter grade from the Dept of Health instead of hiding it !! It would have saved me a trip to the doctor... Thanks Iris Cafe for your poor patronage !!
