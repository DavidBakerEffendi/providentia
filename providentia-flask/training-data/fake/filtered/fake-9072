First time there, thought to myself, "Hope this isn't a bad decision." It wasn't, however. I ordered the pla lard prik, white fish lightly fried with coconut chili sauce. Very good, but not as spicy as I would have liked. The service was fast, the bill cheap, and the water glass full constantly. I can see why some reviews are negative, but I enjoyed my meal thoroughly. 4 stars for great service and solid food.
