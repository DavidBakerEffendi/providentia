best. ramen. ever. if i could i would eat this everyday, but the wait is rather long. no matter when you go, there is always a wait. the longest i have waited is an hour and half but it's so worth it. it's soo goodd. the tuna appetizer is really amazing as well. there is a 17 or so pepper labeled ramen. it's really not that spicy. but it's really good.
