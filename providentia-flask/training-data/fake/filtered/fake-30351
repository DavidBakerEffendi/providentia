So freaking good!! i've only been once or twice and i had the fresh handmade uneven pasta, whatever it's called and everything was perfect, the prices were good and so were the portions. the ambiance was nice and low-lit, but a bit too low-lit. i actually had to pull out my phone to read the menu and reading was hard enough being that it was mostly in Italian, which i don't speak. for people who don't speak this language you'll struggle a bit because everyone who works there is Italian which is both a plus and a minus. plus for ambiance and minus for when your ordering! so bring someone native and it's a perfect place. also right near my house! :)
