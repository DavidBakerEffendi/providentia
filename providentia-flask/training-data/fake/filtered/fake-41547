Food is fresh and cheap. Been there many times. Unfortunitly, the main hostess was incompetent on our last visit. We waited over an hour when she told us 30 mins. We asked her how many ppl were ahead of us 3 times and she still managed to cross our name of her list without having called us (we were litteraly standing right next to her for 60 minutes and its a tiny place.) Then after we caught a glimpse of her list and pointed out her error she STILL sat two parties of the same number of people as ours before us. We were a party of just 2 Btw. Good food, great price, stay on top of aloof and absent minded hostess.
