The staff was very welcoming and nice. Me and my boyfriend went with a groupon and it was great. We got sangria's, their Stix salad, quinoi balls with hummus and the tuna platter for two. It was all great and i love that they use organic produce. The tuna we got medium rare and it was great. The place itself looks clean and inviting.
