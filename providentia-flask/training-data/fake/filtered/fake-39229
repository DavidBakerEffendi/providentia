I have never placed a review about any restaurant I've been to whether it was good or bad. but this time I feel the need to only because what has happened to this place is sad. we started going here a little less than a year ago on the word of another family and it use to be that the service was just awful and the food great. but now it's just the opposite . excellent service and awful food.and it happened in just a months time. we ordered calamari and noticed it was half the portion it use to be and it was loaded with tentacles and over cooked for $11.00 not worth it at all. The pasta was loaded with water and the food looked like it was just thrown on the plate. my wife had veal they gave us 2 very small pieces loaded with sauce and mushrooms. this use to be our go to place at least twice a week but we wont be going anymore.. my wife myself and my 2 sons have become totally disappointed in Gennaros Â even the salad they give you with dinner is sad brown lettuce wrinkled tomato I don't know what has happened to this place but it's just sad.and unfortunately other friends and family are saying the same thing.
