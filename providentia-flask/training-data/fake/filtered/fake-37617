DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU LIKE EXPLOSIVE DIARRHEA. I went with a party of five. ALL five of us were sick for an entire day afterwards on different orders. Aside, the service was pushy - the waiter, without prompt, suggested that our order wouldn't be enough food for the five of us. We didn't order more, and when the food came, it could have fed 8 people (the portions are huge). We declined dessert and asked for the check, and then a manager came over with dessert menus again. YOU WILL REGRET EATING HERE.
