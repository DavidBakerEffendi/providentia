a discovery of flavors, I'm always looking for real flavors and intense food. If the pizza was a religion this place would be a church! everything smell pizza, the place is small cozy and real, a long line always and fresh melted mozzarella on every single slice. The chees is amazing and the pizza it's crispy, juicy and full of taste, really amazing mix!
