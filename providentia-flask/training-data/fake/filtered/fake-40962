The pizza- delicious The wait- annoying but still worth it Even with the limited menu of pizza and drinks, you leave Grimald's more than satisfied. The pizza is amazzzzzing and doesn't take ages to arrive to the table one you're seated. A little crowded --I was elbow to elbow with the person sitting next to me which kind of got in the way of having free conversation with my friend who was with me. Regardless, GO because all the little things don't even come close to making me second guess going again because the pizza itself is just so perfect.
