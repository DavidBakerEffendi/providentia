The honey BBQ shrimp was something I was skeptical about but I was happy I got it, it was great and I was told the red velvet waffle was good sorry they lied it was GREAT. The next day I as craving for red velvet waffles, sad part is that I'm located I the lower manhattan and i wish I could go there everyday. But I will surely visit it again!
