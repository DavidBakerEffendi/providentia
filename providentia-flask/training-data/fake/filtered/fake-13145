Having found ourselves in New Haven one weekday afternoon, my GF and I decided to swing by Pepe's to try out the Pizza.  The dining area is small, but we got a seat right by the window in the front. I went with the sausage and mushrooms, and it did not disappoint.  The thin crispy crust, great sauce and quality toppings made the meal. Having grown up with brick oven pizza, I can't imagine not having it, and Pepe's does it right. Although I have not been back since, I do remember it, and highly recommend it to anyone.
