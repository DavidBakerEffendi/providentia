First time I tried hot pot and it was great! This was totally a different experience than any other restaurant I have ever been to. It was like korean bbq taken to a next level. Good thing I had a few guides to help me through the experience. It costs about $30 and you get as much food you want to hot pot. They start you out with a soup base and then you can order any of their foods from the normal beef, and shrimp to  pigs blood and brain =0! I was  feeling a little fear factorish at first but it tasted good (or maybe im just nice with a hot pot) Also you get to mix your own sauce in the back -try a couple mixtures through out the meal they can make a big  difference. The decor and seating was good. There are even private rooms that are great for small group of people. I liked the experience and would be back.
