Absolutely awful! The one-third Staten Island pizza arrived at the table barely warm. it was over-salted. The meatballs were as dry as sand, The rest of the ingredients were practically dehydrated. We felt that our dish had been assembled from scraps accumulated under a counter in the kitchen. My ice tea was so bland that I could barely differentiate it Â from the water. Anybody drawn to this hoax of a restaurant should approach it warily.
