I went here with a friend who was excited to try the food  and wine menu. unfortunately it did not come that far since we were not allowed to order drinks (at a wine bar?). I decided I did not want a drink and told the server I wanted to stick with water, my friend ordered a glass of wine. For some reason we had to ID ourselfs even though we are both far over the age of 21. My friend who ordered the wine showed her driving license, I did not have proper ID on me (only an expired driving license), however, this should not be a problem since I was sticking with water. For some reason our server decided that my friend was not  allowed to order an alcoholic drink either since I did not have my ID. We both look well over 21, the server was very rude about this, so we decided to leave and try Barbuzzo across the street which was awesome.
