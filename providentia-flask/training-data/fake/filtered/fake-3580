cool spot but don't order the soup , it was good but was on the menu as a bunch dish. It should have been listed as an app. since it was so small , $ 9 for a soup that was 4 or 5 spoonfuls I left still very hungry. But every meal comes with a drink so I like that. Would go back but I would def order something else.
