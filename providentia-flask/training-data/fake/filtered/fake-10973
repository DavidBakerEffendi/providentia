I went to Stony's for a sandwich, and I heard he took over the old Stuffed Shirt. I immediately took for the door across the parking lot and went inside. I was told they were open in an hour, so I walked around and made conversation with the staff until 5:00 hit and I could get a drink, and some food. The lovely hostess offered me a menu, and I must say I was slightly disappointed. I just KNEW with Stony as the owner the sandwich list would be extensive and awesome. Errrrr, where were the sandwiches? There were burgers ($14-16!), but they were pretty standard. I walked around, and decided to take a seat down at "The Snug." I asked to see the menu again, and it turns out there's a completely different menu (more my style). I tried the buffalo chicken wings. They were $12, but the service was amazing. I could tell one of the bartenders was new to bartending, because the beer he poured was mostly foam. The girl who was training him showed him the proper way to pour, and I overheard her giving him a few tips that I'm going to use to impress my friends at a summer barbecue. :) The bar staff made everyone feel like the place has always been there and we were all regulars. Overall, I would say the place is awesome, but the food prices could use some work. I'll definitely be back to visit.
