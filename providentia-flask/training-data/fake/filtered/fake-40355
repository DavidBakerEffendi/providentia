Forget the service: the food here is utterly mediocre. Absolutely standard mass-produced formulaic "thai" restaurant food.  Not going to kill you but definitely not going to thrill you: too much coconut milk and half cooked onions, and not enough flavor. Nothing cooked together long enough to taste like anything.  I cannot figure out what the fuss is all about. It was lousy the first time, I thought I'd try again based on all the positive feedback, and it was lousy again.  It is cheap, but in this case you get what you pay for. I could have been generous and  given the food two stars, but felt all those rave reviews needed to be tempered.
