Went there with some co-workers and had some great soul food.  Everything was great...everyone raved about the collard greens.  I had the fried whiting fish with tartar sauce and some hot sauce (which I think they make).  No complaints there.  Corn bread was awesome.  You can order ahead and have the food ready for when you get there which was great for us!  Place looked great inside!  Some great African art...very tasteful.  All in all I would go back anytime.  Price was also great...about 10 dollars a plate for lunch...so worth it!
