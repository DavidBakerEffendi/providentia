3 bad things about this place. Had booked a party at this place for 50 people. The rates were decided and promised with the gratuity included but they charged it on the final bill. Also the lady working there, i think Â her name is Lisa, was the most arrogant lady i had ever seen. She does not know how to talk and respect the customers. The hall arrangements sucked. It was nothing as promised before making the deal. After talking to my friends i came to know they have been known for doing this. I would not recommend going to this place or booking it for any occasion. Zero stars to what all i can give. Please do not book this for any occasions if u want it ruined.
