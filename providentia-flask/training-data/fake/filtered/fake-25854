This is my favorite restaurant!!! I've been to a lot of thai/vietnamese restaurant before but Thai Awesome has the best food not to mention great food and presentation quality for such an affordable price! They have fast and really good service too. I usually go during the lunch time and always order their lunch combo for only 6.95!!! I always get chicken red curry and it comes with rice, soup,salad and a siam roll..and for that price, its a great deal!!!!!!! My friends and I go there so much that the last time I went,they gave us free desserts. I just LOVE this restaurant. Its really A MUST!
