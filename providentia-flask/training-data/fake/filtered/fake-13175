Food.  Pizza itself was ok.  I'd give it 7 out of 10.  We ordered a clam pizza and it overall tasted good but too salty.  For some people being too salty can be a big issue due to health complications.   Environment.  We were sitting right behind the register.  So the waiters/waitresses were literally placing orders and printing receipts on top of our head.  If they were a little bit less careful, they would've bumped my head million times. Service.  Had to wait in line forever.  Our waiter was plain rude.  Here's what he literally said to me: "You insulted me.  If you want something, you have to ask me nicely.  I'm educated!"  Wonder what I said to him to deserve that?  He asked to separate our already small dining area (right behind the registers) into 2 separate tables, which would not even fit a pizza.  I refused and said this whole sitting area only has 1 costumer number, so it's for one table, not 2.  That triggered the waiter to throw a big tantrum.  Apparently I challenged his 'authority".
