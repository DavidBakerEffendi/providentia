Can only comment on the management and not much else, because they refused to serve me - why? Well, my wife came to have dinner as a "party of 1" and so she was seated and served.  About 30 minutes later after work, I  tried to join her  - she was in the middle of eating her meal - but when I tried to order food, they would not take my order!! Yes - it's true.  Why? They don't sit "partial parties" and so once my wife was done eating, she (and I)  would need to leave so others that were waiting could take the table. Yes - you heard correctly - they refused to allow me to join my wife and order food - REFUSED!. But wasn't I also a customer? I thought I was. When I asked to speak to the manager she said - yes - that was their policy.  THEY WOULD NOT ALLOW ME TO JOIN MY WIFE AND ORDER FOOD, even though she was at a table and in the middle of eating  - This is true.  So I left, my wife quickly finished her food and joined me in another restaurant. Yes - this actually happened.  That's a first for me! I can tell you one couple who will never be back waiting for table.
