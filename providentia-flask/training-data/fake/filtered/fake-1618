I'm new to Princeton and I went there to eat something and watch Italy-England world cup game, and I was so disappointed on all levels. No wonder the place was empty during such a big game. The guy at the counter was extremely unfriendly, the placs didn't smell good. I am from Italy and the pizza was very bad, and plus a very bad atmosphere- I left in the middle of the game to go to the pub.
