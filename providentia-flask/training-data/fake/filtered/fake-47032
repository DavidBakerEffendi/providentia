Probably 3.5 stars.  I had some interesting food here at lunch.  They favor bitter greens too much for my taste, and the beef cheeks were just OK.  The wife's chicken was pretty terrible.  But she had some sort of egg concoction that was lovely, and I had a nice soup.  I dig the space as well, particularly downstairs.
