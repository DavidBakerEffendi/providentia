I just held my wife's 40th bday in the semi private back space of Jadis. The party had about 40 guests and it was simply a great time. From start to finish Gerard, the proprietor of Jadis, made it easy to pull off. Gerard helped us pick the wine and food and, most importantly, was a straightforward and honest broker throughout. I HIGHLY recommend Jadis if you're planning a party or get together for anywhere between 15 and 50 people.
