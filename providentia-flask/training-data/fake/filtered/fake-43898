My wife and I had another wonderful evening at Llama Tooth.  This was our second visit.  First just us then we went with friends.  I had the B4 burger again.  I loved the roll and the fresh blue cheese.  I also ordered the BBQ pork mac and cheese.  It was loaded with pork and the cheese was mixed in perfectly.  My wife tried the chicken potpie.  It was creamy and full of chicken and fresh chopped vegetables with pastry style bread on top.     Outdoor patio: I have not tried the outdoor patio yet.  It looks fun and had great music playing but until it cools down I will dine in the AC.   Beer: I never expected such a quaint place to have a beer selection like that.  My waitress had a good deal of knowledge of the beer selection.  I mentioned I wanted something dark and good.  She brought just that.     Keep up the great work Llama Tooth!
