I wouldn't order here ever again! I called in to ask about delivery to my area the night before because i knew that the following day I would be having guests over and I heard the food here was decent so I figured I'd try it out. The next evening when I called I felt like I had to practically beg the lady to take my order AFTER she told me the prior evening they did deliver to my area. After she agreed to take my order she started rushing me through my order and, not knowing that I understand Portuguese, started cursing to another person that I didn't want my picadinho with pork! After I finished my order and I told her I was paying with my credit card she said "I'm wasting my time we don't take cards for delivery orders" and hung up on me!! My advice to anyone wanting to eat here, before you spend the 30$ required for delivery then a 5$ delivery fee on top of that; save yourself the headache and order some Valenca the foods GREAT and they are really nice.
