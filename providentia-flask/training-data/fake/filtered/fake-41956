My favorite place in the city! Everything is to love, from the amazingly delicious food to the perfect margaritas. The staff is great across the board, especially EB Max and Sergio. The decor and ambiance are the icing on the cake. I've been there many, many times and have never had a less than perfect experience, love you guys!
