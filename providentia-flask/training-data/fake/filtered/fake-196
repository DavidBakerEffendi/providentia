I really wanted to like this place. The food was nothing special, but definitely overpriced for what it was. You would do better at a smaller steak shop elsewhere in town as far as getting a tastier sandwich. Eventually we did. The big turn off for me were the homophobic and racist comments. I thought I was hearing it from another customer standing at an adjacent locaton but when I looked over, the conversation was with what appeared to be a patron and  two employees. They were hurling around profanities and hateful words. I guess because Im white and with my wife and child, they felt comfortable to be ignorant, but theymade be VERY uncomfortable in front of my child. I really wanted to speak up but didn't want to have our food spit on.  It's one of those places that the tourists have to try out, but the locals would be able to direct you to a better place that is less well known. I just think that the time has come when it is not acceptable to subject people to your brand of hate and they are expected to take it. The old ways dont work anymore.
