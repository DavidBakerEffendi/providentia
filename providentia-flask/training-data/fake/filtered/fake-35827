so... if ur looking for the rite spot, to grab a cocktail...and eat some terrific apps.. and pizza, look no further... I was so pleasantly surprised at how authentic the pizza...!!! service was great...(everyone was smiling)... gotta try the asian calamari... i just cant say enough good "stuff"...!!!! I recently went to Anthonys coal fired...no comparison...!! i've been to ITALY...and LUNA'S is "authentic"...so that said...jimmy C's post is way off base...no way this place 2 stars....!!!!!
