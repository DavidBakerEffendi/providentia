It has been a while since I have been truly impressed by a restaurant, but I honestly was by Agricola. Was there last night with five friends. Our waiter - Darrell - was fantastic. Attentive, but not over bearing, friendly, and extremely knowledgable. Given that they were busy, I expected them to rush us out like most American restaurants, but we were able to enjoy eating, drinking, and catching up with friends. The drinks: bar and wine menu is very good. Some interesting and well-made cocktails on the menu and a nice, but not ridiculous, wine list. We had a very nice Marlborough Pinot Noir. Wish we had more time to investigate the bar. Looks very solid. The food: very, very nice. Fresh and original without being pretentious. Our table shared the mushroom flatbread to start which was absolutely delicious. Â On Darrell's recommendation, four of us shared the veal shank, which was excellent. Overall: excellent. Truly the first time I have been this impressed by a restaurant in central NJ and I have been to a lot of them. I don't quite believe in giving five stars, as one can never be perfect, but after thinking about our meal at Agricola last night I honestly cannot think of one thing to fault. Go
