Rasham is one of the best local restaurants in which to sample Pakistani cuisine. My husband is a big fan of the Nihari. The spices are perfect in this dish. They garnish it with fresh sliced ginger and cilantro. Very filling indeed. Anything you order goes really well with the naan freshly prepared to order from their tandoor oven. I'd dare say it's the best bread in town. I usually get kebobs made from fresh halal chicken. Their butcher is on site so all meats are fresh. The kebobs along with raita make an amazing light meal. On occasion I will order a chicken samosa to start the meal. Their samosas are simply delicious. For dessert I recommend the Rus Malai made with ricotta. They also offer gulab jamun and carrot halva. Both are delicious. However, if you want to try an authentic sweet I recommend the Rus Malai. It's lightly sweet, spiced with cardamon. Yum!
