Live next door to this place. Great tasty duck rice. Always order the same dish - duck over rice. The last time I was there few months ago, had bad stomach ache. Recently I went back, ignoring my past experience, and it was bad. I have dined almost all the restaurants in the neighborhood, this place gave me the worst runs!
