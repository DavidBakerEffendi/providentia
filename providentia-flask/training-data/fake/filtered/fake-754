Amazing service and the best lemon ricotta pancakes I've ever had in my life (hint: order them with blueberries). The perfect weekend meal spot, Tom's boasts a classic diner menu, along with some unique and tasty brunch items like Danish pancakes with blueberries, ricotta and parmesan. Sammies are simple and delicious, and fun beverage options like milkshakes or a Cherry-Lime Ricky completes the experience. I don't personally come here for the entr√©e items, but hey that's not what a diner is for, right? Service is fast and friendly in general, prices are more than reasonable, and the ambiance is...interesting. There is ALWAYS a line outside on Saturdays and Sundays, but it moves quickly and they treat you to orange slices and French fries with spicy mayo while you wait. These places are good for the social fabric of neighborhoods. The vapid consumerism that turns NYC neighborhoods into retail turnstiles isn't.
