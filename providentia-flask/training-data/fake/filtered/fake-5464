Checked out this spot on a Sunday night around 7pm with a few friends.....decor was simple but nice, real comfortable, great aura, people are cool, classic hits on the jukebox, like the cure, billy idol, michael jackson etc......and the pricing is not bad.....we had about 9 miller high lifes, a burger and fries, came out to about 60 dollars.....food was tasty, only thing that sucked was that the burger was listed at 9 dollars which comes with no fries just the burger alone, fries will cost another 4, so a burger deluxe there is about 13 dollars which is not cheap....but overall i had a good time, most likely would head back there and just stay away from the food menu.
