The best meal and staff around! I could not have asked for a better meal. If you like Greek food and want to experience a great atmosphere, friendly wait staff and fantastic fresh seafood than this is the place. I visited the Taverna today with my dad and we both opted for an imported fish from greece, char grilled with olive oil, capers, lemon and dill. This simple meal was the best meal I had in a very long time!
