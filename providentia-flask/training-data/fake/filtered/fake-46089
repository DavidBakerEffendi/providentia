I have visited Rose Petals now more times than I can count and I must say everytime has been absolutely amazing! Besides the fact that I love that this is a restaurant in my community, it shows that ownership has taken time to make it a true gem by caring about every aspect, from design, staff, food quality and of course taste. As a Germantowner this restaurant is what we have been waiting for and far more. The story behind the restaurant makes me appreciate the owners and has won me and many of my friends over. Now to review the food. My favorites are, Breakfast: The waffle quesdilla, Lunch: The chicken salad sandwich and Dinner: The Fried Catfish. The food is nicely plated, service has always been outstanding and the owners seem to really want to take care of their guests. I hope we have Rose Petals in the community for many years to come. - A simply satisfied guest!
