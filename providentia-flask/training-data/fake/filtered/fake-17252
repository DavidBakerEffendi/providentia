I just returned from a lovely dinner with my family for my birthday and I must say it was wonderful!  The food was delicious, the service was very good and the atmosphere was conducive to conversation.  We were not rushed at all, our waiter was attentive,  but not annoying.  I had the chorizo encrusted pork chop...it was moist, tender and extremely flavorful. My daughters had the char broiled steak and lamb duo...sensational!   The other dishes were equally delicious.  In addition, the chef made a special birthday cake for me per my daughters request.  All in all it was a wonderful evening.   I suggest you go there and try for yourself...try The DaVinci Room next door to Mona Lisa Pizzeria,  I don't think it will disappoint.
