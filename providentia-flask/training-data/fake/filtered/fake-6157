I went to this placed based on the reviews I read on Yelp hoping  to find another one of those great little neighborhood places that most people don't know about like Macaroni's in NE Philly on old welsh rd, wow! What a dissapointment. Where do I start, the parking was awful! But, to be expected given the location, the place looked dirty and cramped but I can get past all of that if the food is good,  unfortunately that wasn't the case. The service was bad I felt rushed the whole time I was there. Yhey didn't take a drink orderwhen half way through our meal my date asked for a soda the waiter brought over a dirty glass and a can and just left it on the table. The meals we ordered had no presentation and were not tasty at all, I am a person who eats out 3-4 times a week and have no problem trying new places or traveling to find good food. I was horribly disappointed with everything from the service to the quality  and taste of the food, I don't know if it was a bad night or what. Obviously alot of people like this place,look at the reviews it gets! I just don't understand how. I had a awful experience in every way and would never recommend in any way.SORRY!
