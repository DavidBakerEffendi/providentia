I'm a southern girl with a weakness for the comfort food. Pies N Thighs hit the spot, though I have to say I could have done without the long wait and attitude. I heard the Gibson is dishing out pulled pork sandwiches that rock on Fridays for happy hour. BBQ is suppose to be cheap and unfashionable.
