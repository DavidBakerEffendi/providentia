I had the mushroom, stilton, arugula sandwich.  It was still hot when we got it.  My husband and I loved it!  I also enjoyed looking at their unique selection of cards, and I bought several.  We live on the west coast and I have never seen any of those cards in other stores before.  Everyone that worked there was so kind.  It was very busy, we had to wait 35 minutes to be seated.  We spent the morning and afternoon at Yale's Art Gallery right across the street.  I left the card's I bought in the back pocket of the wheelchair my father-in-law used at the museum.  I was so disappointed.  The next morning I called the museum from NH.  They found the cards but refused to mail them to me.  I asked Atticus if they would mail the cards to me and they said no problem!  They would even pay for the postage.  Now that is service!
