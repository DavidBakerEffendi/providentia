This Is by far the best Latin restaurants I have eaten at in the city.The staff is very professional and friendly.The food is fresh and favorable with the the spices you expect from Latin foods.The short rib app & brisket tacos are to die for. Make sure you leave room for desert. The bar is well stocked and offers a variety of Latin themed drinks....the service is top shelf. Great date place, fun atmosphere.
