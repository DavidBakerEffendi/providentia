One star is overly generous for this restaurant.  This was the worst dining experience I  EVER had. I  ordered the porterhouse and couldn't even eat the steak because it had a foul odor.  When they brought me another steak it still smelled funky so needless to say dinner was no longer an option at this establishment and our party of five drove to a diner to get something  to eat.   Stay away from this place!
