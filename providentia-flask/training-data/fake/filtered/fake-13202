Chengdu 23 sets the bar for me by which all other Chinese restaurants are now judged by. I certainly have not been disappointed by anything I ordered off the menu, although I may now have preferences based on experiencing more of their menu. Even when taking the owner's (Kevin) suggestions over what is on the menu, this proves to be even more interesting, surprising and always tasty. If your looking for familiar come to dinner with a mind-set of openness to a new experience and adventure. I'd call it gastronomical enlightenment. If you based your opinion of restaurants solely upon the ethnicity of the diners, non-Asians would be outnumbered on a regular basis. Having Chinese take-out is something I can no longer bring myself to do and would only regret that I did. I'd rather wait for the "real deal" and go for the authentic cuisine. Spicy is not a requirement and can be turned up, down or even off if you like. The negative review writer's opinions very well may have been their experience but no such event(s) have ever occurred or over the many visits I've enjoyed there. Go shopping at the mall - relax with a proper Chinese dinner. Take home enough leftovers for another meal. Enough said.
