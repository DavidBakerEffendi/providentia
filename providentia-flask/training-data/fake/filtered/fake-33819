I won't go here again. I felt as though as soon as I walked in I was getting attitude and judgement from the bartender.  I told her that I didnt like my drinks strong and she made a sour face and proceeded to make me a VERY strong vodka martini. It was so strong and terrible tasting my boyfriend couldn't even drink it.  After she made my horrible drink, she didn't ask us if we wanted to order food. We waited 20 minutes until finally I waved over a server for our food order. We came here for the happy hour half priced appetizers, the pizzas were fantastic but the wings were over cooked and dry. Also you only get a few wings with your order, it`s not worth the money. I am disappointed that the staff was so rude and unaccomodating because the food was good and the bar was beautiful.
