Food was pretty good.  The place is a bit overpriced, but it isn't terrible.  The food is quite delicious, and the menu is always different, which makes it interesting to go back multiple times.Not bad a little pricey menu, but you get for what you pay.  I can't wait to go back for the whole fish.Small intimate space with seating at the bar.
