This place is magical. (We hadn't even planned to dine here: we were just walking around, looking for a place to have a drink, when we thought is was maybe time to find out what was hiding behind the wood cabin :) on Avenue C.) Â  The decor makes you feel somewhere between a log cabin and a apres-ski in the Alps, with wood and dried plants and great lighting. The service is nice - with smiles and interventions at the right time (although I'd preferred if the bus boy didn't hover that often around our table to see if we had finished... ) The food is delicious: we shared the Landjager. home-made sausage, as an appetizer (very good) and then the Wiener Schnitzel (veal) (very good and generous) and the Apfelstrudel (I'd hoped for a larger portion and a bit more vanilla sauce) . It's a pity we weren't very hungry when coming in because we could have eaten much more! I'll definitely plan on going back there soon to try the Spaetzel and maybe the pork schnitzel. Just hope I could do it more often, but prices are not on the cheap side (our bill came at USD 78 for four beers, one appetizer, one entree and one dessert).
