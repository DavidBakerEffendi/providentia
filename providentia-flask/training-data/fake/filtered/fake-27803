This too is a response to JP's comments...first & foremost, YOU SEEM LIKE A GIGANTIC TOOL. Are you sure you weren't out to dinner with your boyfriend? Cause your story was a bit much, drama queen. You should spend more time getting over yourself & less time on Yelp because I'd be willing to bet that the waiters and rest of the staff there work 100 times harder during one shift than your dumb ass has worked in a life-time... P.s. - Find a new place to take your boyfriend out to dinner.
