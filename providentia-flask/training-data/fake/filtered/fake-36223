My wife and I went to Isabella's for our 1 year anniversary just a few weeks ago.  Definitely a mixed experience - the service was slightly above average and the food was somewhat hit or miss.  Positive: the butternut squash soup was easily the best I've ever had. My wife's lamb and pappardelle were excellent also.  Negative:  the steak was very overcooked.  We will check the place out again, but are not in a rush  to do so.
