I have been eating at the Jewel of India for several years and love their food. My favorites are the vegetable samosas and the lamb korma but have had almost everything on their menu. I live 90 minutes away and will drive here often just to have dinner. Â Often I will have dinner with my boss, who stayed in India for a month and considers this the best authentic Indian food restaurant here.
