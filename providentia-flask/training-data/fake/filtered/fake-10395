Many small restaurants have been in and out of this spot over the years, a few have had some decent food, but I think this one is going to do well here. I stopped in yesterday, to check the new place out and compared to the past restaurants in there this place is excellent looking, it's clean, the food is good, and the food is made quick and efficiently. I tried a slice of their pizza and it was excellent not too much sauce and just the right amount of cheese. I also got a 8" ham and cheese sub that was reasonably priced and delicious. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for good food at a reasonable price close to home.
