At 957 State St, Jordan's Hot Dogs and Mac is a good 20-30 minute walk away from the Yale campus. And for students hungry for a good meal, it's the perfect amount of time needed to build up an appetite. Upon entering, we encountered a fragrance of grilling hot dogs and fresh condiments, as well as a relatively simple cooking station, set up to manufacture exactly what the restaurant promised. We fumbled around for a few minutes: Djenab wasn't the biggest hot dog eater, Eric had recently lunched, and I had picked up a bug and wasn't about to eat any time soon. But the options were vast, ranging from the Bacon and BBQ Dog to the Georgia Red Hot, as were the possible toppings. Ultimately, Djenab chose the BLT dog (topped with bacon, lettuce and tomato), and Eric decided on the famous Mac Dog (with mac and cheese). The chef got diligently to work, wearing a smile the entire way. Once our food was delivered, we sat outside to eat, huddling together for warmth from the brisk winds. The BLT Dog was fresh, as the lightly buttered bread added a nice crunch, and the freshness of the veggies lightened the meat, which was not too greasy. Moreover, the Mac Dog was cooked to perfection and the mac and cheese was spiced just right; together they created a wonderful taste.
