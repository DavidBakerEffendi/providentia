I went to Woodrows for lunch today and had their beer and a burger for ten dollar special. Â The place was really cute and the burger was huge. I would highly recommend trying that place out. But if you do go, you have to try the parmesan truffle fries. They are amazing, as are their mushrooms. Plus the waitress really made me feel at home.
