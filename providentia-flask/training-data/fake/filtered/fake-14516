Some people (AKA some people from Dela-Where?) wouldn't know a good pizza if it came up and bit them in the ____. That being said, this place serves delicious, healthy organic pizza as well as salads, paninis, desserts, etc. It is a relief knowing that I can have a delicious healthy meal that is not reminiscent of cardboard. I frequent the Pennington location often and enjoy the wine bar, and after work happy hours. I never get tired of the pizza and have never had a bad experience there! Everyone is super friendly and accommodating!
