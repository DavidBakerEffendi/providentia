Did not get this place at all, kale salad so bland and tasted like the left overs in my landscapers baskets. The ravioli pasta was over-kneaded dough and actually tasted like they were not made in house at all. Have always been a fan of Jean-Georges but this is a disparate attempt for NYC's to feel like they came home to the farm, NOT!
