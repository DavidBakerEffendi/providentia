Just had a great dinner last night at Brooklyn Commune.  We had the greek salad, steak and frites, duck linguine, and short bread with bay leaf ice cream and orange-clove caramel sauce.  Service was friendly and spot-on by our host Sal.  Really the best dinner out I've had in a long time.  Looking forward to going back soon.  Thumbs up!
