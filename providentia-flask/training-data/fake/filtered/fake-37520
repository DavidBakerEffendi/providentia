I was very impressed with Alfie's from the beginning. Very warm and welcoming ambiance. I met the owner several times that I went and I really love the food and the pumpkin beer with the sugar on the rim of the glass. The burger is probably my favorite or the pigs in a blanket. Lovely place with a staff to match. I'll be back soon!
