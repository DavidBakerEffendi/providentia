Still thinking about the bluefish entree I had last night, served on just the right amount of green curry, fresh with snow peas and small chunks of eggplant. The curry stood up to the bluefish without overwhelming or masking it. The service was great - as ever - I always look forward to coming here. The Wellfleet oysters are highly recommended also: nothing hidden about them either... salt, ocean, perfectly opened by the pros. This place is one of Philadelphia's pearls.
