Been a fan of Bayou for some time now. Although pretty busy at times, I feel that it's always worth the wait. I would strongly suggest checking out the pre-fix menu as well during week days. I have to be honest, there were resturants in New Orleans that weren't nearly as good as Bayou on staten island.
