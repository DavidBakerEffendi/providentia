A friend of mine and I walked by this restaurant called La Lanterna di Vittorio (129 MacDougal St, New York, NY, (212) 529-5945) that seemed cute, and decided to go in since we had been walking around for a while. It was dimly lit and was really meant for impressing first dates, but it worked for us too. I ordered spinach and mushroom quiche with a salad ($10) and it was probably one of the best quiches I had ever had. They did something with the crust that I couldn't really put my finger on, but it was slightly sweet, but not in a sugary way, if that makes sense. I enjoyed myself. The pizzas and all of the other dishes looked really nice as well, and apparently they have a garden in the back with a lot of tables. aspoonaforkandaknife.bloâ€¦
