I'm a regular at this place, I really love the Japanese soba its absolutely amazing. My favorite dish is the dip noodle with duck, they serve a bowl of broth on top of a small fire that keeps it warm, I don't have enough words to describe how good it is. for appetizer I love the mocha and the chicken balls are very good too. only 4 star because the service is a bit slow sometime. highly recommended to try.
