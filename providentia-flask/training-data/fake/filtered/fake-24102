Holy lord.  The food was pretty tasty.  The naan was awesome.   The decore left much to be desired.  We sat near the kitchen and noticed flies circling around.   The "holy lord" part comes in about 20 minutes after eating.  I have never had a stomach ache as bad as I did after eating here.  I seriously had trouble walking to my car which was 100 yards away.  My girlfriend thought she was going to have to take me to the hospital.  I have eaten Indian food many a time, and have never been in agony after eating.  It must have been the dish that I ordered because my girlfriend felt fine afterwords and she is usually the one with the sensitive stomach.   I recommend giving this place a try, but have a nice spot picked out on the Princeton University lawn to lay down on.
