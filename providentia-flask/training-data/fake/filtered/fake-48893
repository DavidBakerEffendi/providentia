My wife and I have been going to Almond for a number of years, and were never disappointed until last night (9/28/13).   My Marinated Grilled Octupus had no taste, and included potatoes fillers. The potatoes were new to the dish and were as tasteless as the octupus.  So disappointed because this use to be my favorite appetizer at Almond. For dinner I had the Halal Cart roast lamb breast, yellow rice, etc. and my wife had the Day Boat Scallop & Smoked Duck Breast corn ragout, five onions, sauce "espagnole". I could have gotten my dish from the street vendor opposite Trader Joe's on 14th Street and it would have tasted the same but a lot less expensive.  My wife's dinner was suppose to have Smoked Duck Breast in it, but it was no where to be found on the plate.  No plans on going back.
