The food here is pretty good. The super hot tea in a pint glass is great, and non-caffeinated. I had duck, noodles, pork and wonton soup the times I've been. But do not accept these hours. They are a lie. I always call now because it's often not open at 3 am, much less open till 4 am. I walked half a mile once in the freezing rain to get to that tea and they were closing early. So call before you go.
