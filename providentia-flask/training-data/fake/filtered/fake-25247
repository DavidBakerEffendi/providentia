I've been to champs twice.  I've had awesome stuff both times.  The staff was friendly and offered suggestions, pointing out the things that were just made and still warm.  The prices are really good for vegan stuff.  I haven't been to a non-vegan bakery in a long time, so I don't know  how the prices compare.  There were many baked goods to choose from.  I'm looking forward to seeing how this place pans out.
