I am not a picky person, but this meal was really bad. I mean, really bad. You get a sense that this place is going down hill. Its getting dingy and outdated. One of our dinners came out burned. But rather than remake it, they just added sauce to cover up in hopes to save a buck and served it to us anyway. Good restaurants don't do this. Revere did it. There are just too many great places to go out within a 10 mile radius for this place to compete without some drastic changes.
