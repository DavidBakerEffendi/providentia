Noodle Village is literally the restaurant that I go to for my birthday. Every time I go to Noodle Village, my only problem is trying to decide whether or not to deviate from my usual order; The Beef Chow Fun, which is filling, but not so much so that you can't enjoy your appetizers, the soup dumplings, which are honestly the best I've had anywhere, they're part of why I am willing to make the trip all the way from New Jersey to China Town, and the rice Noodles with the Peanut Butter sauce, which we first ordered for my friend with a Gluten allergy and liked so much that we order them every time we come out. Two of my best friends are allergic to gluten and dairy respectively, which can be a real hassle when trying to pick a restaurant to eat at, but at Noodle Village, we always find a bevy of hypoallergenic options to choose from.
