We had a fantastic time. I made a reservation on-line about 1/2 hour prior to showing up. The place is very small but quaint so a reservation is a must. Don't go without one. We showed up 5 minutes prior to arrival and was greeted by a friendly gentlemen who is one of the owners. He had a fantastic attitude all night as he checked on the food and service. We brough our own wine which was another bonus. We ordered appetizers which were both fantastic. My meal was the veal short ribs which were wonderfully prepared. I haven't had some a great tasting meal in a long time. Even the chef stopped over to check how they were prepared. The only drawback is the size of the restaurant but if you can get over this I highly recommend stopping in for dinner. We walked there from our hotel and thanks to yelp and the recommendations on line as this is how we found the restaurant.
