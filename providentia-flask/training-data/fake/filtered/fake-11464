Tonight is the LAST TIME I will ever order from this place again. I've ordered from them at least twice a week for months now. The first time they messed my order up and I called, the guy was very nice and told me he would fix it the next time I ordered. Tonight, when they messed up my order and I called about it the man hung up on me twice, got rude with me on the phone, kept interrupting me and talking over me so I couldn't even explain what was wrong. The problem?.... I ordered a pizza with all sausage and half pepperoni. I got half sausage and pepperoni and half plain. Simple fix, it was only a $1.00 charge for the topping, My kids had already started eating, and I would have been happy with fixing it next time just as he had the previous time he made the EXACT SAME MISTAKE. However, as soon as he started getting rude and talking over me he lost my business forever. And this was just from a delivery order. He told me to come to the restaurant and show him my order from the GrubHub app because he didn't believe me. If I wasn't on crutches, I gladly would have gone in to get my order in the first place. However, he wouldn't even let me explain that its difficult for me to drive, hence the delivery order. The last time I was in the establishment for dine-in there were no clean tables and my son and I ended up eating on the hood of my car. I thought switching to delivery would be better than dealing with that, but its their tactics that are dirty, not just the dining room. They don't even deserve one star.
