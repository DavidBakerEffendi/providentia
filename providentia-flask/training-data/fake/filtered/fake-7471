This is no doubt one of the best eateries in the city any time of a day!  I love their brunches and dinners and, of course, amazing selection of drinks:)  The place is pretty loud, hustling and bustling with people talking and laughing, but you can still hear your partner sitting across from you at the table and the music selection is pretty good - lively and welcoming! The service is courteous and professional and you never feel the wait for your dish.  As a matter of fact I always base my choice of the meal on the waiter's recommendation and it never failed me so far!   One thing you should be aware of is that the place is so popular that you might be better off calling in advance to reserve a table but if you decide to just pop in then by any means enjoy a drink (or two:) at the bar while waiting for the table - this will give you more time to explore the place before you are finally seated down.
