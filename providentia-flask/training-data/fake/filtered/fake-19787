Guru palace is a nice restaurant  indian Food.  the lunch buffet is excellent. The restaurant is very beautiful inside and having good architecture inside the best part about it is that the naan is unlimited and fresh out of the oven.  The buffet has a variety of different foods including chicken tikka masala , jasmine white rice, dal, and other dishes with tons of flavor and plenty of spices.i had a very nice  party experience there they have 2 big party halls and both are nice and pleasant. Anyone should try it. it is a good restaurant.
