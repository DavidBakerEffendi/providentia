I had been excited to try Sorella after hearing that it opened and went in for lunch the other day.   First off, it's nice to have a restaurant that stays open 7 days a week and the decor on the inside is done very well. The service was good and people friendly. As far as the food goes, we had two pizzas.  One white pizza and one with red sauce.  I found them to fairfly priced, if not a little high.  They are just a little bigger than one person needs but not quite big enough to feed two people if you are hungry. I found the red sauce to be very good, but the pizza could have used a little more.  They were both cooked great in their pizza oven, but when compared to Krust in Middletown (they use the same oven) I was left a little dissapointed.   Overall though it's worth checking out for lunch/dinner or drinks as they have a decent beer selection as well.
