This is the best pizza place you can get in NYC. If I could eat here daily, I would as its awesome incarnate. If you are from the west coast, and love pizza this is the place for you. If your a local, and have good taste, this is the place to eat real pizza, not that NY or Chicago swill the rest try to pawn off as pizza.
