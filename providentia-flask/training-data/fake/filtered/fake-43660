Kale salad - delicious.  Moroccan Scramble - delicious.  Pancakes - according to husband, delicious.  Granola - delicious.  Hamburger (regular, not the Five Leaves special one) - very good.  Some kind of trout for dinner -- good but not great. The wait for a table - starting to become a deterrent.  Tables - too close together and too small -something falls off our table almost every single time.  Ambiance -  not particularly relaxing - you need to be in the mood for a lot of togetherness.
