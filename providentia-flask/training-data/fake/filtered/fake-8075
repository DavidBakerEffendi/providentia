When me and my boyfriend went inside mad asking for a refund and showing the cooks the bug inside our food other customers inside china pan started to ask what happen and wanted to see it Â was true because i heard what was going on. One of the person working their quickly gave us the money and told us to go because they did not want every one inside to here..SO PLEASE LISTEN TO THIS REVIEW AND DO NOT EAT THERE I FOUND A BIG BUG INSIDE OUR FOOD!!!!
