I went with 3 other friends and we ALL complained about the food. They microwave EVERYTHING. You can even hear the little *DING*  going off every 5 minutes  behind the curtain Vegan yes, but horrible food. Service was friendly.... but who cares about that when you're chewing freeze dried tofu sticks and room temperature microwaved noodles lightly sitting in mystery garlic sauce that resembles glue. I would consider returning if I was offered a bubble tea after nicely mentioning how displeased our meal was. Eek! Methinks not INDEED!
