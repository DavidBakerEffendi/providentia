I was taken to Dig Inn for the first time yesterday. Not always easy to find such excellent good late on a Sunday night, I was pleased to be able to choose from so many appealing options. As someone always looking for Gluten Free options, this was a hit. In addition to the delicious food, the staff was delicious as well. The Sunday night crew - Felicia, Ty, France's and Jamie were great...super welcoming and helpful to this first timer. As we were preparing to cash out, Felicia discovered it was my birthday and led all in a chorus of Happy Birthday and informed me that my meal was on the house. Is that great or what? So, if your in the mood for some great food and fantastic service, head to this Dig Inn location today.
