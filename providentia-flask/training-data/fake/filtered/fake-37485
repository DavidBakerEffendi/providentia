This place is amazing!  Great food, great service, and a really wonderful atmosphere.  I recommend it highly for a romantic dinner or even a group celebration. It's a beautiful place, designed and built by the owners, and they came back post-Hurricane Sandy even better than before.  Ben and his team really know how to run a first class restaurant, and, bonus! it's in one of the coolest neighborhoods in New York.
