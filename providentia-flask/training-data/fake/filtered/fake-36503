I had been looking forward to coming here, so on my last night in NYC for business, I had to make the trip. Without a reservation, and by myself, I was able to snag a seat at the bar where the chefs make the tapas. What an experience. The atmosphere, people, smells, food, wine and staff were all outstanding. I did not feel rushed or out of place like I do at a lot of NYC restaurants. The only problem is that with one person, I was only able to try 4 tapas and 1 dessert before I would explode. With 30+ options, the possibilities were endless. Manchego salad, glass of house cava, the razor clams (um, yum), pumpkin and goat cheese croquetas, oxtail stuffed piquillo pepper stew, homemade Catalan sausage, a glass of magnificent Temperanillo, and the Crema Catalana crime brûlée with fried and sugar-coated bay leaves. Oh, and a glass of sherry. Yep, awesomeness all around. I will be back!
