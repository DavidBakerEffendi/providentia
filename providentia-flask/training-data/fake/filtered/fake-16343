I went last week with a group of 8. Not bad for the price, but really nothing special. While there were plenty of options available for the small plates, there were only four options of large plates and I honestly wasn't interested in any of them. The sides they offered weren't so great either. Really appreciated the full bar, as most places in the area are BYOB. Although I went straight to the back to eat, the bar area in the front looked really nice. I think I would like to go back hang out up there, but I wouldn't necessarily go back for the restaurant side. The service was good. It's a very small place with a large wait staff, so there is always someone there when you need something.
