Worked in the restaurant business a long time and have recently come to NH. Have been to the same named place in SONO and enjoyed everything, atmosphere, food, drink and service, in NH tho... first off they act like the staff is all told on a daily basis they are better than everyone they will serve. But the real problem I had was I am almost positive that my food was partially microwaved! I heard the bartender refer to my order being done being "nuked" in 2 minutes and when my small plate of steak tips, Im pretty sure he meant microwaved when he said nuked. After that it was all cold plates for me and they did do a good job on everything else. Just not anything that needs to be nuked apparently.
