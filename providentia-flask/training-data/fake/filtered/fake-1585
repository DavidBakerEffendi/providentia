I get delivery from Gandhi at least once a week, and it is always fantastic. Today I brought a few of my friends to eat in the restaurant. It was AMAZING. The service was excellent, the food was even better without the short lag between preparation and delivery, and they threw in a few freebies. Three people ate until we were stuffed, but the bill only came to $36, AND we had leftovers. Bottom line: this is one of the best Indian places I've ever been to.
