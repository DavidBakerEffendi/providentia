I kind of like the no frills decor and the service was friendly but I really disliked the food. When you have only 8 items on the menu, you would think they would be perfected. We had 6 of the 8. The salad was so salty it was inedible., pulled pork was soooo dry it was like eating wood slivers (I did like the grits & gravy), and the fried chicken & waffles was a breaded, dry like it had been heated 3 times before, chicken breast on basically a flavorless eggo. We also had hush puppies which for some reason tasted like falafel and the last item was forgettable (literally). I visited in early summer so I hope they are heeding other similar reviews. This place could be awesome but it's horrible. I hate to diss the chef but its really not hard to do good comfort food consistantly. I hope the best for them but unless they change some things around..I don't know.
