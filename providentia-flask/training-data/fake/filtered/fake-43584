This was my second time here. The food is absolutely amazing. Prices are more than reasonable. The staff goes well above and beyond! I took a good friend out for their birthday this week. For dessert I mentioned that it was their birthday and asked for a candle. The waitress said no problem. The waitress kept coming back to apologize for the wait which I thought was more than ok since we needed a break from the large dinner. Upon the arrival of our dessert she apologized for the wait again and mentioned they had to go out to purchase candles. Wow!! This blew me away and on top of that I wasn't even charged for the dessert due to the birthday. You never find service this good anywhere anymore! 5 star restaurant and I'll be going back often! Great bartender as well!
