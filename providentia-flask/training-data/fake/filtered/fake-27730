Went here on sunday prior to the Jets playoff game with friends. I had previously heard that others were saying there would be a large wait, but due to the rain and off peak hours as soon as we walked in we got a half tray. Easily the best sicilian slice I have ever had. The corner slices are amazing and the sauce to cheese combination is perfect. A little grated parmesan and red pepper even brings out the flavor more.
