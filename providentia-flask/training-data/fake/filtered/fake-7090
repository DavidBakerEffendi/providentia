A great greek restaurant, and obviously it would be in Astoria. We got there right when it opened at noon and we had a huge party - 11 people. We sat outside and watched the place immediately fill up with hungry customers. We had grilled octopus and saganaki for appetizers, and both were delicious. If you like fish, order the fish. I had black sea bass which was very fresh and not a fishy taste at all. I ordered it de-boned but there were a little pieces of bone here and there, but not a big deal. We also ordered salmon and swordfish and they were both fresh and tasty. By the time we were ready to leave there was a line outside waiting to get in! We were lucky we beat the crowd- this place is popular, and has a good reason to be - the delicious greek food!
