I don't have a yelp account. I didn't (!) until right now! That's how moved I was by our experience. We sat and waited a while to be seated, which was fine. The most magical part of our lunch was our server. She first arrived to drop the specials board and lean it on the table next to us, which we both thought was a joke and then realized later definitely was not. She didn't point out the brunch specials board--which was unfortunate, since I didn't see it until after we ordered, and had some stuff that sounded great (cinnabun pancakes!) They were out of the soup (thanks). Wildly inconvenienced by our presence, she somehow managed to withstand our company while taking our order. Once the food came (which, in the kitchens defense, was good), she disappeared, never to return, until she took our plates after we had been waiting for some time to get the check. Here comes my favorite part: we had already discussed how awful the service was, how cold and rude the server was, and that we, people who have both worked in the device industry and NEVER leave less than 15-20% tips, would reward her with what she deserved: barely 10. When you use a card to pay for the check, it's run through a little tablet, which the server brought to our table. You're then made to select 15, 20, or 25% tip. Nope, nope, NOPE. This would've been okay to customize if she hadn't been STANDING OVER THE TABLE WATCHING. It was horribly, horribly awkward, unprofessional, and just....awful. She threw the card down on the table and said "have a good day" with some of the most impressive levels of disdain and sarcasm I've seen. Decent food, some of the worst service I've ever experienced in my life.
