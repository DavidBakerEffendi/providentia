The Little Owl really delivered on both cuisine and service.  While the  service is formal,  the atmosphere is casual. .  We all agreed that the meatball sliders were a favorite. We ordered one for everyone at the table.  The bronzino was amazing and so were the steaks.   It was an altogether ideal dining experience.
