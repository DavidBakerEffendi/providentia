Had to grab a quick lunch before catching our flight out of NYC.  Had seen the zagat review signs in the window and the clerk at the hotel recommended it.  Food was good and fast!  The server was really nice and allowed us to sit by the windows as we had our luggage with us.  We also had some drinks we wanted to consume before going to the airport and upon asking the server if we could drink it in the restaurant, he allowed us to do so! I'd like to be able to try a few other dishes, but that will have to wait until we go back! I'd recommend going with several other people and eating family style, as with any asian restaurant, so that you can try several dishes without getting overstuffed or breaking the bank!
