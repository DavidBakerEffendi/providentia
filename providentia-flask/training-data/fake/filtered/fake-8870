Name says Dosa Express so you expect at least the Dosa to be up to the mark...not really...it was awful...Not sure how many people have rated it well..As far as South Indian food goes this place doesn't even deserve a single star...Also the cashier present at the time i visited was very rude and unhelpful who doesn't know how to deal with customers..
