We so glad there's another all you can eat place that can actually seat in with party of 10, seating area were much bigger than sushi palace which is few miles down to south and tonight Â were full house and lucky that my bf call for reservation ahead. The food was good, i like it because they don't stuff lots of rices on the rolls so you can eat more, unlike other places stuffing more rices on the rolls and fill you up so fast. Clean and comfortable and services is excellence. Is good for family and kids.
