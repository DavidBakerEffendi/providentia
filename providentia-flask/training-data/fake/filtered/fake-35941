This place is hidden away in a post-industrial neighborhood. The pizza was pretty good, but expensive for the size of the pie. I would give it three or four stars, if it was only for the food, but... the service was less than stellar, to be diplomatic. The hostess seemed more concerned with not seating people than with seating people. And the waitress couldn't be bothered to tell us about any specials - she just pointed to the chalkboard. The worst part was the noise level. There was some sort of bridge & tunnel dance party going on outside, and the late 90's style DJ was dropping out the sound so people could finish the phrase, "Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough". After about an hour, I had enough.
