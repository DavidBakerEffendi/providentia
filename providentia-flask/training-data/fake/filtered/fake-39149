Five Guys is right around the corner, so it's hard to not have them in mind when you stop in here.  Although, this is the same burger that they sell at Rogue without the high price tag, so expectations were high. (Here's a picture of the menu mylatestdistraction.com/… if you want to see what they have to offer) Cheeseburger for $5.75, and fries for $1.50 is reasonable enough, but $5.00 for a shake?  That's when I really hoped it would be worth it.  Unfortunately it was not. The Burger was not too bad, a lot of people say they are small, but they're not.  They just look that way because they are taller, instead of wider.  They're good and you can specify the level of doneness, but they're not great. The fries were horrible.  Dry, and most crunchy.  (Edit: Okay, I went back to 500 degrees, and tried their truffle fries, and they were cooked a lot better this time around.  Although, they were softer than they should have been.  Hopefully they'll get it right sooner or later) The milkshake was good, but that's ice cream, milk, and a blender, it's hard to go wrong with that. Overall, it's probably worth trying, but with Five Guys so close, you will probably find yourself wishing you went the extra block in that direction.
