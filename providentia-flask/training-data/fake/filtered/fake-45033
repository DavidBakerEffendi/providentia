Eggs Benedict was outstanding !! Service was attentive, food came out fast .. The only down side for myself not giving "Cafe Henri" more than 3 stars, is the disappointment of their baguette, they were hard and croissants were doughy and not airy and crisp when bitten into.  if they Ordered their breads from Balthazar in the city and had them delivered daily,  this place would definitely be a contender with Manhattan French bistros !!
