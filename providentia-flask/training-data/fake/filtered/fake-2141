Todd I'm not sure if your taste buds weren't working but this is the BEST pizza in town by FAR....to say that the sause tasted like ketchup, what do you work for Rockies or something? For everyone out there in the burlington area you should definatly try this place - it has a friendly staff and GREAT pizza - buffalo chx is my favorite!
