So me and my wife went to this place for our anniversary and from the ambiance we were ready for a hell of an experience, because it was gorgeous.  I'm sorry to say the food hardly met expectation.  The place was not busy by any means so I expected the chefs to handle our food with a little more care.  It just tasted like a lot of burnt shell fish from the grill and we didn't order anything from the grill.  The only thing that made up for the dinner was the cheese cake was friggin great.  I have had better in Greek dives.
