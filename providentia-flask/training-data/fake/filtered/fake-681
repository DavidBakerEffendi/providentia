This place was excellent both times I've been there.  The first time I went for a quick lunch with a friend who works right across the street.  I got the pizza special and it was amazing.  The pizza was delicious, and the portion was enormous for the price.  The staff was also the absolute nicest group of workers I've ever experienced in Philadelphia. The second time, I went for a later lunch with different friends and had a hoagie.  It was also really good, and the price was entirely reasonable for the large serving size.  The atmosphere is relaxing, they're not pushing you out when you sit and talk for hours and they're incredibly nice.  I definitely recommend it.
