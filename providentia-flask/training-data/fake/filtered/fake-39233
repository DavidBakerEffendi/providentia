Seven adults and two children had dinner on Mother's day.  A variety of items were ordered including two different shrimp dishes, a veal dish, fish, a lasagna and pasta with "Gennaros gravy" (meatball, sausage and Braciola).  Everyone was very happy with their meals, with several saying that it was the best they've ever had of the particular dish that they ordered.  The desserts were outstanding as well. In addition to the quality of the dishes, the prices need to be mentioned.  Each dish was priced a few dollars less than other comprable neighborhood Italian restaurants. Couple their prices with the BYOB policy for wine, and you can experience a good tasting, authentic casual Italian meal for a very reasonable price.
