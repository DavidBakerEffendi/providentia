Dragonfly: We are begging you-- PLEASE fix your service! We love everything else but HATE the service. We've been here so many times and it's always the same. Everyone (hostesses, waiters and waitresses, and bartenders) seems bored and uninterested in doing anything besides socializing with each other. Busboys roam around looking lost. Groups of three or four waiters and waitresses will stand around having a conversation while their tables scan the restaurant wondering where everyone is. And I've never even seen a manager. That being said-- the sushi is fantastic. Always fresh, very creative, and delicious. Every menu item I've tried was great, and they change it up every once in awhile to give it some variety. Honestly, this place is pricey for an average night out but it's the only place in the area with decent sushi which is why we are still customers. We've started just ordering takeout from here instead of dining in because the service is sub-par, resulting in lots of missed alcohol revenue for them. Â  Please fix your service! You've got something that could be quite special-- don't ruin it with bad service.
