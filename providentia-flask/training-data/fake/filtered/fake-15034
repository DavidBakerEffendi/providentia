Food is AMAZING!!!! Can not emphasize enough. The renovation fits perfect and the service is excellent. I recommend the Shish Kebab and Adana Kebab. I had gotten a combination with both and could not make a decision which was better- absolutely amazing. The squash salad and Shepard salad were on another level of excellent. I was there this past Saturday and good thing that I had made reservations. weekends seem very busy so call in advance! Must try!!
