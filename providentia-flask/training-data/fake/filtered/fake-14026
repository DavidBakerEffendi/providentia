Had a very strange and unsettling experience when I paid the bill.  I was there with five friends  and put the tab on my credit card.  My card was not returned with my receipt.  I double checked to see if I had put it in my purse, before I left for a long trip home.  I approached my waitress at the register who said I must be mistaken.  When she reluctantly checked in the back, she came back with my card and said she left it by the machine.  The machine was up front, where I approached her, so I don't know where she looked.  I almost went home before checking, thinking I must have put my card away.  I have never had an experience like this, and don't know what to make of it.  I will definitely not be back.
