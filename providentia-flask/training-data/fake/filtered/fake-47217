A real disappointment After hearing better than average reviews, we gave it shot.  The place is pretty and nicely laid out.  The food unfortunately demonstrated that this is a substandard Italian restaurant with a pretentious wait staff and inflated price.    The area has much better Italian food available at comparable or lower prices.  Look around, you can easily do better.
