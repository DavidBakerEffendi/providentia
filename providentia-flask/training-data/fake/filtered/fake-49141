Salute to Salute!!!  Last night 3/8/2014, 13 people attended this wonderful restaurant.  Arrangements were made for appetizers to be served when we arrived.  They were ready and delicious.  Garlic bread, sweet potato ravioli, veggie spring rolls, fried calamari and mussels.  Everyone couldn't wait for the main entre to arrive.  We all had something different and everyone thought they were equally superb.  The wait staff was so attentive to our large crowd.  We didn't feel rushed, we felt like family. I want to thank Jimmy Cosgrove for taking care of all my requests and making our experience at Salute one of the best nights out in Hartford in a long time.  Thanks again Jimmy!!!
