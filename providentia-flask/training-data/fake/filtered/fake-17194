The BEST Soul Food I have ever had!  I ordered the smothered chicken with mac & cheese and rice and gravy with a lemonade and banana bread pudding for dessert.  The meat was so tender it was falling off the bone, the mac & cheese was perfect and the banana bread pudding (which is made from scratch) was one of a kind! Denise was very helpful and friendly and Napoleon himself even came out to speak with us.  I look forward to going back very soon!
