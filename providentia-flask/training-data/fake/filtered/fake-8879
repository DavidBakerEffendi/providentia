This is probably the meanest restaurant I've ever been to. These people (especially the lady with tattooed eyebrows) takes your order like you owe her something. She raises them up to her hairline when you ask for an extra bowl of sambhar. Speaking of sambhar bowls, why not just have customers self serve like everywhere else instead of giving medicine cup sized bowls? There is no such thing as hygiene at this place. Tables are always dirty and sticky, bathrooms always have doo-doo floating in toilet, floors always have dust balls rolling around, NONE OF THE EMPLOYEES WEAR GLOVES! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS! SPEND AN EXTRA BUCK OR TWO AND VISIT A QUALITY AND CLEANER PLACE AND ONE THAT DOESN'T TREAT YOU LIKE CRAP BUT A LOYAL PAYING CUSTOMER!
