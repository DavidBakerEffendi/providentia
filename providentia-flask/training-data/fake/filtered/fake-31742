Totally Avoid for hosting parties! I was planning a luncheon party for a gathering of about 12-15 families.  Spoke on phone with an individual called Michael, gave him all the details and worked out a per pax, all tax and gratuities inclusive rate. He sought permission from someone and confirmed to the date, menu and rates.  However, when I went to give the money for booking, he started to re-negotiate, eventually passing it on to another individual who started by saying that a minimum of 30 adults and 15 kids is what he would charge for and that the agreed rate would be higher than what we discussed and that the 18% gratuity would be above and beyond that. He did mention slyly that if I paid in cash, I would not have to pay the 7% tax that he lawfully owes to the government! Due to this dishonest attitude and total lack of ability to honor commitments, I have decided to go with another establishment for my party.  If you are looking for a similar get together, suggest that you look elsewhere. I have previously had lunches and dinner here and in my opinion, the quality of food is inconsistent.  Sometimes it tastes great but on other occasions horrible.  Service is consistently slow and leaves much to be desired.
