This place was a breath of fresh air when I moved into the neighborhood and anyone seeking an Italian sandwich experience needs to come get a wiff. The owner, Joe, is the heart of the operation and an overall great guy. I've tried many sandwiches, some of which are traditional and some are a bit unique... don't be afraid, if it sounds good, it really is. The biggest plus for me is their dark Italian roast. Nothing reminds me of being an Italian in Brooklyn than walking down the street, one hand on my chicken parm, the other on my dark Italian roast. You must go here. I'm putting my foodie card on it.
