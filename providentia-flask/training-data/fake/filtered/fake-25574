Great food, waitress (think she was part owner or owner) was kind of rude/attitude-y. She wouldn't let us order an appetizer before we ordered our entree. Made us order all together and our entree's came out about 10 mins afterwards. Every other employee was very nice & helpful. Food was excellent, great prices. Paid $23.00 for appetizer and two entrees. Excellent! I live across the street so I will come here again :)
