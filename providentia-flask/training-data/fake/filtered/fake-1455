Of all the traditions one would leave behind when coming from Europe, an afternoon Kaffee und Kuchen, I could not bear to sacrifice. I come to Cafe Sabarsky for a quick lunch or 4pm pick-me-up. The menu is authentic, though slightly inconsistent. As an example, the Goulash is lacking and the desserts...well it's hard matching to what I am used. However, the service is top. Waiters are intelligent, multilingual and prompt. If not for this, I would give a three star review. All considered, I do recommend.
