like the food! but dont come to this place after happy hour (7pm) my friend and i each had a salad and 2 very small glasses of wine and the bill with tax (and they take cash only) $88...please management dont charge $13 for a tiny glass of wine. your wine prices are not listed anywhere other wise i would have avoided paying $52 for wine.
