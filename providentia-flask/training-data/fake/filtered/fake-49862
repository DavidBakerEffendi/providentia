Was a regular patron of this health food store.  I'm sure many others who patronize this health food store will agree, loved it. A lot of people are allergic to soy and many other natural herbs. For those who have special taste, let the owners know -  change is good for every one!! Give them a chance to change to the needs of the new consumer. Valli
