I was so excited to go to the restaurant.... knowing that there were going to be kinks they had to work out.  However, the food was amazing....  We've been back every week since the opening.  Each week it gets better and better.  The home made pasta is incredible, the Risotto, Sea Bass, Rib steak I think we tried it all!   We were there just last week, the service was right on target, much improved over the last month.  Our food came to our table in a timely fashion and it was delicious!   We'll be back again...  So glad everything is moving more smoothly then it was.. We knew it would be a matter of time!!!! Thank you, Sirina C
