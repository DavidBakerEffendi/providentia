I loved this restaurant. The decor was fabulous and the food was even better. I have not had too much Brazilian so I will admit that I don't have much to compare it to, but I was incredibly impressed. The calamari was fantastic, comparable only to Agave. I had the red snapper. It was served in a delicious (and not too heavy) cream sauce and topped with bell peppers. It was served with a simple trice which was a nice contrast to the complex flavors of the fish.
