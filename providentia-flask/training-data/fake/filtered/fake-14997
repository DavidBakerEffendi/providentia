Great place to get a variety of food in you and maybe sober up a little after a wild drunken night in (fill in the blank) where your friends repeatedly told you to "dude, seriously, calm down on that stuff.". The waitresses hate making milkshakes but i'm a huge fan of Kelis so get one anyway. It's a pretty good diner. I want to give it three out of five but I've had so many good times here that I feel obligated to give them four. Enjoy.
