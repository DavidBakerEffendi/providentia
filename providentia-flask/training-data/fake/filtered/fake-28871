All I can say is "MMMM"!  This place deserves five hundred stars!  My boyfriend and I either pick it up or we call in for delivery, and either way, there's hardly any wait.  The food is delcious!  I can't express this enough.  I once ordered a pizza with extra cheese, and they piled it on!   You can also order their hot dishes, i.e. the ravioli, and you get salad and soft bread in the shape of triangles.  I love that!  I highly approve of their friendly service, and the prices are quite reasonable.  : )
