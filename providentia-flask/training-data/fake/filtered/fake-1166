Our second visit with a family group, and the combination of food and service is excellent. Specializing in panini with a wide variety of pork meats, this deli turned restaurant is small but well worth the visit. Good wine and beer list. Access by subway or cab is preferred, as street parking is tight. Highly recommended.
