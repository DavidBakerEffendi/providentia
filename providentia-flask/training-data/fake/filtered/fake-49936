I've been going there for more than 40 years. I've always wondered what the big deal was. Perhaps if the employees would make you feel more welcome and realize that WE the consumers put the food on their tables, they might have more business. I guess when you own the property and have built a reputation on a myth, you don't have to worry about repeat business. Never mind going inside to sit, where they look at you as if you interrupted their slumber. This dive passes itself for a dump with no respect for sanitation and health concerns and it does a very good job at it. Bulldoze it, fire the entire staff and start from scratch.
