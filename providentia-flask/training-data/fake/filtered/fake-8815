I've been going here for years and it's the best bar and restaurant in PS.  The food can be pricey to some but it's worth every penny.  Perfect waiters and the best bartenders in the neighborhood. My only (minor) complaint is that they aren't open as late as they used to be years ago.  Cold lobster at 3 a.m.?  Beautiful. Forgot to mention some of what I had here: lobster, crab, steamed clams, duck sandwich, seafood paella, peel and eat shrimp, oyster bar - which is one of the best in the city.
