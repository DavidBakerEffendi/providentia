Max and I went here last week. I work around the corner so I've been anticipating the opening of this place for a while now. Here it goes. The pizza is traditional italian brick oven. It reminds me of places I visited in italy. The ingredients are fresh. The size of the pizza is enough for one person so you may want to get two pizzas and to split between two people but also to try two different flavors. The wait staff like Max said was overly nice, seeing as how it was there opening week and they wanted good reviews but they also seemed like genuinely cared and seeing as how the place is so tiny its hard for someone to not be attentive. Max had the Margherita, while I went with a white sauce pizza that had brocoli and other cheeses on it. The pizza was thin and crispy. Made to order. I didn't try any of their appetizers but they were reasonably priced and looked really interesting. As far as drinks go I only had beer. A Troeg (Hop Back?) and a Hop Devil. They were complimentary because Zavino is still trying to get its license. My only complaints were that the restaurant is tiny so if it gets crowded it can be a little bit of a jam. T Check this place out you won't be disappointed.
