Only one visit. The waitress was looking elsewhere while she tried to put the straw across the glass...3 times.. until she finally looked and hit the mark. My calzone was burnt, my friend's ravioli under cooked after waiting nearly 45 minutes for the meal. We just ate it because we had tickets for a show or else we would have walked out. I wanted to show the manager the food but, the busboy asked if we were done and quickly dumped our plates. All this for over $30? Â Not again for sure.
