The atmosphere is enough to go back again and again, and the menu items are appealing and very tasty. Their grilled pork chop  is something special-- simple ingredients that make it pure magic!  I'm just too busy shoveling the savory down my throat once I start! Fun casual place. Very good reasonably priced comfort food.
