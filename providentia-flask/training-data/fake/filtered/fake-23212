I went with my 2 grown children and my husband to celebrate his birthday. I had made reservations and the table was waiting for us. We enjoyed sangria and cucumber margaritas along with guacamole, quesadillas and cheese chorizo fondue to start. All delicious! Guacamole was so fresh and amazing! After that we had dinner. All exquisite. For dessert the donuts as well as the brownie were a great end to an amazing birthday celebration. Waitress and waiters were all friendly and most attentive! Thank you for a fabulous evening!
