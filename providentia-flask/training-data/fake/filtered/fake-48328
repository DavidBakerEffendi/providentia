This place is overrated, their food is nothing special, way over priced, $9.00 for cheese steak, their service sucks bad.  Impatient assholes that give you 2 seconds to make a decision, take your money, shove the food at you and move you on.  I am not impressed, do not see the allure to this shit bag place, will not spend my money there again, the need a wake up call.  I would love to compete against these jerks, easy picking.
