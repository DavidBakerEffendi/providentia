This used to be my favorite yakitori joint in the country - after living in Japan for eight years, I thought I had finally found my little piece of heaven. Recently, however, the place has taken a real turn for the worse. The tofu, once my favorite, had a mildewy aftertaste. The beef was chewy at best. At the end of the meal, the waitress spilled hot sake on my pregnant wife's leg! I'd recommend staying away until this clear decline in quality is reversed.
