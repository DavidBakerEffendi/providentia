My buddy and I stayed at the Doubletree by the airport, got here really late after the Superbowl, and were starving.  This place appeared to be our only option for late night delivery, and the reviews here had me scouring the internet to find other options, but at 1:00am we were out of luck.  We felt like we'd have to eat terrible pizza, or go hungry.  We decided to risk it, and devoured the pizza in about 5 minutes.  We were both surprised at the reviews because the pizza was actually pretty good.  I'd order again without hesitation in the same situation, and if you were wondering, no, I'm not a pizza hut fan, and not a frozen pizza fan.  I like good quality pizza, and this was worth eating.  I'm glad I went against the advice  on this one.
