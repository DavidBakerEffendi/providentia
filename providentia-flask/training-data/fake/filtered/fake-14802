Almost missed out on a great meal because of some of the other reviews here.  My husband and I had a wonderful evening here. Our waiter and waitstaff was wonderful. We had Antonio, he was very charming and attentive.  Our drinks and food arrived quickly and our water glasses were never empty. We had the the mozz red pepper spring rolls for 8$ there were 6 of them! Excellent for sharing but more than we could eat so they were happy to wrap them up for us. My husband had the pan fried chicken parm. Large portions and delicious. I had the eggplant parm and substituted the whole wheat pasta for no extra charge. Fyi the eggplant is thick cut but cooked perfect, i like thick personally because you can actually taste the eggplant, not just fried breadcrumb pattys. Both priced very reasonably for the portion size. DO NOT SKIP on dessert. We had the spiced chia bread pudding and it was Amazing! I would go back just for that. I think we have a winner for this location with centro.  Cant wait to go back and try some of those martinis.
