Love the "oldschool"  serious drinking establishment vibe.  Where else can you find a bar that has an old fridge with a tap sticking out behind the bar? The food is cheaply priced and very tasty, the waitstaff friendly and the beers varied and good. It can get a little crowded waiting for table sometimes on fridays after work, so you might want to miss that, but otherwise it's great for bite and a beer.
