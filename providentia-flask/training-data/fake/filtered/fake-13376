Love this place! It was questionable in the past but the newest owner/mgmt have done a great job. Happy hour specials are awesome. Nightly events like burger night Â Wednesday and tap takeover Tuesday keep us coming back. The chef is amazing! Definitely don't judge a book by it's cover. This is some of the best food in the area. Not just bar food either! Over 20 beers on tap feature some tasty micro-brews and are constantly changing. The wait staff and bar tenders are very friendly and attentive. A friendly reminder to drink responsibly. Do not drink and drive. The local small town PD love to stake this place out.
