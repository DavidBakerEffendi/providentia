Ok so here it goes...I'm not much of a reviewer however, the experience here was compeling. I came with 2 other friends on Friday evening and we didnt have reservations. So the hostess said they didn't have any tables available then asked If we would like to sit at the bar, so we did. The bartender introduced himself (Jason) and asked what we were in the mood for. So I told him nothing too sweet and something very refreshing. He says ok do you like tomatoes? I said usually only in my bloody mary. He said well its not a bloody mary and that he was showcasing tomato more as a fruit then a vegetable. I was like ok...sure why not never tried tomatoes in my cocktail before. Let me say by far one of the best friggn cocktails I have had in my whole entire LIFE! Our other friend showed up and we were hungry, Jason asked if we had resevations and we said no! He said well why didn't you tell me that you needed a table..?.. 10 minutes later we were sat in the dining room. Â Service was great! Very busy restaurant. Just moved to neighborhood and tried Salinas on friends recommendations. GREAT Local spot and LOVED the fire place! Will definately be back. Make reservations this place is busy!! Dana
