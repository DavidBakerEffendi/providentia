I have been to Nyonya a few times over the years and each time the quality and quantity had been going down.  The only one thing that keeps going up is the price.  The roti canai was warm and soggy.  And chicken satay was warm too.  Personally, I think these were just re-heated.  My friends ordered the seafood casserole and it was mostly vegetable.  There was only 3 shrimps and a few pieces of fried tofu.  I ordered the beef chow fun...there was hardly any beef to be found.  I also noticed the food portion got a lot smaller.  If I paid two dollars more for the beef chow fun in a Chinese restaurant, I get about two times their portion.  As for the service, I feel rushed by the waitress.  We got the bill before we finished eating.  This restaurant was a disappointment.  I am sure there's other Malaysian restaurants in NYC that you can get better value for your money.
