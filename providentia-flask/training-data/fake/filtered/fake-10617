This is my favorite Mexican restaurant! I'm very picky about Mexican food and jalape√±o heaven hits it on the head every time! I've been dining there for 15+years and always get refrained beam burrito, shaved steak burrito, and/or the guacamole. Everything is good! The cocktails are delish and everything's always fresh!
