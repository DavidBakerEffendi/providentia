Finally got around to join yelp and this had to be the first place I give my 5 stars to!! I am an avid health food eater - this is my #1 choice on Staten Island! Besides the food being on point for the past 8 years of me eating there, the staff is always so friendly and helpful! The place itself is just so cool.  I would rather wait 15 mins for a wrap that is FRESH and not pre-cooked (collecting bacteria).  The juice is literally dripping off of my wrap! Veggies are always fresh, salads always on point.  If I could give Better 10 stars I would.  Go to Mc Donald's for fast food - go to Better for GOOD food! Keep doing it guys!!! LOVE IT
