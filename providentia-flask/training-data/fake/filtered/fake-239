Best cheesesteaks in Philly? A definite NO. I've found more flavor in a microwave sandwich. In combination to the unappealing food you've got the unappealing "staff" who acted like they just hate their customers. Combine the last element a gawdy right wing "God bless America and nowhere else" element made the whole experience unpleasant. Seriously they had "freedom fries" on the menu. I must have fallen into a time warp because apparently it was 2003 there. Also, I'm from the US and I really wanted to order in German just to make them angry over the "speak American" sign. I like my fast food to come without a political message being forced down my throat. Geno's is a long lined, unfriendly, overtly political, tourist trap serving overpriced and bland food. Also if you are a foreign tourist, or have some difficulty speaking English I'd check to make sure they didn't spit in your food. Best part of Geno's? Leaving Geno's and resolving never to return.
