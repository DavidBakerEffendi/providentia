We came here recently for our first time, we got a table right away and were excited to finally check out all the hype. Food was good and our server was knowledgeable. The manager (a woman) came by our table to check on how things were, which we told her all was well and thanked her for double checking. She was nice, however, and to put it lightly, she smelled quite awful. To be honest, I was glad I was already done with my meal or else it would've ruined my appetite.... Anyways, we will definitely return in the future since the burgers were delicious and the beer selection was awesome.
