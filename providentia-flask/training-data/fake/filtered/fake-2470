I loved my experience here! I had been to the Khyber before, when it was a rock bar. I really didn't expect much when my friends suggested we eat there there. It was late, and I had been working all day. I met three of my friends who work in Old City for a late dinner. It was amazing! I had the shrimp and roast beef po'boy. It was heaven-everything I needed it to be. The menu clearly explained all of the ingredients served on the po'boy. I lived in Louisiana for a while, and I can tell you that this was one of the best po'boys I have ever had! The collard greens were perfectly spiced, the mac and cheese was to die for. One of my friends ordered the brisket, which was juicy, fall-apart delicious. Someone else had the vegan chicken po'boy, which was NOT lacking in chicken goodness (seitan is wonderful stuff). The other po'boy was the roast beef with cheese, and it was so good! I haven't been able to stop talking about this meal for days. The beer selection is great. I didn't try the mint julep, but I've heard it's good. The jukebox has a wide selection of music, and the service was great. Everyone who worked there was really nice, and knew the specific ingredient details about the menu. I don't get to that neighborhood often, but when I do I will be eating there. The Khyber's food makes living in the North a lot easier on this Southern girl.
