Extremely unhygienic. I and my wife ordered Thali. They gave papad as a starter. After we finished the papad, i happened to accidentally remove the paper in the tray they served papad. I found a half eaten roti from somebody else!. How disgusting is it when you are served something on top of somebody else's  leftover  food. I have no trust in the way they prepare food on cleanliness. I am an indian and have been eating in  indian restaurants for years in the united states.  Have never got grosed out like this. Although this was the chef's fault as admitted by the manager, they posed a "sorry figure" by sending one of the server and making him to ask sorry. The food taste was average, not to crave for. Would never go again and will spread the word on this horrible incident.
