My wife and I stop here almost every day! She's getting hooked on the smoothies!  (Me too!) She can't do dairy, gluten, and soy, so the food from here is about all she eats.. The people are friendly and helpful, and for a small place, they have lots of goodies!  They always have the bread my wife can eat, and the muffin tops she loves! I can eat just about anything but I love the Kombucha selection! We've bulk-ordered at the Lambertville a few times.. That's a little ride. A+A+A+
