We have lived in East Windsor for about 20 years so we have frequented this diner many, many times.  Over the past 3 years or so we keep commenting how disappointed we are.  Their takeout portions are getting smaller and smaller and they seem to be charging extra for every little thing.   Today I visited for breakfast with a friend and our waitress was very lacking.  She had a disinterested attitude, would forget things, and when she couldn't be found, we looked over and she was reading a magazine at the counter.  When we asked for more jelly, she literally rolled her eyes.  She brought out more homemade marmalade and pear jelly?  I just wanted a little smear of Smuckers!  We were informed they don't carry that anymore.   They are not a diner any more.  If you're looking for something more, I guess this is it, but give me back the old Americana
