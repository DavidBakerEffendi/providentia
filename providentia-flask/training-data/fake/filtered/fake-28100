This place is super cute. Too bad the owners ruin it. There was a really nice bartender there, who I really liked. She was extremely knowledgeable about the wines and beer. But the owners, one of them a micromanaging b$#&*... she would interrupt her at all times, yelling at her to do something else. The girl was working extremely hard, and wasn't doing a thing wrong by helping me and my friends pick out a wine to share. The other owner, well, let's just put it this way, 2 completely condescending people running a place, who treat their staff like crap. I don't know how they keep their staff there. One owner was telling her to turn the music up (it was quite loud enough as it was) and the other owner was telling her to turn it DOWN... Come ON! Â I was completely uncomfortable. I have passed by a couple of times to see if the girl I liked so much was ever there again. I think she may have had the confidence to say to hell with them. Seriously, I was SO UNCOMFORTABLE there. And the wine selection was OK, not great, and the food was decent. I would only have gone back to see the great bartender/server I had. But I doubt I will EVER go back otherwise.
