We got a gift certificate here, and loved every bite. We'd be wanting to come here forever, and got to splurge on a three course dinner. The waitstaff was very attentive and knowledgeable, courteous. Food was fantastic, if the roasted bone marrow is on the menu, get it. We also had lamb and scallops, which were both perfect. All around a great experience. I would definitely recommend, and very highly! A+
