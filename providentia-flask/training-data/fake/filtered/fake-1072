As a server myself, I usually work brunch on the weekends.  This past weekend I ended up having Sunday off and was so excited to go to brunch.  We chose the Continental based on past experiences there (mostly drinking and apps) and recommendations from friends.  However, I was very disappointed and wish I'd used my one rare Sunday off having brunch anywhere else.  I was told I had to try the blueberry pancakes, so that is what I ordered -however, I was told by the server that Continental doesn't have blueberry pancakes.  She said it like I was an idiot and they never existed - although Blueberry Pancakes are a menu item.  I went with my second choice, pumpkin waffles.  These sounded good so everything was ok.  When my mimosa arrived, I was expecting a little more than a champagne flute (some local places do pint glasses of mimosas) for $10.  This was also fine though because I was mostly excited for breakfast.  When my breakfast arrived (a couple minutes AFTER my side of bacon...) the waffles were cold.  Cold enough that the butter I put on them did not melt in the slightest.  I hate complaining and also hate when customers write on here in leui of complaining, but the server did not come back to check on us so I didn't have the opportunity to tell her my feelings.  If she had asked about our meal, I would have just mentioned the temperature and skipped this whole review.  Either way, I ate 3 out of the 4 waffles.  They were ok... but just ok.  I tried to venture away from the normal brunch places but won't make that mistake again.
