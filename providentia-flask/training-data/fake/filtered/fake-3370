Tried to walk in at 4:30pm yesterday without a reservation and were told it'd be a 40min wait; walked to the nearest bar to have a drink and returned when they texted only to be told we missed our window and would have to wait another 30minutes! We practically sprinted down the block to get there within 10minutes of their text and even after texting "we're on our way" as we walked, they still didn't hold a table for us. We simply couldn't enjoy the meal after receiving such poor treatment simply to get a table! Will never attempt to go again.
