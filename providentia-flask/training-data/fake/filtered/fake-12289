Now this place is legit. I was brought here by the GF a few weeks back and I could not have asked for more.  First off the bread basket is absolutely out of this world.  Very solid... There really is not much to say about this place besides that it is a must try.  Everything we had was fantastic and I am sure everything on the menu is as well.   Also went to brunch last weekend.  Equally as good.  5 stars.  Awesome..
