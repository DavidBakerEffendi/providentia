Short weight. For the past three years I have purchased my Christmas fish from this store.The fish is fresh and of good quality. The first year it was short weight and I considered it an honest mistake. The second year I again weighed my fish and found it to be short; I returned and was given the missing weight. This year my 5 pounds of shrimp weighed 4 pounds 10 ounces. Why is it that a store that sells fish by the pound does NOT have a certified scale for customers to verify the weights? State law requires a certified scale for customers to verify the weight of fish at purchase. This merchant always counts the money customers give him to verify that it's correct. The customers must also have the ability to verify if the purchase weight is correct, especially at these prices.
