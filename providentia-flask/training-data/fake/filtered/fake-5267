Took my wife and kid to have lunch, very disappointed. I should have known this is not an authentic Mexican place. Their servings are for children-after lunch we grab some buns in chinatown. Food is mediocre, if you really want real Mexican food this is not the place. The sides are a joke-I got the tortilla for $3.00 and they gave me like 4 really tiny tortillas, maybe I'm used to real authentic tortilla but this thing is really a joke. This is trying to be cool tortilla but if you are really hungry this is not cool.....
