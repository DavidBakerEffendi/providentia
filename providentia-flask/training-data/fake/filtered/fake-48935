Almond has it all. The service is amazing - Vanessa was particularly wonderful, and the management is also the best I've seen in a long time, particularly Candace. The ambiance is comfortable and chic, without being over the top. Plus it has the option for outdoor seating. I love having the option of sitting on the patio. On top of all that you have amazing food and drinks for good value. The pomegranite martini my favorite - the cinnamon sugar rub around the edge of the glass makes the drink. I would dare say they might have the best macaroni and cheese in the city - complete with hefty shavings of black truffles and prosciutto. The mussels are also delicious. They're soaked in a beautiful white wine, sauce toped with shallots and parsley. They are perfectly cooked - not a chewy one in the bunch! the large order is perfect for sharing 4, or as an entree. And the classic croque monsieur brings me back to the streets of Paris. As an added bonus, they have "disco fries" - otherwise known as Cheese Fries Quebecoise. They're crispy, perfectly fried shoestring fries covered in gravy, and cheese. It doesn't get better than that. I highly recommend you try this place, and you won't be disappointed.
