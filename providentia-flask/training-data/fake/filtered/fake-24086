Had a fantastic dinner here with my girlfriend this past Saturday.  We both ordered the tasting menu.  Everything was excellent.  The chicken liver toasts with apricot were remarkable.  I loved the halibut with beluga lentils.  The cheese plate was fantastic, especially the Maytag Bleu paired with dried figs.   Our waitress was great too.  The whole waitstaff did a great job of changing our silverware and clearing our plates. Chef O'Shea should be congratulated for such a wonderful job.
