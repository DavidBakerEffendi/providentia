It's as good a look at Italy as it gets... that's the purpose of this 'store'.  I'm sorry so many went with a different expectation.  Having been to the first location in Torino, this one is a good replica. Wander.  Browse.  Taste.  Experience. Notice the Tshirts staff wears:  a quote from Slow Food founder, Carlo Petrini, reminding us that food should be "good, clean, fair". He influenced the founders of the original Eataly. I went to get some flavors and textures of Italy - and found a few dozen pasta varieties I have never seen in the US.  And Eataly is not a linear experience - it wouldn't be Italian!!  The crowds have dimmed the impression of the eateries and browsing was difficult.  This review distinguishes between the impact of too many people (e.g., Sat. at 2 pm), misconceptions about what the place is about,  and the beauty of what Italy offers inside.
