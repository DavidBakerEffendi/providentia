overhyped considering the quality and taste: went with a large group and was not really impressed by the food. Â we ordered the large tier of seafood for our appetizer, and the delivery was the only thing awe-inspiring about it. sure, the preshucked cockles, oysters and mussels were tasty but way overpriced. i also ordered the beet salad (typical) and shared the salt crusted red snapper with my boyfriend. it was VERY fishy smelling (not a good sign) and i felt sick after eating a few bites. this place seems sorta gimmicky to me ..i have no desire to go back. a big dissapointment
