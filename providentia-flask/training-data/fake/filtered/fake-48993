We moved to Montclair from Hoboken (where there is excellent delicious pizza) a few months ago and have been trying all the pizza places and looking for a good one that delivers (we have 2 young kids and need the convenience).   The sausage pizza was pretty tasty with thinner crust which we like and good sauce and cheese.  The sausage was good too.  Plus the order of hot wings was very good (not sure how you can screw up hot wings but we've had bad ones before from other places).  An order of spaghetti with meatballs was just ok - we'll save the leftovers but probably would not order again.  The food was remarkably piping hot which is not a requirement but was a nice change from other delivery places. Delivery time was about 10 minutes later than they said - not an issue. I can't say they hit it out of the ballpark with the pizza but apparently we've found some of the better pizza in the area in Bloomfield and we'll save their number on our cell phone for future delivery pizza cravings.  When we want to get in the car, we'll go back to Ah'Pizz in Montclair.
