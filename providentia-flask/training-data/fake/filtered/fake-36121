The place is pretty tiny, so once you step inside the bright red door you have to wait about ten to fifteen minutes to be seated. As we were waiting, I saw that the daily special was apple cinnamon pancakes and knew I would barely have to look at the menu after seeing that. The toughest choice was deciding what size: I knew one large pancake wouldn't cut it (especially not after that long walk!), and thought three small would be too little as well, so I went with the three large. They were HUGE (took up an entire plate). While I tried to convince myself I wouldn't finish them, I ended up leaving behind an empty plate. I think 2 pancakes would have been the perfect amount because I was stuffed afterwards. My pancakes were very reasonably priced at $6.95. While the pancake itself was fluffy, thick, sweet, and delicious, I was a little underwhelmed by the apple cinnamon part of it. My mom also makes apple cinnamon pancakes, so I had high expectations, and have to say I like my mom's a lot better. The apples were a little tart, and there wasn't much sweetness or cinnamon. With maple syrup and the melted butter on top, it still tasted like a good pancake, but I expected much more from the apple cinnamon. We split a large plate of very fresh, juicy, sweet strawberries for $2.75, and my friends each got generous helpings of eggs for around $9. Each came with homefries, which were cooked perfectly (crispy outside but soft inside) and very flavorful, and my friend couldn't stop raving about her spinach and feta omelette. I loved the decoration inside: the walls were plastered with posters of jazz festivals. It felt like a cozy, home-y diner. While it didn't quite meet my expectations, it was still pretty good brunch food and makes for a lovely walk (especially if you take the residential streets-route, with fall leaves blanketing the ground). Not to mention, you don't really have many other options for good brunch in New Haven.
