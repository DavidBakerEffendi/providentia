I happened to be driving from newyork to Massachusetts and stopped for lunch buffet at taste of India. I had to give one star cause the dessert jamun Was ok. Ambience - bad. Service ok. Food - naan was tough like a piece of leather. The dal soup was watery. All the vegetarian side dishes were below average in taste. There were four or more meat dishes. All the non-Indian diners plates were mostly piled high with the above said meat dishes. From the reviews my expectations were high and I was sorely dissappointed. Indians who are used to quality food vegetarian food please stay away from this place.
