This place is great and the quality of the products is very good. The bread is great, as well as the meats and salads. The cappuccino is one of the city's best. If you want a cheap sandwich go to McDonalds don't leave reviews about this place being over priced as some people did in the reviews below. Great neighborhood spot and very friendly staff.
