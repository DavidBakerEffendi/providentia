They have finally gotten their act together! I hav ebeen there a few times and everything was great. There is a real family 'feel' and the food, especially the specials, was great. I wouldn't say it's cheap but it's very competitive. The weekend entertainment for the most part consists of the leading musicians in the Trenton area and is very good (yeah, there's karaoke sometimes and a strange act pops up ... but rarely). Highly recommended!
