I hate to do this, but I must go against the grain here - Grimaldi's is underwhelming. The service was absolutely terrible. And when I say terrible, I mean terrible - waited over an hour for food, never asked how our food was (which was very, very average), and never offered us drinks, had to beg a busboy for more water. The food was okay - nothing special, nothing like the old Grimaldi's used to be. If you want good pizza, really good pizza that's right underneath the Brooklyn Bridge, and you want good service, head over to Ignazio's.
