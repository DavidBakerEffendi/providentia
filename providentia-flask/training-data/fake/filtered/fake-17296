Yum yum yum...love this place. It's a small place, so takeout or delivery is best. Their delivery is always fast and the portions are generous. They have a ton of vegan and vegetarian options. Their Portobello Mushroom Burrito is incredible. I also appreciate that you can add, remove, or change ingredients in your order without complaint. Then there's the delicious free chips and amazing hot sauces. Just love it. I think I know what I'm having for dinner tomorrow.
