Every weekend I order the chicken parm with pasta. The pasta I get is the penne vodka. It's so good! You know how when you eat something so good you want to dance in your chair.. that's how good it is! It's always consistent too, there hasn't been a time it tasted different! It's about a pound of pasta, def enough for 2 people. Thanks Zios!
