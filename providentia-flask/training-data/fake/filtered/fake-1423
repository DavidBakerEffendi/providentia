A group of colleagues and I, who were performing at a theatre nearby back in June 2011, often went to this restaurant after performances. One waitress in particular was so rude, quiet, slow and lazy that we groaned when we were given her a second time. She was so inattentive that she threw out half my dinner without asking me if I wanted it wrapped. (When she collected it, I pointed at my plate and said "I'd like this..." and she shushed me and nodded.) I received the most deer-in-the-headlights apology. Her facial expression did not even change. (How about listening to your customers, dear, instead of rushing them through ordering, assuming none are ordering food in addition to drinks, and speaking clearly instead of passive-aggressively and low?) The manager took my complaint over the phone, but made no effort to make up for it other than promising that the waitress would not serve us at our cast party. She did indeed serve us at the cast party. Six months later, and I have not forgotten. The service was not particularly great the other nights we were there, either - although that one waitress was by far the worst I have ever seen. The lighting on the patio is quite poor in the summertime; you cannot see the menu or the people you are dining with clearly. The food tends to be bland and have no particular verve or personality, although it is serviceable. Several who ordered drinks were taken aback at how shallow they were. It seems that they remain in business simply because of the relative few choices available in that neck of the woods. Even still, I will now make certain to patronize other establishments in the area when at all possible, and you should, too. There is no excuse for bad service when you're paying.
