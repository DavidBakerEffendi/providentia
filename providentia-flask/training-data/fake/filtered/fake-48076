This place is a standard go to for me. Ive been served several times by the same waitress, and am sad to say I cannot remember her name! She has been so awesome every time, genuine and always enhances our experience at the smith. I like the menu and the selections work for me and my taste. The service is attentive and I like the atmosphere. I am a fan of this place, its a little big and not cozy but I love the look tile look and the interesting photos. Its not anything that i would plan for a special occasion, but somewhere I go regularly when meeting up with a friend or 6. I Â will continue to enjoy my experience at the smith!
