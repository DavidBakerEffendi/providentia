This place is amazing! The happy hour lasts until 10 everyday and includes the lychee martini....yum! The food is delicious...sticky coconut rice, veggie pancakes. Everyone talks about the lychee martini but there are other great drinks available for happy hour. I really like their sangria. It has a cool atmosphere due to great music, artwork on the walls and a pretty diverse and young crowd. The music is too loud! You will have to yell to have a conversation.  Another slightly annoying aspect is that the placed gets over crowded. But for a $5 lychee martinis...it's worth it!  Definitely a good after work place for friends to share tapas and get drunk cheaply:)
