The food is great!  From the lettuce slice with miso dressing to the short rib bun (to die for) then to the miso glazed cod that was cooked to perfection.  Dessert was a coconut cheesecake, which was light, and not over sweet, it was a great way to end a delicious meal.  The service was attentive and warm, the wine list extensive and the atmosphere warm and inviting.  Next time I'll try the sushi!
