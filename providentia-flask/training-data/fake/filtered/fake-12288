I am eternally thankful that the Cuban embargo did not block the Cubano Sandwhich from ending up on American soil and ultimately on my lunch plate. Thank you Nico L. for directing Michelle and I to this wonderful establishment. The staff is very friendly and attentive to your needs. This establishment draws a great cross-section of the New York population, which translates to a people watching mecca. My wife and I shared a Cubano Sandwhich and a bowl of their delicious chicken soup. This meal warmed our soul, filled our stomachs, and it didn't empty our wallets. Total cost of the meal with two sodas was $11.00. I want to go back and try the lunch special. This seemed to be the crowd favorite. An aluminum tin filled with rice, black beans, plaintains, and chicken. Margon on this day you were truly my New York favorite.
