It's a shame that they closed the Blue Ribbon Sushi.  I love the sushi there. Thank god they still serve sushi in the brasserie.  The sushi there is the closest I can find compare to what i had experienced in Japan.  Lovely place with great food! However, there is room for improvement for services.  We visit there often but at times, the waiter/waitress are not very attentive.
