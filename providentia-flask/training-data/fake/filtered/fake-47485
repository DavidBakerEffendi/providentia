Dirty tablecloths, crowded tables, rude host and waiters, gross bathroom, and burned crusts.  The pizza itself is ok but certainly not worth the long wait and all the other negatives.  Stay in the city and go to Patsy's where it's clean, the food is great and they are happy to see you.  We certainly won't return to Grimaldi's.
