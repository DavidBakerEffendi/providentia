If you're gluten-free and want italian style thin gourmet pizza, this is the spot The long thin baguette style (gluten-free) bread sticks are awesome, brought to the table and great dunked in olive oil The large size salad is perfect to share. My fave pizza is pesto with goat cheese, feta and arugula. And though I try to avoid sugar, one night i took home a NY black and white style gluten-free cookie. The risottos are very good - but I come for the pizza. Â And there are great prices on wine. The downside - no reservations are taken and the line of gluten-free foodies is often out the door. Also the tables are tightly packed and it is very loud. No lingering here, once you're done eating, they get you out the door.
