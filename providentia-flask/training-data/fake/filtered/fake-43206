Weekdays are great, weekends are terrible. New "restaurant seating" on the weekends and the staff aren't able to keep up with it. Waited over 20 minutes for someone to take my order after I was seated. On any given weekday when it's a "walk to the counter and order" type place, it's great. Far too expensive, though. Expect a sandwich, coffee, and water to run close to $14 bucks.
