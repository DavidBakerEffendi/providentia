This is the best ramen restaurant in NYC and, despite the long waits, one of my favorite places in NYC. This place is a must: amazingly delicious pork-based broths with home-made noodles. Remember to order a pork broth soup, the chicken based ones are not as delicious. The akamaru modern is my favorite.
