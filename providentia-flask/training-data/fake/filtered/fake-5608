Overall, good experience. Loved their chocolate creations, the atmosphere, professionalism. even though, their wings were amazing, the menu lacks diversity a little. I came there starving and I couldn't pick an entree, which is understandable because MB is mostly a desert place. I guess it really depends on a person b/c we all have different taste buds.
