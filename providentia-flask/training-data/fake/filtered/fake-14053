I love the Farm on Adderley. I was born and raised on Cortelyou road and am so happy to be living back in the neighborhood, and this restaurant is one of the reasons why. The food is awesome, I love the kale salad, the fries are amazing, and the chicken entree is off the hook. They make great moscow mules, which is not easy, they're the perfect balance, not to sweet or syrupy. Also, a fine selection of bourbon, which makes this girl happy! Staff is super friendly, atmosphere is comfortable and not stuffy. Love love!!
