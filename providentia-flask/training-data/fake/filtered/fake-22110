This place is absolutely, always a highlight of trips to Philly for me and the kids.  I could spend half the day there eating, checking out unique jewelry and crafts, buying gourmet teas, eating, taking my pick of the day's myriad fresh groceries and flowers, EATING!  Shanghai Gourmet (closest to the Filbert and 12th street entrance) is my favorite for Chinese food.  I've always found their dishes, especially the seafood dishes, to be extremely fresh--with that crisp, "just caught this morning" taste--and not oily or heavy.  A stop at The Famous 4th Street Cookie Company tops it off for me.   May be standing room only in many corners of the market, but you'll soon know why.   It's a hot spot!
