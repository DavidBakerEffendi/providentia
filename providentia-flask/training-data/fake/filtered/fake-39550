One of my college professors flew into town for the day and wanted to meet for dinner on short notice.  She wanted authentic Thai food because she rarely gets to enjoy Thai food near the outskirts of Illinois where she flew in from.  So I went on the hunt to find a great Thai restaurant and I came across this place.   Choosing this place was the biggest mistake ever!!!!!  Although the outside patio is a nice feature and comfy...the food was HORRIBLE and the lemonade tasted like it came from an old can!!  I was so embarrassed that as a native NYer I took my professor to this restaurant.  The service was ok but I will never step foot in here again!
