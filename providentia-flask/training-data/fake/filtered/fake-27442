i could never understand  what the big deal was about the pizza in this place.have been there a quite a number of times over the years,mostly for the spumoni and other flavor ices ,the outdoor seating and because my wife loves the squares,but frankly i always get the runs when i eat there.there is  way to much sauce and not enough crisp for my taste. and with the unfriendly workers behind the counter speaking either spanish and some  arabic language, in a so called  italian joint,itjust sucks the pleasure out of eating here.
