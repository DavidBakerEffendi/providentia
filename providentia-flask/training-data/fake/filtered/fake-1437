Most Horrible customer service imaginable! They screwed up on an order and when we called in to let them know, Mind you we called the first time with no attitude and we weren't even angry, but they yelled at us and told us we were wrong, although i KNOW i wasn't (they've screwed up before) and hung up three times. Unbelievable. How hard is it to just remake one sandwich? Hell I would have even paid for the correct one if they let me. And im sorry WHY do they have 3 sandwiches with the same name!? They have no idea what there daily lunch specials actually are or what is in there sandwiches. They've lost several customers for sure!
