SRIPRAPHAI Thai Restaurant in Woodside Only 2 tables where occupied when 8 of us entered the Patio/Garden. The Flowers turned out to be the best part of the visit. There was nobody to help us putting some tables together, so we did it ourselves. We ordered wine which took forever. We also set our own table, since the waitress dumped 8 plates plus cutlery on the table. Since we ordered different appetizers to share, no plates where offered. My Panang Curry with Pork looked more like a stew in brown sauce. After 7 of us had almost finished the main course the 8th had still not come. The waiter had obviously forgotten to bring it and when he served it, it was cold. We asked for some containers to take the leftovers home and the waitress practically threw them on the table All in all: the service was way below standard, actually rude and arrogant. We have eaten better food in several other Thai Restaurants in the Long Island/Astoria/Woodside Area. It will not be a repeat visit. Heidi B. Woodside
