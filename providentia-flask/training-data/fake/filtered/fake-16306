The food was good, but that does not outweigh the fact that we were treated with rudeness by the manager, who asked us to leave while we were still enjoying our coffee.  It had not been 5 minutes after we paid our bill when he told us there were people "waiting for our table."  When I mentioned how rude that was, he told me I could call back and complain if I wanted to.  I have been going to Bella's for 3 years and always took out-of-town guests there.  But I will no longer patronize this restaurant.
