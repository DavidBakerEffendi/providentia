Very nice atmosphere....great for a date or special night with your sig. other.  No negatives on the food.  The cheese and black truffle focaccia was delicious, highly recommended.  The entree sizes were a bit small...I got the jumbo shrimp which came with 5 large shrimp but not much else.  Desert was the sponge cake with nutella & all kinds of tasty things....great way to end the meal.   I'd definitely come back and perhaps try a pasta dish that may have more by way of serving size.
