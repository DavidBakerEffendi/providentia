I met with the owner after I was disappointed with a luncheon that I held here. We spent half an hour talking about the positives and the negatives from that day. The food at our event was delicious and the service was outstanding. The issue was the amount of food and that was rectified. He listened to what I had to say and wanted to make sure that I walked away from this experience happy - and I did. Very pleasant experience!
