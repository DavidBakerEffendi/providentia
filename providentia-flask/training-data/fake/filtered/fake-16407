Seafood is tricky. It can easily be overdone, under-seasoned, over-seasoned, under-done, and poorly accompanied by bland and starchy sides. NONE of these things could be used to describe ANY of the food at HB Seafood. As a former resident of the Outer Banks of North Carolina and a firm believer of Seafood as Soulfood, I felt an immediate connection with this restaurant. The atmosphere is clean and neat; which is important on first impression, because there's nothing worse than a dirty seafood place. The chef is one of my favorites in the area and my wife and I regularly visit his other restaurant, Hot Basil. (My wife has a gluten allergy, so it's hard to find tasty food that is also gluten free. This place is not only very aware of gluten allergies, but also keeps good kitchen practices that avoid cross contamination and their food is DELICIOUS!) It's tucked away in a corner of Elmwood Plaza and might easily be missed, but its right next door to Elmwood Kabob and is worth the extra effort to locate. Whatever you choose is bound to be tasty, but I would recommend the old-bay fries and the cole-slaw as a companion to whatever you order. Cole slaw is so often poorly prepared, but the serving I got was crisp, sharp and had the perfect dose of horseradish. There's definitely a hint of asian flair in the food, but it's subtle and perfectly blended with the traditional menu options that you would expect from an exceptional seafood restaurant. The clam chowder is thickened with cornstarch and is gluten free and also happens to be outstanding. I couldn't be more happy to have this restaurant in my neighborhood, and am sure that if you like seafood too, you'll not regret stopping in for a bite!
