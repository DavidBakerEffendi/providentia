We are from Phoenix and use Yelp to find places to eat when traveling. We took a wrong turn when walking to Bianca and walked through a street market for several blocks on Meeker. Neat area, this street is loaded with places to have a drink or eat. Anyway we arrived at Bianca and the food was as advertised, it was worth the effort. The place is small but this adds to the charm. Our taxi to and from cost about the same as our meal.
