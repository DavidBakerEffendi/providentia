Wow, after being loyal to supal for so many years it was great to finally try somewhere new. Sushi was hands down amazing. The rolls are gigantic. Their hot food has these massive portions, so beware and try not to fill up. Spicy tuna was hands down amazing and they had about 6 different rolls incorporating their tuna. Plus with this place open superstar east buffet has stepped up the sushi section too so its a win win for AYCE. Go to supal to pig out with friends to straight pig out and go ham, go here to impress a date and have a great sit down dinner with someone.
