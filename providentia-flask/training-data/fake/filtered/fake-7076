what happened to this place ? i used go there all the time for lunch, i even introduce this place to lot of my co workers. food was good before but now from last 4-5 times i have been there. 1st of all customer service ? there is none, no hello, no thanks !!! when u tell them if you want your food spicy or non spicy, they really do not pass your message to the person who is actually preparing your roll, it has happened to me few times now. Kati rolls were dry & no taste, Aloo roll was totally tasteless. keema kabob roll, they took the meat out of freezer & warmed it up in microwave . one time i asked for more sauce & they had a major attitude. i have stopped going there.
