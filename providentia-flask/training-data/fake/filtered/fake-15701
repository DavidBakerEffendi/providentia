After reading all the great reviews on here bout this place I visited NY with a friend. The cheapest Chinese food place ever, anywhere. Everything is good, ask for extra sauce, be picky, and all your request will be granted. we ordered for roast pork or chicken on small rice with a vegetable or noodle Â Amazing the roast pork was cut into thin strips so it made it easy to just devour in 1 bite. Delicious we really enjoyed lunch. After you get your food, walk across to the park and you'll find picnic tables and seats. Watch the kids, the old people, and the weirdos, and take a moment to feel how blessed you are. we Highly recommended this place and come back soon
