MSG ALERT!!!!!!  By mistake I posted a review of my experience this past weekend of Han Dynasty on their Manayunk location site.  PLEASE READ IT IF YOU ARE SENSITIVE TO MSG!  Apparently, HAN DYNASTY IS NOT!!!  I was told by one of the waiters that the owner does not agree with "all the hype" regarding MSG and uses it in his food.  The only way you can request "NO MSG" is by calling ahead.  My question is, does that mean all your food is prepared in advance?
