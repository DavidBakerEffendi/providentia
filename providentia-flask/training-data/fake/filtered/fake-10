food is bland for being Japanese - the rainbow lights are not easy on the eyes Â  my wife and i ordered a simple three roll lunch that come with soup and salad - the japanese ginger dressing was runny and bland, the miso soup was flavorful ! but the three different rolls that followed was tasteless ! plus they seemed to be upset that we ordered only one lunch special for two people to split cause they repeated told us it was made for one person and asked us multiple times if we wanted anything else.. thanks but no thanks... its always better to eat there then have it delivered if your going to review any place
