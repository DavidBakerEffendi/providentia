Went there with high expectations, but was sadly disappointed .. The Gobi manchurian we ordered was just fried gobi with tomato sauce, I have had so much better than this.. The garlic naan made me sick.. had a upset stomach for a loong time after eating it..It was terrible, probably they added too much soda to make it fluffy..I would rather go for good food than fluffy!! Mango lassi was too watery.. Not gonna try this place again..had enough!
