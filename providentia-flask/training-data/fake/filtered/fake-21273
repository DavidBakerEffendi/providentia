The place was pretty, but my husband did not like the food being that his father is part colombian we were hoping to see more colombian plates , atleast more tradional plates, all we saw was american latin plates, the drinks were generous , the wait staff was alittle slow , The kids enjoyed some of the food . but it was alittle too loud ,and it was a lively crowd there , so it seemed like happy place to be
