Love this place. My good to spot for Thai food. Great atmosphere, great food, super in-expensive and very large portions. The atmosphere is excellent, both indoor and outdoor. I do miss the DJ playing subtle remixes of jazz and hip hop. Great place to go on a date or with good friends for excellent food and atmosphere.
