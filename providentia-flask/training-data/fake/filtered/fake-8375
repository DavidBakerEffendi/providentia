Cheesecake and desserts are great, but try lunch and breakfast! Fresh ingredients and great value. Most lunches are $5.95. Casual but comfortable, friendly staff and very bright with all window storefront. Menu for lunch changes daily. Sign up for the emailed menu. Gets your mouth watering. I've eaten there about 15 times in the last year. Would be much more if it was closer to where I live. Daily Vegetarian selections including Quinoa. How many restaurants do you know that serve fresh made Quinoa?!! Parking lot just around the corner if you don't find street parking. Make a note of the phone number, last time I tried information didn't have the listing. (Conflicting carrier)
