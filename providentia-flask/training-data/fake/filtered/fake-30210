We stepped into this Russian inspired cafe late one Sunday morning & enjoyed it tremendously.  The coffee was smooth and didn't taste burnt--too many folks seem to enjoy it that way, I've noticed. We enjoyed some very fresh and airy croissants--with some Russian jam-- and a grilled cheese sammy-- with some Russian cheese, of course!!  I'm hooked! I'm coming back soon to try those Russian dumplings--of course!! And don't know what to get that special person for Christmas, looks like they got some interesting artwork for sale hanging in the hallway.  Don't forget to check it out!
