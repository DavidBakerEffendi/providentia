I love the NYC vibe! The bartender was top notch as well. Gotta love it!!! The food was good, maybe a little pricey, but I don't mind paying for good food. You should also note, that this is more of a bar than a restaurant. Though they are a restaurant, too, they focus more on delicious mixed beverages. I'd call this a gastropub, but the word "pub" strikes up the wrong image.
