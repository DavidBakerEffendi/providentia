I have been visiting Eli's Pizza periodically since they opened.  I love the pizza and stuffed bread dough.  Fillings for the stuffed breads are generous and fresh.  The one complaint that my wife and I have is that the food has no taste to it.  The pizza lacks sauce and the sauce that it has is flavorless.  We just had the chicken parmesan bread that was filled with tender chicken, but had NO flavor.  I purchased a couple of pizza slices and we tried them at home and the crust was great, but there was no one home in "Flavor Town".  I hope that the chef tastes the food like he should.  There is a lot of effort going to waste here.
