Great concept but much room for improvement. Service is slow and a little erratic, prices are overly high and at times I haven't been happy with the food quality. For instance, a mango smoothie cost me over $5 and was really no more than a bit of (unripe) mango plus milk...very disappointing. I think their menu is great and love all of the vegan/other dietary requirement options.... But that said, I think the prices are too high and the service too inconsistent for me to be returning anytime soon. Comment by M S. below sums up pretty well.
