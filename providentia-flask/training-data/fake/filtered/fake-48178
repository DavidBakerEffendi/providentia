Just went here yesterday on 10/6/2013.  WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!! ENDED UP THROWING THEM OUT!   I've been a fan of this place for years.  I constantly recommended it as the best fries!! The new way they cut and cook the fries is disgusting.  The fries use to be slender and crisp...now they are thick and soft.  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE..  I don't usually throw out fries but these I did. WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED! Who changed the process.   Now I have to find another place that makes fries like this store use to.   By the way, the sauces are great!!  Too bad I had to put them on this disgusting mess. My favorite fries place gone to HELL!! PLEASE, IF THE OWNERS ARE LISTENING ...FIX IT FAST PLEASE!! P.S.: My wife threw hers out also!!
