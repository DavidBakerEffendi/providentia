I went here a couple months back, and I absolutely love the environment there. It's surprising that I never noticed it before. The mood is perfect if you're looking to go for some casual drinks after work, or if you're going for a special occasion. Their selection of tapas and desserts are excellent and I would highly recommend bringing a friend (from out of the states) if you need a nice place to bring them.
