I went to Jane this past Sunday, based on the reviews I read here. WHAT a disappointment! Even with a reservation, we waited a half an hour - thank goodness there was room at the bar since it was over 90 outside. When we finally sat down, they did give us an order of donuts on the house...then we were told the kitchen was out of four entrees. Their French toast, supposedly their pride and joy, was not good - dry and cold. My omelette would have been ok if it had not also arrived cold. Our waiter was very nice and attentive, but the room was incredibly noisy and chaotic. I definitely am not going back!
