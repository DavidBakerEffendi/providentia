Fantastic service and great food! Our waitress and bus boy were extremely attentive. This restaurant definitely exceeded my expectations. The crème brulee was the best I ever had...creamy and delicious! It was a great deal as well.  Initially, the only reason why we went was because I purchased a groupon, however they won us over and we will be going back!
