If you're looking for fresh meat pies, not the place to go. Everything is made elsewhere, frozen, and brought to the Whalley Ave location. When you order, they stick it in the microwave to heat it up. If I want microwaved meat pies, I'll go to stop n shop. The middle was still cold, the beef was tough, and the gravy was rubbery. It's like a restaurant of leftovers. Not good at all.
