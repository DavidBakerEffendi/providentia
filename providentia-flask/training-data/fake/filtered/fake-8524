Got takeout there for the first time last night. Lobster roll had decent amount of meat and the roll was nice and buttery. My companion liked the Cuban but thought it needed something. Added mustard and then was in love. Both were served with side salad and fries. Good deal for what you get. Plus the woman at the counter tossed in a bonus muffin!
