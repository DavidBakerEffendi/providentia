We (a party of 4) ate at this restaurant last night, a Saturday, and the experience was literally deafening.  We were surrounded by five tables of people whose sole objective appeared to be to scream louder than anyone else at the their table or the ones nearby.  The maitre d' (or owner?) came to the table next to ours to greet some customers (one of the loudest of the tables) and they were standing over our table and were talking so noisily that we actually had to ask them to quiet down.  On the way out, the maitre d' (owner) didn't apologize but explained that the restaurant was noisy because there was a full house.  As for the food, some of the plates were enjoyable but I had ordered the grouper special, one of the more expensive items on the menu, and found it to be overcooked and underspiced.  Maybe we're getting too old and the younger generation needs to holler their lungs out to enjoy themselves, but if you're looking for a place to enjoy a good meal and have a conversation without having to shout down your neighbors, I'd certainly give this restaurant a pass.
