The Cowgirl Seahorse offers an extensive menu of both Tex-Mex and seafood, combining the two cuisines I've been seeking in a neighborhood bar for years.  Located squarely by the Brooklyn Bridge, this restaurant conjures visions of both topless merpeople and cow-tipping.  Dancing staff members suggest a flirty atmosphere, while the maritime decor keeps the visitor's mind planted firmly in a place of elegance.  Nightly appearances by Asian Elvis are sure to thrill, and favorites such as the Ice Cream Baked Potato are sure to keep everyone coming back for more.
