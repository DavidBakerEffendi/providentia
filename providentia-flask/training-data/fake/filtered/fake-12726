Loved the food.  Went on a Friday night, the wait is kinda long (1.5 hours).  But the service is good and they have a lot of choices.  The menu is a bit hard to follow since it is in Italian and you have to go back to the appendix to figure out what you are ordering.  But the pastas are great, and the desserts were amazing.  Will go there again!
