This place is my favorite Asian food in town, among others... Yet, to me this is number one. The pork noodles are killer and the service unique, as in the staff greets you outloud in japanese when you sit, meaning the atmosphere is good yet thick. Also it is not so expensive. Ive been there at least 4 times and quite frankly, the food is mindblowing. The only thing that looked out of place the other day was the Phillie Cheesesteak spring roll. Needless to say, it was delish, or better yet, umami. I Recommend to try everything on the menu. Except for the wasabi baby octopus. Oh and don't forget to have a japanese beer at the bar while you wait, because i think there aren't any reservations.
