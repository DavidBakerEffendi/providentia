The biggest Gluten-Free Menu I've ever seen.  GF eating can be tough in a restaurant, but they're committed to it.  Kudos.  Classic diner food, great atmosphere - retro chrome & neon, but clean and new looking. GF food is not always equivalent to it's wheat-filled counterparts, but they give it a great go, and lots of choices.
