My friend and I went in there just for some drinks because they have this awesome cocktail menu and all the drinks are names of songs by brand new. We were the only two people in there because it was way late. The bartender was awesome. she knew every little detail about ever drink. All the employees in there were very nice and personable. We could have stayed and talked for hours but we felt bad since it was time to close. The menu looked delicious but we were too late for food. I would definitley recommend this place to friends and family.
