Great, safe place for Celiacs to enjoy delicious Italian food. Choose from pastas, soccas (chickpea pancakes, like pizzas), salads, meats, and delicious desserts! Very cozy ambiance; feels like "fancy at a reasonable price." Good wine list and full bar available. Extremely knowledgeable and helpful staff. Makes for a great pre-theatre dinner or take-out. Must try the soccas and the gnocchi!
