I wish I could comment on the quality of the food at Single Pebble, but they wouldn't let us eat there. Why? Because we had a toddler with us. We showed up a few minutes after they opened at 5PM and the restaurant was nearly empty. Yet the hostess took one look at us with a toddler and said that there weren't any tables available. (Our son is almost 2 years old and was in a very good mood, not crying or anything, just fyi.) I asked her if all the empty tables were taken and she said that yes, all the tables were reserved for future guests. Ok... except that a party of four came in right after us, also without a reservation, and she seated them immediately. The only difference between them and us was that we had a child. I'd heard bad things about the quality of the staff at Single Pebble before but never did I except to not even be seated just because I have a child. Totally inappropriate. I don't care how good their food is (and I've heard mixed reviews to that end) but if a restaurant discriminates against customers just because they have children that's wrong.
