This place is fried potato heaven. Their frites are consistent, and always served fresh. They feature a very wide variety of dipping sauces, and almost all the ones I've tried are good. The ambience is a very relaxed one, as it is a dimly lit, small cozy place near St. Mark's. I would definitely recommend anyone to go and try it out.
