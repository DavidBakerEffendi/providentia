I love anything Mario Batali (well almost everything). I went to Lupa the other after not being there for years. As I expected, everything was great. We sat at the bar and had some wine while we waited for our table. It was such a nice way to start out the evening. We felt really relaxed and the bar tenders were all very nice. The food was delicious. Our service was flawless and we left feeling perfectly full. My only complaint would be that it was a little cramped and noisy, but thats not their fault.
