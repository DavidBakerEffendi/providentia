I too read about this place being cited in NY Mag, so I decided to check it out one Saturday noon with a friend. I agree with the reviewer who posted poor service. Additionally, very slooooow service, just ok sandwiches, pricey for an astoria eatery (it technically does not have the "restaurant" feel to it),. 35-min wait for two tiny sandwiches when it wasn't even that crowded, and the place is very small. its 2012, and yet they dont take credit cards. the only reason i gave it 1 star, is that i am not sure if 0 star will be accepted in this blog as i have never rated anything (restaurant, theatre, play, etc) with 0 star.
