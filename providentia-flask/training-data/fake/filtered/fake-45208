Great drinks! I have been back to this restaurant on numerous occasions now. The food is good, but the drinks are what keep me coming back. I continue to go with the same group of friends and each time we have had the pleasure of dealing with Christie behind the bar. She has helped us at both the upstairs bar and the bar area downstairs. Her drinks are superb. I have tried both cocktails on the menu as well as her personal suggestions! Neither have disappointed!
