Excellent! The perfect place to gather with some friends for delicious small plates of grilled octopus (table favorite), spread pikilia, gyros (slider style), the cheese plate, and souvlakia (three ways). Cool atmosphere around a river rock bar with dark stained arching arbor. Excellent selection of craft beers and affordable Greek wines. Back to the octopus: Chef Andy Brown's 3-day labor of love to bring the dish to the table results in a tender, barbecue finish that you have to taste to understand.
