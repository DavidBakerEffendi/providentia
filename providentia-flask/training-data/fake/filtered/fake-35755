Seriously good food!  My buddy who was living in Astoria discovered this place last year.  Like most Manhattanites I was skeptical of crossing the East River to go to any restaurant.  I consider myself a "foodie" and this place hits the mark. I usually start out with the salad that contains beets and goat cheese.  Then on to my favorite, the short ribs over risotto, they are insane!  I usually top it off with a crepe; my favorite is bananas and nuts topped with chocolate.   Philippe, the owner/chef, is there every night and prepares every meal.  He and his wife Mary are very friendly and seem to really care about the quality of the food they are serving.  Plus they love to engage the customers. One more major factor...price.   The prices are extremely reasonable, especially when compared to any restaurant in Manhattan. Bottom line, whether you are coming from Manhattan or are already in Queens, Café Triskell is well worth it.  I live on the UES and probably go once a month.
