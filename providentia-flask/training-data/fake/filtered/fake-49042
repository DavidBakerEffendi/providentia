This is bar none the worst run restaurant. Ever. I reserved a table for 2 weeks ago for my daughter's birthday. We arrived and were lied to that they were running a "bit late". After one hour they then said the wait would be at least another hour. We then managed to switch from Hibachi to the freezing cold dining room. I would have left but it was New Year's Eve and where would a party of my size go to without reservations? We took up two tables. One table got salad the other did not. Some people were served their food others were not. By the time I got my dinner I was no longer hungry and could not even eat it. I would like to say this was out of the ordinary since it was a holiday but sadly that is not the case. I have been here before and experienced terrible service but that was nearly a year ago and I assumed since they just opened they worked out the kinks. Not so. The management is truly beyond incompetent which is sad because this could be a really great place. They also employ a nasty wait staff. When I accidentally bumped into a waitress no matter how many times I apologized all she would do is glare at me like I had attempted to murder her. Fire everyone but the kitchen staff and start over again otherwise the public is going to catch on and you will be out of business. Soon.
