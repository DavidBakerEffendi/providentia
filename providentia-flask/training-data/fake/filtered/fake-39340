I ordered a goat cheese salad on a Friday night and await it happily only to receive a thick white tasteless and mildy foul white cheese which the kitchen had substituted (Without asking me or telling me, thinking I wouldn't notice somehow).  I told the buser, who called the waitress, and she said she had no idea they did that because they did it without telling her.  When I asked her why they would do that she seemed annoyed when she said  that they are just very busy, excusing this insane behavior.  Who orders goat cheese only to receive some strange no name substitute that the kitchen thought would go by unnoticed?    When I caught them in the act they offered to give me whatever I wanted on the menu "on the house."  I said I wanted the oysters, and the waitress said "Oh the half dozen right?"  She forced that on me.  For the aggravation and insult of trying to trick me into eating something that LOOKED like goat cheese but was FAR FROM it, I should have been able to choose the full dozen had I wanted to. I have eaten here before and never thought this place would pull something so disrespectful and sleazy.  The waitress was cold for that matter, and being someone who works in the restaurant industry, I employed the most appropriate reaction to bad service: I didn't tip.    An overall bad experience.  With so many other better places to patronize who WON'T replace your goat cheese salad with some tasteless and foul mystery cheese that LOOKS the part but is a far cry from your actual order, Moto is off my list.  Note to MOTO's kitchen staff: the whole point of ordering a "Goat cheese salad" is to actually eat "GOAT CHEESE".  Being busy is no excuse for trying to swindle your customers who are paying for a service and specific meal.  Did you really think anyone would be fooled by your failed trick?
