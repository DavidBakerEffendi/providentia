I am going to sue!  I live in the neighborhood, Francisville, and the owners home made chocolate coconut cake is going to make me fat!  Whew! Talk about delish..OMG!  And the Black Bean Soup, YUM! And the chef owner is super friendly. And I love the blue neon sign and the magnificent blue cat mural painted by one of the Mural Arts artist...so beautiful.  I am happy the Blue Cat is here.
