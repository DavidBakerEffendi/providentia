I recently moved to Montclair and I have eaten here twice already which is alot considering they just opened! The counter girl was helpful, but possibly a little overwhelmed, and i hope their staff gets better with time and experience.  I had to wait a little (about 10 minutes) for it to be ready, but it was totally worth it!  This time I had the burger which is basically a grilled cheese on each side for a bun.  It was cooked perfectly to medium rare which I thought was pretty cool that they actually go out of their way to cook their burgers to temperature.   I also had the cheddar fries.  The first time I had them they just used shredded cheese, but it appears they have gone to a cheese sauce which was delicious and gave it more of a traditional look for cheese fries.   I'm looking forward to trying a mac n cheese next time.  I saw some of them come out of the kitchen and people were wolfing them down.
