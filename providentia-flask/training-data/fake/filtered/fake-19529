We visited this place because of the great reviews we saw on Yelp.  Good food but horrible service!  We live in HK and decided to venture further west.  We sat down at the table and waited almost 20 minutes to have our order taken. The place was fairly empty apart from two tables who seemed to be bussing their own dishes.  We order several small plates to split and the waiter forgot two of them and we had to wait twenty minutes on two lamb sliders.  We also had to pour our own water and wine.  Throughout the dinner service we saw other guests searching for their checks and for their frantic waiter. When the Italian waiter wasn't texting, he seemed to be running around for no apparent reason.  And this is after another waiter came on board to "help". It really is a shame, but needless to say we will never visit this quaint little eatery again.
