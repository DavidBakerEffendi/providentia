The THANKSGIVING Balls!!! It's so yummy!!! Although it's an appetizer, I tend to order this as my entree. I've never been disappointed by the mussels either... They're a great combo to share with a dinner date. I really enjoy the atmosphere.... There's a big communal table in the back and it's perfect for large groups. Beer options in a can is not my cup of tea... I'll stick with what's on tap.
