Forget the haters. This is simply the best pizza on the planet. I've been all over (not to Bianco in AZ yet, but soon.) - The Level of ingredients used and the care put into each pie - these are the two things that put Di Fara above the rest. The pies do tend to be on the softer side, and Dom uses lots of olive oil, as opposed to super-thin and crisp pies like at John's  - but the combination of the tomatoes, the cheeses, the dough, the basil and the oil is a truly beyond belief.  Try to go during off hours. If you're reading reviews of those who knocked Di Fara because they came in for a slice and waited 20 min or something, or those that don't even know how to spell the name of the establishment - just ignore them. We'll direct them back to Domino's or Papa John's or that disgusting Artichoke place.   Those who take the time to do their research know that this is authentic slow food - order a pie, sit, and savor.
