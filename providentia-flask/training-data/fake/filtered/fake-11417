Had the pleasure of dining at akitchen this week while visiting Philadelphia for work.  I must say, it was absolutely lovely. From the clean, uncluttered decor to the warm service and the food which was some of the best I have encountered in my travels.  The tempo of this place is upbeat and alive!  The food is stimulating.  You don't leave here heavy and stuffed, you leave refreshed and satisfied.  My choices were the asparagus (YUM!) and the risotto.  Never had better actually.  And for desert the lemon shortbread.  If I return to Philly I will surely be back! Noticed many commented on small portions.  I did not find this to be the case. i felt they were appropriate sizes for the style of the menu.
