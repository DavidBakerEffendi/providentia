I love diners, but I didn't get a diner feel from this place like all the other reviewers seem to have felt. There was a bar taking up a lot of space, which made it seem like a weird nightclub that happened to serve breakfast at dinner. The food was only okay, and the waitress seemed like she was angry at us any time we asked a question. The whole space was very cramped, too, and I felt like I was somehow in the way the entire time I was there. The worst part, though, that pushed me over the edge and inspired me to write a review was that the guy whom I believe was the manager made a racist comment about my friend. He said it in a joking manner, not maliciously, but it definitely made the whole party very uncomfortable and was very rude. I don't know why someone would purposely say something to a customer and make them feel uneasy like that in a place where someone should feel comfortable. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone based on the food, service, and overall feel of the place, but the comment is what pushed me over the edge.
