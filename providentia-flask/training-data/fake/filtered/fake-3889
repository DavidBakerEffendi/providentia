I don't have much to go off for this review, but the things I do are totally worth 5 stars. 1) Frozen margaritas- go during happy hour. They are cheap and strong. 2) Free chips & salsa- not the best I've had but still very good 3) Last and not least- the corn on the cob. Always on the specials menu for around $3 and it is the BEST corn on the cob ever...every.single.time. Smothered in a chipotle mayo with a Mexican cheese blend. Soooo good.
