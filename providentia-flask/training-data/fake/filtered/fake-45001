Years ago this address held a charming Italian restaurant, then an Argentine one, and now, Alsatian. The changing owners only move on to bigger locations after having a popular hotspot here. Alsatian says it all, perhaps, and it's another score for the diversity of excellent haute cuisine in New York City. La Tarte Flamb√©e makes the thinnest savory pizzas. Muenster with pancetta and onion was light and delicious. Prediction: Once the Second Avenue subway is finally built, gems such as this that languish now will flourish. I hope it manages to hold on that long. Many fresh salads including a beet salad and Caesar. Their brunch includes a justifiably famous Benedict over homemade potato pancake.
