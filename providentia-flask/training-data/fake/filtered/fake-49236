Let me start by saying that it's hard not to be swayed by the décor and sexy vibe of the restaurant, it's such an unexpected atmosphere.  I went there half expecting it to be pretentious and overpriced, but I was...wrong. Drinks ($7.50 cocktails, $4 beer):  for drinks we ordered the Green Dragon, Plum Wine Sangria and a Tsing Tao beer.  The Green Dragon had soju and cucumber, which was quite soothing but the plum wine sangria was a fruity drink for those who don't like the taste of alcohol, which I promptly passed to my friend. Coconut Wine Poached Salmon ($16.99):  tender and delicious!  Poached salmon's pretty hard to find on menu's around here, and add in the coconut wine and butter sauce and this dish is a must-try. Sushi Tasting ($19.95):  a chef's choice platter that came with one large tasty "designer" roll, one spicy tuna roll, and an assortment of sashimi and nigiri.  The fish was incredibly fresh (some of the reddest tuna I've seen in a while) but by layering them together some of the flavors blended together.  I would come back just for the tuna here - fresh, terrific texture, melted in my mouth. I do have to say, it's not really "authentic"... it's pan-Asian fusion, a combination of P.F. Chang's type stir fry, composed fusion entrees, sushi, and Korean tabletop BBQ - and for fusion, Dragonfly does it well.  You can tell they use A+ quality ingredients, nothing tasted frozen unlike the chain restaurants that populate this area.  It's also nice to see both the kitchen chef and sushi chef at a restaurant, when they came out briefly to speak to a table behind us.  I would definitely return if in the mood for an upscale fusion experience at a great value.
