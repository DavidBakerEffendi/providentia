Trekked over to Brooklyn to try this place out. It was a bit hard to find if you are not that familiar with Brooklyn, and Google Maps led me astray. After calling them, I found my way there.  The food is excellent. It is hands down the best fried chicken I have ever had in NYC bar none. I got so much food that I could not finish it all. The portions are a pretty good size.  I also got the mac and cheese as a side. Not the best mac and cheese I have ever had, but it was tasty. My only complaint is that I was given a glass of water that was not cold. it was room temperature. They should give customers ice water and not lukewarm water. I would highly recommend trying this place out. I promise you you won't regret trying their fried chicken. Best I have ever had in NYC.
