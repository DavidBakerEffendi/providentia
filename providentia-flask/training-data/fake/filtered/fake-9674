I have been going to Panda House since I was 13. I am 23 as I write this interview and have gotten to know the family that owns it very well. They are some of the most generous and friendly people you'd ever meet and the food is simply the best I have ever had. I have had Chinese food in many other places and still cannot find a place even comparable to Panda House. Furthermore, they will always make you anything you like, even if it's not on the menu. They will substitute bean curd (tofu) for almost any meat and be happy to turn a fried dish into a stir fry for those who are watching their waist or simply don't want fried foods. You can ask for sauce on the side, brown rice, etc. You order how you like it. They will make it for you. I cannot rate this place any higher. You won't be sorry you went.
