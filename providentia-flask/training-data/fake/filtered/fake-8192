Delicious. So many delicious plates. The atmosphere is super cute, it does get quite crowded and loud, but it makes the ambiance very festive. The meat skewers over fire is scrumptious, the pork with plantains delicious, mushroom quesidillas, the breakfast burritos, all fabulous. Don't miss the signature drink, the Yucajito. It's actually too good, because you end up drinking it so fast. It doesn't taste that strong, but it is verrry strong. Great place, very fun and huge portions.
