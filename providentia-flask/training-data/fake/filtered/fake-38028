Soooo... Where to start... Started the evening with amazing cocktails (Pink Picket Fence and the Rosemary vodka cocktail that I can't think of the name (too many cocktails). Let me just say, they were amazing. I'm born Â and raised in New Orleans and these drinks were top notch. When we walked in we noticed the huge portions so only order two entrees and an appetizer for three people. Which was WAY too much food. We probably have enough to all eat again. We ordered the mash potatoes with mushroom gravy (amazing), the honey chicken and pickles sandwich (fucking amazing), and the mushroom and Mac and cheese (holy balls, fucking amazing). We also ordered a pickle sampling. Our waitress (who was adorable and nice!) said we should hold out for dessert and I'm so glad we took her advice. The biscuit bread pudding is TO DIE FOR. It was insane. I am so excited to heat up the left overs. The only thing I have against this place is that it is so freaking dark in there. I get it, you want a certain ambiance, but I had a really hard time reading the menus. It's really not a big deal when you measure up to how good the food was. I wish I could rate this restaurant higher than 5 stars. I've been to a lot of great restaurants but this hits the top 5 I think. Highly recommend!
