I won't be surprised when Ratchada will soon become a new best place for Thai in South Philly.  I've been here twice this week and has not been disappointed. Their foods are fresh, flavorful, and needless to say DELICIOUS ! I'm eating leftovers of their foods (Green Curry Noodle and Massaman Curry) I ordered from last night right now as I'm writing this review and they still satisfied me.  Yum !!! This place just opened a month ago in December 2012 under new management with an additional new chef from the previously owned Cafe De Laos so those old negative reviews are not reliable. They only have two servers but they always served you with a genuine smile and care despite during busy hours. The ambiance is classy but not pretentious. My boyfriend and I have a pleasantly romantic date here because the beautiful decor and warm ambiance really charmed us. Try their creative and satisfying Laos Samplers appetizer and mouthwatering Thai Tea cheesecake with ice cream ! You wont regret it except maybe on your weight. I would give them a five stars but I figure i should give them four stars so that they'll continue to keep up or eventually might even surpass their current excellent foods !
