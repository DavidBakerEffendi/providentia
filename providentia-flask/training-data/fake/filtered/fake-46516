The wait is long but by far Ramen place you can go. i been to many ramen joints and they do have one in japan as well but still the best ramen you can get anywhere in the WORLD...... i just happy i live so close i usually this place i usually make reservation and go back home and come back in 45 mins for my table. it's great to live in the CITY.....
