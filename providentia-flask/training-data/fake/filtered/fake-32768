Just ordered the usual "Fat Lipschitz" sandwich and the "FIT B-ranch" sandwich. Lipshitz came without ranch dressing and wasn't even cut in half. The B-ranch had hardly any chicken in it. Also ordered fried Oreos--didn't realize this, but apparently when you say "an order" of fried Oreos, that's just three Oreos for $3.49. At least it came within a reasonable time tonight, because the last two times, we had to wait over an hour for our food.
