Ting Wong is Chinatown's diamond in the rough. Â It's a tiny, unassuming restaurant that is almost invisible next to Imperial Inn's big awning and red doors. The ducks hanging in the window might be the only thing that would make you notice Ting Wong - but it is so worth finding! The restaurant itself gets about one star, if that. It's pretty dark, the bathrooms are dirty and hardly ever have toilet paper or paper towels, and there is no ambiance at all. The service gets maybe three stars. The food comes out quickly and the guys in the front are pretty friendly, but you're lucky if your water glass is refilled and extras like crunchy noodles and fortune cookies are nonexistent here. BUT the prices at Ting Wong are about as low as they get ($5 for an entree). The portions are generous, even bigger than some other places that charge two and three times as much for the same dish. Ting Wong really earns its five stars for TASTE, though. Everything - really, everything - is delicious, more delicious than any other restaurant makes it. Even the rice tastes better here! (Maybe an exaggeration, but it's good!) Definitely a place to try if you're near Chinatown. The wonton soup (which is really more like a dumpling soup, since the wontons are like pork and shrimp filled dumplings) is amazing. The vegetable fried rice is also delicious, as is their pork chop. Yum!
