my friends made such a big hype about how good the food was but i didn't enjoy the food that much the only good thing i had was the mac and cheese (it was really good and that's the only reason way i gave it 2 stars) i order a chicken fried steak with mash and it was not good at all the steak was nearly burned and it was spicy , which was totally unexpected . so i sent it back and order a salad with regular steak , i figure it would be the fast thing to go and since i was eating with other ppl i didn't want them to wait while i eat. however this wasn't the case it took forever for them to bring me my new order. if you are going to this place stick with the mac and cheese it your best bet
