My husband and I went to Parc for a late Valentines day lunch. We had originally made reservations for dinner but decided to drive up to Philly and spend the day enjoying the city. So our week late Valentines day dinner turned into one of the most amazing lunches I have ever encountered. My husband and I were walk in's and had about a 20 minute wait. So we waited at the bar and he had a beer, and due to me being pregnant ,I an ice tea.The bar was very crowded but inviting at the same time. Within 20 minutes they sat us. The menu was great and had diverse selections. We ordered the tuna tar tar and mushroom tart for appetizers. Both were full of bold flavor. For our entrees I ordered the Lamb Sandwich and my husband the Steak Fritte. Again, we were both impressed. The lamb was cooked perfectly and full of savory flavor. The steak was perfect and melted in your mouth. Since the meal so far had been so wonderful we ordered dessert. I had hot chocolate , best Ive ever had ,and a fabulous cheesecake with honey and rosemary....with a side of fig sorbet. Very creative, light and Â refreshing. If you haven't been please do yourself a favor and go. Yes it is pricey but it is well worth it! You won't regret it!
