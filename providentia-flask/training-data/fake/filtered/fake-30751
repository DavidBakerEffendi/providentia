I agreed with Jessie D on 2011 review. We had lobster soup, hailbut fish and blue crab pasta. If there is minus star, I would have given minus one star. For the money, I expect better food. Service is good, but food is totally below standard. Lobster soup is very salty and winery- it is like you drinking sea water with half bottle of wine. Fish- Â 4 bites - then you are done- I have a tiny mouth! Pasta- I think the noodle is from a chinese brand precooked package. Again, 4 bites- you are done. Taste- I will not pay $25 for the pasta that does not fill me up. If I go there again, I am a big fool.
