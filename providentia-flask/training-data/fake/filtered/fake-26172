I hate to give this place one star..It was filthy when we walked in with a RUDE owner. (middle brother) We called ahead and ordered 4 one topping pizza's...We arrived, paid for it and while waiting noticed the sign special that would have saved us $20....We approached the counter girl who was nice who in turn went and got the owner....He rudely told us that it was too late that he had already rang it up...We told him that we would order two more pizza's with the money we felt we had coming, he RUDELY said no. He told us that he has no responsabilty to tell us about the special and we should have read the sign......WE ORDERED FROM OUR HOUSE ON THE PHONE!!!!! Â What a money hungry bunch of people....We did not care for the pizza either as it tasted stale and was skimpy on toppings...AVOID!!
