One of the worst pizzas I believe I have ever had.  Ordered via Seamless Web and received a pizza with a burnt crust.  Too horrible for consumption. Called to complain and was told their cooking style is 'rustic'.  Not sure what that means but I interpretted this that they believe that pizza is best served with a black crust.
