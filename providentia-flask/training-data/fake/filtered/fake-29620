I went there for Brunch and Lunch it was nice, we sat in the back, nice and cozy.. The price was not bad at all...There Pankackes with Chicken was awsome and there Lemon aid so refreshing. The service was ok. I had one waitress who felt her friends were more important than us, so it sucked for her because I left her no tip! Other than that, I liked and would go again!!
