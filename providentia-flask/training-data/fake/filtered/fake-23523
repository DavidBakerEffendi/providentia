Should have researched the reviews before we took a party of 14 to the murder mystery dinner last night!  Where should I start?  I'm trying to think of something good to say and as someone else mentioned-we never had an empty water glass!  Other than that, as 4 of us were driving home, no one was satisfied with their meal or the show, such that it was. $55.00 per person for a limited menu, plus tip, tax, and beverages was extremely overpriced. The calamari was like rubber and the marinara sauce so chunky it was difficult to dip.  The cavatelli was absolute mush and the meatballs were hard and tasteless.  I don't know how to describe the chocolate mouse cake of which I only ate half only because I was hungry (and I am a chocoholic). I don't know if they planned it this way, but the 3 course dinner,  took 2 1/2 hours to be served and the food was not very hot...lukewarm at best. The murder mystery show was dumb to say the least.  One of the first things the host said was "the more you drink, the funnier the show will be."  Well, seeing as how we aren't drinkers, the show was not entertaining.  The one actor who had any personality, was the victim, who died very early in the evening. The other actors can't even be called actors as they barely said anything and gave one word answers during the interrogation.  The murder mystery lasted only half the night, followed by dumb games like which of the 2 couples can get the Chinese handcuffs off first without using their other hand.  It was over so fast, the host had to do a do-over.  Followed by a scavenger hunt for 2 people, followed by a newlywed show for 2 couples.  And did I mention the sexual innuendos all throughout the night? Needless to say, an extremely disappointing, expensive evening. Oh and have you ever tried to find a parking place on Wooster Street?  Their so called lot of about 15 spots was full.
