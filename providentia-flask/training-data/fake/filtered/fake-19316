My party of 4 ate at Aita tonight and the food, I'll admit was good, but eating out with friends is not just about the food.  You go out with friends to socialize and "catch up". So when the hostess came over and asked us if we wouldn't mind leaving because there was a party of 4 waiting for our table, my friends and I were pretty put off. And this was not long after we'd finished dessert. That's a no-no in my book. Patrons of a restaurant should feel welcome and appreciated.  We felt neither.  And when you've all paid for three course meals, one doesn't want to be pushed out the door.  Lots of other restaurants in Brooklyn. I don't need to be treated that way.
