sunday brunch around noon. shitty service. waiter rushed us through. even took our drinks before finishing them. the really annoying part, the waiter kept on using the same cheesy line for every single table "so i see you've met each other." kind of feed them and get them out as quick as possible type of service like applebies, red lobster, etc. in all fairness great food (lobster, scrambled eggs, texas toast) but shitty service ruined the experience at this name brand restaurant.
