We made reservations for our family (8 people) last night to take our dad out for his 60th birthday. While we did feel that the atmosphere, decor, menu, and food were very good, our experience with our server was very upsetting. We were about to put in an order for a couple small appetizer plates (calamari and eggplant fries) when she stopped us and said, "We have a sampler appetizer special that I think would be just perfect for you. Would you like that instead?" We agreed and took her recommendation. Not until the bill came did we realize she charged us $88 for it. I have never paid that much for an appetizer in my life and never would have ordered that. It was very uncomfortable and upsetting that she did not tell us when she recommended this "sampler plate" that it would be $11 per person and after taxes and gratuity, add a total of $120 to our bill....for appetizers!!! She also brought my husband two glasses of cabernet that she "recommended" and when the bill came we found out they were $15 glasses. We were so suprised and shocked that someone would knowingly upsell us stuff like this and not mention that she is recommending the most pricey items not on the menu. Regular glasses of wine run there from $6 to $10. I did not even see a $15 glass on the menu! We love good food and don't mind paying for a good meal at all - especially for a special occasion like this. But we also do not like to feel ripped off and taken advantage of and this is exactly how we felt when she delivered the bill. It left a very bad impression with all of us and we would never want to return to Carbone's Kitchen again knowing that someone would take advantage of us that way. It's really too bad too because the food and atmosphere were nice. Very disappointed and regret going there. :(
