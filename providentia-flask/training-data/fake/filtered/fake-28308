This is one of my fave 5 places to go eat. I love the ambiance, great service- fast and friendly! Even though the place seems packed I never wait too long for a table, food comes out quickly, the place is well ventilated even in summer time. The food is delicious, meat is tender and juicy. The live band is a nice touch and always different. Great location, you can have a nice little walk further down by the water. Every time I bring my friends they love it.
