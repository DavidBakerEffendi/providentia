Delicious and unique toasted paninis and tapas. The empanadas are juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside, with some really interesting fillings, e.g. pulled pork! My wife loved the Le Cordon Bleu panini! I ate some of everyone's choices because it was so delicious! Great choices for the kids as well. Definitely going back soon!
