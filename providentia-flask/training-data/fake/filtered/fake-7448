ok i friggin love this place! simple dining with no craziness! there usually is a wait but u can always beat by dining alittle early and if there is one u can always pop down next door! the corn is so good and i love JARRITOS everyone has to come here! hostess was so nice and she was really cute! be prepared to be stuffed and also be prepared to see lots of people instagraming their food!
