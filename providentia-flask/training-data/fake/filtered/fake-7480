Two words Duck confit incredible and the grill chicken pail lard with frisee the best tomatoes not too ripe not to green. Really great feel good wine available that nice French bistro feel had a great time a bit far from home but it's worth it really love this place service was great waitress was friendly and gave a great wine recommendation I will def be going back to this place
