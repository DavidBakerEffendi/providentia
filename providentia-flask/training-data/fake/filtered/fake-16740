Food is delicious and the wines are only modestly marked up, so that's a win win if I've ever seen one.  A couple of downsides: this place was pretty happening several years ago, but it's no longer cool.  This is good for a nice meal, but you're not hip eating here.  And two: some of the portions are incredibly small.   Overall though, I'd definitely recommend!
