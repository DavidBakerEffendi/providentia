I love this place.  My burger is always perfectly done, they always have a short, but expertly curated tap list and the staff is welcoming and friendly.    The bartenders know definitely know what they are talking about. There have been a few instances when I haven't liked some of the new additions to the menu (due to perhaps a bit too much experimentation in the kitchen?), but the staff always makes it right if you aren't satisfied. I'll always have a soft spot for Memphis since I got engaged here, but what will keep me keep going back is the friendly staff, knowledgeable bartenders, deep fried pickles, great beer and great burgers.
