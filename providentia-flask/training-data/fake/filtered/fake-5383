Love love love the Rice Bowl. I highly recommend the Gen Tso Chicken! They actually give you chicken breasts instead of chicken chunks! The veggies are super fresh and homemade iced tea is delish. Also, Tony offers the best customer service I've ever seen at any restaurant and I eat out a lot. Try it once and you'll be a regular in no time.
