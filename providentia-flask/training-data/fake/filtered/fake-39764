This is the 2nd year in a row I took my daughter out for lunch at Lu Nello's. she loves it, so do I. Service is outstanding, food outstanding. Will be back for her b'day next year as well as other occassions. I have been there several times for various reasons. I didn't like that I was forced to valet park. It should be offered, not mandatory.
