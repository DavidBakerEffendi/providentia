I've been to Jimmy's twice now - which, considering how many wonderful dining options this area has, is a massive compliment in the first place. Even when it is crowded, the staff is warm, friendly, helpful, with fairly swift service! The food is scrumptious, creative homecookin'! I could not resist ordering the Tater Bowl both of my visits - crispy, ooey-gooey delightfulness! Their keylime pie milkshake is to-die-for, as is their fried deviled eggs (YES, fried deviled eggs!). On weekends, you'll get an extra surprise small plate of homemade soft 'n' crispy cinnamon donut holes. Jimmy's is a must, for a cute, delish, low-key meal!
