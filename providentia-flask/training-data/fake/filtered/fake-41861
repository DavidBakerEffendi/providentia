This was the first place recommended to us on the train and it did not disappoint. Starting with the wine, the Lambrusco was really delicious not sweet like I expected but really berrylike with a nice finish. I had veal in a delicious vodka sauce and my partner had seafood risotto. Very large portions and very rich flavors. The arugula , raddicio and endive salad was not bitter but really fresh. The desserts here are the jewel. I had the poached pears and it was very light and flavorful. I think that I will go back to try the others.
