Walked all the way there from 38th and Walnut and it was worth it!  Tried the Satay Taco and the Thai Taco which were both awesome and had wonderful distinct flavors!  The guy that works the window is also very friendly!  Will definitely make the trek back soon.  In terms of Asian fusion tacos...this place is far superior to Tyson's Bees.
