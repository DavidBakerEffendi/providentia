My girlfriend and I have been here 4 times over the past year or so. Each time has been a good experience - we love the food (I now make a tomato, onion, pepper vinaigrette to go with my steak at home), the atmosphere is great (very intimate, nice decor), and we always seem to have fun at Samba (good vibes). We more or less order different dishes every time and have yet to be disappointed - one thing we do always get is the garlic shrimp appetizer...one of those dishes you find yourself craving. We can't wait to go back this spring and sit outside.
