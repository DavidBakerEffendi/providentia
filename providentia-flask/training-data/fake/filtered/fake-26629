Love this place! Awesome breakfast, fresh, hearty, delicious. Had what were probably the best pancakes ever! Service was good too! I ordered the Bubby's Burger, which was a pretty good burger, and not too greasy.  The mac & cheese was good, but not the best ever and I really enjoyed the red cabbage slaw.  The appetizing biscuits were served warm and exceptionally tasty.  For dessert, we all ordered cupcakes, and I selected the seasonal treat: pumpkin with maple icing!  The cake itself would have made a great coffee cake, even without the icing.  After all that, I was stuffed...in a good way. Next time I'd like to go back for the midnight brunch!
