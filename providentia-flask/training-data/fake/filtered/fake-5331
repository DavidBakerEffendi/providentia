Service is consistently poor and frantic. Tonight the server told our table we couldn't order off the 11pm menu because it was 10:30pm and the kitchen was very strict. Then she disappeared and came back at 10:55 and said we had to order off the late night menu because the kitchen switched over and the other menu was no longer available.  Whaaaaaat?! Is the kitchen strict or are you just a horrible server that dropped the ball?! I love when people think that we are as stupid as they are. Sorry Bubbys, we won't be back. Beyond disappointed. Overpriced for the quality and service.  Walk north for some delicious Mac and cheese if you're in the mood.
