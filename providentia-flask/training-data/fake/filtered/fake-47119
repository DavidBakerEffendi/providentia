The food and setting were both very good. No question. However, with all of the excellent restaurant menus in NYC, an overall winning dining experience often comes down to service and great management. Particularly at $30 entrees, where many other restaurants with equivalent food quality and price point have nailed their service. Clearly, you see where i'm going...Balaboosta lost points with me due to a few seemingly small but important service blunders that in the end tainted the overall experience. So what happened: the busboy was gruff, and in his manner of clearing the table inevitably splashed Â my face and clothing with oily dish residue, all while clanking silverware near my face and ears. Some people would dismiss this as an accident or a one-off experience. I actually attribute it to poor staff training. I quietly let the manager know what happened as I was leaving, first complimenting the restaurant on the cuisine. The manager was polite, however she did not apologize and responded by awkwardly justifying the quality and reputation of the food, the open kitchen...huh? And therein lies the source of so-so service. Now, with so many great options in Manhattan...why would I come back here?
