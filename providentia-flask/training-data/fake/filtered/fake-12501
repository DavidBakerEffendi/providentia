I really, really, REALLY love this place. The portion sizes are more than what you'd expect for the price and the food is never a disappointment. The only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the size of the place. If you go to Mooncake during dinner time on a weekend - expect to either sit at the counter or wait a while.. which isn't even that big of a deal. I'd definitely recommend it though to anyone wanting to try some tasty food for a great price :)
