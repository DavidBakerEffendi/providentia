When I walked into Bella Vita I was greeted with smiles and the delicious smell of Italian food.  I had just come back from sending 4 months in Italy and never thought I would be able to have such amazing Italian food in America.  But sure was I wrong.  I ordered a potato croquette, which is the ONLY place in America i had ever seen these.  I couldn't believe how much it tasted like the ones I LOVED in Italy.  I also ordered a slice of focaccia pizza and had to order a second one it was so good.  My dad got the sun dried tomato pizza which was incredible (I stole a few bites).  We then split a Nutella slice for desert and licked the plate clean.   We have returned a few times since our first visit and each time the owner makes news and different pizzas! Each one better than the next! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants REAL Italian food ... and for such a great price!
