Love this place! I recently moved to the area and tried a lot of other pizza places and was under impressed. It's a real small-town gem that I think everyone should try at least once if they are finding themselves bored with plain pizza. Â Of note, the sauce is a little on the sweet side but not overwhelming and the crust is perfect.
