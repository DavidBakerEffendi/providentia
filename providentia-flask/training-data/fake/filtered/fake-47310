I went to the Fairfield Tavern for the first time on Mothers Day.  We went to the Brunch which they have every Sunday.  The quality of the food was good.  The organization of the brunch needs help, definitely!  There are breakfast foods mixed in with Chick Marsala and Pasta.  They have a pancake and omelet bar next to the carving station.  In front of that is the Salad bar.  Next to the salad bar to the left is: scrambled eggs, sausage/bacon, potatoes, chicken Marsala and pasta.  In the bar area, they have rice pilaf along with steamed vegetables, waffles and french toast and desserts.  Like I said, the food was good, we had a great time, but the organization needs to be looked at.
