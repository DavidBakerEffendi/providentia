From the outside, this place seemed like a total dive... which frankly, is pretty ok with me, depending on my mood. Upon entering the establishment, I saw that my initial assumptions weren't terribly off base, except that the food everyone was eating looked amazing! We had just popped in to grab a quick drink, but the looks of the food passing by made it impossible to resist, and we ordered a tray of chips with gauc, and two other dipping things that I'm not even sure what they were, but all I can say is Yum!! The prices were extremely reasonable, the service was good, and the atmosphere was laid back and fun. My only complaint about this place is that the bathroom is IMPOSSIBLE to find without asking for help. (For real, its in a practically hidden location.) Can't wait to go back and explore more of the menu!
