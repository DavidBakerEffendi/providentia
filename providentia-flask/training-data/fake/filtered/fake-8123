I would like to give 3.5 stars, but upgraded because of the cost and portions.  I liked the pizza.  The crust was on the thin side, like I like, and the pepperoni had a bit of spice, like I like.  But, the sauce was a little watery and the dough was not uniformly crisp.  The were parts that were not uncooked, but were kind of bread like, kind of hard to describe.  But I prefer that to the buttery, chemical taste that some chain places have.  I'm thinking it will be perfect reheated in the oven.  I would not say this is the best pizza in West Haven, but it is good.  For $13.75 I got a large pepperoni and a free small cheese.  My italian bf approved and I enjoyed it.  I will order from there again.
