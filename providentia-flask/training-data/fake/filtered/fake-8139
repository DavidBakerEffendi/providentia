It seems nowadays any place could called itself a tapas bar. Yuca is at best a mediocre mexican restaurant. We ordered a few so-called tapas- they are simply half portion of what they would serve as entre and priced a bit higher. The guacamole is among the worst I've ever had-slimy texture and flavorless. Some kind of salsa was also served- again, one of the worst salsa I've had. The bruschetta is simply inedible. The bread is rock hard, and the size is so awkward that you don't know if you should eat it with utensils or your hand. An espresso-infused rib is slightly better, but the dish lacks originality, let alone subtlety. Corn cake with shredded beef and fried onion- the corn cake was tortured into a Â soggy mess with so many moist ingredients layered vertically- again, it's impossible to eat it in a morsel, and one would shudder at the idea of dividing the wobbly pile. The spanish meatball is not good at all- very heavy-handed in seasoning and no progression of flavor. Food aside, the Sangria is equally awful. None of the food has any originality. The place is essentially a second-rate mexican restaurant masquerading in the name and charging the price of a Spanish tapas bar. The decor is disgusting too. 2 star is way too generous for this place.
