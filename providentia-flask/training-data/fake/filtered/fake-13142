Our waitress was wonderful and very friendly.  She interacted well with the customers and made us feel like family.  I was looking a greek dish and she recommended the chicken soulvaki pita, yummy.  My husband was looking for more traditional fare, her recommendation of the turkey was spot on.  The perfect family restaurant where you feel like family.
