It's a fun new spot to get lunch. BUT I do have to say for $8 for a sandwich I was hoping for more than just 1 slice of cheese with 1 slice of bacon on 2 pieces of overly buttered toasted bread.  And I'm not exaggerating, it's was pathetic.  The tots? VERY good and cooked well.  But they really should up the slice count on the sandwich or I won't be going there often.
