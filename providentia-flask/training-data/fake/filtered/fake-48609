Two of us went to eat here. The penne pasta dish we ordered was not too good. We were charged $5 extra for sharing a dish. So be careful guys if sharing. They do not pre inform you and is not too evident on the menu.we landed up paying $ 22 for a pasta and a small salad. Not worth it at all. Would never visit again.
