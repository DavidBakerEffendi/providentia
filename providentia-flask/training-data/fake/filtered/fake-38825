The most idyllic cozy NYC cafe.   As a native NY, foodie, and home chef , this is my favorite place. from the location, to the highly skilled baristas. The moment you enter - you are welcomed by the most charming staff - home baked goods, great salads & sandwiches for lunch.  They buy & support local farmers and food artisans.
