Extraordinarily good food is a complete understatement.  It is amazing, beyond reason.  The serving sizes are virtually non-existent, however.  Expect to take two or three bites and find your plate quickly empty.  I have a rather small appetite and do not mind smaller portions, but this place is less a restaurant and more of a giant finger food sampler with a hefty price tag.  Looking at the menu you'll raise a brow at the prices, then further raise a brow when you'd expected to get what you'd paid for.  In taste, definitely.  In portion, definitely no!  Needless to say I'd venture there again, but only if someone else was willing to fork out.
