3 out of 4 of our dishes were excellent (the pizza being lackluster). That would get the place 4 stars but dinged them another star because the waiter was really quite rude. We had a 6PM reservation and he was rushing plates off our table and brought us the check, unasked, at 6:45PM (while people were still eating). He also seemed visibly upset that we did not order appetizers or dessert. I know the place is small and they want to turn over tables but it was empty when we arrived and still had tables when we got pushed out the door.
