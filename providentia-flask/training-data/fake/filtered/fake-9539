The young who makes my burrito is very sweet (Everytime I go!) He's wonderful. The manager is pretty intimidating and doesn't come off very friendly. As for the food, it's a solid choice (cheap and tasty). It's way better than moes (on route 33). Plus you get free chips if you check in! Can't beat that
