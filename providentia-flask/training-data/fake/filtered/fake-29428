If you like good mexican food, Adobe Blues is ok, but try Burrito Bar or any place on Port Richmaond Ave for better. If you like good beer, Adobe Blues is ok, but try Killmeyer, Play Sorts Bar, Unique Billiards, or Bootleg Mannigngs for better. If you like getting abused by an asshole bartender, then go to Adobe Blues, Â it's for you.
