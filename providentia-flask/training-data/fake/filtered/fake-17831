As a long time Red Hook resident I feel that Fort Defiance embodies the spirt of the neighborhood.  I know that sounds cheesy, but it does.  It's eclectic, artisan, quaint, and delicious.  The cocktails rival some of the best Manhattan cocktail bars and the atmosphere is much more comfortable.  The food is also excellent.  Don't skip the ever-changing oyster options.  Burger night is great for saving a little cash too...as it can be a little pricy.  This place, like so many others in the nabe, was hit hard during Sandy.  I walked passed the restaurant the day after hurricane Sandy.  Scrawled in chalk on the menu board just outside the door read, "Chin up Red Hook, we're alive aint we?"  Fort Defiance has recovered, is very much alive, and is as good as it's ever been.
