If you want to pay $50 for a round-trip cab ride downtown and experience mediocre overpriced food then by all means visit North End Grill. I am a big fan of Danny Meyers and have eaten many times at all of his restaurants but this one didn't have any of the DM vibe, except for the inviting space and "pleasure to serve you staff." The best dish was the garlic infused clam pizza which was a perfect start  as was the marinated hamachi sashimi  but from  there all was downhill. Expensive and miniscule artichoke salads should have been served with a magnifying glass but it didn't matter since both were sent back to the  kitchen not because of their size but because the flavors were muddied and dull. Halibut at a whopping 27.00 was also tiny , weighing in at 4 oz max and a steel head salmon was just ok. Wild mushroom and kale risoato - not a typo but a nod to the vegans was perfectly ordinary. When our party of 4 left we all were in agreement that this place has a long way to go... and what's up with all those egg dishes ??
