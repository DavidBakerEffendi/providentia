Had a two great meals - the first was inside. My wife and I had dinner seated at a window table which we were lucky to get because the place was packed and we showed up late but they held our reservation. The food was fresh and each dish was prepared well. I was impressed becasue my first inclination was that it was going to be another tourist trap on the water... but from the service to the wine list, everything was above expectation! That led me back to try it again and this time we sat on the deck. what a wonderful experience! Give it a try! Foodies will love this place.
