Yeah, now this was good! I've been looking for food like this for a long time. I'm usually cautious of internet reviews but this time it was accurate. I'm tired of reviews that rate chain restaurants as 4 stars. Food, service, and atmosphere reviews were accurate. I'm from Massachusetts and stayed in NJ to take day trips with my family in to NYC... This place was better than the food in Little Italy. Don't let the store front or neighborhood fool you... Do yourself a favor and walk right in. I spent $130, before tip, for a family of 4, including soup, entry, a bottle of homade wine, and dessert... And it was well worth it... For a change. We'll be back tomorrow for lunch. I'm just glad it's not in my back yard because I'd be there every night... TRULY, a hidden gem!
