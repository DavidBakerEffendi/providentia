Have not been disappointed yet. Live close-by and enjoy a brief walk over to enjoy a delicious lunch, including steak tacos (Rob's favorite) and chicken enchilada (Pam's favorite). Cisco and Eva make the experience personal and welcoming. Food is very good, service with a smile, and very affordable.
