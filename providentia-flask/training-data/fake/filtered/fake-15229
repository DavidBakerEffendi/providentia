I had a pizza craving and decided to check out NYPD pizza. I had heard good things, and I was in the area. I have to say, it was very good. We got a BBQ grilled chicken pizza. Usually, I don't like chicken on pizza - I think it's kind of weird. But the chicken on top was amazing! It was sliced thin instead of chunked on there like most other places and it was juicy and very flavorful. Between two of us, we ate the whole thing in about 10 minutes. The crust was pretty good, although it could have used a little bit more flavor and chewiness. I've had better NY pizza, but this was pretty good.
