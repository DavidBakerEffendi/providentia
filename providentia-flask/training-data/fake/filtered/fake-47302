Had dinner here last night and it was awful. Hamburger is supposed to be 3/4 lb. and it was more like 1/4 lb. It was much smaller than the bun it was on. I asked our server 3 times to be sure that it was cooked medium and he assured me that it would be. It came out well done! I also asked for seasoned fries, as that was one of the choices and my brother asked for plain fries without seasoning. I got what he got PLAIN fries without seasoning. I also thought the salad bar had little to offer in the way of a variety of vegetables. There were not many choices - not even carrots, which should be a standard. Would not return here - Charlie Browns was much better than this place.
