I'm going to say they miss the mark.  I've been coming here since they opened, maybe 6 or 7 times to date.  Each time, I end up being slightly disappointed but have been always willing to give it another shot.  I love the idea that most of the fare is sourced local, I fully support the concept and gladly pay the premium for it.  The weakness however, is not really the individual ingredients here, it's the service to some degree and their dishes to a larger degree.  We ordered the bacon almonds and the cheese board to start.  The bacon almonds were covered in sugar, so much so that when we were done picking them out of the dish, there was about an inch deep layer of granulated sugar in the base of the little bowl - why so much?  The cheese board was good, and was the highlight of the meal, even though they supply you with 5 squares of crisps that are smaller than wheat thins to go with the entire board of cheese.  The mussels and a double burger were next.  The mussels were covered in mayo on a weak broth ... It doesn't matter to me that the mayo is homemade or fresh, but what is it doing on mussels atop a thin broth?  Almost curdles, not good.  The double burger is a standard finisher for me, and is more like an appetizer, only slightly bigger than a slider, although certainly thicker.   Sadly not cooked to anywhere near what I had asked for.  Service was truly marginal, pretty much as per usual, although you do get lucky on occasion... I still tipped 25% because I have a hard time not doing that, even though it really isn't earned here.
