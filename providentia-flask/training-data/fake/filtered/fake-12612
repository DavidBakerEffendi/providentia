Finally got to sample the lunch menu. (I've only gotten breakfast at this place so far and I highly recommend the Talya omelet, $7, which has turkish sausage and comes with cheese pastries.) Today though I had the tilapia ($12) and my husband got the beef stew ($12) and we both loved our food, which came with a choice of pilaf or mashed potatoes. My tilapia also came with a side of veggies: just eggplant, tomato and garlic I think. Really different and really light tasting; I was impressed and I don't even normally like eggplant. Hope this place does well; Bayonne needs more places like this that cook this way (letting the food speak for itself as opposed to drowning everything in oil or tomato sauce.)
