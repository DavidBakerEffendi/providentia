I'd like to start off by saying I don't ever write reviews on restaurants because everyone's taste usually vary so greatly. But I had such an amazing dinner here I wanted to write one. See when we got to Eataly my party and I were amazed at the market and atmosphere of BIRRERIA, but were very very worried when we saw how limited the menu was. We were just going to get drinks and some cheeses but decided to stick it out and give it a try. I'm so very happy we did. I got the pork dish, and I'm not a huge pork lover, and it was the best thing I think I have ever eaten. We were so pleased we stayed. So if you look at the menu and think you won't like it, give it a try, because it was truly AMAZING!!!
