The Witherspoon grill is an Excellent Steak House that we frequently eat at. However, this morning my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed their brunch. We each had an order of "Bread Pudding French Toast" and it was one of the best breakfast meals I have ever eaten. Joli was our waitress who was both charming and efficient. I would suggest that anyone eating at the Witherspoon Grill ask for either Jason or Joli as their server.
