Simply fantastic.   I was in the mood for dim sum and saw that they had shanghai style soup dumplings so I gave it a try.  They were great (pork and crab). I had scallion pancakes which also were perfectly thick and not overly greasy. The best part of the meal was the salt and pepper pork chops which tasted like those I've had in China.  Unexpected awesomeness there and I most certainly will return when I'm back in Philly.
