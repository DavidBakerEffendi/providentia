I love, love, love Pietro's. I don't think I've ever been disappointed with their food so far. Their calamari for appetizer is great and I love their Penne a la Vodka. I do suggest to split it with someone because it's a huge serving. The service is always great, they're very attentive. One night, my friend and I decided to eat at Pietro's and it was 10 minutes before closing. I thought they'd hate us for coming in so late especially when they were already cleaning but I still got that warm, attentive service they always have.
