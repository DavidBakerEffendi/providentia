My husband and I like to come here for the happy hour and some food and have no reason to complain. All the staff is very pleasant and the bartenders are very attentive. The food is also delicious and comes in humongous portions. We have gone maybe a dozen times so far and we both look forward to the good times we have there. We have recommended Puerto Vallarta to friends and brought one with us recently. Â If you are going for happy hour, just make sure that you get there early, as to get a space at the bar. The whole place fills up VERY fast on the weekends! One of my favorite restaurants to date, and my absolute favorite Mexican restaurant.
