This was one of the best restaurants we have visited recently. Our waiter was friendly and efficient. The food was excellent. Even the bread they served was very good. We had Eggplant Rollatini for an appetizer, and Andrea Risotto and Pork Ossobuco for entrees, and Pera Con Gelato and Tiramisu for desert. Everything was excellent. While it was a little expensive, we both felt that it was well worth the money due to the quality of the food. Also, we had enough left over for two more meals, so really not at all overpriced. I highly recommend this restaurant, and I am looking forward to going back.
