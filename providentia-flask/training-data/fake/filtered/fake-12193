Miya's is one of my favorite places to take company when they come to visit because I know that these fanciful and artistic flavor combinations exist no where else.  Everyone is in awe of the menu--the novel ingredients and unique combinations not to mention the passion that goes into the concept and construction. That being said, I haven't been impressed with every roll I've tried--there are certainly are some flavor combinations that just don't work for my palate.  But the beauty of the menu is that there is honestly something for everyone. The service is sometimes a little lax, which makes total dinner time a tad longer than I would prefer.  So, go if you know you have the extra time to spend. Pricing is a varied as well--from super expensive to dirt cheap.  And the sake is superb! Chinese Firecracker is hands down the best option on the menu for those who like a little kick.   Overall, a favorite location within downtown New Haven, and definitely worth the money/wait!
