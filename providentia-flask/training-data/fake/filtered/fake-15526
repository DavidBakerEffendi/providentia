Am√©lie this place like it has the plague. I hated it. Its full of teen bopper gays, the night I went they were having a christina agulaira, justin, britney contest. the guys were awful, the booze sucked, the music was for crap, cramped outside...i even saw bobby trendy from the anna nicole show there. Don't bother.
