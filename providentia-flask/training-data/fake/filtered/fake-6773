We had dinner here on July 3rd.  The food and the wait staff were phenomenal.  My husband and I shared the mac & cheese dish; it was outstanding!  For our entrees, I ordered duck and my husband ordered hanger steak.  Since I order duck quite often when we eat out, I can confidentially state this was hands down the best duck entrée I've probably eaten.  I prefer my duck medium rare, the dish was prepared exactly the way I wanted it and the portion was just right.  Interesting side note, my husband requested his steak be cooked medium and apparently the chef had overcooked the steak; as our waiter came out to apologize for our wait and indicated that our entrees would a few minutes longer.  Honestly, we hadn't noticed our wait to be very long for the entrees, but appreciated the updated and shared a good chuckle with the waiter about the situation.  The décor is warm and inviting and we felt very comfortable just sitting and relaxing.
