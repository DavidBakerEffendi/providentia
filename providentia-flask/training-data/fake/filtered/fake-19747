Went there with my wife and had a delicious lunch (salmon for me, chicken francesca for her. Food was well prepared, service was reasonably attentive but not obtrusive. Enjoyed the decor- reminded me of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture/decoration. Was not cheap, except that we had a discount from Groupon.
