This food is simply stunning. In every meal (of which we have had at least six) the execution is flawless, the flavors continue to be new, exciting and complex, and the atmosphere and wait staff are very pleasant. The food is always complimented by a well-selected beer and wine list. Above all, the Chef must be commended for his complementary amuse bouches. Every time we visit, we are presented with a new amuse bouche that consistently sets the tone for the coming exquisite dishes. In short, you must try this restaurant. The menu is always fresh and seasonal and cooked to perfection. This place is fantastic for date nights and anniversaries. P.S. Try the tasting menu! It is worth every penny.
