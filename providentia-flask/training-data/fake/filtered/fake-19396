Truth be told, this is the restaurant that inspired me to join yelp after five + years of consistent use. My wife ordered the lamb chops, and one of the three chops served was raw. Literally, raw. We sent it back (the one chop) and it came back a second time ALMOST raw. (Not medium rare, like a tasty lamb chop should be. But raw.) I ordered a burger. It came out cold. The waiter didn't return to our table for twenty minutes so I ate it. (Meh.) The tables are tiny. I don't think text can do it justice so check out the uploaded pictures. Also waited at least twenty minutes for our drinks and did not order during a busy time. The appetizers were served simultaneously to the entree. In rereading my review, I feel like two stars is an incredible generous review -- and if I find myself vomiting in several hours, I will revisit and edit accordingly. Good luck.
