We went to Cucina Forte for a family birthday.  There were 21 of us.  Not only was the food delicious, all orders arrived together and hot which is a difficult task.  Everything was delicious!   Gloria made us feel very comfortable and welcome.  It's a BYOB and our bottles were opened quickly and poured as we took our last sips.  They even made a special birthday cake which was the best cake I ever had.  If you're looking for delicious food , service and want to feel like you're like you're a part of the family, go to Cucina Forte!  I can't wait to go back.  Thanks so much Gloria!
