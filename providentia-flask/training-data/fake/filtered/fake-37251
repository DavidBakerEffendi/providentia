We went on a saturday night, ordered yuca huancaina okay, lomo saltado okay but the pollo a la brasa too dry, the chupe de camarones too hot (spicy) they did not know how to make it milder (some milk will do the trick (pure peruvian way), fish too salty.....in general for what we have been charged it was a total rip off. Oh i was forgetting, what they claimed to have served as lucuma ice cream wasnt it tastes more like coffee almond ice cream. I am from Peru and believe me this would be qualified as a mediocre restaurant in Peru. Management was so rude, they dared to tell us "people are waiting for this table" Do you mind? ....Total disgraceful, we advise anyone that have respect for themselves not to support this restaurant.
