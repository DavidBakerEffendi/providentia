Best pizza you'll ever have and its not even close. You may have to wait in line for quite a while but it is most definitely worth it. They only serve whole pizzas but they are relatively reasonably priced considering the reputation of the restaurant (I believe it is a $14 for a large plain). You don't feel sick or bloated after eating an entire pie either and believe me you will want to (I usually don't eat more than two slices anywhere else). The calzone is also very good. If you get it to go or delivered they do not give you a cardboard box so the taste of the pizza isn't effected in any way and the ingredients are always fresh. Definitely a place to check out.
