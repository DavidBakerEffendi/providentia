The pizza is not all that. Â I despise everything else about this establishment. They're SO famous that they feel the need to be: 1. overpriced 2. cash only 3. pretentious 4. prejudiced against slices Honestly, go to John's on Bleecker in the village. The food is just as good but the ambiance is ten times more chill.
