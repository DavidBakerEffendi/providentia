I have tell everyone who thinks this real Japanese ramen that it is not! It is a wonderful creation of fusion dish, but it's far from deep earthen flavor of original ramen it should be. 3 star is based on expectation of the hype. Â Great concept! Good dishes, but I rather chew on original ramen noodle!!!
