I go to Pommes Frites all the time, but usually I just eat all of my fries at once--obviously they're good then. Last night, I picked up some poutine with the intention of eating it but then I fell asleep. I just woke up and started eating it, and I was so surprised to see that the fries were still very edible and tasty. When I leave any other fries alone for a few hours they take a turn for the worst and become too disgusting to eat (texture changes, they become super starchy...) I was so happy about this this that I decided to make a Yelp account and write a review. I love Pommes Frites!!
