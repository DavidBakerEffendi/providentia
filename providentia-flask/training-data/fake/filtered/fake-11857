We got a reservation within an hour of when we singed up on Yelp. Started with the stuffed mushrooms, then the salad, and the chicken Marcella.  Our waiter was great. A lot of fun. Food was fabulous with big portions. Don't forget the Oreo, Hot Fudge Sundae.  What a way to top it off. Great location right on Times Square.  Great atmosphere.
