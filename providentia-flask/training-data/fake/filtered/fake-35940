Great pizza, excellent octopus and lamb, good meat and cheese plate, sucky salads. Could've gotten 3 stars except for the servers - indifferent and more than Â a bit rude. Attitude from the get go. Plopping down plates, not telling us what the meats or cheeses served were (good cheeses, too). Okay, the place was busy; but taking my plate before my fork went down while hovering over my wife asking "Are you done eating?" while she was STILL CHEWING was a bit much. Get the pizzas to go.
