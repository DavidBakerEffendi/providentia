When I stopped for gas on 95 N and saw the Go Organics sign - I figured I would give an egg sandwich a try.  IT WAS SO DELICIOUS - hot and very tasty!!!!!   I will definitely stop each time I pass through and look forward to trying many of the Go Organics menu items.  I felt energized and healthy which is not a typical feeling after eating rest stop food.  Thank you Go Organics - I hope you expand rapidly.
