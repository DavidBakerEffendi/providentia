Excellent vibe, delicious food!!!! Went on a busy Saturday night with 3 friends and we had an amazing time!!! Absolutely loved the loukaniko sausage as well as the spreads with pita bread. Service was fine and music had us in a great mood all night long!! Going back next Saturday night again, highly recommended, great way to start your night out in or around Tribeca...
