I went to Mama Mary's recently for the very first time. The resraurant was hot as hell.  The staff was full of attitude and after waiting for my food fro over an hour, it was missing some items. I hoped the food would be worth all of the aggravation, but it really wasn't.  The meat was tough and the portions were small. I don't think I will be returning.
