Here are the facts nice and simple: Pros: Great Pizza, probably the best in NYC but I would have to try every Pizza joint in NY to make such a claim. I would say its one of the best Pizza's I have ever had. 5 Stars for the Pizza. Cons: Long lines of people waiting to be seated. Expect to wait around 30 - 60 mins to be seated. Slow service, probably due to the amount of people that go there. But any time I went there I was never satisfied with the service. The wait staff is really not customer friendly. And I have been in the restaurant industry for a while and I have worked myself as a waiter and I know very well what good or bad service is. These waiters just don't seem to care at all. They better thank their lucky stars that this place has such a huge rep. and due to the amount of people that go there they probably make some decent tips, cause if these guys worked in my restaurant they would not last a day. Â  Owner and waiters rush to get you out the door once you have finished your Pizza. And God forbid you order a coffee or an espresso (which really sucks by the way) they are just gonna tell you straight up: Finish your damn coffee and go!! ( This was told to me by the owner the last time I went there). I'd understand if I knew the guy or if he was joking but he said it with the most serious intentions ever. Personally if I wanna go to a place that claims to have the best Pizza in NY the least I expect is to enjoy my time there, relax and not get rushed. But that is not the case here. And this has been my experience any time I go to Grimaldi's. I am giving it 3 Stars just cause of the good Pizza served in this place, otherwise it would get 1 star for everything else.
