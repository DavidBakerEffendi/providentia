Food is not bad but service staff is a little bit racist. We were a multi-racial group, including an African-American and some Asian-Americans. The staff always served the whites first, then the Asians, and then finally the sole black person at our table, even if they had to skip the sequence and walk all around the table. I couldn't believe this was happening in liberal Princeton; I thought I was in Birmingham! Try the experiment yourself and see. I will boycott this restaurant and encourage others, whites and non-whites to do the same.
