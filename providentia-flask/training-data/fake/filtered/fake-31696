I just ordered take out from Stamna. IT ROCKED! OMG!! I could hardly wait to get home; the food smelled and looked so good (I ripped open a bag just to see)! Â Another plus? The food was still piping hot when I finally got home with it 20 mins. later. I hate it when the food gets cool, or arrives lukewarm. It was well worth the wait - The lemon potatoes are excellent, the chicken and meat gyro platters were delicious. The green beans in tomato sauce were so rich... We ate until we were beyond stuffed, it was so good! Never had dandelion greens before. They were sort of like spinach, with a slightly bitter tang, (way less than the bitterness of broccoli rabe). It's making me look at my "weedy" lawn a lot differently now... who knew I had such an abundantly available, tasty and probably nutritious food growing right in my backyard? It time to stop killing the greens and start cooking the greens! Sprinkle with a little fresh lemon. I was delighted to meet one of the owners, Angela, who was very gracious and gave me special attention and a nice dessert, to boot! Thank you, Angela! On my way out, I was pleasantly surprised to see a display of the freshest fishes ever... laid out for the choosing, and there wasn't the slightest fishy smell whatsoever. I look forward to having them cook one of those whole fish for me when I visit for dinner. YUM... I have just become a loyal customer. :-) Very good food! Nice staff!
