I have eaten here countless times since they opened and it has always been dependably good.  Burritos are a staple.  Fajitas are best shared - huge portions and a bit greasy so a little too much for me to handle alone.  Be sure to ask what the specials are - they usually have one or two items that may or may not be on the menu that are always delicious.
