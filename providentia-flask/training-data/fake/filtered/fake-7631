I have been to this restaurant with different friends for three times and every time we experienced bad service. The staff's attitude is negative as if we owe them something. Â After a very unpleasant experience last night, I know I will never step a foot into that place again. I have given them enough benefit of the doubt. Some dishes are okay such as "tofu fish", most dishes are below average and no where near authentic Si Chuan cuisine. If one likes food made in cheap oil, this is a good place to start. And, I believe this place can win an award for the most non-professional, nasty food service in America.
