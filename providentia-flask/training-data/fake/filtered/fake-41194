The ramen is about as good as it gets.  I'm a big fan of specialty shops like this that only do one thing and do it well.  (Yes, this is the norm in east asia but not so much here).  Its neither fancy nor expensive.  The only downside is that the wait can be a deal breaker for both lunch and dinner on both weekends and weekdays.  If you go solo you have a much shorter wait.  Don't even go with a large group (please). They dont offer takeout, delivery or reservations.  But its a noodle shop, so don't complain.
