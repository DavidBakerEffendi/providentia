I'm not sure I understand all the hype for Piora. I found the venue to be quite nice and intimate. However the plethora of staff that attend to you was overwhelming in my opinion, though I understand how some would find that a plus. The wine list was presented when seated, and at more than $60 a bottle for every wine except three we opted for a beer and cocktail, which we had to inquire about. They didn't have my initial beer selection and the lager I ended up getting was really tasteless and uninteresting. The cocktail my date ordered was quite nice however. The monkey bread starter was nice, but nothing special. It Â was just a nicely baked bread with butter. The small potato soup starter they give was a promisingly tasty sample. However it was mostly downhill from there. The short rib appetiser was overcooked and very sweet with few unique flavours. My date got the bucatini which was okay, but very pricey for what you get. The suckling pig was poorly described on their menu and turned out to be small pieces of pork belly and a disaster. The pork was overcooked and tasteless, the other flavours on the dish were indiscernible and pure sugar. There was no savoury or salt element to be found. The presentation was a mess and I had no idea how to eat it and which elements to combine. Many elements were superfluous anyway. And in no way did it embody a suckling pig. The smore-like dessert was okay. There's only so bad chocolate and caramel can taste. In the end the food was okay overall, except the pork dish, but when considering the cost it did not rival other New York City establishments and certainly not ones in other cities in a similar price range.
