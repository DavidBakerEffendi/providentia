First time there had the "filet mignon" and lobster tail. The tail was  excessively overcooked, dry and tough. The meat was the worst cut of "filet mignon" I have ever had.  The bread was good (duh) as was the side of  greens and potatoes that came with the plate but that was it.  Clearly would not return to this establishment.
