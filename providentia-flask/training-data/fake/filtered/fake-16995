Absolutely the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. Pizza took 40+ minutes, making us late. They gave us a hard time and made us pay full price for the second, later, pizza- despite us not wanting it. Upon arriving home, both the pizzas were wrong! Dominos, or for that matter fast food, would have provided better customer service.
