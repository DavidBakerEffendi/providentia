My Pie is a little jewel of a pizza place. Thin squares and very fresh ingredients on all the different pies available. Not one of those greasy pizza joints. Excellent flavor and taste. Sit down on the stool, eat a heavenly slice and watch all the people going by on Lexington Avenue. What a treat!!!
