I am happy that I came in on a busy Friday night! The wait was okay and I waited about 5 mins and the manager Ben (I believe) is a super nice guy, he recommended the tuna dumplings appetizer and the sea bass for entree. I really love the tuna appetizer and the sea bass is the best sea bass I have ever had! The red miso sauce is fantastic with the cold soba sesame noodle on the side. My friend Anna ordered the Saigon beef which is pretty good,too. Besides the food, the best thing I love about this place is the decorations. The design is just so nice and so modern. As they said, they will get the liquor license soon and I think it will be even better. I will definitely come back and check out how their drinks are. Â Good place to hang out with friends. Nice food and nice people.
