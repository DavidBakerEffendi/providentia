I recently moved into the neighborhood and LOVE this place.  Brunch is great.  Their tacos are amazing at night.  The bourbon lemonade is my new favorite drink.  I like it so much I've started recommending it to friends who work in the area and last night we met up there as well.   UNFORTUNATELY, the one thing that REALLY is unappealing is that last night our drinks and dinner on the patio were accompanied by cigarette smoke.  There are no smoking signs all around and yet it is not enforced.  I Really wish they'd nip this in the bud so we can ALL enjoy the patio without the smoke (literally) being blown towards our table.  Perhaps they can even enforce a smoking corner but at this point we were surrounded by it and it made us leave much earlier than we would have otherwise. Please fix this so we can keep coming back!
