It is really sad to read some of the negative reviews here about this restaurant .First  of all service is really good. The server is really professional and I was wondering how he manage the control entire restaurant by himself with only one busboy. I was there with my wife and two other couples on Sunday for dinner and restaurant was full and I was looking at him and he knows what he is doing. The food is good and big portions and some of the meals you can share two people . And the restaurant is not expensive at all. If  you go restaurant for a dinner  and you like fresh air they got patio too. And its beautiful.  I will recommend couple dishes you have too try  first eggplant salad as a appetizer and they have nice  Shepard salad with crumbled feta cheese on top and for main course  either lamb chops or Turkish ravioli  so delicious. I recommend this place for everyone  even for kids they got big menu . You will not be disappointed in there.
