Ok, so I have been here twice in the last few weeks. First visit my fiance and I had the hummus (boring) but when my chicken pot pie came I was blown away. The crust is flaky with sea salt lightly sprinkled on it. The creamy base with veggies and chicken was the best I have ever had. My fiance had a burger which he didn't like but when I let him try my pot pie he ate the rest of it. Drinks? He didn't order any specialty ones but when I asked for a chambord or poma margarita and they didn't have either they muddled some fresh raspberries to accommodate me which was very good. I liked that they made an effort or the service. Second visit on 11/1/12! We ordered the the charcuterie board that we added humbolt fog cheese to and the bbq french fires. I love cheese so no issues there but the fries were ok. Nothing special. For our mains of course we both ordered the chicken pot pies :-) Overall, will go again and try out some of the meat preparations which went by the table many times and smelled great but with the pot pie to share as our appetizer.
