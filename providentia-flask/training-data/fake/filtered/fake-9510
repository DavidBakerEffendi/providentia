I read all the reviews and it had my mouth watering.  I grew up in Kearny, NJ and the Argyle was a regular stop for us.  It seems its just always been there and always made the best fish imaginable.  I haven't been back to NJ since 1994 but I made a bee line straight to the Argyle the moment I hit town.  I envy anyone who gets a chance to go there.  Enjoy!
