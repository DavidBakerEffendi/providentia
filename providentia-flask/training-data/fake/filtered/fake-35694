My favorite spot!   I try to order the delicious salads, but the paninis are always calling my name.  The deep and sexy house beats are also drawing me into this beautiful spot.  The owners are accommodating and friendly each time I visit.  I even brought friends and family and they enjoyed this wine bar as well.   Thank you, Bocca  Rossa, for never disappointing!
