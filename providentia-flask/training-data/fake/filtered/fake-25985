Hands down best deli in the county, period. Quality and service aren't catchphrases to these guys - they're a freakin' religion. To say they're a friendly hard-working crew doesn't do them justice. When you go in for the first time, the next day they'll remember not just your name but probably your order as well. Extensive menu at a very reasonable price per portion. Catering is top notch and they'll get it to you next day. Their fresh brewed iced tea is what keeps me going every afternoon and they've got a lot of snacks like soy crisps and vegetable chips that you won't find anywhere else - they'll ease your conscience after wolfing down one of their massive Sloppy Joe's! Simply the best.
