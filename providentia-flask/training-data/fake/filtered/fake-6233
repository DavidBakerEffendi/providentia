BEWARE - they recently raised prices by 30% plus. The food typically varies between good and very good but is not amazing. Similarly the d√©cor is decent but not spectacular and the service is usually good. They have some annoying quirks like nothing for kids to drink - no milk or juice. At their old prices (which as of this writing are still listed on their web site) we would dine there frequently and it was a decent value but when we went there last week we were first surprised at how empty the restaurant was and then simply shocked when we saw their new prices. Entrees that had been $15 were suddenly over $20! They offer entrees with vegetables or a side of pasta. One of our friends ordered both and was charged $8 for a side a pasta brining the total well over $30. The food and setting simply cannot justify these prices.
