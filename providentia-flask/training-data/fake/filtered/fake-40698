Visited a friend in NY last month, and we had dinner here twice in a span of a week! I insisted we go back for a second time because the margherita pizza is TO DIE FOR! Best I ever had, honestly. I would marry it if I could. Ohh I love love pizza. I also like the no-frills menu, theirs was kept to a minimum so you easily know that what they are serving are all special. Four stars only because on our second visit, our wait took awhile. Not much of a bother, but when you're hungry and you are asked to wait for a table... you'd understand what I'm trying to say. I will MOST DEFINITELY go back when I visit NYC again!
