I just visited this diner tonight and let me tell you it was great! My family and I stopped in for a bite to eat on our way home from a long road trip and I would definitely stop in again. I ordered an Ankita Salad and it was delicious: grilled chicken and shrimp with fresh greens and some garlic bread (my mouth is watering just thinking about it again). My husband loved his bacon cheeseburger and my mother raved about her chicken marsala, she had to take some of it home! They are so kid friendly here and the waitresses are just delightful, they were so great with my son (who was a little fussy at first). Definitely a great establishment. I will be visiting again.
