I was on my back home to NJ and decided to stop by and eat at Blu Orchid in Queens.  Everything was fantastic from the price, ambiance, food, the friendly service and specially the the mussels, grilled prawns and panna cotta.  I ate too much, but it was definitely worth it.  Coming back to see this joint soon with  a larger group and it's worth the travel  See you very soon Blu Orchid...
