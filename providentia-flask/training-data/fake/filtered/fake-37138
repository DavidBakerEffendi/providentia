Flat Top is exactly what so many of us have been waiting for! let's start with the food. the food is top notch and simply so so delicious. the chef seriously knows what he's doing and the flavors of the dishes are unique and perfectly put together. for the yelper below, flat top is now back to serving bone marrow (which is amazing)!!! i ordered their new lamb chop entree last week that is amazing. the lamb is not too gamey, and it goes perfectly with the eggplant stuffed with butternut squash, broccoli rabe, roasted garlic and tomatoes. my husband and i were blown away with this new dish, like all the other entrees we've tried (our favorites are the burger, chicken, bass, and steak). Flat top has become our go-to date night spot. it has such a romantic vibe at night and provides the fine dining experience the area lacks. service is always on point and everyone is very friendly and accommodating. we are always excited to see our server there who never fails to make our experience so great every time. now, onto the coffee and the perfect cafe spot it is during the day time. they serve blue bottle coffee, and for those who don't know it is really the best! i'm obsessed with their iced chicory and their seasonal pumpkin latter is also up there on my list (SO much better than starbucks)! we've also gone a couple time for brunch, which is also really great! the scallion and cheddar cheese biscuits they give us when we sit down is so delicious! im always tempted to ask for one more. love their spinach egg white omelette and bangers and mash! flat top really is the best place in the area and is worth a visit if you haven't been.
