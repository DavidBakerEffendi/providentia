Unbelievable! Went here for dinner tonight with my father and could not believe how delicious everything was. We split the wings for an app which were cooked to perfection with just the right bit of spice. We tried the sauces that are on each table with them and while they were all good, the XXX was the best in my opinion. Now, normally I do not go for pulled pork, but I saw "The Macnow" which came with honey smoked hot peppers and sharp cheese and had to try it. Hands down, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. My father had a brisket sandwich that he enjoyed so much, he ordered one to go for lunch tomorrow! We were not disappointed at all and will definately be back in the near future to sample some more of the menu. Side note- Jim, the sandwiches do come with the coleslaw on them. I thought it odd at first too, but actually liked the combo when it arrived.
