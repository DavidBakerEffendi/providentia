Went here last night with my wife for the first time. The second we walked in we knew this place would be something else. The atmosphere was great, I felt like I was back at my nanas kitchen. We were instantly greeted and felt like family. we ordered an appetizer, a salad, and entrees. For starters we had their special artichoke franchaise...WOW. it was great. the artichokes were fresh and the sauce was perfect. We then proceeded to have the Mafalda salad, which is similar to a chopped antipasto. the meats were great as well as the cheeses. and let me tell you, their homemade dressing was out of this world. next time I plan to buy some to keep in my kitchen. Entrees were fantastic, as me and my wife opted for the specials, I had their butterfish (which is a Hawaiian sea bass) and my wife had their "famous" seasoned chicken. both were incredible. Service was also impecable. we had a young waiter named Anthony who did a fantastic job. He also brought out a free homemade tiramisu for my wifes birthday. this will now be our Friday date night. this restaurant truly stands out among the dozens of Italian joints in Hamilton. Highly recommend.
