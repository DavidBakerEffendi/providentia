Wow!  So this is where it all started, eh?  Having just eaten one of these legendary sandwiches - a pepper cheese steak with provolone & onions, I'm surprised that that this genre of fast food actually survived!  The bread was a bit tough and cold and the meat  dry, tough, chewy and barely, if at all seasoned.  And just where did the cheese actually go? I couldn't taste it.  I spent more time picking the stringy meat out of my teeth than actually eating it.  IMHO, this was one over-hyped eatery.  The service was fast, but the employees a bit indifferent & impersonal; even though it was a bit busy, even a small smile takes no additional time & costs nothing extra.  Perhaps, tomorrow, I'll go across the street to Geno's and see how they rate.  Honestly, I've had much better "Philly" steak sandwiches back home.
