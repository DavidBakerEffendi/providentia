Since they first opened, the portions have gotten unbelievably smaller with the prices going higher. I realize that happens a lot these days, but it doesn't cost that much to make Mexican food! With the new renovation, it seems so much colder and aesthetic looking, although the bare concrete floors is a turn off. Service was so-so but the quality of food has definitely gone down hill. It will be a long time before I spend my hard earned money on a meal that consists of mostly beans and rice on the side. It's a shame they lowered their standards.
