We went to Sallys Apizza because my daughter said it was on the Travel channel as who had better, Sally's or Pepe's down the street. she had Pepe's said not bad so we tried Sally's. We waited outside for half hour, got seated in a gross booth, placed order got our drinks in filthy, dirt encrusted glasses, half hour later burned pepperoni pizza arrived dripping with grease, then mozzarella arrived, again burnt! We were starving so we ate it. Then I made the mistake of using the ladies room-one word- disgust, and while waiting for my daughter noticed how filthy rotten dirty the kitchen was, had I gone before we ate, we would have walked out, NEVER EVER AGAIN will we go there. The owners look and are evil, no customer service what-s0-ever!! You people are crazy that rate this place anything higher then ZERO stars, you want fantastic pizza try the New York Pizzeria in Cato New York-(central NY) absolutely the best pizza in NYS!
