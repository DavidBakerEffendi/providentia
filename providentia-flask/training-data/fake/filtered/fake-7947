My wife and dined here with another couple Saturday night.  We made a reservation a few days ahead, when we arrived our outdoor table request was ready for us with out name on the table.  Nice touch.  There was a live band that night so it was pretty busy, atmosphere was energetic and funny.  Ok now for the food.  Cheesy garlic bread is a must.  All four of our meals came out on time and hot.  Food was incredible, I got the Rigatoni Carbonara and it was great.  Our waiter was also very good, great service and fun to talk to very personable.
