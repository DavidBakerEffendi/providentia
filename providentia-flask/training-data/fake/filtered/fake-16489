THe place is good. Not great...To be honest i was a big fan of this place when it opened up last year. I have been there a couple times since and each time I seem to appreciate it less. Spoke very highly about it the first time, not so much second time, and this last visit was ehh. Service has gone down, Could hardly understand my waiter though he seemed like a nice guy. Food was good. My steak came out ice cold, which bothered me. I dont usually send things back but this could not be eaten, after a few LONG minutes, the server came back with the steak. It was warm, not hot but edible. Not sure if i will be back anytime soon.
