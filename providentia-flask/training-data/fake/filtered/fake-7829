On Friday Aug 5 my family gathered at this restaurant for a pre-wedding celebration for my nephew and his new bride (University of Vermont Alumni).  There was over 45 of us.  It turned out to be a disaster.  My husband tried to order a drink at the bar and he was refused service.....not because he was disrespectful, or had been drinking.  He is a 61 year old professional and he was refused solely for one reason  he was Puerto Rican.  When the bartender was called on it by my brother,  the bartender told him he would not serve him and then my brother was called an ASS HOLE by the bartenders friends.  The female bartender did serve my husband but we left anyway.  In this day and age this is a disgrace.  This incident put a damper on the entire weekend.
