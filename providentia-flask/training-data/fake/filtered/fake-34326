What an experience it was to come here! First I was prepared after reading the reviews and knowing what to order and knowing not to mess up the special rice and sauce recipe by adding my own soy. I specifically requested Yasuda as our sushi chef that night and ordered the omakase which allows him to basically order for us. The wait and research was all well worth it because what we got in return was delicious melt in your mouth cuts of fish and although we spent alot, we got a lot of sushi in return. I will definitely be back here.
