HORRIBLE SERVICE.  We decided to give it a try last Saturday since they just opened and wanted to support their business.  Found out later it was a Bad decision.  The service was so slow.  We waited for more than 30 minutes and none of the burgers or the fries were served yet.  We decided to ask for the manager.  She wasn't very helpful either.  Rather than reassuring us about the food to come out soon, she justified their slow service.   Ended up going next door to Chipotle instead.  NEVER AGAIN..
