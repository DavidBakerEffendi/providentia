I have been eating here for a few years now and here is my take. [The Good] Definitely one of the best sushi I have ever had and their uni is to die for. Food is in general expensive but reasonable as my wife and I can have good amount of sushi with a drink for $120-$150 (unlike Megu or Masa with their way overpriced menu). [The Bad - reason for only 3 stars in spite of great food] Below average service, and most importantly, their inability to accommodate their customers. Things like: holding your reservation for only 10 minutes, giving you only 2 hours to finish and leave, no kid under 5, no stroller. So my wife and I need a baby sitter just to eat here and always feel rushed and never relaxed. Not the experience you want when you spend $150 on a dinner. [The Ugly] The worst host ever - he thinks he is above his customers with big attitude.
