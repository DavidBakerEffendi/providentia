1/26/14 The pizzeria is cute but loud. The bread and garlic knots were good. The thin pizza we had as an appitizer was good. My entree, Chicken Savoy on the bone was ok, but the side of cavetelli and ricota cheese had no taste. My wife's entree, Fettuccine with Shrimp in a Voka Sauce also had no taste. Â My wife said that the shrimp tasted like they were boiled. This was our first and last time at Angeloni's.
