The sushi here is decent but the service is very poor. We did not get half of the things that we ordered and the waitresses were very rude towards us when we wanted to order more. Some of the servers also did not speak English well so when we had trouble and did not receive all of our food our server was unable to assist us. Overall very poor experience and I will not be back to this location!
