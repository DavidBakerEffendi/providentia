BEST DJ EVER!!!  I took a large group to Silk City for a bachelorette party and we had the best time ever!  DJDeejay went out of his way (weeks before the event) to make sure the night was everything we wanted it to be!  The bar atmosphere was personal and friendly and the dance floor had just enough room!  The bar service was fast and prices were reasonable.  The music was a blast (thanks to the amazing dj).  We couldn't have had a better time anywhere else and I definitely reccommend this place to anyone looking to have a great time!!
