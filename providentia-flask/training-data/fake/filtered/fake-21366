I love this place.  Every time I go it is delicious.  I highly recommend the pineapple margarita, the elote asado, and the chicken quesadillas with plantains.  the staff is very friendly and eager to help, if not always super attentive.  it's great for a casual date, and really not expensive for a lot of food.  LOVE THIS PLACE.
