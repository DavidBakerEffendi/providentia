What a pleasant surprise we received at this charming tapas restaurant. We have been travelling across the US on holiday from Australia for the past three weeks and stopped here on our way to NYC. We can honestly say this is one of the best meals we have ever had- and we have had many! The menu, decor , service- even the restrooms are exceptional. Claudio and his staff are attentive and give great advice on menu choices. We would highly recommend Bistro to anyone who appreciates good food. :) Connie M.
