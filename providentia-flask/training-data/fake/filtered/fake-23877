We have been going to Bridid's for years and I am crushed.  It must have new owners because this is one of the worst dining experiences that we have had in Philly.  The menu has changed to something sparce and uninteresting, they have raised the prices, the bathrooms were dirty and the food was almost inedible.  In fact, my daughters sliders were inedible because the bread was so hard and dried out.  Bridgid's was one of our favorite restaurants, may we have a moment of silence for it's demise?  Where is Gordon Ramsey?
