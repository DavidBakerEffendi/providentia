The most amazing pizza - square pizza, thin crispy crust. I have only tried a few other things on the menu because the pizza lures me back every time. The pasta with ribs and meatballs is also amazing, as is the house bread they serve you when you sit down. I have not had anything that I have not liked yet and the prices are pretty reasonable. Cooler vibe than most neighborhood pizza joints.
