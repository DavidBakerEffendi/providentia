I was truly disappointed by my experience here.  The ambiance was lovely, the service was stellar, but the food was mediocre at best.  I was appalled at how they managed to ruin some amazing ingredients.  The halibut we ordered was unevenly cooked - one piece was undercooked, the other was overcooked and mushy.  We left the oxtail stuffed artichoke (two of my favorite foods) on the plate as it was overcooked and chewy.  The "slow cooked" pork belly on one dish was hard and chewy.   The lobster was unevenly done.  We were so disappointed that we didn't even stay for desserts, which says a lot if you know me.  I would recommend waiting awhile to visit to see if the kitchen can sort itself out.   If you go, sit outside in the garden and only order appetizers (the stugeon rillete was good) or some cheese with a bottle of wine.
