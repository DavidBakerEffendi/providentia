Honestly.....More food from this place goes on my table than food from my own kitchen!!!  Wonderful & BIG dinner menu.  I agree with a previous poster..."Don't try the carbonara..you may not EVER try anything else"! The make a great apizza also, call it in as you like it....ex, light sauce, well done, crispy bacon....They pay attention to detail.  Prices are very reasonable for this true "GEM" on the hill.... GREAT job Vin!!!!!
