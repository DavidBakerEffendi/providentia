it is a small tiny pale room with sparse decor. the tables are jammmed in very tightly. it is loud and not comfortable. food: apps - grilled octopus, with fingerling potatoes, and a tomato spread a+. very very meaty and not rubbery and very good. pumpkin gnochi  in a brown butter sauce. a +. creamy and good. potato leak soup was flavorless. surprising since the pumpkin market has done a mean potato sunchoke soup in the past. entrees - grouper w/ shrimp. oh boy. grouper was great , but the shrimp were so so salty. :*( no good. hanger steak. tiny strips. not really super special. char (like a salmon) ok. on a bed of lentils that could have been cooked 2 minutes longer. desert- pumpkin bread. dry. coffee ice cream yum. the waiters barely talked to us, and we really felt like we were in their way. and people coming in for their tables just stand there awkwardly and stare at the tables, cause there is no where to go, and the front of house is busy waiting tables or something. and the poor tables right next to the bathroom. this place is so tiny and uncomfortable!   so sad. this really wasnt the great meal i wanted it to be.
