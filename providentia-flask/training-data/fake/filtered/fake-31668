Good food prepared quickly doesn't happen often, but seems to here. After receiving their door hangar, we decided to order in on a chilly evening. The chef was very helpful on the phone in describing dishes in more detail. Delivery was very fast. And our food was quite good. The next time we don't feel like cooking....we'll be calling Quick Fixx again. Pemberton folks.
