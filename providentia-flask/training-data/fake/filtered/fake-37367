A very unique place. The Vietnamese banh mi I buy there is very delicious. Well worth the cost plus two subway rides. I haven't tried all of them. I'm very biased but I've tried the pork and the chicken sandwich. I like the pork more than the chicken. The pork has more flavor to it. The coffee is very good too! Try it!
