Didn't know it was vegetarian, but the food is good. I would tell you what I ordered, but I have no idea what it was. We got a masala dosa and it is bigger than the plate! Looks like a gigantic pancake, but is very good. You get a lot of food for the price you pay. It is not expensive at all. But, once you leave...Holy Heartburn Batman! Those Dosa's really get to you =/
