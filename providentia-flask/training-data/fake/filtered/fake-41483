Not a huge sushi fan here but, was dragged there for a bday dinner. Nice atmosphere, especially on the 2nd floor, more intimate and quiet. The service was decent, the food was great! Really good appetizers and some of the rolls were unique and flavorfull. Favorite was the washington roll. They also have a nice selection of sakes!
