Worst customer service, maybe even borderline racist.  I took my wife for a nice night out hoping to show her a good time.  I had made reservations at Trumpets and we get there pay the $15 cover charge for each to then find out our table had been given to another group. No problem there, very trivial issue.  We were sat down at another table where our initial drink and meal orders were taken then the wait staff seemed to turn a blind eye to us until the food came out.  I had to ask 2 different people to see if they could bring bread to the table since our food was taking long to come.  It took at least 20 minutes for us to get it.  In the 3 hours we spent there, we were never asked for refills for, our plates stayed on the small table we were sitting at for at least an hour after we finished eating and had to ask someone to come get them.  I don't want to say that they were racist since it was our first time there, but when we are sitting in the middle of 3 tables along one side and the tables to either side are constantly asked if they are ok or if they need anything and their plates are picked up as soon as they seemed to be finished with them leaves a lot to wonder.  Both my wife and I are Hispanic, none alcohol drinkers so I am not sure if they did not pay attention to us because we were not drinkers but when looking over the crowd gathered there, we were the only people with color.  The music was great and the steaks we each had were pretty good.  If it wasn't for the service I would actually go again and make it a little hang out spot for my wife and I.
