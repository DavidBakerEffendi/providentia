Good food and low key is how I would describe the place. I've been going to Lisiano's Â for some nine years now. The food over this time period has been consistent. It is a no frills decor, but not a hole in the wall, exactly. Home made food, nothing tasting out of a box. The bread is made there daily, and is worth buying a loaf to take home. The salad with their dressing is great, and I always have the minestrone.
