Went here back in May twice in the same weekend - once on Friday and once on Saturday - because the first time we got food here it was amazing. Both me and my boyfriend had chicken and waffles at around 11 in the morning, and we both agreed that it was perfect the first time we went. I'd recommend anybody to get their chicken and waffles.
