this place is perfect. Falafel and sabich are a spacial delicacy when cooked properly, and, like in any other seemingly simple food, the secret is in the details. The falafel I tasted was nicely presented on a plate, and only the fluffy and crunchy pita bread on side reminded me of the traditional way of serving. Having said that - the falafel balls themselves were good, the add of zaatar and sesame to the pita was a nice twist, and the two salads accompanying it were refreshing and terrific. Very very nice place, and would definitely come again soon!!
