Rude Â , rude yes, button your shirt or I won't serve you, I said really, in surprise. Button your shirt or go somewhere else. I did (go somewhere else that is) for a place that the last time I was there, had 2 servers dressed like cheap hookers, this was unbelievable to me. I had on new shoes, shorts and a dress shirt it was almost 10:00 in the eve, and still over 80 outside. I went to the Pub and they served me unbuttoned shirt and all. No more Kens for me .I had gone there a few times a month. I felt insulted Send that waitress to the Middle East The Taliban needs a few good women.
