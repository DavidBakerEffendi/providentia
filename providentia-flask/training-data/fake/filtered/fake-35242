The atmosphere in Gaia's is wonderful. It's small, but cozy, and the decor is wonderful. It's extremely comfortable and has a great vibe. The food itself was fantastic. I ordered the meat lasgna. it was incredibly fresh and delicious. For me, though, the best part was the price because the lasgna was only five dollars. It was a bit unreal haha. I was so happy with the service, everyone who worked there was extremely friendly. Overall, i really loved the place and i will definitely be coming back.
