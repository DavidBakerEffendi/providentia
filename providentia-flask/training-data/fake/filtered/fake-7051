We tried Pizzeria Verita last night for the first time and it was delicious! There was a bit of a wait but the bar seating was very accommodating. Good wine list and great specialty drinks! I've lived in Italy for a while, so I guess you can say I became a pizza snob. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE American Flat Bread, but I felt like I was back in Italy the minute I took a bite into the Maize pizza and I can't wait to go back and try the Fig and Gorgonzola! Service was great, very friendly, knowledgeable and the pizza came out in about 10/15 minutes after ordering! Also I loved that they had Limoncello which was absolutely delicious! I can't wait to go back and maybe next time I'll save room for the nutella pizza for dessert!
