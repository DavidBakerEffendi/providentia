This is my favorite pizza place.  I crave Saraghina ever Friday and Saturday.  I normally go just for a margarita pizza.  I sit have a little glass of house red and wait for my pizza to go.  When I eat in the service is great and all oh the waiters are sooooo cute and sexy.  Shhhhhh!  Don't tell them I said that.
