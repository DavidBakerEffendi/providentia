Wow, is this an interesting meal. Being adventurous eaters, we decided to go all out. Totto gave us more than we could handle. Every chicken dish was amazing (the wings are a VERY pleasant surprise). The atmosphere was amazing. It feels like you're eating in a place no one knows about. The only reason this doesn't get a five from me is that the kobe beef tongue and tuna liver w/ cream cheese dishes may have stretched the boundaries of my palette just a bit too far. I'll go back, and I'll take newbie friends with me.
