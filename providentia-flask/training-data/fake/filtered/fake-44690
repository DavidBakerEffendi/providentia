I love Baba Olga's Cafe for lunch!! I work close by in the area and find myself there at least a couple times a week. Aliza is super friendly and very accommodating if you have  any dietary restrictions or just want a different variation of what any particular meal offers.  The staff are also very friendly and knowledgable. Today I had the summer veggies and hummus plate and once again I was not disappointed!! The menu changes seasonally so you have to try things as you see them! A couple of my other favorite dishes are the Mezze Plate and the Shepard salad.
