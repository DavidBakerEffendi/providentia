Fantastic! The brunch here is to die for and the music is bumpin! Enjoy a classy Brunch dish with Latin flavor along with a glass of fresh sangria. Their menu had great choices, and I went with the Latin Benedict. The eggs were perfect and the pork duck sausage was delicious. I had the punta Cana and samba sangrias (sangrias at brunch is complementary). I am a white sangria girl but the samba was delicious for red. Highly recommend this place and make sure you reserve seats!
