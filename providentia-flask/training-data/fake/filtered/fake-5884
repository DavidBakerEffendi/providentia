Came here for a Sunday Brunch after walking the High Line...after waiting for them to open, we were the first to walk in but the last to get a table...WHY? Still don't understand the explanation I was given. After we were seated, the server came with water and she filled my glass without noticing the large chip--when I mentioned it, she rolled her eyes. It should have been a sign for me to leave but I was hungry. I ordered the eggs and salmon with the homemade biscuit. It was more like a scone-not fluffy like biscuits should be. And I would have preferred the salmon to be slices-not mixed in. When I asked for butter for the biscuit, I needed to ask twice. The salt on the table is rock salt and doesn't mix in to the tasteless eggs. Overall---I would not go back...I was with two culinary students and they got an eye full, also.
