I can not comment enough on the Gluten Free food. My first meal here was GF Chicken Parm and i was in heaven. Upon arrival we discussed our GF allergy and was given a GF menu and GF warm bread. No mix-ups here GF, DF allergies are taken extremely serious. Â We suggested that night that GF Eggplant Parm should make the menu, approx 2 weeks later we returned and it was offered as a nightly special, it officially is MY favorite meal at La Riviera. It is now offered on the menu woooo hoooo. Their non GF food according to the rest of my family is amazing. We recently attended an all GF night at La Riviera. It was am awesome NIGHT of ALL GF food and a sampling of each entree.
