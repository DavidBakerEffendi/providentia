Ugh! So disgusted with the experience here. Took my mom, dad, grandmother Saturday for a meal on Mother's Day weekend. First of all, the front doors were left open so all the smoke from people smoking at the front door came to our table. thanks, I'm 7 months pregnant. Our server was SLOOOOOOWWW! Everything seemed to take twice as long as it would at another restaurant. Our water wasn't refilled in timely basis. Drinks took 30 mins to come to table, and entrees were covered in cracked black pepper. who does this? does a decent restaurant have the server ask to ADD this seasoning? My grandmother could not eat her seafood meal due to it being too peppery. My dad's saltimbocca was poorly prepared- oh- and the cup of mac and cheese with a little seafood appetizer was $17. we liked the bacon dusted calamari. service sucked so bad- could not wait to escape this place. never going back aweful.
