Drinks are good and service is quick but the food has been nuked in a microwave. If you are a careful observer you'll notice food arriving at your table in under 3mins, piping hot in the middle to the point you have to leave it for 10 mins to cool down and vegetables slightly soggy. Don't really understand the big marks people give for this restaurant other than the fact that had the microwave been thrown away the flavors are actually pretty good. I am sure there are some hard working chefs out there in NYC churning out some freshly cooked amazing tapas that could walk all over this place. There are a handful of items that aren't microwaved and that's the fish!
