Shake shack is only okay. The prices and the portions are kind of crappy compared to a place like 5 Guys. The shakes were alright, but I'm always willing to try again. I luckily didn't have to wait too too long (like a lot of people said I might have to), and the service was friendly, because if I did wait longer it would have slipped to 2 stars. This place really is just okay.
