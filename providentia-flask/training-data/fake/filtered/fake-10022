Damn, I live in the neighborhood and was psyched to have this German Beer Hall arive but am DISAPPOINTED because: 1)  food alright 2) service was BAD 3) expensive 4) too LOUD I did like the atmosphere but not for the hi sky prices that they gave me.  Sad thing is that I live in the hood and I emailed the owners my thoughts Iin thinking they might improve, etc  (I mean if I was an owner, I'd love to know what the customers thought) and they never replied to my email.  Fortuntely, there's many other affordable options with better service and the same beer.
