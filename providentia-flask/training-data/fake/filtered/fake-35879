For several years my Husband and I ate the greek food from the Canal Street Grille it it was previously very good but for the last year the quality has extremely slipped.  The  chicken gyro off the take out menu was so soaked with oil and vinegar that was poured over the sandwich we could not eat it.   The chicken was very dry and thick with no tsantziki sauce on the sandwich as usual.  The mediterranean salad always had ample lamb  but on our last order you were lucky if you found 10 thin pieces. Another order of lamp was about 2 inches and was hard and chewy.   We live in Yardley and this place was convenient but we will never try again.
