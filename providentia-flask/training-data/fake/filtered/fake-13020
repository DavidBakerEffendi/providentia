Outstanding!  Four of us ate there this past Saturday night and it was tremendous.  We were across the street having a drink while we waited for our table. They actually walked over to find us and tell us we were ready to be seated.  Who does that? And trust me, there was a line of people waiting, they could have easily filled that table.  And then the food, omg!  All the entree choices were delicious as were the appetizers, wine and dessert.  We had it all.  Portion size is generous, and the prices are so very reasonable. And the staff was so friendly, even in the fast paced, busy setting, they maintained a great attitude and really made us feel welcomed and never rushed. I found this gem based on YELP reviews, trust me, you need to eat here.  Thanks to the staff for a great dining experience!
