We've been long time patrons & have always enjoyed the food at the Arlington until recently.Wait staff is  mostly inattentive , seems once your meal is served they vanish behind the kitchen doors. The food standard seems to have been lowered. I ordered the ravioli parmesan   & when it was served there was no red gravy to be found anywhere on the plate. It took me so long to get the server's attention that my food had gone cold.  My wife had ordered the fresh  roast pork which looked like it was nowhere near fresh & the gravy was not served with the dish. On a recent visit this week , my wife ordered the hot open turkey sandwich . When served it looked likelike turkey coldcuts on white bread, not hot anything.  The server was oblivious to our complaints & we then decided that The Arlington Diner would not get our business any longer.  Unfortunate , but  we don't like to throw our money away on  food when dining out. Mark me highly disappointed.
