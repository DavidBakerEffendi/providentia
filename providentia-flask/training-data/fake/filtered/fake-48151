Fantastic bar. I actually created a Yelp account just now because I felt I needed to give Swift a positive Review. Went here after class at NYU on a Thursday night with classmates. It's the perfect bar for having conversation: music that isn't too loud, darker lighting, and no TVs showing sports games. It's the perfect place to go to have a a relaxing drink and nice conversation with a group of friends, and a great place for a first date. It's the type of bar you'd walk into and feel relaxed ordering a beer on your own.
