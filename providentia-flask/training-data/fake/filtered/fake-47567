I have a love hate relationship towards this place. I love pizza but hate when its literally sitting on my lap to eat it plus all of the other patrons on my lap as well. The pizza is super yummy! Its nice that after polishing a pie of pizza I know I can walk it off by looking at the brooklyn nd manhattan bridge. Oh yes and the gorgeous city sky line while enjoying my ice cream they sell on the board walk.
