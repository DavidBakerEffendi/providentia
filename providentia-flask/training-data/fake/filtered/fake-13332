The chicken is nothing special.  to make matters worse the service is awful. There was a line and one of the workers said " I can't help you because our manager jen said only one to a computer" wow. then to make matters worse the owner decided to crank the techno beats so loud that you had to yell your order, and then cashier had to yell your order to the cook even though they are next to each other.  Don't waste your time here
