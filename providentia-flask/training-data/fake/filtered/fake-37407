wow, this place has really changed completely. i had been there previously, and was overall just satisfied. but now, they have completely lived upto their tagline - Fine dining Cuisine! I ordered Chaat-tini (innovative name) and Seekh kebab...delicious! my wife ordered Tamatar shorba & absolutely loved it. their entrees are amazing & we got some packed for home too. i particularly loved their aura, its refined & elegant. i wanted to sit in the bar, but it was packed. But will definitely go next time. Its nice to see a restaurant with such a splendid decor and skillful cuisine come in our area. Keep up the good work.
