Tried this place last Sunday on the recommendation of few friends from Jersey. Have to admit I was shocked at the big line of people waiting to dine in. We waited about 45 mns. before getting a table. Initial reaction was just shocking to see 100 types of parathas on the menu. We were recommended a few items from the menu and opted to try those since it was our first time. We ordered Big Bite, Bhel Puri, Pau Bhaji, Chopsuey Dosa, Couple of stuffed parathas, Masala Phudina lassi and Masala Kokam lassi. All the items were excellent. We were surprised that this place has been around for 15 Years and we never knew about it. This restaurant is a must visit if you love your food. The taste is simply awesome.
