I have been here several times.  Overall, I like the place.  Super low key and most of the food is good.  Great place if you're in the mood for tacos and margaritas without spending a ton of money. Can't go wrong with: chips & guac, chicken tacos, shrimp tacos, grilled chicken sandwich DON'T ORDER: pork tacos.  they serve you the dry ends rather than the moist shredded pork.  Haven't tried the pulled pork sandwich, but my guess is that this may be where the yummy stuff goes.  The taste isn't terrible, but you kinda have to choke down these tacos...
