Worst restaurant, owner changed last time I came its was very good now it's worst, I had few hair in my food, salt in field was almost non existent, many of the item in menu were not available, sambhar was remotely Indian, Chutney was from ready mix, so do not visit there are good restaurant in few mins distance,
