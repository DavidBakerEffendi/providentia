I was a regular and frequent customer at Le Barricou for years, in spite of the their steadily rising prices in combination with dwindling portion sizes.   Who can resist a decent place that's half a block away from home?  Well now I can resist, because I had the disgusting experience of stepping in a pile of human feces on the floor of their bathroom.  I couldn't see it because the lights in the bathroom are rediculously dim and there were dead leaves all over the floor.  I quitely told Sharon (the only person working in the front), what had happened and that I just had to clean it off my shoe.  She told me she would have someone clean it up.  She didn't apologize for my nauseating experience or comp anything on our bill.  Normally, I let Sharon's unpleasant attitude slide, because she is only employed there because her son is part owner.  However, I found this extremely offensive since I used to go there on average of 4 times per week consistently.  Now I don't go there at all.  Dumont is much better anyway!  Also with the additions of Xunta, Hachi and Ooba to Grand Street, it's no skin off my back.
