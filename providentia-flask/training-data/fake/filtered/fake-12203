With all the new trends happening in the culinary industry today, Miya's Sushi is far ahead of its time.  Its owners, Bun Lai and his mother, transverse their ideals, culinary imagination, and beliefs across several generations.  From the first moment you walk in the door, you and your guests will see this.  Their patrons include students from across the city, the middle aged workers of the city both blue collar and white collar, and their older patrons; all the while, everyone is relaxed, happy, and very excited about what they're eating.  The diversity is unmatched in most culinary institutions, but the reasons for this are actually very simple: fantastic culinary creations, great prices and specials, and an ideology that pertains to us all--waste not want not when it comes to our planet and its resources. Miya's Sushi is focused on creating sushi masterpieces.  Only, they do not focus on traditionally consumed delicacies found in most restaurants or from exotic species found elsewhere in the world, but specialize in using by-catch and invasive species found right here in long island sound and our surrounding waters and farmlands.  Miya's invasive seafood menu includes Lionfish, Japanese knotweed, Kudzu, and the warty comb jelly just to name a few; furthermore, their menu continually introduces new items from their owner's unlimited imagination a continuous basis.  Basically, no matter how frequently you visit Miya'sSushi in New Haven, CT., your palette will be constantly entertained by new and exciting foods that in all modesty are preserving our world for the next generation.
