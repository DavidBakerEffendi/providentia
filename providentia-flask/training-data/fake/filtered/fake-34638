I want their recipe for the veal stew!  Except I probably don't have the patience for the hours or days of marinating and/or simmering that went into it.  Which is probably the reason it's not on the everyday menu, but if they tell you it's the special, and you don't hate or object to veal, don't even think about ordering anything else! Not that there's anything wrong with anything else.  My wife's Fettucine Bolognese was excellent, and my grilled calamari appetizer was pretty standard, but very good.  And for dessert -- I don't know if they make their gelato in-house, buy it in bulk, or something in between; all I'll say is, the hazelnut took me back to a sidewalk in Florence, too many years ago. This is definitely a local gem, and we'll be back!
