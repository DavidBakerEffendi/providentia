I first popped-in for coffee and dessert with a few friends. The staff couldn't be nicer and service was great.  The owner, Luis, came out of the kitchen to greet us and to make sure we were happy with the food and service. Since that initial visit, I have been there a few more times for breakfast, dinner, and late-night coffee and dessert. Every visit has been good.  Every dish has been well presented and great tasting.  The atmosphere is nice and relax.  Once inside you will think you are in Park Slope or Williamsburg. My wife and I looking forward to Sunday brunch with live music.
