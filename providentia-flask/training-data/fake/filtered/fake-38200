Greek Lady is the place I go when I'm not sure what I want. If I'm in the mood for Mediterranean, I love the falafel and hummus. The chicken nuggets and fries are crispy, salty, and not too greasy (AKA the best combo ever). I eat those things like it's my job. Also great brunch food. Fluffy omelets on deck.
