La Taqueria Shrimp Taco. This one is From another World.....Not many places have shrimp tacos; you were unique among taco slingers for having them.  May I even go so far as to say distinguished?  Not only did you have them on your menu, but you did them better than I've had anywhere else.  For Reals.  The grilled shrimp were perfect, light, and had that wonderful smokey flavor from grilling.  The guacamole and onions on top complimented the shrimp so well.  Truth be told...... and we're being truthful right?......... I was never a fan of the pineapple salsa; it was too sweet for my taste.... But no worries, I never had any problems substituting the pineapple salsa with the fresh green salsa. Shrimp Tacos, you will always be first in my heart, Shrimp Tacos, i will remember you kindly, Shrimp Tacos, i will keep your memory alive in the hearts of others, oh, Shrimp Tacos how I will miss you, Thanks....
