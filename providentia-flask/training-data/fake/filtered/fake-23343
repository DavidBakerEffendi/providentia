This restaurant is really good to be in their neighborhood. They have great food but the only flaw is that it takes a while for seating and after u order, it take about half an hour maybe more for the simplest thing like grilling a burger or having a salad. That's just weird... And because this place is so small they should be working quicker because they have to worry about so many orders at a time. Prices aren't that great. If u would order three burgers it would come out to like $70 in this case u might as well go to McDonalds but that is just shit in a a sponge. They have good atmosphere and such but it a little boring...
