Came here a couple of weekends ago for my sister's 30th birthday.  I was worried I would struggle getting a table for 5 on a Saturday night in Manhattan (and I did), but Bouley managed to squeeze us in at 10:30 - not too late a sitting when you've got an awesome cocktail bar down the road (Brandy Library - amazing!).  Staff was incredible, gorgeous cocktails and wine, and the food was beyond superb!  Best meal I've had in perhaps ever!  Will be going back again for my birthday!
