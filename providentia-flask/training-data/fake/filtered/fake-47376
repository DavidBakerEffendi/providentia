I purchased 2 large pizzas, to go, for about $44.  The crust was paper thin, the hamburger was very salty.  It didn't even taste good. I was beyond disappointed!  I had been buying pizza at Park Ave for many years.  I didn't mind the higher prices because it was the best pizza around but now it's the worst!  I'm done with this place!!  I'm sorry that I feel compelled to tell the truth.  Jeff G.
