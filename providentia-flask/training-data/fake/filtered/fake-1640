The food is always good and, although it can be busy on the weekends, you don't end up waiting very long.  The staff is always friendly and accommodating.  Service is usually very fast.  My only complaint/recommendation is that they really need to update the building inside and out.  Sorry.... I really like the food but IMHO this place is in need of a renovation.  It's a little grimy.
