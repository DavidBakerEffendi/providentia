So, I came here on a recommendation and I'm glad I did. From the outside it didn't seem as spacious as it really is - on my journey to the VIP room (aka THE BATHROOM) i saw a third room in the back. I requested to the hostess to sit there and she said that would be okay). BOOZE: At the bar while I waited I had a cocktail called "citrus and something". The "something" isn't part of the name - I just forget what it was called - it was very good but very dangerous, as in one turned in to 3.... The hostess told me it would be about 10 minutes for the table I requested - it ended up being 15-20mins. FOOD: I had the pasta with rabbit and its hard to do rabbit well - they succeeded. Very tender and tasty. I then had the folded chicken (I know, 2 entrees, give me a break i was HUNGRY!). It's hard to get excited over chicken but the folded chicken was spot on - perfect texture. I think the figs that it's served with was the clincher for me... WHY NOT 5 STARS: You can't tell me it's going to be 10mins and then have me wait 15-20.
