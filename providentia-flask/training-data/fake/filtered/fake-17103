Love love love this place. Me and my husband went there for our weeding anniversary. The atmosphere and the food was beyond our expectation. Very classy and sophisticated. Service is a A*. The waiter (named Ori) was very pleasant with detailed knowledge for food and wines. We strongly recommend this restaurant and surely going back again.
