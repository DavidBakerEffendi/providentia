I recently visited Cuban Petes for dinner, because I love Cuban fare. It was a very good experience--great atmosphere, attentive service and excellent food for a very reasonable price. I had the paella and it was delicious! The place is rather festive--it is fun, and I might expect a band to start playing any moment and for spontaneous dancing to happen. The servers are friendly--but they are not overly talkative. They get the job done... I even met the owner and he was very friendly. I also recommend the Flan--a delightful treat!
