Love this place.  It just opened up a couple of weeks ago.  It used to be a bagel shop called Goldberg's Bagels but it was recently converted into "GoldBurgers".  They have burgers and hot dogs all made from fresh ingredients with quality meat.  You can create your own burger with all sorts of toppings in addition to some suggested combinations (Kind of like a Pizza place that has toppings but also specialty pizzas.) I have had a New England style Chili dog which was great.  They offer a choice of all beef or all pork hot dogs or you can get 1/2 and 1/2 for the best of both worlds.  I went back a second time for a burger and had the Black and Blue burger with two patties and blue cheese.   Also had a strawberry shake that was delicious.  Well worth a stop.
