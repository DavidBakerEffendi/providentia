I came in for a quick lunch and thought the food wasn't too bad (or too spectacular, the veggie meat was pretty soggy and slimy) I only ate it because I was starving. I was waiting for my sandwich and saw a roach scuttling under tables. I mean, it's NYC, I get it. But still. Also, the air was very hot, stuffy and meaty (I don't know how the chef suffers back there). While it was just a regular eating joint, it didn't really look like a restaurant. It looks like it was maybe an office before or something. Yeah, I won't be stopping by again. I'll go expand my bahn mis horizons elsewhere.
