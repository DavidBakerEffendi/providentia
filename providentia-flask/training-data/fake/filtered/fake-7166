ok, I LIVE for izakayas. I grew up with them, and finding a place that actually satisfies me in NYC... is rare. But this place did it for me ;) Super cheap, but recently they raised the price (recession, I understand)- but the portions also got a bit smaller! When I first came here 3 years ago, everything was huge for what I paid for. I usually get: BBQ kalbi ribs Liver sashimi (LOVE) Yellowtail sashimi Deep fried chicken gizzard Fried chicken (looove the ponzu sauce) Daikon salad Hokke ---and a ton of sapporo + iichiko shochu with lemons. Oh and for the ones that have high expectations for ramen, this isn't your place. Hagi is an IZAKAYA, they serve small dishes that are good with your drinks. After seeing a few people eat ramen here, meh, don't even bother. Keep it simple with the sauteed/fried/sashimi dishes. I know, my selection is not good for the ones with high blood pressure, may clot your arteries but it's delicious! OH and occasionally they have uni (sea urchin) sashimi on their specials list so every time I come I pray it's there. My only problem is that there is a ridiculous wait-list on weekends (and sometimes even during the weekday- its midtown- all the Japanese salarymen come out for drinks). Also, I see a bunch of fruit flies flying around all the time, especially in the sectioned corner on the left when you walk in. I don't know where they come from, but I hope they get rid of them soon.
