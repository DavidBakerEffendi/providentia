Well, a group of ten of us were planning to have a nice Friday lunch at Adrienne's. The manager on the floor, a tall portly bald guy, told us that he couldn't give us a table until the rest of our party arrived. There were only five of us at the time. We understood and we were fine with this. We told him that we wouldn't mind sitting at a smaller table while we waited, because we really wanted to enjoy this pizza. There were tables of four and of six. He refused to have us sit at the table for six, and insisted that we sit at the table of four. He was very adamant about it, which I felt was sort of strange. We decided to wait outside in the cold mind you, until our party arrived. While we waited, we saw that he actually sat incoming patrons who were a party of four (and white) at the table for six. We were dumbfounded. When the others arrived, I told them what had transpired and that I would refuse to eat there for obvious reasons. Two friends and I decided to go down to Harry's Pizza Bar, and they accommodated us nicely. We would never give Addriennes our money nor the time of day no matter how great the pizza is. The manager should be fired.
