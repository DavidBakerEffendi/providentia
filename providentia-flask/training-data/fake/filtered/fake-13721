I grabbed a take-out pie from last night's soft opening and came away impressed.  First off the seating has been thinned out since it was "Grimaldi's" with fewer tables leaving the smallish space less crowded.  The pizza was an improvement over Grimaldi's with a more noticable coal flavor, a better rise on the dough and a more flavorful sauce (with a slight spiciness).  The improvements came at a slightly higher price point with a large cheese going for around $20 about $4 more than at Grimaldi's. Juliana's is a great addition to DUMBO, but Wild Rise at 68 Jay Street Bar still makes my favorite pizza in the neighborood.
