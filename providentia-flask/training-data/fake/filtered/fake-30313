I was incredibly unsatisfied with the service in InfiniT Cafe. I was personally insulted by the owner of the restaurant, when the tea is already overpriced, and the service is horrible. I had just sat down with my $6 cup of tea and had a bag of food sitting on the seat next to me. I was harshly asked to leave claiming that me sitting there was "wasting her space." When I asked to finish my tea first, she said I must buy a food item as well as tea. I have never once been treated like this as a regular paying customer. While this Cafe claims to be an environment that is welcoming and relaxing, the owner does not practice this. I would NOT recommend this place to any of my friends or family.
