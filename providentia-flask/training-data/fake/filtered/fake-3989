Average food, crappy service.  They ran my credit card wrong 3 times, mixed up my cc with another customers then gave both  us attitude and it took over 20 minutes for them to correct.  Half ass apology certainly didn't help.  Never see me there again not even if I were to show someone a crappy evening!
