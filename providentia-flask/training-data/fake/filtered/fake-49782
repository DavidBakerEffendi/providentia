I love Hibiscus. My go-to is the curry kale wrap warmed on a Spinach wrap. The owners are so friendly. They make your food to order, and it takes a few minutes to come out because they make it with care and attention to detail. They are also very knowledgeable about health and holistic nutrition. I posted on their facebook asking about natural fever remedies, and they responded very quickly with a suggestion. They even invited me to come into the store so they could give me fevergrass- which they did for free. I'm drooling thinking about this place... totally going there later for some healthy vegetarian comfort food!
