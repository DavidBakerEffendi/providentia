This place is awesome. Cheap tasty food which actually has flavor - cant complain. Beware of the spicy sauce - being somewhat of a spice aficionado I thought I would have to drench my falafel sandwich with the hot sauce to get some flavor. Turns out i just burnt my insides. Its HOT, but so good. Use sparingly. And don't expect fancy. You're paying a pittance for a good meal.
