If the pizza is burnt, the burnt taste and smell comes out of your nose, and you can taste it burnt charcoal to the back of your tongue. Now if you remember anything that is you paid 20 odd bucks for the bunt piece of charcoal. A few days ago I read the Times 20 things to do in which they wrote a great review of the Pitsaria but I don't know what I missed out, perhaps I missed out mentioning I work for a big newspaper corp. Anyhow I went in at the bar area and the bartender gave me the menu with a dry attitude. Fine no one has to smile at me, it makes me feel weird anyways. So I sat there inconspicuously while I could see the line outside the window and I smiled in omniscient. I placed my order and waited for around 35 min for the pizza only to know that they gave my pizza to people next to me who ate a piece of it. I went to the same guy that took my order, who looked too busy and he promised another pizza. And so I waited for another ten minutes and I looked outside the window at the que in envy. Â No more waiting. I went to the front desk and politely but firmly asked the pizza to be packed. Here they had my pizza ready only to see it was smoked to charcoal. It was burnt on the sides and the bottom. Is this how its meant to be I asked the owner and he gave me some reply like "its not an electric oven so"...OK right now I have rats running around in my stomach. Fine I'll take the pizza but I will not leave any tips... The pizza was burnt and it tasted like charcoal and I want my money back...... Don't go there, its a horrible place. The old Grimaldis is shut down and this is a new one. Definitely not worth the money.
