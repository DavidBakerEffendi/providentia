I doubt that there's any restaurant hidden in a strip mall that's better than Luca's. Nestled in a nondescript Rt. 27 strip mall about five miles south of New Brunswick's Art District is a BYO Italian restaurant with top notch ambience, service and its own distinctive approach to Italian food. Our Tuesday evening visit prior to an 8:00 pm curtain at the George Street Playhouse reaffirmed our positive opinion. We shared the Spiedini (Fried fresh mozzarella in a brandy sauce) appetizer and all agreed it was superb. The Pescatore Risotto (Jumbo shrimp, Prince Edward Island mussels, fresh clams & bay scallops in a white wine sauce) was superb, and the ample portion was equally good as leftovers the next night. My wife thoroughly enjoyed the wild Tasmanian King Salmon (Grilled salmon from Honolulu, Hawaii over spinach, broccoli & fire roasted cherry tomatoes in a white wine dijon sauce). It's a BYO, so you're not beholden to a sommelier's high-priced choices. We shall return!
