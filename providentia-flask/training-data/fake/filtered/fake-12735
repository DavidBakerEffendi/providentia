We received a gift card to Lupa for Christmas and made a reservation for Saturday night. We didnt wait long for a table, but it was packed. The atmosphere was great, not too loud and the decor was just enough. Our server and the wine director were both attentive. We started out with the escarole salad and the cured meat tasting plate, all of them were delicious and we loved the combination. I had the bucatini al'amatriciana which was very flavorful and perfectly seasoned, I order this dish often and it was the best I've ever had. My boyfriend had the linguini carbonara which was made a little differently than usual, but still delicious. We also ordered an amazing Tartufo for dessert. It was a great experience and we will definitely be back!
