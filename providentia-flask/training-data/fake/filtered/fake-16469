I went to Republic this past friday night and walked into a buzzing restaurant and even though the place was busy I was greeted politely and didn't have to wait more than three minutes to sit down. I sat in the front room and was waited on by Britney, who was extremely pleasant and knowledgeable. I had the fish and chips and a bottle of the Justin Cabernet Sauvignon which was suggested by Britney and was an excellent choice. I loved the atmosphere and set up of this restaurant Â along with the staff who were polite and professional and in my case my server knew the ins and outs of this restaurant and it's menu like the back of her hand. I will be returning and spreading the word.
