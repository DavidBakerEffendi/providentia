Not sure what restaurant the other reviewers dined at but our experience was mediocre at best. Reservations were convenient, the seating was prompt, and the attendant staff were very friendly - but it went down hill from there. "Salt" is not a food group and Vernick went through a lot of salt . . . everything from the grilled romaine salad to the buckwheat pasta to the tuna to the pork were salty.  The buckwheat pasta was not "al dente" - is was chewy and under cooked.  This strikes us an the easiest and most fundamental missed self-test coming out of the kitchen.  Pasta should just be done right or done over. The biggest stickler for us, however, was the wine pour.  It was inconsistent and parsimonious.  It is cute to have the bottle brought to the table for a sip check of the grapes, but for $14.00 I want more than two fingers - the pour was just cheap.  Follow the Tria model if the table staff can't be trained pourers and logo-mark the glasses to mark an accurate pour. The atmosphere was contemporary and clean, trendy and sheik . . . but all lost due to the pounding music of James Brown.  I asked our waiter, Arielle, to tone down the music selection and she only advanced the music to the next song on the CD . . . "I Feel Good" became "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" . . . hardly appropriate dinner music. Dessert was a water bottle from a street vendor to offset the sodium overdose and ice cream in beautiful Rittenhouse Square. Price: $159.00 for the three of us was way too pricey for two mini-plates each (we skipped the entree') and a couple of drinks.   The smiles of the staff are enticing, but the overall experience was just a non-starter.  We won't be back. Realtors check back mid-July first for the "for rent" sign.
