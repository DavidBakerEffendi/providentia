Great place. My husband and went there for dinner this past Saturday and everything was outstanding.  We shared the Pastore Salad and the PORTOBELLO RIPIENO. The salad was perfect for a hot summer day, olive oil, red wine vinegar , tomatoes and cannelloni beans.  The other appetizer, well the sauce that was on it was divine. For dinner I have the BUCATINI ALLA CIOCARA , again delicious!  Pasta was  cooked al dente. The sauce have a great mix of flavors. My husband had the CALAMARI TOSCANI in the MARECHIARO sauce. Calamari was fresh and tender and sauce was yummy.  The size of my meal was so large I could not finish it and unfortunately we were so full we could not try dessert. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant  and will try to save room for dessert.  Service was attentive but not too over bearing, everyone was very friendly. Also it is a BYO. Give it a try!
