This place was gorgeously authentic. From the moment you walk through the entrance you feel as though you've been teleported to Paris. I enjoyed our waitress as well, we were in no rush and she had overheard us so we ended up staying as long as we wanted without hassle, and she was actually French. That's not to say that the service is slow, they are extremely quick with bringing out food once it's ordered. We just stuck around and enjoyed the atmosphere, it's such a relaxed European style throughout the place, it's as though no detail was spared in re-creating an actual French cafe. I had the French toast and it was absolutely stunning, just as everything else was. They had paper place-mats and my friend is an illustrator in training at SVA so he took out his drawing materials that he always seems to have on him and he drew our waitress on the place-mat. She was thrilled, and I think she might've kept it after we left. I highly recommend this place. The prices are fine for anybody, even the average college student and the entire place is beautifully authentic. I will be returning here very soon to show off my little discovery to some more friends!
