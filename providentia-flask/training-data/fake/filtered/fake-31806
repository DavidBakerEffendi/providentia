Most filthy bar I have been to in the developed world.  Yes, it's a dive bar, yes it's cheap so shouldn't ambiance and cleanliness be unimportant...Answer: Yes but not to the extent of this place.   And do the bartenders have to be so blatantly  homophobic? Sticky floors, an air-conditioner condenser with exposed wires that screams OSHA violation, and a single bathroom piss soaked through the linoleum.
