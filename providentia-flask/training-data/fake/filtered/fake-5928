i live in the neighborhood so I am always around. Been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and nothing really stands out - although never had a bad meal (ok, apart from the blood mary) However this is a great place to go if you like wine. BYO at $ 20 only and they have great glasses and are really friendly if you bring your wine. If that's your thing it is the best option in Chelsea...
