Broadway Bites location is really good.You can eat something without spending much time.It has many food vendors. You can find many kinds of food but probably they won't be enough to satisfy your hunger .Because the meals are small.My choice wasn't the best.I ate a steak sandwich and i will Â never come back there for that sandwich.The service was really quick but it's taste wasn't good.If you're close Broadway Bites you can go there for snacks and drinks something.If you make a good choice you may have fun.
