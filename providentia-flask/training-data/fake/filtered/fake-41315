This restaurant was a serious disappointment,four of us got there at 5:30 on a saturday night the place was almost empty.There was one nice young lady covering the bar and restaurant. The meals came without the bread and salad which never arrived. Two separate couples came in and left without being waited on. I did have an excellent calzone, but I would not recommend this place to anyone and Â my quess is that they will be out of business with in six months.
