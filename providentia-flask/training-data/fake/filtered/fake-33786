Everyone loves pizza. And why not eat at the first and best? Lombardi's is the first pizza in the United States. Their original location was about a block away from where they are now. They closed and reopned several years later at this location. Must say that the pizza is GREAT. They use a coal overn. My favorite part about the pizza is the sauce. Its fantastic. Â Only downside? A bit expensive for pizza, but hey, it is wonderful. I believe this estabilshment is cash only.
