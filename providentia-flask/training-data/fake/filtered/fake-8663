It's a wine bar and so much more.. If you're like me and can't real Italian or know much about wine, have no fear! What may seem a little overwhelming is so far from it. The bartenders are so well versed that they are able to find your perfect glass(es) of wine just by asking a few questions.. it takes all the stress out from having to choose and allows you more time to enjoy yourself. The food is described as small plates, but do not be fooled! Small plates indeed, but hefty servings is what you actually get.. and it's all really tasty. (seriously, who knew that whipped salted cod (baccala) could be so buttery and yummy?) This place is definitely my 'go-to' in the West Village.
