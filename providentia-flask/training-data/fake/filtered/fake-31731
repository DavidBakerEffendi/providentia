I've been going to Emeralds for a few years since my time at Montclair State. Although it does get busy around dinner time and during sporting events (as does any bar) you can always tell the staff is working their hardest. Yes I do think they could use a dedicated waitress at times but they will do you well as long as you're courteous. It is a bar full of regulars but they are always welcoming. I would definitely suggest the wings, burgers are great, I've heard the steaks are good and pretty much everything on the menu is under 10$. It gets a little packed in there at times so be prepared if you're going during peak hours.
