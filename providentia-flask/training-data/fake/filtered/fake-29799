I love Lobster Joint but after 5 visits I only just learned that the tips at the counter are not shared with the food runner.  Every time I go the same person brings out my food and cleans up my mess.  She remembers my name.  Every time I have left tips in the jar on the counter not realizing that it was only for counter staff.  What a shame.  Most people would not leave cash lying on communal tables, esp when the tip jar is visible right there when they pay.  I don't get it.  When you go don't forget to tip your food runner separately.
