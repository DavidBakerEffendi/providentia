I give bottle bar two stars for the mere fact that they have a large selection of beer at reasonable prices. As for the bar area, I am more unimpressed every time. Tonight, my sister and I purchased our beers from the bar, and then were lucky to snag a table. A waitress came by and asked if we were going to order any food, which we said no. About five minutes later, a guy came over and told us that if we were not ordering food we couldn't sit at the table. This is an understandable request for a restaurant, but this is bottle BAR. We pointed out the fact to him that zero of the people sitting at the other tables had food, but I guess since we already had our drinks when we sat down, and are two girls?? he felt we weren't allowed to sit there. So we chugged the rest of our beers and left. This all happened at 9:30 at night. No one was eating food. Maybe if this bar sold french fries I would have considered ordering something. No I do not want a side a lettuce with my pork sandwich thank you.
