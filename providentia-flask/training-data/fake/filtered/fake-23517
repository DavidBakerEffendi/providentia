came in here by chance and had a spectacular time; it's always such a nice surprise when random choices turn out to be terrific ones. the food was delicious and the service exceptional. our server (who is the manager, i believe) was incredibly knowledgeable about oysters and made excellent suggestions. we actually ended up sticking around post-dinner just to chat with him and the bartender for awhile! a super fun evening - highly recommended.
