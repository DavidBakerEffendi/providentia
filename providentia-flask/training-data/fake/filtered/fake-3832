This was a nice place to go with the previous owners and is now a GEM with the new owners. You could not feel more welcome and the interior is stunningly beautiful and cozy. Food is of the highest quality and caringly prepared - from burgers in the tavern to fine dining. Food & Wine, James Beard and the Globe are not wrong. Weathersfield is worth the drive.
