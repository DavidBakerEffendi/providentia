Got to the airport early looking for a nice bite and drink. Nice selection of wines but service and food need work. Sat for quite a long time before having my order taken even though waiter had put cocktail napkin  at my table long before. Ordered Caesar salad with grilled steak. Steak was dry and overlooked.  Croutons from a box despite being told food was made fresh when I arrived. Dressing most likely from a jar. Guess I should have tried the tuna tartare that others mentioned here.
