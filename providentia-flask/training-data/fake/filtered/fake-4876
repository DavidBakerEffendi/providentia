Been here multiple times for dinner, mostly with big groups. The food has been consistently amazing. There aren't many options on the menu, which consists of pizza (with choice of toppings, of course) and salad, but that's all you really need here. Plus some great beer. Personally, I'm a fan of the amber ale, although the blond is great, too. The dining experience is really chill - paper plates, a cup filled with silverware, a communal salad bowl, and a huge rectangular pan of pizza. I've never had anything but good service, both for dinner and at the bar. No complaints. Although I did bring a visiting friend here for dinner, and she was somewhat underwhelmed. Maybe I hyped it too much, or maybe New Haven style pizza wasn't for her.
