I bake bread myself and I have told Sara and Ethan Brown, who own this bakery, that they have pretty much put me out of business with my family. The breads here are really great and they grind their own flour, The whole wheat is the best I have tasted but they are all good. The same goes for the cinnamon rolls, the scones and everything else. Even the dog loves the dog biscuits. The deli sandwiches are good and the staff really friendly and service is great. All in all, there nothing but good to say about this place.
