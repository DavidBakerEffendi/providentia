Went for a special anniversary and we were let down.  Granted we don't eat out 'formally' alot these days as we prefer more 'casual' fine dining but we were more than taken back by the arrogant server.  She really was a snot.  I wanted to leave but my husband insisted with stay.  the highlight was the salmon for my husband and us leaving before dessert to get a gelato on the green.  My Black Angus at $ 31 was well passed medium and tough.  I just don't get the arrogance these days of restaurants like UL.    It certainly wasn't 'extraordinary' as the new york times proclaims and as they blast across their website.  I'd give them another chance if I got my $ 200 back for a dinner for two with one bottle of wine.  Outrageous
