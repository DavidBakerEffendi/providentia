Got here purely by chance and as an out-of-towner. Impressions.  Okay food, beer, decor downstairs.   The downstairs would rate a 3.5 on this scale.    I would do this again. Upstairs?  Toxic slack.  These people are to Philly what hippies are to Boulder, only no one cares.   Goatees and sunglasses and layers of thrift store dog blankets.   Oh, my! To be fair, I was younger once.  Hung with the fashionably outscast.   I've seen my share of dive bars and scenes.   The Comet Tavern.  O'Cayz Corral.  Was it really this bad?   It seemed so forced and contrite, yet what is a slacker to do but slack, only here it reaches critical mass.   Not even worth the morbid curiosity of such a scene. History lesson.  By the early 80's, John Lydon was with P.I.L. and buying a house in Hollywood.  Stop the pretension of assocation.
