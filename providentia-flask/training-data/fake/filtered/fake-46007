I have lived in the Financial District for many years and Trading Post is exactly what Lower Manhattan has needed!. So excited that it opened! It's a perfect mix of bar and restaurant with delicious food, great service, fun bartenders, and really comfy barstools!  As a vegetarian, I haven't tried the meat items on the menu, but I can say that they have the best mashed potatoes I have ever had.  Seriously. My friend actually brought them to her Thanksgiving dinner.  Also the shrimp flatbread is amazing!
