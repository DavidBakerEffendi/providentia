Great family friendly restaurant. Yet another achievement by restauranteur John Procaccini. Attention to detail in every area. Impeccable service, awesome menu selections, and crisp, clean environment. Special touch, fried oreos!!! Highly recommend this restaurant for anyone that appreciates GOOD food at extremely fair prices. It's the kind of restaurant that you want to keep going back to right away.
