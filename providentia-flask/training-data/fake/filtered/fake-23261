Probably the WORST experience out in West Hartford ever. We waited 30 minutes to get to the door. My sister got in and about 20-30 filed out all at once. The manager, Will (bouncer said the manager's name was Will) came over and said, "Too much movement" and starting shutting the door in my face. I asked, "Wait can my sister come out then if you're not going to let us in?" My sister walked to the door and asked confused after seeing a slew of people leave, "How come you aren't letting anyone else in after all those people left?" The manager then proceeded to yell in her face, "The more you fucking talk the less likely I am to let you in. You better fucking wait patiently and do what I say or I don't have to let you in." Turned to the bouncer and said, "Can you try and fucking explain this shit to her" and walked away. Seriously appalling to treat another human being this way. Needless to say we left.
