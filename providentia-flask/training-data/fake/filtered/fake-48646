I would rate this place a little more generously if their customer service wasn't so sub par. To that end, don't even bother ordering delivery. You can never understand them over the phone due to all the background noise, they will rush you through the call to the point that I've had to call back simply to continue placing my order, and then the delivery will take upwards of an hour or more. In Hell's Kitchen, there are far better restaurants to choose from. Only bonus is that they are open 24/7.
