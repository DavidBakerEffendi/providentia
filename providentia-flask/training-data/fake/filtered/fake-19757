Staff was pleasant, hoewevee, food was tasteless, just downright terrible.  Drinks did not taste as they should.  Horrible experience.  Portions small, and priced too high for the poor quality.  Very disappointing.  Thank God Jamaica at 50 was great or the evening would have been a total disappointment.
