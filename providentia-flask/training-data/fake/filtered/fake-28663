Do Not judge a book by its cover at this North Brunswick Strip mall establishment, where stars of the show are the grilled meat delicacies served in heaping portions, FYI the Istanbul Combo will allow you to sample multiple types and styles if you are new to this region of cuisine.  Fresh tasty but simple salads to start and the Lahmajoun appetizer is a must order.  Service was knowledgeable and friendly.  Modest Prices and a BYOB policy make the tabs easy on the pocket.
