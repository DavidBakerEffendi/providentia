We were so excited to try  Westville and couldn't have been more disappointed with the food and the service.   I ordered the turkey chili and a side of Mac and cheese and my husband had the grilled pork chop with a side of kale.   First of all they brought my dinner about 20 min before his, and while the chili itself was decent, I think the turkey was actually processed meat (it had the consistency of spam).  Plus it was incredibly bland.  I asked for some shredded cheese and they brought me two slices of cheese that would normally go on a cheeseburger.   The Mac and cheese wasn't to die for as I had heard. Little Giant/Tipsy Parson makes a much better Mac and cheese.  Plus my the pork chop was totally overcooked and salty.   To top it all off, both of our water glasses were dirty, and so was our silverware.   Maybe we'd have better success with breakfast but I wouldn't bother going back for dinner.
