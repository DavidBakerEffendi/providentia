What a treat! I have been to some of the best restaurants around the world. And I would say this stands up to any of them. First I love the gallery feel of the place, and that they are using local artists. The design kept to include the beauty of the building. We were drawn to the farm to table concept and the food exceeded our expectations. We started with the crabcakes, the creole remoulade was outstanding served on risotto along with the delicious braised short ribs. One Crescent mixed salad greens which we all salivated over. Dinner included the perfectly cooked Wagyu Steak, Blackened Pork Cheeks with cheddar jalapeno grits(the perfect complement) and the Scallops with charred brussel sprouts/bacon perfectly done. Topped off with the very rich and decadent chocolate torte. And the service could not have been better from the front of the house to the servers, everyone wanted to make sure you were enjoying your dining experience. I will be spreading the word on this new gem.
