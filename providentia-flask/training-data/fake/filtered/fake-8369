Beautiful place, great energy, excellent service, awesome bartenders, and to top it all off...they have deliciously fresh shrimp Summer Rolls that I love with the peanut sauce! I had their Pho Beef Noodle soup and it was amazing! It is definitely a must try...I couldn't help but embarrassed myself and picked up the bowl and slurped every drop! (Oops...burp) I can't wait to try their other items and share them with my friends.
