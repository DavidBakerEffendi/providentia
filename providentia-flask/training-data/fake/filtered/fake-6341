After reading the review before me I jumped on the chance to go here. I wasn't dissapointed. I was surprised ... for a Saturday night in Olde City I didn't have to make reservations, even though I did, because the place, though small, wasn't really crowded. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't really good! Prices, I thought were pretty fair, and the service was AWESOME! if I only remembered my servers name I would totally tell you to ask for him because he was so nice! It was my friend and I on a girls night, so he sat and chatted with us for a little while, which was cute, and would check to see if we needed anything all the time, but not in the annoying way. I had the Gorgonzola Salad and the Veal and Crab ... both of which I highly recommend! AND get a glass of wine. It was really delicious and went well with my meal (I had the Pinot Noir). However, I don't completely agree with the protion sizes of the girl before me. I thought that I was going to be stuffed AND be taking things home like the 4th street deli does. The sizes weren't small, in fact I would day they were the perfect portions; I was able to finish everything, not feel hungry or stuffed. Word of the wise ... try not to sit at the booth that faces the kitchen and sit more into the little seating area. We had that booth and I felt like everyone in the kitchen was always looking at us because of how the booth is set-up to face the kitchen. I will be going back!
