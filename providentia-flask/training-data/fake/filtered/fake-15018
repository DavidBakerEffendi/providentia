Best breakfast place in the world! The Dutch Baby is unique, the chocolate chip pancakes use bittersweet chocolate and real whipped cream, and the apple pancake is totally decadent. My favorite is the Dutch Garden - a German pancake with freshly steamed broccoli, mushrooms, & tomatoes; they serve it with melted cheese on top, but if you ask, they'll leave the cheese off and bake the vegetables inside the pancake - perfection! I'm not a regular meat-eater, but I have tried the home-cured bacon and it beats any I've ever tasted. The fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice is deliciously pulpy. They also serve substantial chef's salads and other non-breakfast fare. Weekends are crowded and you will wait for a table. I prefer weekdays when there is no waiting.
