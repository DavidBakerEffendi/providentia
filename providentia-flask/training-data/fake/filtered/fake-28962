I absolutely love this place.  The veggie stack sandwich is so good I have dreams about it! Great beer selection and the best sweet potato fries. However, bring an extra dose of patience with you when dining there.  The service needs to be more attentive.  It took me 20 minutes to get the waitress' attention in order to tell her she brought me the wrong food!  I'm sure someone else was starving waiting for their dinner.   My food did eventually arrive and it was delicious. This was not the first time I  had problems with the service, but I will definitely be back again and again. Their great menu and beers will keep me coming back.
