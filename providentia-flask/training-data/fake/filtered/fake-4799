My review is for the overall restaurant, although, I would give the bar staff a rating of 5 and the rest of the restaurant, which includes the food a rating of 3.  I'm a regular at SCG and have been since it opened.  I love the bar staff, Patrick, Stephanie, Jackie and Ashley.. They are always awesome, friendly and make a great drink.  I've had almost everything on the menu over the years and food is usually good.  Sometimes not great.., sometimes a bit skimpy on portions, but typically good.  I had the bbq for the first time a week ago and I do have to say they were some of the best I've ever had.  Sooo Yum.  If you want a great burger, you can't go wrong, especially if you're a blue cheese person, the blues burger is incredible.  Happy hours are great, with good prices.   Wish they would extend the HH's until 7:00 every night instead of 6:30.  Also, I must add that the food selections overall on the menu and the lighter dishes, such as the apps have gotten more limited and I suggest the menu be revamped to include more selections and also some more reasonably priced options.  The appetizer menu is really awful and if you just want something small to eat, you have to spend $16-19 on an app or get the SCG potato chips which are around $7, which is both ridiculous and not the healthiest choice.  Definitely need to add some variety and more reasonably priced items.  I've left this place several times early to go have dinner someplace else.
