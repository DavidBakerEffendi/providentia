I can't get enough of this place! The food is fantastic. The lobster rolls are pretty much the cheapest price you're going to find around here and the quality is amazing! I love this place! Oh, and the service is fantastic too. Everyone was friendly and nice. Our neighborhood needed a place like this!!
