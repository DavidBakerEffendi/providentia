Couldn't possible think of a better place to come late at night to get a good satisfying noodle-starch overload,  Pork and duck are delicious, and I love just ordering random things from the menu to see what comes out.  The atmosphere isn't much unless you come in expecting a brightly lit not over-designed place, in which case the atmosphere is great.
