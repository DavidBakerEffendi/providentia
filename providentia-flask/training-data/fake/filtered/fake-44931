If you ask for a specific booster shot such as Protein, Fat burner, Energy Booster, Creatine, Glutamine it's all the same powder. This is deceiving for the fact that you pay extra money thinking you're getting a concentrated shot of Fat burner and you're actually getting the same thing as the guy who thinks he's getting a concentrated shot of energy booster. It's some all encompassing powder and it's a bit of a deceitful tactic.
