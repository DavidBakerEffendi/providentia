Laduree's Macaroons are the best in new york. There's always a line, thats because its the only store in the United States. Worth the wait, and price. Box of 12 cost $33.60. The Macaroons have a very thin crunch. Once you bit into it, you break the top crunch and then your teeth hits the cream layer. Its amazing. Lots of tourist. I don't blame them. Its the best.
