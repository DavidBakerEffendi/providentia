Far and away the best hoagie anywhere. I'm in Florida now, but lived/worked/ate in Philly for 40+ years. Most of my jobs over the years had me on the road all over the region, subsequently I've had hoagies and hundreds of places, Sarcone's are the best. Yes, the bread is legendary (it's rumored that in the 'old-days' Brooklyn's famous italian eateries drove to S.Philly every morning to stock up on the bread they couldn't get in NYC), however, it's more than just the bread. The quality/flavor of the meats cheeses and toppings they use combine with the bread to create a truly memorable experience. I've been to places that use Sarcone's bread but lack on the other ingredients. While the bread does help cover some 'mistakes' there's just nothing like the full Sarcone's Deli experience. As far as cheesesteaks? Stick with Steve's in NE Philly, but Always go to Sarcone's for hoagies....
