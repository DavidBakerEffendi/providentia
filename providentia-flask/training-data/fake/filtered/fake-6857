We had Â a pleasant evening last weekend. The menu is a selection of exquisite combinations of diverse culinary origins, like a doughnut foie gras that delights your senses. You never could have imagined those 2 things together, and how well they combine. This is a perfect place to try new flavors. Take note that reservations are not taken, although is very comfortable to dine at the bar. Also be aware that they only take cash for the moment. The staff is incredibly kind and helpful. We live in Manhattan but we are definetly looking forward to visit them many times more.
