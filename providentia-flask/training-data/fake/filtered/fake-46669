I have been to this restaurant several times now and have spent a good deal of $ here. Food is good but what really distinguishes them is their bread. This last time we went here with another couple.  The waiter brought over one loaf of bread, which if you have never been here, its about 8" round and needs to be torn with your hands.  Touching other peoples food, or having them touch yours can be a bit uncomfortable and down right gross for most people, so we asked for another loaf.  The waiter did bring out another loaf, but this one was not warm and was clearly not fresh.  Really, we dropped $60 per couple and they couldn't even give us an extra loaf of fresh bread? With all the great restaurants in this city they can keep their bread, we won't be returning back anytime soon.
