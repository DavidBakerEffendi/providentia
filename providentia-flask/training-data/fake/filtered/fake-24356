Stay away!! the place is a dump! If you're concerned about your health, you need to eat elsewhere...Don't be fooled by the door crowd, it's only because the place is extremely tiny...There are some issues that my friends and I had with the place and they're not in particular order; The owner is flat out nasty; There are baby cockroaches crawling all over the interior brick walls; Bathrooms are very disgusting, Their soda bottles actually expired almost a year ago; Don't expect the temperature to be less than 92 degrees, there is NO AIR CONDITION! The salmon was rotten and smelly... The French fries are full of burned crumbs from the deep fryer's oil that probably hasn't been changed for months! The only thing thought, the waitress was trying very hard to do the right thing, but she was pretty dumb!! Never again!!!
