So good!!!! Truly authentic Thai food in a city that already has plenty of Thai restaurants. The red rice is delicious, and makes this restaurant a standout. They make food quickly, and include a wonderful miniature sweet rice dessert with every meal. I've had a couple of their curries and some noodles, and everything has been great. Their prices are very reasonable, as well. The one thing I would say is that sometimes they have someone answer the phone who is a bit difficult to understand, but my order still went through. Will be returning here for certain.
