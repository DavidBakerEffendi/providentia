Well I just called Pierre's to place an order for a "breakfast tray" including breads for a meeting at my job.  I had several questions about the size of the breads they carry - how big, what's in them etc...Each time I asked a question the girl says "hold on" - so I probably actually spent all of maybe 2 minutes speaking to an "actual person" - the rest waiting for an answer.  I finally ask - can I speak to someone that knows?  She says she's the ONLY one there working, can I call back later?  OK so I ask another question - she puts me on hold again then she comes back and asks ME another question. Finally I'm very annoyed and say - can I speak to the person you keep asking??? She says "Dave - can you talk to her?". I wait another minute hear a few beeps on the phone as if I'm being transferred or hung up on - and gave up...very annoyed and frustrated!!!  Clearly they do not want my business or my company's business!  I pass there everyday on my way to work and thought "let me try them". NEVER AGAIN!!!  I work in Edison and will continue to go to Raritan Bakery on Amboy Ave.  They are AWESOME!!! Don't bother trying to "ORDER" from Pierre's - very poor customer service!!! Gave them a 1 star - I haven't even been in there - now I don't want to go inside!!!
