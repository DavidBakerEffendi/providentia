A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Love the food, the drinks, the staff and the atmosphere. My most recent dinner there was on May 21st. Friends and family joined us to celebrate my husband's birthday.  We had the pleasure of using the private room downstairs and a had special menu prepared ahead of time.  We were assigned our own waiter who was so attentive and never more than a few steps away from us outside the curtained area.  So, needless to say, the drinks were always flowing.  The poquito picantes were a big hit.  The apps were plentiful and DELICIOUS and the main courses were fabulous.  I absolutely LOVE the black cod (can not find anything like it elsewhere) and highly recommend it.  My mother was raving about the calamari dish the next day to all of her friends and if you are a fan of pork, you must try it.  It is tender and succulent.  When you call to make reservations, ask if  Angel will be there.  He is the most gracious host with such a positive upbeat attitude and quite stylish, I must add.  He helped make our dinner a celebration and a feast of flavor.  Thank you Yerba Buena for an unforgettable experience.
