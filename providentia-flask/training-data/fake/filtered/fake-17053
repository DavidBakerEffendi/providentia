Wanted to give Cubanu another chance.  First two dinner tries left a lot to be desired, very slow service, servers who did not know the menu, bland food, no bread, etc. Went for drinks and Flamenco show.  One other couple in lounge area and yet we waited 20 minutes for server. Bar only had 3 people. No reason to be so slow. Ordered special Small Beers for both of us to start to be followed by pitcher of Sangria. Shots were great, Licor 43 and Baileys.  However, the Sangria was very dark, strong and very bitter.We sent it back and asked for replacement. It never came. Waitress was not interested in serving two women. Stayed for first set of Flamenco trio, then left. Server never came back and we had to flag her down when I ordered a second small beer and she served it to table next to us. They were happy to drink the "free" drink. Servers need better training, very inattentive, very slow and had to ask for napkins.  We won't be back.  Three strikes is enough for me.
