So when our friends drove us up to this place I was nervous, doesn't look like much from the outside.  However once you come in, past the shower curtain-like entrance, you are greeted by a warm albeit minimalist interior.  Ok not so bad.   Sit down, the service is not the fastest but we were also in a party of 8 so probably just giving us time to wind down.  Drinks come out, I had a very nice white wine that doesn't taste at all like I just paid $5 for it.  Appetizers, awesome, now that's what I'm talking about.  Spring rolls were light and not greasy.  Chicken saute was perfectly cooked.  Had these weird rice cakes with a really delicious dipping sauce, a surprising treat.   Now for the main dishes.  I had the salmon in coconut-chilly curry, omg delicious.  The fish was flaky and the sauce perfectly seasoned.  I like my food spicy and they made it just right, not too excessive but definitely built up through out the meal.  All of my friend's dishes were amazing, even the simple pad-thai. Such a great surprise, it made my night.  I can't wait to bring people here and pretend like I discovered this hidden gem on my own.
