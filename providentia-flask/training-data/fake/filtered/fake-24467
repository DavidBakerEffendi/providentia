I have to say this is def. not a favorite. I've been to Joe's in flushing which is MUCH better than the Pell St location. Their dumplings tasted very different than those @ the Flushing loc. They weren't as juicy or tasteful. The dough was thick. The food itself was good but I have had better in smaller Chinatown restaurants. The wait was ridiculous. There is no waiting area so you have to stand outside and wait.  Unfortunately, the next day was garbage day and it was quite smelly of rotten garbage outside while we waited. Then you are seated with strangers @ large round tables. They cleaned the table with a dirty towel. The table was sticky. I had the pleasure of sitting next to a guy who just would not stop talking and saying the most rudest things to his girlfriend, her cousin and ate like a caveman. My hubs had the pleasure of sitting next to a guy who would cough all thru the meal and not cover his mouth. The dining room seating was so crowded that I got knocked in the head 3x by the waiters tray. The restroom.......YIKES. I've been in porter potties that I consider to be cleaner!  We thought experiencing Joe's on Pell would be a good experience but it ended up being gross and a huge tourist trap..... Do the trip to Joe's in Flushing! It's worth it and you will have a much better experience - and awesome soup dumplings!
