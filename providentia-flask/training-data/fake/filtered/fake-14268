I personally will not patronize a restaurant that won't take reservations for parties of 4...so I have to find parking in a tough area...walk my 70 year old guests into a place and not know when will get seated. I guess they know they will be busy but why not say, if you don't show up we give the table away in 5 minutes..it would accomplish the same thing and would help create a loyal following of those who still believe in the old fashioned reservation system. Oh well, there are many other places that will take our $150 tonight.
