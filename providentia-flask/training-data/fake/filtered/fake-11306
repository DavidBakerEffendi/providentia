the dinners here far exceed their breakfast... it must have been a whisper campaign that formed their breakfast lines... i dont get why so many people are willing to wait out in the dead of winter for french toast here- however, I would easily withstand a rainstorm to enjoy their hot sandwiches at night. not the cleanest areas near the bathroom but if you can hold it, you'll leave this quaint restaurant feeling charming:)
