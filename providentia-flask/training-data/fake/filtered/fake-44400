The customer service is TERRIBLE!!! ... As to a point where my change was thrown at me nd my sour cream was watered (down) which i never received in any other resturant ive ever been too in my life.. My suggestion would be to compliment your customers more and accept constructive criticism. And by the way real management needs to be on hands at all times in this location!
