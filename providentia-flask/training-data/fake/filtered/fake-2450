This place has character.  I recently stumbled on the Khyber while looking for a happening place to take my nephew and his girlfriend.  I chose this place above all the other restaurants--It just looked charming from the outside.  I wasn't disappointed. Our server was super attentive, the menu choices were ecclectic for both food and drink. Price was reasonable. Will definitely be back.
