Went to dinner here last night hoping it would be good. Let me start by saying it was freezing, barely any heat, and they sat us next to the door because 4 tables were reserved. We ordered the picanha (steak) and feijoada (beans with meat basically) and an appetizer of sausage with fried mandioca. The appetizer was good, so we were hoping this would be a good meal. 45 minutes later, our food is still not on the table (food that should have taken ~ 10 minutes to prepare since the rice and feijoada is premade, and small minute steaks take no time to cook). our waitress is nowhere to be found in this tiny restaurant so we ask the other one to check on our food. she comes out immediately with it and it was freezing cold. they forgot about it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugged. no offer to comp. anything. one apology. worst experience. food wasn't even that good.
