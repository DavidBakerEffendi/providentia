Well, we were told by a friend from NY to go here so we thought we would try it out.  The host was friendly and told us that we would have a little wait.  15minutes later we were seated.  Our server was a cool hippy chick who explained the menu.  HUGE LIST OF SPECIALS (a little overwhelming--but will definitely be back to try more) Had a amazing black and white shake and the vegetable sides were awesome from wasabi mashed potatoes to grilled artichoke YUMM!! Amazingly enough our bill for 5 people was only about $125.00 GO GO GO GO!!!!
