As a tourist, we went there for lunch.  Fun, eclectic neighborhood gatropub.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered lots of stuff off the menu.  All of the food was perfect.  Check out the burger, its a must. Fun beers on tap and an excellent wait staff. I will dine there again the next time I am in New York.
