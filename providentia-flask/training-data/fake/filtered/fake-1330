I'm from NY and have very high standards for sandwiches.  I visit Philly regularly for work and literally go out of my way each time to get a sandwich from Matt & Marie's - it's THAT good!!  Great sandwiches are hard to come by, but they really hit the nail on the head.  I've only been 4-5 times so far, so I still haven't had a chance to try all of their different types of sandwiches, but so far none have disappointed.  Most recently I had the ham sandwich with their home-made mozzarella.  Scrumptious!!!!
