Pure meat awesomeness. The rich romantic atmoshphere lends to a great night. The staff attentiveness is beyond compare. At no time was I without a full glass of water, and someone was there to ensure all was well at every second of the meal. The spicey lobster appetizer was so good!! Tempura bits of lobster fried but not too crispy and topped with a sauce that was amazing. Steak was perfect! Served on the signature 500 degree plate to keep it warm. The meat was so tender you could eat the fat! Just unreal. The onion soup was also great, with the melted cheese on top and loads of onions in a winey broth. And if you can save room for dessert get the chocolate explosion...EPIC!
