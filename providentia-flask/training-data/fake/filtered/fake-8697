went Sunday evening.  Nice family style.  Food was good but for $35 fixed, a good (not great) value.   Place was almost full (seats almost 50), but not as loud as other reviews suggest.  Great environment for conversation (which was good as they only had 2 servers with no other staff (really needed 3 as we waited a fair amount of time between servings). Servers seemed slightly frantic (cold wet plates for warm food, table next to us had to send coffee back as it came cold, etc).   all said, its worth a try - tho not sure if i'll go back.
