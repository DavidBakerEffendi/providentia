Nightmare experience.  Although we had reservations we had to wait around for a long time while they acted like it was our fault.  When we finally did get seated no one even brought water, let alone took drink orders, for fifteen minutes.  When we finally got a manager to the table he informed us that if we ordered entrees right then it would be an hour before they would be served.  People at the closest table were standing to try to get someone's attention because they were having the same issues.  We decided to leave.  No one bothered to apologize for their ineptitude.  I feel sorry for anyone who planned an important meal there.
