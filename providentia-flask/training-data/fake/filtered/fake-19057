hot damn and holy hell. delicious. $5 chicken biscuit gets me going. throw some extra hot sauce on that bird and eat up, kid. collard greens and hush puppies, mac and cheese and black eyed peas. god damn, this is some serious business. service is as good as it should be, cause I'm sure those kids don't make shit, and the kitchen is on their game. I've never even been in there longer than forty five minutes start to finish. do yourself a favor and come hungry.
