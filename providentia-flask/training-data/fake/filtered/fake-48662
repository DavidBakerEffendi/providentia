LINES!!! AND WAITING!!! UGHHHH!!! BUTTTTTT!!! Well, well, well worth the wait.. I have never had better empanads.. Baked, Fried it doesnt matter. The Flan is rediculous and the fried bananas are something of a treat.. They should be put on the dessert menu with how flavorful they are. The only reason I dont give this place 5 stars is because I believe it should be bigger to handle the endless order they take all day and the endless lines they have to grab a seat in a pretty crowded restaurant. Other then that, if you can order ahead for pickup is probably your best bet. The prices are reasonable too considering how full you feel after only 2 or 3 empanads.. The Arroz con Pollo is also really really good, one of my favorites!
