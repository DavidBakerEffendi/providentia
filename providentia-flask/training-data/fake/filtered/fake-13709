We ordered margarita with less oil(I have a liver problem and am not allowed fat). We got an oily pizza, very poor tomato sauce, basically..no sauce. Maybe 2 spoons of it on a large pie. Cheese was ok, not a great quality mozzarella. Dough is forgettable and basil was burnt. Basil should be fresh. I'm a sourdough baker and passionate about good pie. We will not be coming again. Too fatty for not much taste.
