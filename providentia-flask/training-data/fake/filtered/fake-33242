Came here for happy hour and it was fantastic. The Shire is my recommendation for a delicious cocktail while the buffalo chicken fritters off the bar bites menu gets 5 stars from me. Bianca was extremely helpful and kept our drinks coming, Thanks! Justin was very knowledgable about all of the drinks and Lauren was also super bubbly and knowledgable :) would come every day if I could keep up the good work guys!
