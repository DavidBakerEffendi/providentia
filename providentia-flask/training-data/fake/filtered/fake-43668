Yet another great review for Five Leaves. What can I say? These guys rock. Great, flavorful food. Excellent drinks. Lovely atmosphere. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the prices, which seem a little high for the neighborhood. Not that the prices will stop me next time I'm craving one of their burgers.
