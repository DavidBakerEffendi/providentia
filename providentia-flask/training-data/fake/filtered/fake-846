This place is so amazing. The wait is horrible, we arrived at 4:15pm on a Sunday and had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. I must say that the wait was definitely worth it. We started with the seasonal fig, prosciutto and burrata salad, which was just incredible, a mix of flavors. We had two pies that were cooked to perfection and very tasty. Â  Have been here several times, just love the pies here. We will definitely be back for this delicious pizza.
