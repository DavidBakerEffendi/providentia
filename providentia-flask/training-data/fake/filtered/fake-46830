First, I'm not much or a review writer, but had to write one for this place.  Came here for my birthday last week. This place is A.M.A.Z.I.N.G!   We were 6 of us so got to try quite a few different things.  I was a little concerned about the $15 cocktails some previous reviewers had talked about, but all our cocktails were $12.50 and good solid pours.  We were all buzzed after 3 (or was it 2 ;-).  My favorites were the Army & Navy, Aviation and the Punch! For food, here's what to try. Tiger Prawns, Pani Puri, Chilli Cheese Toast,  Butter Chicken Masala, Saag Paneer, Fried Okra, Bombay hash browns, and Biryani  (we had lamb and chicken and it was too close to call which is better). Dessert: We had Benoffe cake & the Rum Ball. Ask them to do the birthday prep.....and you're in for a treat. Whole room turns dark, funky bollwyood music and dancing girls with sparklers.  Planning a friend's next birthday there!
