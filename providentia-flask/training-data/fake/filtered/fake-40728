The food was really good!! The decor - not so much.  Really outdated,, I'm sure they were going to for ambiance, but it was a tad crowded and cramped. The waitress we had was new and forgot my order all together, and messed up the pizza we ordered too.  She didnt bring the right size beer, and it was just a mess.  We went outside after dinner, and had another drink, and dessert - apple strudel - and WOW, it was SO good, I will go back JUST for that again, I'll just make sure I sit in a different area..
