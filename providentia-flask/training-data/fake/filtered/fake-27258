We arrived at Le B as they were opening at 11 today and took a small table outside with our 4 year old.  We ordered some apple ciders, which were fine, then put in our food order - French Toast, the Caprese omelette special, two soft boiled eggs.  Oops - no Caprese special available, our server took back her original listing, it was goat cheese special - so I reordered a Croque Madame.  It was literally 11:57 when the food arrived, a good 45 minutes after ordering.  My son and pregnant wife were freaking out.  When she brought the hard French Toast (no wonder they don't call it Pain Perdu - it is nothing of the sort), she informed us that the kitchen would not do soft boiled eggs.  Or anything good.  She left that last bit as an implication.
