I have lunch here a few times a week. My favorites are the chicken salad, Mediterranean tuna, and fresh roast turkey. My husband usually has the chicken pot pie. Homemade soups are great, especially sweet potato. Good specials too. They also Â have burgers, mac and cheese, comfort food. Everything is flavorful and fresh. I've been there a few times for dinner (they just started serving Fri. and Sat. nights.) Tonight my husband had the boeuf bourguignon, I had salmon with citrus glaze, mashed potatoes and sauteed green beans. Both were excellent, reasonably priced. Friendly owner/chef. A lovely neighborhood place, a welcome change from taverns and coffee shops.
