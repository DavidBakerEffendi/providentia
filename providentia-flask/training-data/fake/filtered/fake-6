The egg on an English muffin (their take on eggs Benedict) was fantastic. Service was quick and pleasant. They have multiple roasters providing their coffee and the barista knew how to make a good cup. They have a La Marzocco Strada for espresso and then you can choose between a Chemex, French Press, or Fetco for filter coffee. There was plenty of seating, it's well lot, and comfortable. Free wifi available. Good stuff.
