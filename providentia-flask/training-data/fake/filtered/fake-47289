I don't understand the other complaints, this place is great.  The price is great and the service is great as well. My wife and I were very impressed with the chicken and broccoli and the singapore mei phun.  I never went to hong kong so I have nothing to compare it to except other Chinese American food spots and this place rocks.  I do agree that the place is empty but I think it's because of it's location.  There is only on street parking and most of it's customers probably order out.  This place is great if you want to take a day off cooking and enjoy quality food at a good and fair price.
