We had been meaning to get to this welcome new addition to QV and finally did last night, with friends in from CA.  We had an all around great dining experience.  Atmosphere very comfortable and simply, but stylishly designed.  Great use of a very irregularly shaped space. Staff could not have been more pleasant and accommodating while at the same time genuine and not a hint of phony waitstaff-speak. Four of us had first and main courses and deserts. All were delicious and in perfect portion sizes. Hint from the staff was that the pasta dishes could also be had in half sizes as first courses.  Two of us had them and loved both.  Menu had just the right amount of choices, not overwhelming nor sparse.  Fav was the pan fried crispy flattened chicken and pasta with lamb sausages and tomatoes.   A perfect new addition and a BYO at that. Reasonable prices.  Four people with three courses each with tax and 20%+ tip was $175.  What we used to pay for two at James..... LOL
