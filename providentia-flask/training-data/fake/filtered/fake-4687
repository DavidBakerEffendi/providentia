Some restaurants have all the luck, but Rouge had a bit more.  Perfectly situated in Rittenhouse Square, Rouge has a beautiful view of the park and from most seats inside and out you can enjoy the vision of loveliness while dining on some pretty tasty food.  Within a weeks time, I had the pure joy of eating there twice...once inside and twice outside and each time was not only did I enjoy the experience but so did my guests.  I tend to be a creature of habit finding one item I really love on a menu and then ordering it again and again.  For the Rouge, this would be their yummy burgers and even better fries served in a cone shaped holder lined in paper.   But there was  one sunny day when all seemed right with the world...the weather was beautiful, my business partner and I were overflowing with exciting ideas for a new business ready to be launched and of course, I had the pleasure of wearing the most fantastic soft gray ruffley stilettos so it only seemed natural to embark on a new food experience.  It would be the fabulous soft shell crab sandwich slightly battered and fried on a heavenly soft roll.  Yummy!!!  The lunch was complimented with excellent service.  I can't wait to go back to one of my favorite lunch time spots in Philly.
