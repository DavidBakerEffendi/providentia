Ordered falafel sandwich & stuffed grape leaves, both very good. Tried my friends lamb and couscous, both good. Very nice tasting falafels, veggies are fresh, very good & soft sesame seed pita bread! Grape leaves are big, and very flavorful, although seem a bit expensive for a small order of 3. The food here seems very good, but the prices are a bit high, although still within reason for this type of food spot. I will definitely be going back.
