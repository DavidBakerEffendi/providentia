Its okay. The food was stuffed tastes good but lacks flavor. The whole design of the place is cute but i also had a problem with the drinks, the cups were cute and designed (there is more than one so its reasonable). Didnt get the corn my friend had it and said it was not bad at all. Not beefed up to the hype.
