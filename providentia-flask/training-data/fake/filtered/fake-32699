Don't know what it is about this place, but every time I go, I like it less and less. The only good thing about it is the wine. Their brunch is subpar and their menu very limited. I think I got food poisoning tonight. They really need to do something about their menus... I believe they kinda suck. Don't know how they get good reviews.
