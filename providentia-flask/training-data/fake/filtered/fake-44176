We had brunch reservations for 10:30 am on a Saturday. Per their sign their hours for weekend brunch is 10am-3pm. We arrived at 10:20 and the doors were locked. We knocked multiple times and no one came. We called them the person who answered the phone said he wasn't sure of their hours. We finally got into the restaurant and sat at our table for 10 mins without anyone coming to our table to take our drink orders or give us water. We were the only people in the restaurant. We got up and left.
