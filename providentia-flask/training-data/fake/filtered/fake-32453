This review is addressed to Samantha Q, I'm sorry that you have that discomfort. But what is the point of you writing a bad review if at the end of it you're going to say the food was good. The last time I checked going to a restaurant was for the food not how big the space is. Every New Yorker knows that the best food comes from the smallest places. Thats why we all say we know this great hole in the wall restaurant. Also you have to understand that this is an authentic Italian restaurant. Which means loyalty comes first. Mario (the owner) is a great host and treats every loyal customer with respect and attention. That is why he doesn't have a manager running the place like every other restaurant in the city. You visited the place on a Saturday when 98% of Mario's LOYAL customers are attending. That is why you felt left out and needy. I have been going to il Triangolo since it first open, when I call to make a reservation Mario and his family always give me the highest attention because we know each other. Kind of like in the show cheers where everyone knows your name. Trust me when i tell you that if you become a loyal customer Mario will move mountains for you. thats how true Italians treat their family.
