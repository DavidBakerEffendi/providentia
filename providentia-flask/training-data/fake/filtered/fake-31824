Unfortunately, I am writing to complain about the treatment I just received from one of your servers. I ordered a take out "Chelsea" pizza and a Peroni as I waited. After 30 mins. waiting in a practically empty house, I had to ask another server if there was any food ready. This after witnessing the oven cook had left the premesis. This male server then fetched my take out pizza stating it had just come out of the oven. He was obviously lying since upon easy inspection, the Chelsea pizza was room temperature with its cheese having congealed. Granted there was a large party of friends meeting at the bar, so this server obviously prioritized their service and potential tips over mine. I always tip even on take out items. Not this time. I was actually scouting Ovest in order to bring a large family party in later this week. This will not happen now, nor will I ever return or recommend to anyone I know to patronize Ovest. It took all of my powers of consideration -- a character trait this server obviously lacks -- not to upend the pizza and smear it all over a table, especially having been lied to without remorse. At least he gave me a "thank you," and actually gave me my food. I left my cold pizza there having even had a few bites. With each of my 3 bites I became angrier. I paid my bill, and will never pay another in Ovest again. I will do my best not to let anyone else waste their money in Ovest either. ps. I still have my receipt. "Your Server was CLAUDIO"
