I love this place!  The food was great, and the service was excellent.  We all loved their exotic rolls, I have never tasted this kind before and find it very refreshing.  Teriyaki chicken and shrimp was excellent, not dry and tastless as at some other japanese places we've tried.  We just popped in there with a party of 20 people after sudden change of plans at the other restaurant that could not seat us, and the stuff was very welcoming and accomodating.  They even asked one couple to move to another table so they could seat us.  it was a birthday party, and our waitrers were going out of their way to please us and the birthday person, warming up Sake for us, and cutting and distributing cake.  We brought our own alcohol, and they were happy to provide wine and sake glasses.  Nori was added to my list of favorite places to go after this weekend!
