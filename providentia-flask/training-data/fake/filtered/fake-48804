This was the PERFECT late dinner spot...  we got in just before the kitchen turned around from dinner to late night, so we had the entire menu to choose from!   The waitress was incredibly courteous and attentive, we ordered sandwiches that were PERFECT.  The BBQ Texas Burger was incredible and I kicked it up with some horseradish that made it ROCK!   The Pastrami Nightmare was equally perfect...  great quality meat and the perfect mix of flavors. With a dining room open late Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights, this could become an addiction!
