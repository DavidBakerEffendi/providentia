I have now discovered that I love French food!  To start, we ordered mussels, escargots, and calamari. All excellent. . For my entree I ordered the filet mignon topped with foie gras. It was my first time trying foie gras to my great surprise I actually enjoyed it! FAVORITES: the sweet potato (could not stop eating it), the calamari (comes with tiny mushrooms bursting with flavor), filet mignon with foie gras (what is the magical sauce they pour over this???), thelamb,  the atmosphere - the restaurant is MINISCULE, candlelit, and very intimate.
