Nestled in an unassuming strip mall just north of Kingston, NJ proper, SUSHI PALACE has become one of the most talked-about and respected Japanese restaurants in the tri-state area. Their claim to fame is the all-you-can-eat for $20. Rather than buffet style, you are given a special menu (abridged from the full menu, but not by a lot) consisting of sushi as well as hot meals. Then you order as much as you want. One California Roll? Good. Ten California rolls? No problem. 22 Spicy Tuna and Philadelphia rolls? You got it. 12 seaweed salads and 3 orders of steamed dumplings? Need you ask... It seems too good to be true, since the quality of the sushi is excellent. Just expect long waits on Sat/Sun, since word has caught on fast for this place. Service is always good, and bamboo atmosphere is great. We trek 90 mins from Phoenixville, PA for SUSHI PALACE. It is worth every minute in the car...
