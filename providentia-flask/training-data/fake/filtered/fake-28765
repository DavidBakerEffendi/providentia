Wow! Just wow.  Definitely amazing sausage and cheese steaks.  I didn't have that high of expectations based on the location of Rocco's (kinda attached to Home Depot)  but was I wrong! The garlic chicken sausage is to die for! And the guy ringing me up was super friendly.  I'll definitely be back.  I just wish it was closer to center city. Lol.
