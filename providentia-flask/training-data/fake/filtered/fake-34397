DELICIOUS Food !!! Reminds me of italian home style cooking for the modern american. Portions size is just right. I had the pasta with lemon & pepper sauce, and the mozzarella was to DIE for. Fresh and homemade taste, Just like in southern Italy. Ambiance is cozy, dim lights, great for a date or just dinner with the family. Have to say one minor bad thing, they have no cocktail list, but the food makes up for it.
