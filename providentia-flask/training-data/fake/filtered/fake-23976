Valentine Day review. After doing some research and hearing the rave reviews on yelp with the food and its "intimate" setting I decided to take my V date here. First off, we were both way overdressed for this place. Second, if you lilke eating in a hot kitchen then by all means come because it was at least 80-85F in the place. The back section has an open kitchen so you can see the Chef, cute, but its really seems to be an ego thing for the Chef to check out your dining experience. Perhaps putting up some sheetwall and turning on the air alittle would make the guests feel more comfortable. Literally, I was counting the minutes to get out of the place. Â In fact, I tried to avoid dishes which would make me sweat any more than I already wax so nothing spicy, heavy meats etc. My date didn't even want to order wine...Note to manager, when your waiter is sweating and it isn't even that busy turn on the air. The wooden tables are perfect for a family gathering; not an intimate date setting. Food: We had an appetizer which was great. Awesome quality and perfect presentation. The entre selections makes it difficult to choose. Its seems the type of place either you will have a great dish or a terrible dish; this usually happens when the Chef tries too hard to impress. Case in point, date ordered a risotto and she was totally freaked out with shrimp and prawns sticking out from all over. Was way too spicy also-never had a spicy risotto before-the uncomfortable room temp didn't help here. Anyways, her dish would have been much better as a small appetizer than an entre. The pasta dish I ordered was overcooked and not very impressive; the thing that killed it was being so so salty. Sucks because I could tell this place uses really high quality food. Would be open to going back and trying another time(sometimes places can be hit or miss certain nights) but given just how uncomfortably hot it is, will venture elsewhere. A 100 dollar meal best spent somewhere else that night.
