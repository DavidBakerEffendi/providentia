Tried the pizza tonight and wasnt very impressed.  Im not a fan of corn meal on the crust and the sauce was very bland.  It was strange when i called b/c they asked immediatly if I was paying cash or credit and I had to give them my credit card info before I even came and got the pizza.  When I went in to pick it up it was 100 degrees in the little area Im not sure how they could even breath in there and the staff behind the counter making the pizza were wearing flip flops.  In an area with a ton of choices they have a long way to go.
