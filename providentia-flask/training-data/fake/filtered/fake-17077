Due to favorable ratings and press, I went expecting a fine meal. I was powerfully disapponted. The space is lovely. The wait staff is, however, not particularly graceful. There was interruption of conversation and a general briskness not conducive to pleasureable dining. I had two 'special' dishes. Both were ill-considered and poorly executed. The scallops and short ribs first course was not a happy combination. In addition the scallops were undercooked and not particularly tasty. The main course halibut was over-cooked to the point that it had to be sent back. The management's reaction was appropriate but the meal had been undermined. Dessert included a too-sweet pecan pie and a not-very-tasty key lime tart. My companions all seemed to enjoy what they ordered but I would not choose to return.
