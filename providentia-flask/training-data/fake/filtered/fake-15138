This is my favorite gluten-free Italian restaurant in NYC. I started coming here a few years ago when I was first diagnosed as gluten intolerant. The owner here is very proud of his work and is often seen talking to diners. He and I had a long conversation about the gluten free diet. He is very knowledgeable. The food is excellent. I usually get the wild mushroom ravioli when I come, however every dish I have tried here has been great. The desserts are amazing, especially the flourless chocolate cake (BIG chocolate fan here). The only disappointing dish I've encountered here is the key lime pie - not because it's bad, it tastes great, but because the slice they give you is very small. If you're gluten free, you need to check out Bistango.
