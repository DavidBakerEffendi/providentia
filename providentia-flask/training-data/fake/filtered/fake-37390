Such a shame.  I happened to really like this restaurant.  The food was always good as well as the portion sizes for take out meals.  However, they just started charging for rice.  I was appalled to learn that I paid $12 dollars for two servings of rice.  I've been ordering literally for years from this restaurant the exact same order and rice had always come with the entrees.  Charging for rice is one thing, but now paying for an extra $12 to my bill for the exact same meal just seems insulting. With all the other Indian restaurants in the Oak Tree Road section, why do this?  I will be happy to go to other restaurants to avoid this.  Urban Spice - you just lost a customer because of this ridiculous up-charge.
