Perhaps it was a fluke but we waited over 40 mins for our table even though we had reservations + we checked in upon arrival. We were told our tables weren't ready yet and were given the option to wait at the bar so we grabbed cocktails and waited...... It was an unusually long time and we noticed that 2 other parties that arrived at similar times were long ago seated.  When we were done with our drinks, we asked about our table and were informed by the hostess that an earlier hostess forgot to check us in!  :/ After apologizing, we were finally seated where there were plenty of empty tables in the back. So now about the food: - They gave us complimentary monkey bread for the slip up.  The bread was warm and melted in our mouths.  One of the spreads however was too fishy to enjoy. - The pork belly was way too salty to enjoy.   - The gnocchi was cooked too long and too soft in texture. - The duck was just ok. - The only note worthy and interesting was the bucatini.  Good mix of flavors and textures. The portions here were big if that counts but overall I would not come back again.
