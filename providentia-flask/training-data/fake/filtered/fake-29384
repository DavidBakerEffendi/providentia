Currently my favorite hangout in town, this place seriously has it all: excellent food (try the pork belly tacos!), great bartenders, cool tunes, and a comfortable neighborhood vibe. Drinks and food are all reasonably priced, and there's even a nice dining room in the back for enjoying your grub sans-bar stool. Come out for a drink and blare some oldies on the juke!
