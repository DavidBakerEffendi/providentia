Above average food, excellent wait staff, only a 15 minute wait on a Sunday after a theater matinee performance when it was very, very crowded.  Larger groups will wait much longer.  There were 4 in our party. It goes without saying that the cheesecake is the attraction here and it is well deserved, but instead of paying $7 per slice for 4 people we went next door to the bakery and bought a whole regular cheesecake which yielded 6 generous servings for about $24 and took it back to our hotel to enjoy for dessert later.
