I'm a big fan of Depalma's for excellent takeout Apizza. My favorite standard is trying a Pepperoni and Mushroom, and I like Depalmas better than Modern and Tolli's. The Depalmas crust is a little thinner and has some blend of spices that I prefer. I've only tried Tolli's takeout once. It was more expensive and I didn't like it as much. But I would give Tolli's, Modern, and Depalma's all five stars and rate them as top-notch New Haven-style apizza.
