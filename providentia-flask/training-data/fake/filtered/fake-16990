This place has to be the worst place to ever visit. We wanted to have 6 separate checks to keep it simple. Too difficult for them, so they chopped it into 3 checks making everything difficult, then tacking on an 18% fee for a tip I wasn't planning on leaving because the waitress was horrible. (Smiles are easier than scowls, just a life tip) and the food was atrocious. All in all negative five out of five. It's not hard to be a waitress, I have been plenty places where they do a better job. If you plan on eating here, don't. Just grab a beer with your friend and sit on the uncomfortable chairs in the claustrophobic room while you second guess your choice to come here.
