I don't know what the guy who wrote a review before is talking about. This place is so good one of the most delicious Chinese restaurants in town. I;ve been eating here for so long and I have never had a problem with their food. The taste is excellent and the service is even better. They are so sweet and its a great restaurant. I have lived in Rutherford all my life and there is no other chinese and japanese restaurant that I would even think of going to.
