My husband and I made a New Year's Resolution to try all the restaurants on Fulton street. We spotted Prospect and headed in for Sunday brunch. The service was nice, the seating was a bit tight.. but the atmosphere was cozy. He ordered the meatloaf sandwich and I got the Prospect benedict with pork belly!!! His was delicious and moist. He kept saying throughout the meal that it was the best meatloaf he had ever had. Mine was a huge disappointment. I am always sold when I see pork belly, but the small quarter size piece was over cooked and dried out. Also I'm pretty sure there was supposed to be spinach under the eggs, but there was only 2 leaves of arugula. I was raised to not complain about my food, so I tried to be thankful...and then I found a hair in my potatoes.... I glanced up and could see that 3 of the cooks had beards. My mother would be disappointed, I couldn't finish it. Don't get me wrong, I love a man with a beard, just not in my food!
