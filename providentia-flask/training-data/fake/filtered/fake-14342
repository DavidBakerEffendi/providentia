Came here with group of 7 during holiday. Left satisfied both the food and service. Everything on the menu are delish, and CHEAP. The bill for 7 of us just under $60 with tax included and no gratuity included. In some other States, the gratuity will automatically included for party over 6. Sadly, this place got a negative review just because of service charge issue. Well, I used to work as a server. And some restaurant don't give a house pay, so the only source of income is from Tips. If some live long enough in USA, then should know Tips are widely practiced in hospitality business. And I'd like to quote from one reviewer "do you require any change? " - well, I did that and hear it all the time in busy restaurant, this is only to save time for the server for going back and forth. So why is this become an issue if we like the food knowing that someday we'd might come back for the food.
