I always considered Barrio Chino to be a great place for food and margaritas.  Habenero grapefruit is amazing.  However, I am a little skeptical of their cleanliness after my last visit (which coincidentally will be my last time ever). Truthfully, I've always used Yelp to check out reviews, but have never posted a review; this experience was so awful I feel the need to. My friends and I arrived and had about an hour wait before we were seated on a Saturday (which is pretty typical).  I ordered the habenero grapefruit margarita (like I usually do) -- we all ordered a mix of tacos to share.  After eating the tacos and finishing the meal we asked for the check and paid out.  As we were leaving I noticed I still had a little margarita left.  I proceeded to take the finishing sip and looked down in the glass only to see a gigantic clump of what I suspect was human hair.  When I realized I had been drinking a concoction of habenero, grapefruit and human hair I panicked and ran out of the place thinking I was going to puke.  I have no idea what the hell happened, but will never go back in order to find out. If I could, I would give Barrio Chino negative stars!
