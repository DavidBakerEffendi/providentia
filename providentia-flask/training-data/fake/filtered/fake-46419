I have tried sooo many ramen noodle places in California and nothing, I mean nothing compares to Ippudo for my taste buds.  They have perfected it.   Your ramen bowl is like a perfect storm.  You'll know what I mean when you see it.  The pork bun, wow... can't find any in California matching it either. The place does get crowded, from 1-3 hours wait.  Our wait time was 1.5 hours and you know what, it didn't bother us as we had some drinks at the bar and snacked on those yummy pork buns. We were brought to our table upstairs (they have like a secret door) - I would suggest you stay in the main room.  The seating upstairs was bar-like and behind the glass is some stuff they have, very unsightly.  BUT who cares if you have been waiting for HOURS, the food is more important! I would definitely come back when I visit New York!!!  Unless the owners decide to visit California :) and start one here!
