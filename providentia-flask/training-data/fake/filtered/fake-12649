This place is worth the trip to Staten Island, this is one of the best spots for comfort food.  Every single time I come here I try something new and I'm never disappointed.  The chicken yaya gumbo is great, just the right amount of spices and the bread they add into the middle gets absorbed with the soup and becomes just delicious.  If you're coming for lunch try the alligator burger its great.  The seared tune is my favorite dish, order it medium rare.  Everything here is good, im getting hungry just thinking about this place.
