A hidden gem in plain view:  filling, wonderful noodle bowls with many choices of fresh vegetables, meats, fish, and spices.  I've brought three friends in the past two months. Don't miss the spring rolls appetizer--just like the Vietnamese restaurants in San Diego of the 1970's.   So inexpensive and casual for such great wholesome food.
