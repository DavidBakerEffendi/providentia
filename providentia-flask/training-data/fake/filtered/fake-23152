A bit pricey but well worth it. If you go on a weekend, expect there to be a long wait going out the door and sometimes even around the block.Small place, said to be the original(and first pizzeria ever in the USA).Authentic Italian pizza, brick oven, slightly smokey(yumm).Whatever toppings u get will taste excellent but whatever you do,as much as you think it willmake it better, DO NOT GET EXTRA CHEESE on the pizza.It was ruin it!It's just fine how they make it.Remember it isn't Pathmark mozarella so extra cheese will mean its not melted as good as the regular portioning and it will make the pizza chewy and rubbery.I thnk their cheese might be house made and unsalted.
