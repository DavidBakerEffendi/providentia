My wife and I like funky, unique places.  We searched yelp and came across this one.  Skeptical on a "sandwich place", we went while we were in town and left with the best memory.  A very airy, fresh, intricate, delicious sandwiches.  I honestly can't picture the quality of sandwiches getting better than this.  Keep up the great work! The only reason that this does not get a 5, is because we did not see any description of the sandwiches.  They all had great names, and I was curious on all of them.  The owner and staff will graciously help you out if you ask, but I am just someone who would like to see every single option to feel confident I am spoiling exactly what my taste buds are craving at that time.
