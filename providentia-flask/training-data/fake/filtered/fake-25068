Went here last night.  We had the baked brie en croute as an appetiser ($8.99).  I didn't know how to eat it so the server enlightened me.  I didn't really care of it, but it's the first time I'd ever tried something like that so it might be just my own personal preferences.  For the main meal, I ordered the grilled NY strip steak with smoked gouda roasted potatoes and green beans ($23.99).  The steak was cooked the way I ordered it (rare) but it was tough and had no flavor.  The potatoes were ok but didn't have much flavor either.  I thought maybe it was just me, but my friend ordered the same thing and also thought the steak and potatoes were lacking in flavor. The green beans were good, but you only get like eight, which I thought was a little skimpy.  We didn't have a wait a long time for the food, and the service and atmosphere was great.  If I were to go back, I'd probably order something "safe" and less expensive, like a burger or something.
