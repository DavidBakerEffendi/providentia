A very unique japanese place that specializes in hot pot and pig's feet, but also has a nice selection of other dishes. Â  This used to be a five star place, but they haven't been able to keep up the quality of the food since they have become extremely popular. Get the foie gras inari, avocado tofu, and a hot pot. The sake is also very reasonably priced here. Avoid the sushi (it's decent, but it isn't anything special). The grill pork belly is also very good. However, due to the lack of consistency, you might experience a wonderful meal or a mediocre one.
