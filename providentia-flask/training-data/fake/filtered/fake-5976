I was very excited about going to this spot. I ordered lamb ribs and not only it took forever to arrive but the food was barely warm! I couldn't keep my friend waiting so I didn't send it back but it was very disappointing. The taste was ok but the texture of meat was like chewing on rubber. The staff appeared too full of themselves and I felt like I was supposed to drop on my knees and praise god for letting me be at their restaurant. I would've given them half a star if I could.
