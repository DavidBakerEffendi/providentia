Really good waffles. Hubby and I both got the southern comfort waffle (a cornbread waffle, topped with fried catfish and turkey sausage cream gravy). While we both asked for them To hold the gravy on the side...they forgot to do so...but won't hold it against them. Just a drizzle would have been enough but I feared that they would put way too much. Overall, the atmosphere, staff & food are amazing. I just ask that the cooks pay attention to the notes written on orders like no gravy.
