WARNING about this restaurant! BLOODY BAND AIDE FOUND IN FOOD!  I have been eating at Rouge for 15 years and have always loved it.  This all stopped this past Saturday night....when...as I was eating my endive and bibb salad, I came across a used bloody band aide!  I was disgusted...not only because this is disgusting, but also because I am pregnant and it just makes the whole thing even worse!  I immediately told the server who promptly removed the salad.  The manager apologized and comped the meal...which I didn't eat anyway!  I tried to inquire about any communicable diseases the wearer of the band aide may have had but have not heard back from the manager or the general manager, like they said they would.  Hence...a review on YELP, which I have never done but now feel the need to since this whole experience is just awful and I wish it on no one else who is trying to enjoy a meal out.
