Have you tried Brother's Pizza since Sal and company became the new owners?  I stopped in one day during the summer for a slice.  It had fresh tomato, garlic and cheese on it.  It was wonderful!  Since that day, we have ordered from them several times.  My husband and daughter love their glutten free pizza.  Their calzones are chessy and the crust is very tasty.  They delivery and currently we are waiting for our dinner.  Try it soon - you will not be disappointed.
