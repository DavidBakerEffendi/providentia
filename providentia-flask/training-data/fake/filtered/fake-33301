I've been fortunate enough to eat at Bouley 4 times in the last year and I've been impressed every single time. I've had the lunch tasting menu each time but have played around a bit with different things to order. I suggest ordering the smoked salmon blini, the kobe beef cheeks, and the chocolate souffle. I also LOVE the selection of breads here! Don't be afraid to chat to the guy who brings the bread cart around - he's super knowledgable and will basically let you try every single piece of bread if you ask. The first time I went here I only got one piece but the last few times I've gotten 3 or 4 - definitely worth it!
