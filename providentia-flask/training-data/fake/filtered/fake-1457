Food is spectacular and the Viennese coffee is just worth making the trip uptown!!!! The service is on the iffy side, not very attentive but I do like the eclectic crowd here. Down to earth Artsy and old time New Yorkers. Breathtaking interior too! Â Feels like your took a train ride and ended up in some classic european cafe society parlor painted by Gustav Klimt. Check out the art nouveau-esque cafe in the basement if the lines are too crowded upstairs especially on the busy weekends. The food is the same and it's less chaotic than it's sister cafe upstairs.
