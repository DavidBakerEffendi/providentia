I have to say that the Black Label Burger was if not the best, than one of the best burgers I have had since birth. Fries were even amazing! i DID NOT EVEN USE KETCHUP on either. Sauteed onions on top of the burgers added a unique flavor to one of the juiciest burgers ever!!! $26 was well worth it.
