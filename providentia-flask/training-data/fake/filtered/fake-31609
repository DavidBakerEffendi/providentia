Came here last Saturday to celebrate mothers bday. A bit overcrowded and had to wait a little to be seated (we had reservations), but it was Saturday we understood. We all LOVED LOVED LOVED the view! It was perfect view of the city including the empire state building. The lobster flat bread, crispy arepas, and salmon were all delish!  We didn't order dessert, but our server Michelle brought out ice cream with a candle (how awesome of her). She was great.. constantly but not annoyingly checked on us throughout the night and was super sweet. It  was an awesome night with a great view and service .
