Anyone who knows me should know that Taco Bell is my favorite restaurant, and of the food court selections, if you don't try the more exotic Asian chicken places, then Taco Bell is your best bet. But this Taco Bell stand isn't as good as the dedicated Taco Bell established. First of all, compared to all the other places, Taco Bell has one of the longest waits.  You can realistically expect to wait 5 minutes for your food, which is slow by fast food standards. Second, the prices are a bit higher here.  Every item is 50 cents to a dollar higher in price, which takes away one of Taco Bell's greatest merits, it's affordability. So, overall, it's a good place.  But it had to make some compromises to fit inside a mall.
