I LOVE THIS PLACE!! Everything here is AMAZING. Everything here is cheap. It's quick and to the point - the place is definitely no-frills, but there are a few tables for when you want to eat, and I usually do take-out. I love the classic spicy banh mi, spicy noodles with tofu, or the summer rolls. It's pretty quick if you stop in and place an order. I seriously eat here at least five times a week.
