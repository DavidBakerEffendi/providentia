David S could not have said it any better. Wasabi is my favorite sushi restaurant anywhere. I have had sushi all over the United States, Hong Kong, Thailand, Australia, U.K. etc. This place is best. Unfortunately haven't had the chance to get to Japan, but overall love Wasabi. Staff is consistently the same people, they remember you as a customer and are always friendly. I have NEVER had bad service from them and have probably been in there more than 40 times. Thanks Wasabi!
