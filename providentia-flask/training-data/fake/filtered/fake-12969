The food is good.  Decent sicilian lunch menu.  One very big complaint ... I sit at the bar from time to time and there are ALWAYS fruit flies around.  I have been going there over a year and have told the bartender and management about this in more than one occasion but the fruit flies persist.   Makes me wonder about the cleanliness of the kitchen!
