We had the worst restaurant experience at Govinda's today. They gave us a pretty late appointment time when the restaurant was practically empty and when we showed up, there was one table wrapping up. There was just 1 waiter. We placed our order around 8:30 and at 9:15, we were served an appetizer only (which should have just taken about 5 minutes to prepare). The customer service at Govinda's is very poor (worst so far) and not forthcoming ; the ambiance is pedestrian; and the food cannot be commented on as we were never served. Will not recommend this restaurant for sit-in dinner or special event. You will be disappointed.
