I have tried many sushi places in north Jersey but have found that Zen is by far the best.  Very fresh fish, always crowded so you know nothing sits around.  The specialty rolls are a main reason to go here.  They are large and have amazing flavors.  You get what you pay for so don't expect a cheap meal.
