Best kept secret is Sunday BBQ.. Amazing homemade pulled pork and Mac and Cheese.. Well worth the trip. No place on Staten Island serves such delicious, authentic BBQ.. Also try the homemade fresh Maryland Crab Cakes with chipotle aioli.. you would never expect such gourmet food from a neighborhood bar and grill!
