This place sucks.  Phoned in my order from Skillman then left to pick it up.  When I arrived there was a young girl behind the counter standing next to a pizza that was burned beyond recognition and had a bewildered look.  We stared at one another for 10 seconds before I finally had to say I was there to pick up a pizza that I ordered.  Without hesitation she said it was not ready yet, even though I phoned the order in 25 minutes prior.  So I grabbed a seat near the entrance and watched this old clown making homemade pasta on a makeshift table.  The health department prohibits any food preparation outside of the kitchen area. Another 10 minutes passed and I asked for my pizza.  This unsupervised and clueless teenager checked the pizza oven, looked at me and asked if i didn't mind a well done pizza.  Wtf, the pizza was freakin burned.  Told her i didn't want it even if it free.  Suddenly a man comes by and tells me he'll make another one.  So now i have to wait another 20 minutes.  No offer of a discount or offer of a free soda while i wait.  The guy cuts the badly burnt pizza into slices and placed it into the display case and i heard him say something sarcastic to the old fart.  He prepped my pizza and instead of popping it into the oven, he first carried it into the back out of sight.  Seconds later he reappeared and placed it in the oven.  He either spit on it or something else.  I just walked out disgusted.  Never again...this place sucks.  Bad food, bad service and bad attitudes.  If you notice, of all the pizza placed in Hopewell, this is the lowest rated.  They SUCK.
