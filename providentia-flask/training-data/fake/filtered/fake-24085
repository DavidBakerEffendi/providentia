Just back from brunch, and it only reaffirmed my already high opinion of this place -- a real neighborhood gem, our go-to spot when my wife and I want to eat like foodie hipsters but aren't in the mood for attitude and house music. Chef Rob Halpern (who on all our visits has made a point of personally greeting every diner) is one of the most gifted new talents in town -- as the Inky's Craig LeBon recently acknowledged in his year-end wrap up. The menu is up-to-the-minute-- think sous vide and flavored foam accents-- without feeling like science experiments run amok. (On a recent trip to LA's Sona I was served "smoke" ice cream, which tasted like some unholy collaboration between Ben & Jerry & Phillip Morris.) Atmosphere is unpretentious and comfortable, and especially cozy in winter with the gas fireplace going. I suspect there are a lot of Penn & Drexel grad students going on first dates here. In summary: the place to return to after you've been underwhelmed (and overcharged) by one of the hyped restaurants-of-the-moment.
