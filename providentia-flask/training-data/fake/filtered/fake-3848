every time I go here, i love it... just a simple nice elegant place with great burgers!!... love to sit at the bar or sit at a table... usually has a guy playing the piano for setting the mood right.... the burgers are always on point... prices have been going up as the years have went on, but still worth it to come... Â Can't really comment on the steaks or sushi (which is a pretty new thing they added).... the sushi looks fresh though... but yea go there for the burgers!!!
