The best burger of my life, friendly service, excellent beer recommendations, fun, low-key interior. It may be trendy, but they were even cool to my tourist dad wearing jean shorts, running shoes, and a camera around his neck. What more could you ask for? I've been here multiple times and I've never been disappointed. Go at an off-peak time and skip the wait.
