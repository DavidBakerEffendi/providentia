Stopped by Butcher Bar for the first time tonight and think I've found my new favorite dinner spot. The relaxed ambiance alone is a reason to return to Butcher Bar. I sat at a table outside in the back and enjoyed the cool midsummer breeze and the subtle lighting that decorates the restaurant's back deck. The creative, mouthwatering options on the organic menu made it impossible for me to choose only one dish, so I started with the perfectly creamy Mac and cheese that was oozing with flavor and the warm and to-die-for corn bread muffins in the honey butter dipping sauce. Although I was stuffed after eating every last bit of my appetizers, I was anxiously awaiting my "50/50" gourmet sandwich that I ordered for my main dish. I thoroughly enjoyed my entire sandwich which was half pulled pork half brisket on a perfectly toasted bun. The meat was fresh and full of savory barbecue flavors. It came with a side of cole slaw and pickles, which I usually don't rave about, but even these sides were scrumptious. I also tried the garlic mashed potatoes which were better than my Grandma's (a secret I'll keep from her). I even met the hospitable, friendly owners who were so nice to introduce themselves after realizing I was a first time customer. I will definitely be returning to Butcher Bar in the near future and trying the Crazy Turkey Burger next... And some more corn bread muffins of course!
