Best chinese food ever and they deliver!!!!  Prices are reasonable compared to the others in the area.  They are the only place that will deliver in the snow or storms.  Chicken and Broccoli is very tender and fresh.  I love the General Tso's.  It is fresh white meat not like other places.  I order from them at least once a week!!
