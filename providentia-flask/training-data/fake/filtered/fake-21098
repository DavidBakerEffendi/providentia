Personally I find Murphy's to be the most enjoyable of the Main St. restaurants in Hanover.  The food is typically enjoyable though occasionally leaves something to be desired.  I really like the bourbon steak tips and beet salad appetizer, which are consistently top notch. The atmosphere is very pubbish and the recent renovations have made it very comfortable.  My experience with the staff has always been fantastic.
