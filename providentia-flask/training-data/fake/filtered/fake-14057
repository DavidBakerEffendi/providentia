Just about everything about The Farm is excellent. Food, service, atmosphere ( love their outdoor space). We have enjoyed oh so many wonderful brunches here from the coffee to the omelettes to the seasoned fries, we are devotees. We always leave with the impression that we paid too little given the portion size and quality of the food. Service is always efficient and friendly.
