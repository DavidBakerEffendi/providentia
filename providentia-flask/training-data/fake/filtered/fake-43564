Without a doubt, the Â best Chinese food I have ever eaten in my life. Can't tell you how many places I've been to that advertise a dish as, " spicy", only to find the food to be incredibly bland. Or...food that is so spicy that the heat overpowers the taste. Not here. Have read some complaints on here about the service. Never had a rude or surly waiter here...have had to wait a while now and then for both seats and service, but I figure that's the case at most restaurants that have as much traffic.The overworked waiters have always been very helpful.....especially in explaining the different entrees.I did ask one at the end of the night if they took cards and he proceeded to bring me a plastic fork( go figure).....but I passed that off to the noise and my hoarse throat. Then again, if you want a perky, giggly waiter/waitress all the time........there's probably an Applebee's in your neighborhood. Look....go here if you're serious about Chinese food and spice.It's not a classy place, but it's worth every penny.
