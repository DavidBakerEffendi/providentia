Best place to eat in Middlesex county..... (GREAT FOOD) The owner which Â owns " Pierres in South Brunswick" built this for his son "Nice hook-up" which doesn't know anyting thing about running a restaurant. you can see him walking around the restaurant not knowing what he's supposed to do. It takes a long time for the food to come out, be patient it's worth it. Great food, poor management! It's too quiet also!
