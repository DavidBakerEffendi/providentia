The secret is out.  This place rocks.  The food is tasty (authentic), the atmosphere is just right, and the staff is super chill.  Olivier is quite the character .  Its obvious that he and the chef put a lot of thought into creating this spot.  One of my new favorites.  Can't wait to have the lamb again...
