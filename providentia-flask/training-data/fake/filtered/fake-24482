With visiting NYC from the UK we walked around china town and found Joe's Shanghai on 9 peel street NY 10013. this was on 8/7/2010. After looking at all of the awards on the window we decided to go inside and had to wait 30 mins which we were happy about because we thought it must be good??? The meal itself was very poor and not what I expected. Our Local Chinese Takeaway in the UK was much better!! The food was salty and tasted yuk. The service was also poor very rushed and made you feel that they wanted you out of the door ASAP!!!. I am not one to moan and we decided to put it down to experience and pay the bill and leave. In all on the hustle and bustle we left without our shopping bags. We proceeded to walk out of the restaurant and down the end of the street where we realized that we had left our bag at the table. we had left the restaurant only 2 to 3 mins earlier and I walked back in to find our bag. At our table their was around 8 young Chinese guys aged around 16 to 20 years old. I asked them if they had seen our bag and looked under table. they all denied seeing it and when I asked the manager and waiting staff if they could help they all pretended that they could not speak English and denied all knowledge which I could not believe as we had only just left 3 minutes ago!!!! Nobody wanted to help me whatsoever and  I thought that after our party of 8 had just spent over 250$ in the restaurant they would have??? I told the young Chinese guys  to empty out their bags and after much resistance they put their bags under the table and moved their arms around a bit as though passing something amongst each other they  showed me their bags which I could not see my stuff!!. I decided that I would leave and write this review to warn other tourists not to visit this restaurant again. Kind Regards Mark UK.
