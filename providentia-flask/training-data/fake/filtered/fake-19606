Jack & Nellie's is the place to go to when in Forrest Hills- I litteraly feel proud just to have it to when i talk about Forrest Hills. Its good for every occasion I feel, food is great and the deserts are out of this wored. Everyone was very nice- I didnt get to sit at the bar yet since i love the seating area too much- But it really looks great over there.
