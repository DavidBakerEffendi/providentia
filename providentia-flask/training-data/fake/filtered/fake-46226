This restaurant was 5 stars for me four months ago, suddenly the food has changed, maybe the original owners, who understood what it means to be a true ramen shop have left the country, not sure..  I went from twice a week, to not having been back in months, after three marginal experiences in a row..  I miss the old ippudo, , hey management, will they ever come back.?
