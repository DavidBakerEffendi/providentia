Consistently delicious! From the roasted capese salad to the Italian onion soup (yes, better and far more inventive than the original French alternative), the fresh flavors are amazing. Pomodoro...light and lovely; atmosphere is warm and welcoming and the service attentive ... Genuine. Our wait staff was fantastic! We highly recommend a visit if not a weekly ritual!
