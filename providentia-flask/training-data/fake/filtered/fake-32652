AWESOME place! they have a great party package if you want to go with a bunch of your friends for an event, and have a KILLER country music night on fridays. Tuesdays are good too for the beer pong and wednesday they have karaoke . the owner is awesome, and the bartenders actually know what they're doing (apryl and robbie kill it on fridays!). if you're going, definitely check out the food too - everything (even the burgers and chicken is fresh!). I'm a big fan!
