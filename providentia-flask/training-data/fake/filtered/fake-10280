Ended up here with no destination in mind for dinner w friend on a rainy night.  Came inside and great music, lighting and cool atmosphere for a glass of wine and food.   service was great, friendly.  food was really delicious.  the soup was especially delicious on a rainy night.  recommend the ravioli with mushoroom that they had as special, really fresh!
