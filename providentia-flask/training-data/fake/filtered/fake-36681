The burgers and shakes were good.  Very disappointed in the service.  Went to the bar to order a quick burger.  I was told I had to have a seat at the bar to order. Went down to the other end where my friends had a seat for me to order and where the bar tender at the ooposite end was supposed to take the order.  The bar tender from my end was now on the opposite end chatting it up for a good 5 minutes , and the original bar tender who said i had to order from a seat just let her keep on yapping knowing I had just inquired about ordering food.  That was the third worker there that just seemed to be off in la la land not actually doing their job and trying to get this money.  Every turn there was more and more bad service, workers dancing with the juke box and not caring about customers, bringing out and charging shots for a whole table when specifically 3 shots were ordered.  Like I said food was good, but customer service was a huge turnoff.  Will not be going back and will warn friends and family about wasting their time and money here.
