While sitting near Qodba Mexican Grill at Newark airport the server behind the counter put on plastic gloves at that time a friend came to the counter, they shook hands, slapped 5 and started to talk. Â When the friend left the server started to prepare food with that same glove on and he also wiped something off the counter.....with the same hand and wiped his brow....with the same hand. This was a turn-off with these unclean acts!
