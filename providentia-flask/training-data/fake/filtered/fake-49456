Loved this restaurant!! Unique decor, attentive staff, great crowd! The menu selection is great and offers something for every palette. The Mojo Grilled Shrimp and Enchilada Mixtas were two dishes I had the opportunity to taste and was impressed by both. Good presentation and portion sizes too! Great in-house salsa and specialty drinks! This restaurant definitely add fabulous flair and unique twists to some traditional Mexican dishes and there's something for everyone at reasonable prices!
