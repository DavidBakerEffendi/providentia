I wrote this after my 2nd time eating lunch at Trio's.  Another good find on Girard street a few blocks away from Las Cazuelas!  First time here I had the two slice of pizza special, which comes with a small drink for $5.  The quality of the pizza was great, it was actually a square slice of their tomato pie, which has cheese on it.  It had great flavor, and chunky tomatoes.  Great deal! 2nd time I had the chicken sorentino, it came with a side salad, bread, a side dish of pasta and the chicken - for around $12.  This was also very good, the sauce on the pasta was different than the pizza but still great, and the chicken came in what seemed like a red wine sauce with mozzarella and a tomato on top.  Good stuff!  I didn't realize that there was a good Italian place here in my neighborhood, but now I'm sold.
