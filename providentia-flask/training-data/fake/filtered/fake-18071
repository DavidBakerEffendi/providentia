This place is AMAZING!!! I'm totally in love with the mango habanero wings and the jalape√±os!! I have actually driven over an hour to get there because I had a craving for them! The garlic parm fries are delicious too!! I can't get enough of this place. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and it is very affordable!! Perfect place to hang out with friends, have some great food and watch the game!
