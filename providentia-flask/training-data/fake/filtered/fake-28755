For a sushi snob that has been searching for a place to indulge, Doma was the perfect answer....Since moving to Philadelphia nearly 10 years ago, I have been in search of the perfect sushi haven. Pod and Morimoto both disappointed... where was the local sushi joint that was fresh, clean, and creative? Kisso? Close. Fat Salmon? YES- until they gave up on BYO. I thought I found the answer once introduced to Koi" in No Libs- and that held with me for years.. until Doma introduced itself to our neighborhood. Not only is the fish fresh, the rolls creative (over the top where you want them to be and simple where you want them to be), but the atmosphere and decor is as zen as the sake you choose to bring. In all seriousness, the service is over the top friendly (without being overbearing), faces are remembered (and appreciated), and the "melt in your mouth" sushi leaves nothing to be desired.
