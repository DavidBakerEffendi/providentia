Overall, Houston's is a great restaurant. I went there for the first time in January.  Their ribs are TO DIE FOR!  I have also had their rotisserie chicken. The menu is rather short and a bit pricey for it to be a chain; however, the food and atmosphere make up for it.  All of the booths are very comfy and the live jazz is great.  The restaurant is very dim and makes for a romantic place if you're trying to take your significant other.  Oh, and men aren't allowed to wear hats.   Excellent food and great service!!
