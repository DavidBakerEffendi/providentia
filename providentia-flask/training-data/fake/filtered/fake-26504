We love Thali and went here to try out his Mexican variation.  Won't go back.  (1)  Nothing great about the place and on a warm day, the AC was underpowered.  (2) The help was a little confused and slow, nothing awful, but just kind of blank.  (3) The tacos were sort of ok, but very spicy.  (4) The burger was dry and tasteless.  (5) The fish of the day was dry and tasteless -- and expensive for a single piece of overdone fish on a plate with no sides, no presentation, just dry and tasteless.   Really, why go back?  Prasad should stick with what he knows.
