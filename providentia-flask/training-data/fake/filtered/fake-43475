We just left Scannichhio's with a party of 7 for Thanksgiving Dinner.   Unfortunately for me and my family we sold our house and I am moving tomorrow so I was unable to cook Thanksgiving dinner...We made our reservation for 3pm......we arrived and our table was sort of ready  They had it set for 6 and we were a party of 7.....and it was too small of a table.  So they quickly added another table so we would be more comfortable.  Nice touch but that is where it ended.....It was a prix fix dinner for $30.00.......They started out the meal with Escarole Soup.....The soup was lukewarm   NOT hot....only 2 out of 7 people had 1 meatball in their soup......Did not want to complain just poured another glass of wine and waited for the next course.  which was Ravioli....Now there is not much you can do to mess up ravioli.....unless they are NOT hot which these were not.......I couldn't believe this is how Thanksgiving dinner was going... but was hopeful for the turkey course.......So out comes the turkey....and it look like it was being served in a hospital.....There was a teaspoon of stuffing  with no gravy...there was a teaspoon of mashed sweet potato's There were 4 SMALL slices of turkey with minimal gravy on them.....and two thin slices of canned cranberry sauce.  I  could not believe how this meal was presented......My husband asked for more gravy and they brought him out about 2 teaspoons of it......My mother's turkey was two huge pieces of skin and fat.... I stood up at this point and officially apologized to my family for bringing us here and ruining Thanksgiving......At no time during our meal did one person come over and ask how everything was........The only saving grace to the dinner was that we brought our own pumpkin pie......At least there was one thing that was tasty   $300.00 and it was AWFUL.......
