They dont even deserve the one star. I  ordered pizza (margarita)  pizza was burnt and cold, and tasted like cardboard. Worst pizza place I have ever eaten at. Some resturants should not make pizza. We also had the cold antipasto, should say cheese platter, since that is all you get .And the few thin slices Of meat were accually green. I have to say this is my fault since I have ordered food from San Vito's befor and evey time the food is awful. If you want real Italian food or good pizza, I recommend not San Vito's BAD Food  And Service Just as BAD.
