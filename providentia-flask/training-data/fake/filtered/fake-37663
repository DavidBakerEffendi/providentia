I am giving it 4 stars because this place was a deal. My wife and I ordered delivery. 2 lamb gyros, falafel appetizer (that came with hummus and pita), and grape leaf appetizer. All delivered for $23.95. That is a deal and a half. The falafel was excellent. Best part of the meal. The gyro was so-so. I hate to admit it because they may in fact make their own lamb gyro meat. What I'm ashamed to admit is that I like Kronos gyro meat. I thought that theirs was lacking flavor. The grape leaves were the most disappointing. Menu describes what appears to be homemade, and these tasted like canned or jarred. I own an Italian deli in Las Vegas, my buddy a Jewish deli. We both grew up here. He makes his own grape leaves at his shop. These were nothing remotely similar. The ones I got from here were small oily and identical to what I've gotten at the supermarket. At the same time, the food was good, and for $29 including tip to delivery person, it was awesome. If I ordered again I'd get falafel. I'd definitely eat here again except I'm going home Monday or Tuesday. Totally worth it.
