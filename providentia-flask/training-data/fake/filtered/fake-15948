This place has the best food around but their prices slowly but surely got out of hand Â for a local place. I remember the first time I got food from here the value was awesome I got a burger and fries for little more than 7$ bucks, buffalo chicken tenders and fries for 6$ and when you bit those fries they bit back. Sadly these days my girlfriend and I are better off grabbing lunch once we're in the city,where prices are absurd, or cooking for ourselves considering the cost. Also their hours are absurd for a coffee place, I need you when I'm headed to work or class bean not at 9am. Can't even count the times I've been headed out early and been disappointed by the late opening hours here.
