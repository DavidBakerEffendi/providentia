When I saw this place under construction I was curious what it was going to be, now that it is open I am self proclaiming myself as there number one customer. If you want real Italian authentic espresso you must try it. Hands down the best espresso I ever had. The ambience is of a small cafe in Italy. The food by far one of the best paninis I ever had, the menu choices are great as well def the best quality food. The prosciutto melts in your mouth and the pesto sauce is great. Then finally the gelato, I suggest the zuppa inglese . Creamy and savory. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.
