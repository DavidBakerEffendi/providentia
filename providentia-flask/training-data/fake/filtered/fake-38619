I was shocked by the swordfish with escarole and white beans. It was fully cooked, and it did not really have a wood fire grill taste. That dish particularly made me think that this place is not a real seafood restaurant. It is overpriced for what it is. There are other players around that can offer you a better fish for the price. When I told the server that I was surprised that the fish was overcooked he started to talk about "consistency" and that the swordfish is at "steak consistency." Aren't you supposed to cook it like a steak? At least medium? It reminded me of that episode of "chopped" on food network where a chef fully cooks tuna belly, or "toro." It seems like a crime and call me crazy, but it is difficult to take this place seriously after that.
