Been here too many times. Fam lives in town and the men like the short ribs, so it's been the "go to" for b'days, holidays, etc. for the better of the last 5 years (groan). I have always found it disappointing. Believe what you read about frozen veg, stupid pricing on mediocre pasta, and wild variations in seasoning from non-existent to oral anatomy-shriveling. There's a notable more-hit-than-miss grease-factor, as well. This place is dark and LOUD. If you go early for dinner, most of the grown-ups from that mid-day christening party will be plastered and their toddlers will be wandering around in search of a responsible adult to put them down for their respective naps -- lucky you. I will say that my visit on Father's Day this year was most entertaining as the double-dating, Hell's Angel-types seated directly behind me grew rowdier and rowdier and I got to watch the other diners grow increasingly squirmy with each raucous exchange! No subject was off limits ... let's just say it got "adults-only" in about 19 seconds. And no, the management did not intervene. Maybe if I drank, myself, I wouldn't be so down on this place. I'd be too drunk to care about lousy, overpriced food and non-existent ambiance. Â Instead I'll just consider myself fortunate that I only have to visit a few times a year, eat a ham sandwich before I arrive, and enjoy the immediate company.
