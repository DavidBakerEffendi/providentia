let me start by saying i'v been going to eulogy for the past few years.i love the staff and the beer selection is great.i'v been to eulogy a few times this past month with a few friends that allso go in quit offten.ryan was our server and was very helpfull and friendly.the beers we had were great,to bad i cant say the same for the food  : (  this is like the third time i'v gone in to eat and just had food that was dissatisfing.im thinking you might have changed chefs and if thats the case change agian.the food is so inconsistent that the next time me and my friends are thinking of a gastropub to go eat at in the city eulogy will not be on the top of our list.we  will still belly up to your bar for great beer,but untill the food bar is higher there we wont be eatting.
