We drove half an hour to come here because I was craving pizza, and this place is supposedly known for pizza, which is tough to accomplish in northern NJ (a pizzeria every half mile).  We walked in at 4:30 on a Saturday afternoon, and they were quite busy to be so early.  No one said anything so we started walking around to find a table.  Eventually a server walked by and we asked her if it was self seating.  She said "it is right now" in a gruff, annoyed tone. We thought that was strange, and we sat down.  Someone walked by and asked if we needed menus.  Yep, sure do.  Someone came by after a couple minutes to get our drinks, and we just wanted water.  Someone else brought the water.  Then our server came back and asked if we were ready to order.  My fiancee asked if they had alfredo sauce.  They didn't.  I asked what their most popular pizza was.  She said, "plain I guess."   I paused for a few seconds to look at the menu.  She asked if we needed more time.  My fiancee said yes.  Then the sever rolled her eyes and walked away shaking her head.  I didn't see this, but my fiancee told me that's what she did.  I processed that for a second and asked, "did she really do that?"  My fiancee was certain of it.  So, I was just like, "okay, we're leaving."  That's just crap.  Really?  We've never been here.  We have a couple of questions and need more than three minutes to figure out what we want, and that's a problem?  Fine, we'll go give some other place our money. I don't care if you make the best pizza on earth.  If your service sucks then you don't get my business.  Simple as that.
