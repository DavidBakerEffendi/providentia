Awesome! Attended a soft opening and the food is DEEEELICIOUS! The Grand Opening is on May 1st and I will definitely be back a few times a week for lunch. Everyone must go. The food is light, tastes great and at a great price. The Jerk Snapper Fish Sandwich and Jerk Chicken Sandwich are TO.DIE.FOR. The place is brand new, so the place was clean. There is no other restaurant that I can really compare it to. Every one has to try at least once.
