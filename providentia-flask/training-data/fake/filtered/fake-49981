The woman who owns this restaurant is an absolute sweetheart! We are vegan and have lived in New Haven for a while but didn't know they offered so many vegan options or else we would have ordered sooner. We ordered the Drunken Miracle Noodles, Pad Him Ma Pal, the Bangkok Stir Fry (all with veggies or tofu), some spring rolls and the Mango with Coconut Sticky Rice. Everything was incredible, especially the Bangkok Stir Fry and I would definitely recommend ordering dessert as well. Our food got here fast and fresh despite our house being kind of far from the restaurant. We will definitely order from here again!
