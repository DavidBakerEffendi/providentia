Better than the sum of its parts.   When I think of August, there really isn't anything that's incredibly special.  The food is impeccably prepared, but there's nothing on the menu that's really special.  The atmosphere and decor is really pleasant, but it's not spectacular.  The service is always solid, but there's no fawning over you.  The pricing is reasonable for the quality of the food, but it's not cheap, nor is this a spot where the food is impressive due to it's poundage.  But when it all comes together what you get is an amazingly pleasant and satisfying dining experience.  Isn't that what you want when you go out to eat? I've eaten there about a dozen times since it opened.  Once on a busy night we, like some other reviewers, had to wait about 20 minutes for our reserved table.  But it's a small, intimate, restaurant, and that can happen with second seating's.  The portions aren't huge, then again, this isn't an Applebees.  Take the scallops: typically 3 large scallops over a bed of flavorful greens for $8, if I remember correctly, but they are done to absolute perfection, soft with just a hint of browning on the surface.  Dinner for two will run you over $100 with tip if you do a couple of appetizers, your entrees, desert (they're all good), sparkling water, and cappuccino.  That does put August in some serious competition in Philly, but it more than holds its own.  I'm booked for dinner there again, tonight.
