OK first the rating it's based on solely on the food cause i don't really care for ambiances the Â wait was painful but we finally made it in after an hour we ordered the samurai ribs and some hirata buns to start i thought the ribs were overcooked and the hirata buns were saturated with mayo and now the tori ramen the ramen was too blend for me it felt like something was missing ,after over hour of wait i expected much better experience,i was enormously disappointed
