I'm not a regular, but I went to a great wedding here (in the patio at the back), and decided to come back for dinner.  Great, friendly, classic italian red with an upscale detailing for the local litterati.  A bit dark in winter.  Looking forward to the back patio again in summer.  Worth the trip.
