I'd say this is my favorite restaurant in New York. Easily. Food, drinks, atmosphere, place, the space - but most and foremost the four owners. Amamamamzing. Only 'problem' is now that it's not only you who have 'discovered' it. Yeah, first world problems of highest caliber. But I guess the price of popularity is what you have to pay when your spot kicks ass. Keep it up, boys.
