Gennaro's is our go to spot. We order weekly, usually alternating between pizza and entrees. We love their pizza! We usually order plain but mix in the Bianco, Margarita and the Italiano, all great. We've tried most of the entrees and none will disappoint. Their delivery is the best. Food is always hot and drivers are always quick. Calling in an order is quick and painless. No hold, staff knows the menu, and is always friendly. Salads are great too!
