Came here a few weeks ago with my wife and sat outside on a lovely afternoon. Our server was busy but attentive and we got a table immediately. My wife had the burger which was amazing. Couldn't get enough. I had the BLAT (with avocado) and truffle oil fries which was mind-blowing. Food and atmosphere here are excellent.
