My friends and I had been wanting to check this place a while a go. We finally went last Saturday thinking we could grab lunch. We were a little surprised that it was around 12:30 pm and there was no one there. We walked in and were totally confused on how it worked. It looked like a cafe with a cafe counter to the left but then up the steps there was an open kitchen where it looked like chefs were cooking (thus, we thought we could get an actual lunch) but then opposite of the open kitchen was a place where they sell prepared food, cheese, beverages, other specialty products. Â  And between these two "islands" there were a few tables. We weren't sure whether we needed to be seated or if they had menus or we had to order somewhere and then sit... it was totally confusing. The other thing that sucked was that no one approached us at all (it was evident we had no idea how it worked since we were just walking aimlessly). Thank god this very friendly Mediterranean looking guy with a full beard who worked behind the cheese/prepared food area, came up to us and asked if we would like to grab a seat. We asked about how to order and he explained that we could grab some prepared food and that they had great drinks and cheese plates. Since we all love cheese we went for a cheese plate. The cheese plate he put together was amazing, one of the best we had ever had in fact. And he knew so much about each cheese and what to pair it with. We had some coffee and hot chocolate (pretty good too) and were there for a while enjoying the cheese. We chose to go have lunch somewhere else however as we didn't want to have prepared food for lunch. All in all the experience was a mixed bag. The cheese plate was amazing, as was this guy. But the way the establishment is designed and the other employees suck.
