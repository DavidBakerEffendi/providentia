I won't pretend to be an arbiter of what "is" or "isn't" authentic Mex/Tex-Mex, but what I will say is this: Honest Tom's produces a tasty little variety of tacos and burritos. The decor is sparse but fun- no gimmicky posters or art; wouldn't feel out of place in a sleepy beach town. There's something endearing about Tom's that will bring me back. It's not the very best (tacos could have used a lime wedge, but the fresh pico and guac made up for it) or the cheapest (2 tacos, at $6, filled me up, but I feel like myself and other reviewers fall for the "Chipotle effect", where you expect a grotesquely gut-busting amount of chow), but it's good for me. With Rx and a few bars, the neighborhood around the joint is on the cusp of a new chapter and I'm rooting for it. CONCLUSION: Good excuse to wander around an interesting little neighborhood. Order: the sweet potato tacos. Don't: expect Starr-quality execution. Do: expect fresh ingredients.
