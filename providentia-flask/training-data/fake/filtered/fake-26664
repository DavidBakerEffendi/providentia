We stopped in for lunch today on a whim. The location hasn't fared well with various Italian restaurants and I was intrigued by the complete overhaul into a comfortable, laid-back space with a wood burning pizza oven. The service was excellent. I will say that we were one of just a few other tables (it was early), but the waitress was very sweet, especially with my toddler son. Not intrusive, helpful when asked, and on top of refills, order taking, etc. We ordered the white pie, the sausage pie, the margherita pie and a custom pie with caramelized onions and mushrooms. All were great but I actually recommend the white pie the most! It's like eating cheesy garlic bread in pizza form. Delicious. Everything tasted fresh and the pizzas were a nice departure from the typical greasy slice options in the area. You won't leave with a pit in your stomach. You WILL leave with leftovers as the personal pies are significant if you have an average appetite. We split the homemade chocolate chip cookies, which were decent - especially if you're partial to a harder cookie (I'm a soft & chewy girl myself). The owner/chef was a fantastic guy. He came over to Â say hello and find out how everything was - just another example of how welcoming the place is. In a high turnover location, I'm hoping that this one lasts as it's a standout.
