I thought this would be a nice place. Till I order. I was still hungry I order Caesar salad & roasted all natural chicken for 16$ all I got was alot of BIG pieces of garlic uncooked potato u got maybe be four little piece of it as if u was a baby baby carrots that wasn't clean with the stems still on 2 tiny pieces of chicken for a 5 year old omg never again will I go here for food the salad was basic and it wasn't great how could u get a salad wrong. Don't waste ur time here just go for a drink. This place wont last long
