Worst restaurant, not just bad Thai food but also bad service! Went there with my husband a few times. Food used to be decent but over time they have deteriorated so much! The last time we were there, I asked for mild green curry and my husband asked for medium spicy. I couldn't even have two bites of my food it was so spicy. My husband has a very high tolerance for spice being Indians! Even he couldn't eat it. The food was stale.... After a few bites my husbands nose started bleeding! He covered a few tissues in blood. When we told the server about this he started laughing!! We complained to the manager and he was extremely indifferent to this. I would never go back to this place.
