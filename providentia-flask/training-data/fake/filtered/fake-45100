definitely one of the best xiao long paos in manhattan.  better than joe's.  the skin is not thick, for sure and the meat is very flavorful.  have eaten there 5 times and it's been pretty consistent so far.  the classic pork xiao long pao is better than the pork with crabmeat.     also, it's one of the cleaner restaurants in chinatown.  can't give this place a perfect 5 because have not found the other dishes they are good at.
