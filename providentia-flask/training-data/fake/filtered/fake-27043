Kennett is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood. The atmosphere is cozy and warm, the service is extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Chef Brian Ricci has created a unique menu that focuses on seasonal, locally sourced foods. Â Everything we tried was executed flawlessly. It's rare that a dish exceeds it's menu description, but at Kennett each dish was better than you could have imagined. The small plates were my favorite. We had Beans and Toast (which was out of this world), Roasted Parsnips (my favorite of the night) and some Brussel Spouts w/ Sunchokes (caramelized, bacony heaven). Wow. Incredibly delicious and nice to see some of these rarely-used winter vegetables put to good use. We have also had the lamb burger topped w/ a vibrant purple cabbage slaw...it's a beautiful burger and has perfect seasoning. I've also heard raves from our friends about the hamburger and veggie burger. You know this chef has a rare talent for transforming beans, grains, and vegetables when die-hard carnivores come back to try the veggie burger. Not to worry, Ricci knows his meats, too. Seriously. When we were there a local farmer had just delivered a few geese...Ricci said to stay tuned for some goose prosciutto he was going to work on! Kennett is as perfect for a casual stop after work as it is for a delicious night out with your food-obsessed friends.
