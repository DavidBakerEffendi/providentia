Drove 45 minutes to take 3 boys to Nomad's Adventure to play laser tag.  We bought tickets specifically for laser tag....and then when we went over to that area for a time, we were told it would be 3.5 hrs before there would be an opening for them to play.   The place was uncrowded, but apparently they book birthday parties back to back and don't allow for any outside participants in any of the sessions....so don't go anytime before 7:30PM on Saturday or Sunday and expect to play laser tag.  The ticket booth should have been aware of this prior to selling us the tickets.  We then watched the same disappointment happen for 4 other families with children who'd come to play laser tag. The bumper car area was about 20' x 40' with 10 cars.  Not much room to move and you had to wait for the one attendant to shuffle between the bumper cars and "tea cups".  There were very few attendants for the area. No one was  floating in the arcade area to help with game issues. 3 of 5 prize ticket counters we tried to use were not working.  Many card readers on the games were not working. This might be good if your taking very small children for the climbing area, bouncy house or "wipe out" but it was a poor experience for 10-15 year olds. We won't be returning.
