We chose to book our wedding at Highlawn because of the amazing reputation, unbelievable view and outstanding staff! We are so excited to have an intimate wedding with close friends and family at a truly fantastic place. The wedding coordinator made us feel so comfortable and really wanted to help make our day special while working within our budget. We are so excited to have our wedding at such a great place. I would absolutely recommend this venue to anyone looking.
