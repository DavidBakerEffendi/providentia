It was made clear to me that children are not welcome to this restaurant. They are extremely strict about "no strollers" even when the establishment is empty. I understand that strollers can lead to congestion in the restaurant so not wanting to argue about it, I folded the stroller in the corner. Then I asked for a highchair and the restaurant does not have highchairs! This made it clear to me that children are not wanted at the restaurant. This restaurant is going to lose business with its obvious dislike for children in an area that has a lot families. I know kids can be difficult sometimes, but they are not lepers. It sealed the deal that I will never return to this restaurant after hearing of the sexual harassment allegations against the owner. Too bad the food is great, but the owner and his policies are not. There are too many other good restaurants in the area to patron this one.
