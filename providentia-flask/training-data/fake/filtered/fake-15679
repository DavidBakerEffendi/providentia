4 stars for food, 2 or less stars for service. There were at least 4 waitresses working there on a Sunday night and we never even got asked if we wanted chips or a second round of drinks. Instead they stood at the bar and gossiped. Will definitely go back because even though it's still not perfect Mexican, it's the closest to authentic in Burlington. Maybe service will be better next time.
