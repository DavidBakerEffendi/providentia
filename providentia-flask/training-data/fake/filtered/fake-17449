I was in Philadelphia visiting my great aunt a few months ago and decided to try The Abbaye for Sunday brunch.  It was a very comfortable environment with a crowd that seemed like mostly regulars.  I ordered a coffee to start although looking around the mimosas and bloody Marys seemed to be quite popular!  The waiter was an extremely pleasant muscular guy and service was prompt.  The coffee was good for a pub environment.  Much better than any diner coffee!  I was also provided with these coffee cake mini muffins that were quite tasty.  Upon first glance at the menu I fell in love with the TX Benedict which consists of 2 biscuits topped with fried chicken, 2 eggs over-easy, bacon, and brown gravy with toast and potatoes.  I requested the eggs over-hard. When my food arrived I was in awe at such a magnificent creation.  Everything was perfect and the portion was huge!  Potatoes were good and eggs were cooked to my liking.  It was so tasty that I was able to finish regardless of how full I got.  What was even better was the price.  Very reasonable and I hope to return next time I spend a weekend in Philadelphia.
