wow! came here for the first time for dinner, and the black label burger exceeded all my expectations! AMAZING! service was decent, not great, not bad - but something feels special in that room. i could compare something about minnetta to balthazar, but i think its just that energy you feel as you walk in the door. the lighting abit more dim, the staff a bit less friendly - but it feels like an old newyork city secret - just off this magical nyc ally. cant wait to try brunch.
