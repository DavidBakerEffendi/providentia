Great food, service, and ambiance -  best mussels and lamb chops I've ever had and many other favorites.  This is the only place I go out to eat in Nutley. Haters... restaurants cannot legally keep family with kids out so your ratings are unfair; food poisoning - really?!? not enough rice ?- it's for your own good. Fly in your salad? ok, that's not cool but it happens and don't forget most restaurants have way worse health hazards. Don't be quick to give businesses bad reviews on some petty stuff. This place definitely does not deserve one or two stars!
