UVA is one of my favorite spots on the UES. The service is wonderful and the food is always a guaranteed pleasure.  The Eggplant and the meatballs are phenomenal.  I recommend the bruschetta too (specifically the ricotta with the honey truffle). They are always packed but once you're seated, you are constantly attended to and the service is quick.   Love this place, definitely recommend it for anyone trying to take someone on a nice date, as it's romantic but not too quiet where you feel like you have to compensate for lack of background noise.  The garden in the back is a huge plus in the summer too!
