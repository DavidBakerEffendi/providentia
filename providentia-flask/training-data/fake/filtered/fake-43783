This by far is my favorite NYC restaurant.  The sangria is excellent the tapas are beyond stellar.  My favs on the menu include the Brussle sprouts, short ribs, bacon wrapped dates. The pork empanadas.  Pretty much have enjoyed everything I've ever ordered on the menu sans the Sliders and warm vegetable salad.  Live in Austin now but whenever I visit NYC I always hit it up.
