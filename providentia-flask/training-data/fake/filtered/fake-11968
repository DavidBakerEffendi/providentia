I saw this place mentioned on TV as part of an American Food broadcast. I wanted to go there for the longest time, and today I finally managed. Oh boy, what a disappointment! You need to stand when eating (!), the tables and the floor are dirty, and $7 for 2 dogs, a side order of fries and a small soda. Give me a break already. Has the charme of a 3rd class waiting area in a train station. I guess besides being served fried hot dogs, there is nothing and no single reason to come here. I'm absolutely disappointed and won't come back.
