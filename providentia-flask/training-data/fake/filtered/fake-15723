Roberta's is the place to go if you're looking for a good pizza, salad, or craft beer. When you walk in you're instantly greeted by  young and hip employees. I should put emphasis on hip because the whole restaurant is hip; the music, the furniture the, even the tiki bar and garden outside.  The first time i went to Roberta's was when my friend showed me. I remember splitting a pizza called the bee sting. It's a pizza with honey and either hot peppers or hot sauce. Deffinitely ask for this if it is no longer on the menu. It's worth going there just for that.
