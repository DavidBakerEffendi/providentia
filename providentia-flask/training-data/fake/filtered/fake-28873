Went for breakfast for the first time not bad and prices were good the service on the other hand was not great, my husband and i wanted to try it again for dinner it was not that busy for the terrible service we had, tried to get waitress attention while she was chatting with the a man usually up front dressed in a tie so i assume he was a manager, he does not look like a very pleasant person, well it really annoyed me to see how Â he noticed that i needed her attention "my waitress" and did nothing so i had ask another waitress that walked by to get her for me. So dinner turned out to be a TERRIBLE experience for the second time around. We thought we try once again, we went for desert i asked for cheesecake did not like it, it was falling apart seemed more like cheese pudding..this manager did not seem to be to happy about that ( I've always been under the impression that the customer is who has to walk out happy; go figure) well i changed it for a tiramisu i liked it and then as i was halfway done i felt a piece of wire in my mouth, and i don't have braces, so here i go again i called the waitress, she brought it to the Mgr's attention, he seemed pissed at me i felt!! since he did'nt have the courtesy to apologize, terrible host or what ever his position is for that matter, if he's the owner he needs to stay home, if he works there he need to look for another type of job, maybe behind a door since he is not a people person. We will never go back, I think three times is enough.
