Delicious, authentic, and fresh. Having spent a little time in India I am often disappointed by the bland, always-the-same Indian food I have found in the Princeton area. Bombay Grill is the exception to the rule and I am thrilled to find it. Out of this unassuming little restaurant comes food that is flavorful and bursting with savory spices and herbs. I had chicken sagwala (spinach sauce) with roti (flat bread) and raita (yogurt) twice and am very happy.
