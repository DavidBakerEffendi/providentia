There is no doubt that this Toscano is authentic. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant. We have had just about everything on the menu, but my favorite is the short ribs with polenta. It is quite possibly the best short rib that I have ever had. The two negative reviews here please disregard- I do not see any issues with the qualitative aspects of their food, or the qualitative. The service has always been spot on (but as in this business, things do not always run smoothly)- this is one restaurant that hopefully will stick around. Heading their again this evening!
