A friend and I attended the champagne brunch. Our waiter was absolutely horrible. When you go to a restaurant, you don't want to sit there and have a waiter say inappropriate things that make you feel awful for ordering something. It destroyed my entire experience. The menu CLEARLY states "Enjoy unlimited champagne to complement our three-course Sunday brunch", but they should amend that to include the fact that their waiters will treat you in a rude manner if you happen to consume at least 2 mimosas. I was absolutely appalled by this considering that my friend and I were not behaving unruly what so ever. Additionally, he automatically entered the gratuity to our check even though it was only for myself and one other person. I thought this was terrible and he didn't deserve any tip after the inappropriate things he said to us. If you want to go to a place where the staff judges you for what you order, this is the place to be! Otherwise, I thought the food was decent. The first course buffet had a lot of variety and I enjoyed the selection of soups, fruit, and pasta. However, I ordered my main course, the filet mignon, to be cooked medium and it came out rare. Based many of the other reviews here, I guess that's a typical issue at this restaurant. The dessert buffet was delicious, but that didn't salvage the damage done by our waiter.
