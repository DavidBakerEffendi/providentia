We got the ferry over and randomly walked into this place for a drink.  The girl behind the bar was super friendly and was telling us about the real Jersey Shore!  The smell of fresh pizza drifted into the bar from the open kitchen next door and we had to try the pizza.  It was INCREDIBLE!  A great destination if you are a tourist - 10 minute walk from the ferry.
