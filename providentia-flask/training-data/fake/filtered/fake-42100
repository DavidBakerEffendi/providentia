This place and Gnocco on 10th street are the two best pizza places I've had in NYC. It's a toss up between which one I like better, but Luzzo's was great. Their mozzarella and tomatoes were both very fresh. The service was also really fast. The inside of the restaurant is also cool. There is a table and chair on the roof!
