I give one star because there is no provision for zero  star ratings. this place is very very bad..prices are medium, not cheap, but they are very frugal with dispensing rice and small bowls at that. Sat night June 11,2011 my wife and I dined at this establishment, had luke warm pork dumplings that were marginally acceptable but this was followed by shrimp with lobster sauce served in soup  bowl. consistency  was  watery and while shrimp were good the remainder  was just chicken broth liquid. final dish was pan fried noodle with sea food.It was not fresh and tasted as if it was reheated from something prepared a  long time ago. In booth  behind me a customer ordered whole fish something or other. he loudly declaimed...this is frozen fish. I presented yelp 10% discount coupon which was accepted  accepted in a surly manner. a dear friend from Taiwan said if you want good Chinese food in NJ go to Chinatown. amen
