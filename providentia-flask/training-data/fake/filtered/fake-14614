I had to write a review on this place as soon as I possible could!! See I go to the Lucille Roberts gym in Kearny almost everyday and I pass this little quaint spot each time and finally I decided to invite my best friend out for a nice Saturday evening. Walking in I love the decor, especially since I am in love with the NY lofty feel and they completely draw from that inspiration. The look is so trendy and chic with exposed brick, dark floors, sexy tables and stools, small bar and an outdoor terrace that is so beautiful on summer nights. On the walls are wonderful abstract art that adds the warm feel and can even be brought. We started off ordering drinks; my best ordered the Tazo Jack Daniels Tea and I ordered the Tropical Fusion Martini, which was delicious by the way! We went the menu and were shocked at the affordability of the food and the wide selection. It seemed to be a Asian and Spanish fusion of foods and tastes. She ordered the vegetarian black been soup, and the fried calamari. I ordered veggie spring rolls, yucca fries and of course dessert. The portions are enormous ((you really get your monies worth)). So we spent the evening eating off each others plates and dipping in their wonderful interesting sauces. Everything was amazing and cooked to order of course. Love the calamari, it was soooo delicious ((a must order)). Â The music was awesome, I remember hearing a Sade song I love sooo much. The people were great and the waiters were so sweet and attentive, they actually sit at your table help you order. After we were stuffed with delicious food we, well I decided to order dessert a brownie a la mode with chocolate and caramel sauce, one word ((illegal)), lol, it was so good I wanted another...j/p This place is a gem in the middle of Newark, anyone looking for a trendy chic place to just chill and eat some really awesome food, please try out 27 mix!!
