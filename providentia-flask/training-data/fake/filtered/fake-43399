I just had dinner here last night for the first time and I have to say it was great.   I had a Meaty Latke, which was to die for.  It was absolutely filling and had some great flavor as well.  The beer selection was a bit overwhelming but in a good way.  With so many beers it was hard to pick just one.   The staff was also attentive and friendly.  When I walked in, I was greeted promptly and it was a very welcoming environment.  One of the owners even introduced himself and chatted with me a bit which was great.   The decor was pretty comfortable too, feeling like I was migrating through a house as I walked through the space.  The fireplace and couch was a nice cozy "hideaway" in the corner. I would easily recommend this place to everyone.  While it's outside the "comforts" of Center City/Walnut Street, it's definitely worth the trip.
