First off, the native, male waiter, was brusque and no help at all. Thank goodness, there was a Latina waitress, who spoke both English and Spanish; she explained the menu and made our experience a pleasant one. The "tempura"-type appy sampler was too "doughy". My lamb was served nicely enough on a sizzling platter, Â but would have been better if it had been pulled off of the grill a minute sooner. I'd give an overall C+.
