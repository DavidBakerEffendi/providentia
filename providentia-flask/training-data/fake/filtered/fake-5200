I have been there for both lunch and dinner. And the food was fantastic for both. Lunch I had a hot roast beef sandwich was fantastic! Dinner a chicken dish, and half of my wife's veal that was delicious! Portions were huge! The only this I will say is that the staff from lunch and dinner is like day and night. First dinner. The staff was miserable. Helpful but not friendly. Like they didn't want to be there at all. Made me not want to go back. Then I went in for lunch I do believe it was a Tuesday. There was a guy behind the register who took our order. I do not remember his name. But he was the most pleasant person. Asked me how my day was going and really made you feel like he was interested. He then brought our food out to us. And my wife and friend witnessed him check on every table giving them the same attention. With a smile on his face and making people smile and laugh. I do believe my wife and friend have a crush on him! To finish up he made sure he said good bye to each and every person as they left. The food and that individual is the reason to go back during the day. Wish I could say the same for frankanthonys at night.
