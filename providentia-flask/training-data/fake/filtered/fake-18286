It was about 8:20 and since my husband was away on business I stopped into pick up something quick to eat at home. It was a bit confusing when they said they were closing because the door states close is at 10. In any event, limited prepared options still available so I chose some sort of chicken/eggplant/mozzarella combination sandwich. The service was not particularly friendly and it took FOREVER to pay. With expectations set low by my experience in the store - I non-enthusiastically sat down at home to eat. Man was I surprised! Absolutely one of the most delicious things I have ever eaten! Fantastic fresh ingredients delivered sensational flavor. Advice to owners .... Â smile, provide quicker better-organized check-out and your establishment could deliver PERFECTION.
