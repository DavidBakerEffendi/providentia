Bad attitude. Went to Lucali for the first time. Pizza is good but the attitude is not worth it. Front area staff is pretentious. The wait was not long so that was not an issue. I asked if they have a booster seat and she seemed annoyed I asked. No worries - we are fine without. The waitress seemed like she was annoyed to have us there and did not want to bother going through the menu options. If that is too much of a bother, then perhaps you do not want our business! We ordered a pizza and calzone. The waitress neglected to tell us that they space out the orders. We could not get the the calzone until we were done with the pizza!! I wish she would have told us that early on but that is too much effort. Overall, Lucali thinks they are too good for anything and I am sorry but the pizza cannot make-up for that. This night was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have had.
