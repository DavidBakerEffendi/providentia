The new location that they have been at for some time now is romantic without being uncomfortable at the bar where many people come for the great drinks and flat screens. Reservations are important but you can always luck out. I have eaten herer so many times in 8 years it is like cheers I love the shrimp with the chihuhua chees its amazing. I mean you cant go wrong with shrimp wrapped in bacon with cheese fried. The portions are great so you wont hesitate to share your amazing food. The gucamole bar is fun an extensive as well as tasty. The staff is able to carry out your alcholic libation on their head and do so often as you walk throughout the restaurant which adds a relaxed more comfortable vibe to the hugh candles and mexcan masks . They have more tequila then any otehr place in the city. The logatinos are to die for and definetly a special worth having whe available. The ceviche is made fresh daily with diffrent fish and is always a crownd pleaser. Big Â groups a reservation is a must or the wait may be long. Good for kids or a date. The bill can be about 40 per person including dessert. But it all depends on how hungry I am because I have spent alot or alittle but never felt slighted or left with out a doggy bag of leftovers I eat before I get home. The parking is bad in this area but there are lots and a few valet spots with in teo blocks. Oh the chirros are the best!!!
