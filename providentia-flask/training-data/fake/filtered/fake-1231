Best restaurant in lower Manhattan - hands down! The only downside is that you almost always have to make a reservation -- even if it's in the middle of the week -- but they're pretty good at seating you within a few minutes of the time you arrive. The food is absolutely amazing...and consistent. You can order any dish throughout the period of a year -- and it will always taste as great as it did the first time you had it.
