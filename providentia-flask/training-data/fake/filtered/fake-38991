Wonderful addition to Hudson Street in the Far West Village which had lost a number of favorite restaurants because of rising rents.  This is among the best of the Moroccan style restaurants that have sprung up all over the city.  Lunch was great and so reasonably priced.  The salmon picatta was especially delicious.  The side garnishes were well prepared, too.
