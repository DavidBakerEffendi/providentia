Best Pizza Ever! Loved this place. Pizza was absolutely delicious and the thai chicken wings were unique and really tasty. I'm sure the red necks are pissed that the Ponderosa is gone (and it shows in some of the reviews/comments... "Gross beer"??  lmao ) ..its a shame that they have apparently figured out how to use the internet.  ha.   Anyway, I am psyched to finally have a place to hang in Williston and I can't wait to bring my friends.
