Something is definitely wrong..such highly rated place...I believe some worker is messing with the owner..I called asking to speak to the owner and some guy with a Spanish accent laughed at me and my friend ..He picks up the phone saying 'what you want' and then hangs up. ...I asked to have the owner call me bakc and no one has. .spoke to a man named Bogdan he took a message but owner never called back. ..Also I called twice today and both times the cleaning guy laughed at me and hung up ...saying that if I want to speak to the owner I need to come down there....so weird I'm buffled....All I wanted is to make reservation.for 10 people....geeee
