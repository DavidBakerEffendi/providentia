I have a non-review review.  I live right near the center of Montclair and eat out often.  I know that reservations are required at many of the restaurants, but most of the establishments that thrive find a way to get you in without a reservation (granted you may have to wait 30-45 minutes). We walked into Costanera and asked to be seated...we noticed there were no less than 5 empty "4-tops" (it was only 2 of us).  They told us we would have to wait 2 hours. We walked around a bit and gave our name at another restaurant right next door and were  able to be seated within 20 minutes...in those 20 minutes I kept passing Costanera and noticed that only 1 of the 5 empty tables were seated... I realize this is a relatively new establishment, but this was a miss on their part. I am still interested in trying this place out, but I guess will have to make reservations a good amount in advance to ensure seating...although, we often decide to dine at the last minute. Hopefully, I can update my review in the future.
