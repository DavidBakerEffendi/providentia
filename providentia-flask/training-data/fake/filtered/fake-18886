The pizza is ok but ONE STAR for the pizzaiolos who definitely need to chill out. They serve you attitude for half an hour than they you get your slice. I've been there 2 or 3 times and I noticed that they make you wait in purpose. They have like 10 pies of pizza's ready in the back, I mean cooked pizza's ready to serve!!! But of course they want you to wait outside like an idiot so the whole avenue can notice the place. I felt like I was trying to get pizza in the soviet union during the 80's. I'm back to my old Pizza Lombardi
