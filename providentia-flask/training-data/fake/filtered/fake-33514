The pizza here is soooooo good.  They have a lot of specialty pies and slices like chicken bacon ranch and others that really appeal to hungry college kids like me.  Everything else on the menu is delicious and reasonably priced and they also have daily specials (like the homemade chili, which I DEFINITELY recommend) in addition to their regular menu.  They even have a twitter account that you can follow and sometimes they tweet deals on pies and stuff.  The staff is very friendly and they work hard to make sure everyone is happy with their food, even when there are lines out the door.  This is making me hungry, Im heading over now for a slice...
