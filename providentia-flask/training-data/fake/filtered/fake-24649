Had a 9:15 reservation. Didn't get our first drinks at our table until 10:30. I understand that you have to "get a drink at the bar" and wait until the prior seating leaves, but I think 1:15 minutes is pushing it. Especially without any apologies or complimentary items from the chef for the excessive wait. Additionally, Â pretty arrogant to include 20% tip on a table of 7 that waited that long for horrible service. Ambiance is cool, which probably causes the arrogance. Overall, good food. Would try again. Definitely not with a "party of 6 or more". Where a server is actually accountable for their job.
