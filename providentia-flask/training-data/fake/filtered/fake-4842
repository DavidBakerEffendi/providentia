Love this place - brought the family a few times, always enjoy the cool decor and great food. Wait staff is always nice, kids ask to go back again all the time. Pizza selection is great, love the taste of the different brick-oven pizzas. Kids get a kick out of the fries served in little "fry-baskets" and the lollipops. Really enjoy having plenty to look at - waterfall in the middle of the dining room that changes color, fun word art (kids love deciphering it), plenty to look at while we wait for food (always fast and hot) Definitely recommend this place to all my neighbors, worth visiting multiple times to find your favorites on the menu!
