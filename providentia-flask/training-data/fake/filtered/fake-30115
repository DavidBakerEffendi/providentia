I've been here for breakfast about 4 times now, and have yet to be disappointed. Great food, great atmosphere. On weekdays, you can pretty much walk in and be seated. Weekends are a different story. It wouldn't deter me completely from returning, but I will try and stay with weekdays. I've had a couple of different omelets, all good. I love the vegan sausage (though I am not a vegan). Good stuff. Highly recommend.
