Wow - what a horrible experience!  Terribly managed restaurant!  Waited a full hour for a salad and a couple of sandwiches.   Out table of 7 was served 5 meals and it took another 30 minutes for the other two people to get theirs.  Complained multiple times to the waiter who was the only server in the place.  The Owner/Chef was not the least bit accommodating and was down right rude.   Worst experience I have ever had in this area eating.
