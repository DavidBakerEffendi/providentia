We scheduled Isabella's on the night of a concert at Beacon Theatre which is only a few blocks away. Great location but not an awe inspiring dinner venue. Nice outdoor seating for al fresco dining experience with portable heaters to stay warm even on colder evenings. The artichoke salad was a good starter. The bread and bean paste is a questionable deliverable. The ravioli were served on a flat plate, were hard and I would not reorder. The lasagna was good but tasted a bit like bottled sauce. The apple cobbler was a good dessert choice but rice pudding was not. Espresso was delivered cold. Service is not as attentive for a restaurant of this level. Location, location, location solves many ills.
