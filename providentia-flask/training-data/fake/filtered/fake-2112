I stumbled into this "restaurant/cafe" while looking for another coffee shop.  It looked like what I expect an East Village place to look like.  Small, cozy, mismatched but consistent with the vibe furniture....country store feeling.  And the food did not disappoint.  Their kale salad will make you like kale. The waiter misunderstood my order and gave me a coffee/soda and normally I don't order cold coffee drinks but this was so yummy that I went back three weeks later just to order that drink (and eat of course). As one friend who I took there said..."You feel healthy and fresh when you eat here" and that friend has been back many times by herself.
