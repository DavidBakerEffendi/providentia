Crockett's has been serving some of the best fish & seafood in the region for a lot of years.  I'm 37 and can remember when they were just a walk-up/carryout establishment a couple of blocks down on Bloomfield Ave. when I was 5-6 years old.  they have been consistently frying that delicious fish, those succulent shrimp, and those plump savory scallops for as many years as I can remember.  I live in Florida now but EVERY TIME I'm back in NJ...I get some Crockett's !  So...do yourself a favor and grab a sandwich and a tray of shrimp and you'll be up here yelping too !
