I just moved down to New Haven from Hartford and i was looking for a new breakfast spot to replace Moe's (an amazing restaurant if you're ever in Hartford).  Wow was I disappointed.  I actually signed up for Yelp just to review this place.  While the food was good, the waitresses here are so rude that I would NEVER come back.  I've never seen such HORRIBLE service in my entire life.  They are unprofessional, unfriendly and VERY VERY rude.  I wish I could give this place no stars.
