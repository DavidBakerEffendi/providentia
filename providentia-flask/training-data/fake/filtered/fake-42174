Since it's Williamsburg, I joined a group of friends going to this restaurant who happen to be ex-Orthodox Jewish, to be ironic. They were amused that every item on the menu is pork. It's literally like bacon with a side of bacon. "Traif" is a Yiddish phrase for "not kosher," so the moniker is very accurate. I'm more of a chicken guy, but I really did like the Other White Meat here. I had the braised pork belly, which I had never had before. It sounds filling, and it was! I kept wondering if anyone in the restaurant was secretly Orthodox Jewish, or if everyone was just a hipster. Â Hard to tell with the beards.
