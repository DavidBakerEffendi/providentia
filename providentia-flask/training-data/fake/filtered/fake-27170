Anjappar food Quality is really good thats y they are managing even though a very very very very bad service in the restaurant. Â Food comes very late say 20 to 25 minutes and the take out section is really worst as they give 40 minutes time to pack one Biryani which they must have prepared already. These people need to improve thier service otherwise the upcoming Arusuvai Restaurant nearby will kill this restaurant day by day.
