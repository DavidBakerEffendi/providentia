If anyone loves Greek food, this is the place to go to! I just had some friends visiting and wanted to take them to a nice, but not overly fancy, restaurant.  Litho's is a great place- BEAUTIFULLY remodeled, with a huge marble rock wall, an artful display of seafood on ice, and a bar that isn't in the way of those having dinner.   Some of my friends who came to dinner with me are overly picky eaters.  I'm not afraid to try anything, but I was slightly worried they wouldn't find anything to eat.  WELL, I was wrong.  They loved everything we ordered, including the "Midia Axnista" which are sauteed mussels with garlic, white wine and herbs, a favorite of mine.   They're dinner menu consists of really authentic Greek appetizers, with a HUGE selection to choose from.  They have soups and salads, and one dinner option is to choose your own fish from their display on ice.  They have some specialties available for dinner also ( I got the "Plaki" which is Chilean Sea Bass in Tomato Broth with pearl onions and potatoes.)  NEedless to say, I  LOVED it. So after you've had a few authentic delicious Appetizers (the sauces were fantastic)  you choose your main course.  Although a lot of the dinner options have complicated Greek names, if you've got some picky eaters, read all the options.  "Kotopoulo" for example, was a delicious half roasted chicken dish with fresh herbs and oil.  Definitely had a Mediterranean twist, but very approachable for shy eaters.   Overall, we had a great time- the wait staff was excellent ,the chefs were from Greece, and we were seated very promptly.  The restaurant inside is so lovely, and in the summer there's outdoor seating, so I can't wait to go back and try it out then! 300 thumbs up!!
