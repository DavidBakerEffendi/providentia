The food was okay; too salty for my palate. The stuffed artichoke was like leather, but I did not complain. One in our party was late arriving due to plane delays, and the hostess could not pass by our table without jeering. Since it is a small restaurant, I am sure it is important to turn tables frequently to maintain a healthy profit margin, but southerners do not like to rush through their meals. Had they told us upon making a reservation that our dining time would be from Â 5-6 we would have opted to eat somewhere else. Rudeness does not win stars! Hence, a star and a half!
