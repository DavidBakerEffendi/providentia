This place is way overhyped. If anyone says this is the best pizza in brooklyn or New York is clearly not a native New Yorker because that is just straight disrespectful. The place is small and cramped. This pizza is dry, brunt, thin, not enough sauce, and overpriced. There is 3 pizzerias off the top of my head that sell better pizza than this place. 1) Tony's dekalb Ave 2) Tony's on Harmon street 3) Sals on dekalb. So stay away, save your money, this place is a hipster trap, and I will never go here again.
