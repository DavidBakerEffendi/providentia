I will admit when I walked into this tiny little Cafe I was ready to immediately walk right back out. There was a line of people inside waiting in what seemed to be the size of a living room to be seated. I decided to use the restroom while waiting on line and almost had a panic attack when I noticed you could not move anywhere when you stepped into the "closet" I mean bathroom... We waited about 30 minutes to finally get a table and boy was it worth the wait. i ordered Corn on the Cob as an appetizer, Skirt Steak as an entree and a Mojito (blended). Let me first tell you that I have never ever had Corn on the Cob that tasted spicy and sweet at the same time. The corn is amazing- seriously if you visit this cafe... HAVE THE CORN on the COB you will not regret it! Although my entree did take a while to get to my table- I was extremely impressed with the portion and quality. This cafe is not the kind of place that has the food already made... my food tasted super fresh and was delicious. I will definitely be visiting Cafe Habana again.... just not on the weekends or at night.... I'd rather avoid the crowds.
