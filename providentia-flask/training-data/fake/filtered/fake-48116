The food was decent, but the ambiance left much to be desired.  I found our waiter to be pushy and glib. The food: The food was flavorful and nicely prepared. The Sformato was the highlight of the evening and definitely worth ordering. The ambiance: The big issue I had with the restaurant was the ambiance. Walking in you are welcomed by a revolting photograph of a skinned rabbit. Presumably an attempt to be "arty", yet nonetheless unappetizing. The decor is average, unoffensive but unmemorable (other than the rabbit photo).  However, the real issue is with the music. It was too loud (the acoustics in the restaurant are not great) and included a bizarre mix of music ranging from pop to def leppard. Not exactly relaxing to dine to. The service: Our waiter wouldn't leave us alone to look at the menu and kept coming back every minute to see if we were ready to order rather than look  for visual cues (such as us putting our menus down, etc.). This happened several times and became annoying. Later, when we expressed dissatisfaction about one of the dishes, instead of apologizing, he make a snarky comment. While these are not major complaints, they are just not things I would expect to have to deal with at these prices. All in all, the food was good, but the ambiance and service would stop me from going back.
