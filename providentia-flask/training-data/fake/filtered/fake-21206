We came here for brunch and were extremely well looked after. Between us we had the omelette, Farmer's Salad with Chicken, and Fried Chicken with Waffle, and we shared some Sausage and Bacon. All were delicious, although perhaps not what your heart doctor would recommend. We also sampled excellent Corn Bread and Doughnuts, and best of them all - the gorgeous moist Cinnamon Rolls. The service was attentive and it had a nice traditional ambience. We left somewhat larger than we came, but we left happy and satisified.
