I loved this restaurant.  It's a very nice location (ask to sit by the window when it's nice out!) and the food is unique and delicious.  I agree with the Anna S about the drinks being a bit pricey.  However, I will disagree about the portion sizes - they are definitely reasonable for any human being that eats a normal amount of calories in a day (i.e.: not for people that are only "full" after 2 breadsticks, 2 towering plates of salad, + appetizer and full plate of Fettucine Alfredo at the Olive Garden).  Definitely recommend, but more so as a date or friend excursion than a family outing.
