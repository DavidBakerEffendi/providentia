I visited Amy Ruths recently, the food was bland, the service was horrible and the staff was rude to people waiting to be seated.  I've gone to Amy Ruths many times before, and the ambiance and the food was good.  Sorry, to say it was an unpleasant experience.  I talked about how good they were and my cousin met me for dinner, and he too was sadly disappointed with the lackluster of the food and the service.  He was like just what do you have to do to get a glass of water. . . . . let alone the food wasn't seasoned . . . . .
