Best Chinese Food ever....I love their fried and white rice, lo mein, boneless spare ribs, crab ragoons fried half chicken, baby shrimps, and chicken and broccoli, Â which the broccoli is very tasteful and soft to eat. I can go on and on. Let's say that this is the only place I go for Chinese in the Hartford CT area. I would say that there general tso chicken is mediocre.
