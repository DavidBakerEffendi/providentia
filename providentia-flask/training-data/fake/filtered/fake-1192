Once again, I just don't get it. Service wasn't bad.   Place is busy, we were lucky to get a table. Its narrow in there, with one long community table down the middle that didn't look too comfortable.   Pick a meatball style, and for me, they put it on a mix of vegetables.  You use an erasable marker on their standard, one page laminated menu.  Some overcooked broccoli, some beats, some beans.  Meatball in spicy meat sauce.  I can't say it was great. It didn't come out hot, and it was good, just not really good.  We spent like 40 dollars there, with my guest having the vegetarian meatballs over some soupy polenta. She told me the meatballs taste like veggie burgers.   I dunno. Once again, I don't get the hype.
