I read press about the Brooklyn Ice House to Red Hook and they kept referring to the owner coming from The Gingerman. I went to college in Austin where the Gingerman is at it's best. In NYC, the Gingerman is like a Disney version of what a bar should be.  It's pretty clear that the owners come from the NYC Gingerman. I'm really disappointed. They have beer. They have food. But they have no soul. Something about the place just doesn't feel good to me. It's got a gross vibe - like a chain restaurant.   The clientele is very bridge and tunnel (and not the Brooklyn bridges which don't count).  The food is just not that special - I suppose it's meant to be eaten when you're totally wasted and that way you won't feel bad about eating low grade meat that's cooked in a mediocre way.  But it's cheap so if that's what you're after, enjoy. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat or drink here unless you're a fan of  places like Hard Rock Cafe or Applebees.  This place is just one step up from that.
