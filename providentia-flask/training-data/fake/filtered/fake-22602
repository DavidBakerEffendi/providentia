Stopped in for a late dinner around ten last night, and had a great time.  The waitress behind the bar was very pleasant.  She also was very knowledgeable about the draught selection, and clearly knew what she was doing behind a bar.  I would suggest this place for lunch, dinner, or even just a drink.
