had a good brunch this morning and a great first experience in the back patio! had the egg sandwich with bacon - it was a little light on cheese which actually was great for me since im not the biggest fan of cheesy eggs and a great cup of strong coffee. Also had the fresh watermelon juice which was a great "dessert". The food was very fresh and certainly tasty but even better was the back patio. It was a quiet perfect sunday morning refuge being able to sit under an umbrella among the vegetable garden. I will be back and bring others as long as i can sit outside!
