I really wanted to love this place.  We have been passing it for a while now.  Last night we decided to head over.  The atmosphere is inviting and has a cafe meets soda fountain feel.  The service was unbelievably slow.  We ordered a salad and chicken fingers and were waiting for almost half an hour.   The table next to us seemed to get special service as the waiter was always there, but would ignore our table.  When I informed another waiter that our food never arrived, he stated that the kitchen was very busy.  Miraculously, after I asked about our food it appeared. It didn't help matters that another waiter was dutifully fawning over the table near us.  I can only assume that they were family of the owners.  Having worked in the food service industry and at my family's restaurant I can tell you that customers do not appreciate being treated  like second class citizens.  You have to make everyone feel like they are family.  That's how you get repeat customers. I ordered the Chestnut Cafe salad:  mixed greens, walnuts, goat cheese, dried cranberries and dressing.  Sounds nice right?  A pile of boxed mixed greens were thrown on the plate covered in what looked like a pound of goat cheese that was drowning in a pink salad dressing with a couple of walnuts and a few cranberries hidden in the wreckage.  I could barely stomach the look of it and had to eat around the mass of cheese and mystery pink sauce.  I would have sent it back, but after the long wait I was hungry. The buffalo fingers were generic pub grub, nothing special.  My husband liked them, but thought they needed a bit more buffalo sauce. I did have the pumpkin spice coffee, which was nice. Since I liked the feel and look of the place I will give it one more chance.
