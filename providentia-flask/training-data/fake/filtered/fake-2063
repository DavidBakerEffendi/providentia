Had Brunch this weekend. Staff was fine, atmosphere too, but the food was so-so. For example: biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were more like pieces of cake than actual biscuits, and the dish -- which should be smothered in gravy -- came instead with about a teaspoonful of the stuff. When I asked for more they obliged, but then charged $5 extra for the honor. Really don't see what all the fuss is about, certainly it's not worth a long wait, folks.
