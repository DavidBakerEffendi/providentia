This place is the best! I don't know what I like more, the food or the couple who run the place. They make us feel like honored guests every time.  Even when we brought our unruly 2 year old along for dinner, they were totally cool with him running around a bit & told me not to worry about it.  The woman co-owner scooped him right up, as though he was her own grandchild, and gave him a warm hug. Everything that we've tried here has been delicious. Only drawback is that I can't help but overeat because the food tastes so good!
