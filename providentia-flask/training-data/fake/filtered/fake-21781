I love Reading Terminal it's always a great experience no matter how crowded it gets. I love seeing all the vendor booths with all the different food. my favorite (I forgot the name) but they have the best fish and rice and it has shrimp on top it's so delicious I think I will make a trip there tomorrow. This market is a must place to go in Philly!
