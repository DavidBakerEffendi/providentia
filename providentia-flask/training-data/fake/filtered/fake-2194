I recently moved to Clinton Street about year ago and was excited to maybe have great breakfast spot down the street from me. Our main goal was to recommend this spot for our guest at the new Hotel on Ludlow. Man was I wrong. So I placed order to go and gentleman on phone sounded delightful and nice. He said the food would be ready in 20 minutes. So i figure to come 30 minutes later. Arrived and my food wasn't ready, not a big deal! I was excited! So right when he said few more minutes, I could see down food line, they had my exact order read but set up for a table. I was like, I must have ordered the right thing! So 10 min pass, 20 min? 35 min. Then guys stops his food service line and says that's actually to go guys! Man was I angry because the meal been sitting there before I got there and 45 minutes already passed! I couldn't blame the service line due to the fact the cannot speak English. So he dumps all this food we order in plastic container, I mean I order 50$ worth of breakfast alone for my self. No syrup, no butter, cold waffles, cold pancakes, eggs and everything was just Nasty and hard. Unfortunately we just threw it away. I was imaging maple syrup? Whip butter? We gotNothing :( but high hopes. we had to crunch on a dry waffle and toss it after 4 minutes. I believe this was something that started off good and unfortunately like everything that starts good, ends bad. We will not be recommending this to any of our guest or family.
