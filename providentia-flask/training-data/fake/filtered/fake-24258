I work in an office at Broad and Chestnut, and lord knows I'm always looking for a good, inexpensive lunch spot. My usual is Saladworks (so expensive) or Grocery (there are only so many days in a week I can eat soup). And then I smelled my cube neighbor's lunch today. $7.44 got me wonton soup and what was possibly the best green curry I've ever eaten. It's labelled on the menu as a "1" on the spicy scale (3 is the highest), and I'm definitely glad that I didn't ask for it spicier. It probably would've been just as delicious, but when I'm at work, I don't want to sweat curry all afternoon. That said, the "1" had a great little kick to it. The chicken was tender, the veggies (carrots, peppers and greenbeans, maybe?) had just a little crunch in them, and the sauce was pretty close to heaven. Best part, the portions are large enough that I can easily get two lunches out of a meal. This restaurant opening actually makes me a little sad that I'm moving out of state in a week. ps. Ask the hostess to turn on the bar while you're waiting for your take out. You won't regret it.
