Thai Taste may be funky, semi-underground, wood-paneled, oddly-decorated, and a little bit dark - all part of its odd charm - but the food is fantastic and the staff is great.  It is the place my family goes to when we want to have a great lunch or dinner together.  Combination dishes never disappoint - a great way to sample a variety of dishes and try new ones.  Prices are excellent, considering what you get for the money.  We love it here.
