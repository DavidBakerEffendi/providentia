Excellent Service and average burlesque . My friends took for my first time here when I was visiting them and family back in April. The service was impeccable as I didn't wait long to get my pint  . The staff were also friendly and patient as I didn't know  what drinks they have on tap . The Guinness though was a bit watery but I think that was just how Americans got it . the Burlesque was alright more of a strip than burlesque  but still good.
