Still a favorite place to eat in Princeton. Love the funky, downstairs hidden-away feeling -- not fancy but clean. Good sushi. Food is really fresh and made to order so sometimes it takes a little while... worth it. Casual, lots of students, professors, and locals. Not upscale - don't be in a hurry and you will have a fine time. BYOB is welcome. Good lunch specials, too. Parking on Chambers Street or parking garage down the block. Easy walk from campus or town - right across from Nassau Barber shop (just off Nassau Street)
