The food is very good but pretty basic, however the prices are steep for regular fish that is very common in japan.   The service is much to be desired... wait on a list that should be 30 - 45 minutes instead of the 25 that they tell you... once seated they never tell you when the food is coming.  Only time to go is exactly before 12:00pm for lunch and promptly at 6:00pm for dinner... otherwise good luck to you.   On the day we went they didn't even have the top 4 most popular items. So why bother?
