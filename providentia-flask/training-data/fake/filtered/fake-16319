This place is a local staple in my area, however, the staff is terrible. There was a discrepancy with price on their website and when I called to order food for my co-workers and I they charged us a higher amount than what was listed on the website. I explained that the price that I saw was 2.00 lower, the waitress continued to argue with me saying that it wasn't true. I asked to speak to a manger and received a similar response and I offered to print off the web page and bring it in when we picked up our food. In general, the waitress and the manager were both rude and lacked any customer service. She said not to bother Â the price was 2.00. We cancelled our order. I then wrote an email to katz deli complaining about the rudeness, to which the owner responded that he had spoke to his staff and was aware of the situation. He took up for the waitress and said she argued with me because she had been there forever and that had never been the price. He missed the point.... the problem was less about the price and all about the attitude. All of that being said..... I enjoy the food but they are not very nice and I would rather take my business elsewhere.
