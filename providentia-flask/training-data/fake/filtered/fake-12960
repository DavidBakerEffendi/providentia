If you like dining in an atmosphere which is comparable to that of a highschool cafateria, then this is your place!  Due to the idiotic design of the place, forget even trying to have a conversation with anyone you are dining with, unless you feel like screaming at the top of your lungs!   And don't get me started on the staff!!!  As soon as you walk in, the nasty hostess gives you the third degree and God forbid she smiles!  The staff in general is AWFUL.  The Calandra boys really screwed this one up, BAD
