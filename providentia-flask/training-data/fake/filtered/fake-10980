I have never posted a review on Yelp before, but our treatment at Yakitori Totto moved me to write one. My husband and I were visiting New York and heard from local friends that the food was good here. We called at 6 pm before we came over and the hostess said there were no reservations, to just come and wait. When we arrived, there were several spots open at the bar but the hostess claimed that there were no available seats and it would be at least two hours before any became free! She was so rude and dismissive. Even by NYC standards I was surprised. We were very disappointed.
