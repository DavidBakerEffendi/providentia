Simply because I completely disagree with the four people who have posted here (two who ate there together), I want to say that while this doesn't quite live up to Chengdu 1 in Cedar Grove (no connection), the food at Chengdu 23 was authentic and delicious. If we weren't such major fans of Ch1, we'd be ecstatic to have found a place where they understood when we told them we don't like "American" Chinese food even though we're not Asian, and it wasn't overpriced (we spent $29pp which included a massive tip, and we were a group of 7).  We tried some of our 'standards', including the shredded potatoes, twice-cooked pork (belly) with fermented black beans, spicy wontons, soup dumplings (called steamed juicy buns here), ants climbing the tree, and more.   The reason I feel the need to post about it is that a handful of people who can only talk about how mediocre 1-2 items were don't seem to really be as focused on food as some other diners might be.  The restaurant was full--mostly with Chinese people--an excellent sign. Yes, the atmosphere is more upscale than Chengdu 1, but it's hardly pretentious.  For the poster who misses the previous place (Taipei), which was a BUFFET, guess what?  SAME OWNERS. If you appreciate authentic Sichuan food, give it a try.
