The amazing food and good ambiance (if a little loud and limited A/C) make this a great brunch/dinner option. But what really sets 5Leaves apart is the service.  In my opinion at least, it's the gold standard in Williamsburg.   Wait times tend to be long, but they give you a good estimate of how long it's going to be.  They do a great job of moving people through at a solid clip, but they don't make you feel rushed or prodded.  They manage to be attentive despite how crazy it is.  I've been here over a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.
