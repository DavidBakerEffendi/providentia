I read a HOT review about this place and it made me all the more curious to find it - considering its out of my way.. its impressive.. the food was done right!, they even accomdated the boys at the table so they can watch hockey on tv while they buried themselved in the CRAB! (must get again!) ...the food was simply woohooo! Tables get maxed quickly, no wonder.. even the lychee ice cream was YUMM0!! Only down side is its a CASH only joint.. 4 of us at like royalty - with drinks + tip ... less than $125. Now thats a pretty good darn deal!! And thats NO Groupon!!
