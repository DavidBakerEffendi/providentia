Possibly The Most Annoying Meal I Have Ever Been Ripped Off For.... Just returned from dinner at Minetta Tavern and I turhtfully don't understantd the allure... "Okay" food in a totally overcrowded,, uncomfortable dining room.....At very expensive pricing given the atmosphere, comfort level and overall atmosphere. My party of five were seated at a table intended for possible three.. located in the path of waitstaff and maitre'd's constantly bunking into you.. My view was of the bread station and a pole to my left..... Our waiter was extremely pleasant, but he could not make up for the complete discomfort I was subjected to. Â Every time a wiater or bus person walked by, my left shoulder and arm was hit, pushed, bunked into... we kept trying to move the table a bit to avoid this.. but to no avail.. the space is too small and there are far too many table "shoved in" to make this a pleasant dining experience. The food was "good" .. not great as some tout.. and the prices are not in line with the type of seating one has to endure... this is NOT fine dining.!! I wonder how the fire department is paid off to allow such a crowded space... All in all, although it is one of "the" places to be seen.. I would certainly rather be sitting in a space where I could enjoy my meal. Minetta Tavern just isn't it ........
