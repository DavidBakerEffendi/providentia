By far the best restaurant in Hanover and probably the entire Upper Valley too!  I love great food and no one can beat this place as far as high quality of dishes and price point. This is really a great place because the food is consistently excellent PLUS the portion sizes are generous and I always take home the rest and enjoy it the next day. I'm a vegetarian and have enjoyed every plate I've ever ordered from Jewel of India.   I've also brought my father, brother, and a number of colleagues here who eat meat and they all agree that this is best place in town. Some of my favorites includes: Paneer shahi korma, aloo saag, dalmakhani, garlic naan, and the wonderful paneer kulcha. I'm not sure how the desserts are because I'm always so full even after eating half of my entree!  One day, I'll pace myself or just order some dessert to go! The staff have been nothing but polite and warm to me.  Mr Singh, the owner, even asks about how my father in San Diego is doing because they joked together while at dinner 3 months ago :D DELICIOUS.  Just try it once and you'll be a repeat customer.
