Well, I am not giving it five stars because....because probably 5 stars should be reserved for places where you get "a real authentic and unforgettable experience". After all it is a Chinese place that serves sushi. And for that it really is great, so consider these 4 stars for 4.5. Or even for 5 for regular everyday places. I went there yesterday; a guy, who I am a customer of, took me there for a dinner. We sat at the sushi station (there are 4 seats there), and we kept ordering and watching the sushi chef work. It was a real pleasure. I am no sushi conoisseur but I could say the guy was a pro and a good one at that. Maybe not that good as that famous guy in Japan who does sushi by appointment only, is world famous and one session costs you as much as your whole vacation, but then I would not even consider that. The sushi was good, the fish fresh, the signature rolls fancy enough. One thing that kinda caught me unprepared was that nowhere on the menue it said that any roll ordered comes as 4 pieces (or was it 6?) and then the signature rolls come as 8. Good thing I was very hungry. The price of the "all you can eat" is still $25. And even though I was not the one who paid (and the guy who took me there left the tips) I felt compelled to leave a tip in the chef's jar and to tell him it was a pleasure to watch him work. I do not know if the bug problem exists as someone wrote here, if it does, I did not notice any. Also for me the bathroom is always one of the main criterions to judge a place by, and it is pretty good and clean. PS. I may not agree about the "Sushi Palace", I was there about 3 weeks ago and I was not disappointed, but then again, I am no food critic. It is a good place. If have a chance will go there again. De gustibus no est disputandum, of course, so take it as my personal opinion.
