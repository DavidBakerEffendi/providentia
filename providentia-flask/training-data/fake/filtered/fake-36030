This by far is one of the best places to get pizza in Brooklyn. Roberta's in Bushwick is the best, but this isn't too far behind. The food is great, and so is the atmosphere! It is right near many coffee shops, and a great candy shop two blocks away. The only problem was the wait. It doesn't seem like it's usually bad, but we had to wait an hour to be seated. It was worth it though because the food was great! And then the manager gave us free gelato because of how long we had to wait. Great place, just don't be surprised if there's a long wait.
