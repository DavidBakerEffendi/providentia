We ate here as my husband is gluten intolerant and enjoyed a lovely pizza and risotto.  They have really mastered the bread sticks and the apple pie for dessert was to die for.  We shared our meals and dessert and it was not overly expensive. The service was friendly and prompt. It was certainly crowded and everyone was sat almost like a school mess table so not the place you would go if you want some privacy and intimacy. The place had some cool music playing in the background. We enjoyed ourselves and our meals! Would definately go back if we lived in New York!
