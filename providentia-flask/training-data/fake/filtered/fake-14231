I LOVE this place. The food is amazing, the people are amazing. The atmosphere is perfect. We held a happy-hour fundraiser at Swine and it couldn't have been better. The owners and staff went above and beyond to make sure the event was a success.  The ambience is fun and low-key, with a wonderful drink selection and REALLY incredible food.  The Bone Marrow & Brisket Burger is seriously the best burger I have had in my life. Also, don't miss the Potato Chip Nachos or the Bacon Wrapped Dates! Go!
