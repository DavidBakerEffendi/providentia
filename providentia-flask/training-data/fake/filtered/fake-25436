When I lived in Brooklyn Heights, I was fortunate enough to be able to walk to the place.  Unfortunately, it didn't matter how close I was or when I went, there was a line that lasted from open until close, and if you were lucky, the line lasted only 2 hours. Worth the wait?  Meh, especially not while waiting in rain or in a blizzard unless you're beyond wasted, then it may be worth it.  You do have it try it once.  It is some damn good pizza.  After I moved, I was surprised to discover one opened in Manhattan.  So, naturally, I had to visit it.  Conclusion:  Go to Brooklyn.  The New York one is fine, but not the same.  Even worse, they turned my club haunt and my former church to a sad little mall that includes Grimaldi's that still takes only cash.
