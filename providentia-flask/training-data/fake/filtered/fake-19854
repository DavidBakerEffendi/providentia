So...funny story. I thought this place was a candy store at first. It was only because the name was Sugar Freak! I assumed! But then I went in to sample the southern/Nawlins fair and was really impressed. My jambalaya was better than what I had in NOLA! True, maybe I didn't go to the right restaurants in NOLA if that's the case, but it was extremely flavorful. I also got the drink special - lemonade vodka Â with lemon sorbet made a fun and refreshing float! My brother got the crawfish boudin balls and the catfish meal. I don't remember if the catfish was grilled or blackened or what but he was a very happy guy! I read that they'll be offering gluten-free options in the future and I am overjoyed at that - more reasons to go back!
