Being in Brooklyn this place has a very laid-back, "hipster" vibe, somewhat of a pub/bar setting, the music selection was good. The music was good but it was super slow for brunch on Sunday!!!! Me and my friend waited an hour for our food to come out..... The eggs benedict were really good though, the only reason I give it a two star instead of one star rating.
