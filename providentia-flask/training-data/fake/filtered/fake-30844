After a hellish 2-day airport experience coming in from LA, The Double Windsor was my first stop with my pal that lives in Brooklyn.  The good beer, friendly bartender, and awesome BLT were enough to make me forget my luggage-less night stranded in Philly.  Im not sure about the no-kids drama, Im an outsider... all I know is I would go back!   Seriously, get the BLT.
