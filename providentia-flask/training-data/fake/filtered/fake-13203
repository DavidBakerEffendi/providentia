I am not related to the owner in anyway or form. I saw two less than disirable reviews which I feel is EXTREMELY unfair to the business. I moved to NJ 2 years ago and I work in the city. I tried different Chinese food myself, especially Sichuan cuisine. Guess what, this is as good as it can get. It is very authentic for Sichuan food. This is from someone who lived in Sichuan for a few years. Â I realize not every dish is Sichuan style but most are. If you are looking for General Cao's chicken or some Shanghai or Catonese style or, American style Chinese food, or some cheap buffet style crap, don't go there. But don't mess up a great restaurant's reputation that many of us can't live without. Yes, it is a bit pricey, and can be slow in services because they are busy at weekends (I only go at weekends). It is not fast food. If you want good food freshly made to order, you have to have good patience.
