i have been looking for a place like this my whole life on staten island.  it is all healthy food, nothing fried, everything baked, grilled or steamed.  but let me tell you, it is not your average tasting healthy food.  i am so sick of diet food and how salty or bland it can be.   i work on south ave and order every single day.  sometimes salads, or an entree.  everything is always fresh.  my favorite is the Buffalo Wrap.  i also love the bison burger with turkey bacon and cheese over brown rice. after the gym i always get a Nutty Professor shake. the decor is like a city cafe.  its so comfortable.  they play really cool lounge music and everything is so clean.  the staff is so friendly.  they also have outdoor seating.  i love this place!!! oh and PS - if you're not into healthy food - you will still love it.  my boyfriend eats the quesadillas (low fat cheese) but they taste great.
