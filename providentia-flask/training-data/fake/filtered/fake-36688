Overall, the food was okay. Honestly, you can find better. I ordered the Veggie Mex. Hot Dog along with the lamb burger (Don't judge guys my boyfriend helped me eat this lol) . So the hot dog was small, it was maybe a finger size? Definitely much smaller than a regular hot dog. I wouldn't waste your money getting the hot dogs if I was you. Save your money for the burgers instead. The lamb burger was alright. I asked for medium-rare and got what seems to look like a rare burger. The outside of the burger was cooked, however the inside was really pink. I got really nervous because I never had a lamb burger before so I kept asking my boyfriend if it was okay to eat. The burger itself, tasted like meat with lemon and bread. There was no special sauce or flavor to the burger. My boyfriend ordered a cheese steak pretzel burger. He'll write his own view of things later he said. We also, ordered onion rings which was good. But the pricing range was expensive. Believe me when I say it. $5 for just 6-7 onion rings with absolutely no flavor. I'm usually not the type of person who uses ketchup on my food. But I had to when I was eating the onion rings and the burger. I would like to mention that the waiter was extremely nice and keep checking on us  while refilling our drinks. I give him a thumbs up!  :)
