Finally got around to trying the pizza at this place. What a waste of time and money. They have this impressive setup, the oven and all, and some dude working at a feverish pace to get these pizzas put together and into the fire. I had the veggie and it absolutely sucked. How can you screw up something as simple as sauce, cherry tomatoes, artichokes and peppers? Well, the sauce tasted like watered down ketchup. I'm eating pizza over 50 years and I've never had sauce this bad. I mean, it was significantly worse than anything you'd get on a frozen pizza. Â It was laughably, ridiculously bad.
