Loved the drinks, food and staff at the Betti Bar! I was looking for a more intimate setting that wasn't too noisy and this was the perfect spot! The bartender and waiter were very attentive, always made sure our water glasses were full and ready to answer any questions about the menu. We ordered the Hourglass Tavern salad, spanakopita and spinach ravioli, all were amazing! I definitely recommend this place!
