The food may be good if you are going to eat in, but this place is a unacceptable / very unprofessional from a delivery standpoint.  I called in for a delivery and the person taking my order wrote down the wrong room number for my hotel.  Instead of the deliver driver calling the cell phone number on the ticket or even researching at all where the food was supposed to go, he/she turned back and returned the food to the store.  When I called, the employee answering the phone informed me that since I did not answer the door, he had my order and was eating my food while talking to me (obviously it was hard to accept my deliver when I was not in the room that he wrote on the ticket and the delivery person did not call the cell number).
