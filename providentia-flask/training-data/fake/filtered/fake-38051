I ate here for the second time on Friday night. The first time was not that memorable but our friend was staying at the hotel and it was convenient. This time I was not impressed at all. The food is expensive, average at best and the service on Friday evening was not good at all. We ordered the chicken for two as our main which comes with 2 sides - Kale and Canellini Beans. However the sides did not actually make it to the table until we were 3/4 of our way through the chicken despite us asking 3 times for them. They took the starters off of the check to apologize which was all fine and well but when leaving they could not locate my umbrella at the coat check. They gave me cheep and nasty standard hotel umbrella since it was pouring outside and took my details. Later that evening i was woken up at 12.40am by the coat check girl telling me that they found my umbrella and that I could go there to collect it. I asked her to have it delivered to my office and was told they could not do that. So now I have to make time to travel back there to pick it up. Don't think I will ever be dining here again.
