This place is pathetic -- I would give zero stars if it was an option. They can't (or won't) even pull off a Burger King "have it your way". I went with two friends on a Monday night around 11. There were only a few people there, mostly at the bar. One of my friends wanted onions on his burger, but the waitress said they didn't have any. He persisted and got the waitress to admit that they had shallots. He asked to have those on his burger. She went to the kitchen to see if that was "possible". She came back and said they wouldn't do it. Then he asked for mayo on it, and she said they never have mayo in the place. We left.
