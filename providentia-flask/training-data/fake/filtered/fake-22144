Large portions. Perfectly prepared. The spicy aroma, lifts you off your seats as the waiters bring Â out dish after dish of delicious food. We had the Octopus Salad, the Sangria, was so delicious, that we order three pitchers! YUM! The appetizers were brought out and served to all of us at the same time! WOW! What a great staff and perfect timing on everything.. We had a wonderful time sampling each others dishes, and it seemed endless, because there were 10 of us and we were in town for a business meeting. the atmosphere was light and the people were not showy, or phony. Kudos to this wonderful restaurant and staff! The only drawback was that is was crowed, but that is the only thing that I felt could have made it a little better. The prices were right..
