I went to a band of skulls/ the Whigs gig at this place about 2 months ago. I was there by myself but met a nice guy who felt bad about me being myself and invited me to hang out with him and his buddie, so I guess you could say people are chill there. The show was great, it's a small venue and the sound wasn't the best thing but the place will make you feel in an underground secret society...of people with great musical taste of course. The bands where even selling their own merchandise which was awesome. There's enough parking and the bar and stage are in different rooms, so they get to have all ages events. Overall, It's a cool place to see a show.
