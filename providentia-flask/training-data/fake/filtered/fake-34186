I've been in NY for 13 years and have NEVER experienced such a rude host, and I've been to a lot of restaurants in the city. We were five minutes late to our lunch reservation and he gave our table away. My friend tried to explain that they said they would only give the reservation away if we were 10 minutes late and he was said "yes, we give the reservation away after 10 minutes," and we again tried to explain that we were only 5 minutes late. Then, he offered our group two different tables, at opposite sides of the restaurant, which we refused to do. One of the tables he offered us had a couple sitting next to it, and I asked them politely if they would move. They Â were very nice and said they were almost done so we could have their table. The host got livid, became a petulant child and screamed at us saying he was not going to talk to us or seat us. We tried to talk to him and he just kept saying "I'm not talking to you, I'm not talking to you." I don't care if the food here is supposed to be good--nothing is worth so much that it warrants such a rude and impolite attitude.
