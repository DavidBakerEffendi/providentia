I don't know what the bride below me is saying I had a small wedding of 100 and Franco was amazing Â when we didn't have as many people as expected he let us count our vendors as guests we thought he was very fair everything was amazing Danny was amazing as we'll always around when we needed him food was amazing!!!! Everyone still raves about our wedding and we wish we could relive that day all the time!!!!!
