I have lived about two blocks from this place for 6 months.  And, walk by it all the time and I had never noticed it before.  Then one day someone suggested we go there and what a find!  I don't like sushi, but everyone that I went with really loved it, and the chinese food was so good.  The service was great and they are open to even trying to do custom dishes.  And of course, you can't beat the prices. I went there yesterday for lunch and I got an entree, rice, and egg roll, and soda for 5 bucks and my husband got two sushi rolls and soup for 7 dollars.  It was delicious and the service was excellent!
