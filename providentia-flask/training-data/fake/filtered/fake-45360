I've heard a lot about SOCO for quite so time now and I finally had the SOCO experience, the staff was kind and courteous, the service was on time and the food was good. On a scale of 1-10 I'd give'em a 9 and I would also recommend them to people I know as a very nice place to sit down and have a bite to eat. Thanks Sam you really made my wife and I feel welcomed.
