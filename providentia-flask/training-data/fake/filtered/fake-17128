We had the pleasure of dining at Sea Fire Grill for my daughter's 21st birthday Friday night and it was a fabulous evening. I made the reservation based on a our hotel concierge's recommendation. She noted the restaurant had only been open for 5 months and was already getting rave reviews and her personal favorite. Without question the service was impeccable and the food was unmatched. Two of us ordered Â the Halibut -- and it was delicious and cooked perfectly. Our party of eight had a variety of dishes including the oysters, tuna, black sea bass, ribeye steak and chicken -- each with rave reviews. Thank you to the Sea Fire Grill for a wonderful night of celebration! I highly recommend this fine restaurant and can't wait to return when we are back in NYC.
