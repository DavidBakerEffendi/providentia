this place was pretty good. the oranges and cookies in line are a nice touch. I went for sunday afternoon brunch and while the line was kind of long, it moved really quickly. the servers were attentive and everything came fast, but i did have to ask for water three times before i got it, and it still took like 5 minutes after i asked the third guy. my friend got the sweet potato pancakes which were delicious and i got the basic two eggs breakfast which was not super great. The potatoes were still somewhat hard and the eggs were really nothing special. But, this meal was only $4, which does not even exist in california! i would go back but it is a touch overpriced, from what i can tell, for the quality of the food.
