At a recent birthday party with my lovely girlfriend and friends we hoped to enjoy our night full of laughter and memories that would have lasted us a life time.  The latter is true but our memory will be filled with remorse. Now it is unfair to make that type of statement without any facts, so here they are: 1st- The waiting.  When you enter you are greeted with the old adage, "is your party here" , no was our reply, so we were told to wait by the door until all members were present.  No invitation to the bar or a simple how many of our party was missing.   2nd- Drink!- As I discovered the bar all on my own,  I had to discovered my own table as well.   3rd- Pricing- exactly my point, none was available. 4th-Loud- I wasn't looking for a night at Webster Hall I was looking for a night with great food and friends.  I asked the waiter, if he could lower the music he said of course and nothing was done 5th- Food- ehhh Final thought- As a member of my community and someone who approves and disapproves liquor licenses.  I will be sure to vote no next time the Diner comes for renewal.
