My wife ordered 4 tacos, 1 burrito, 1 enchilada, and 1 super nachos. We received 4 stale tacos that had a metallic taste or bleach, and the burrito and enchilada were nothing but soft tacos packed with sloppy food. The super nachos had that bleach taste, too. When she called to ask for her money back, the owner of the place became angry and started yelling at my wife to bring in the food, screaming at her that nothing was wrong with the food. The owner then hung up on my wife, which almost had her running out to the store to confront him. Recommendation: Call the health department, and avoid this place at all costs.
