My girlfriend and I have been wanting to eat here for a while, but due to the restaurant's poor management and staff's incompetence, have been unable to do so.  Now for the story... A few weeks ago, I checked Edi & the Wolf's website to see if they took reservations.  According to their website (ediandthewolf.com/reserv…), they only take reservations for parties of 6 of more.  Upon arriving at the restaurant later that night, the hostess asked if we had a reservation, at which point I mentioned that their website said they only took reservations for large parties.  The hostess wasn't aware of that rule, but offered us a seat at the bar.  Since we wanted to have somewhat of a romantic evening, we declined and left, knowing that we had to make a reservation in the future. This past Saturday, I called the restaurant to make a reservation for that night.  I was told that there were no available tables in the main room, so I made a reservation for a table in their heated back garden.  When we got to the restaurant, there was no hostess to greet us and we waited awkwardly in the front of the restaurant.  After around 5 minutes, my girlfriend went to find a hostess so we could be seated.  The hostess said there was no more room in the back garden and offered us a seat at the bar.  When my girlfriend reiterated that we had a reservation for the back garden, the hostess offered only the rude explanation of "well sometimes plans change." We are both disgusted by our treatment by the staff of this restaurant, will not be returning, and will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or family.  It's disappointing because the menu looks absolutely delicious and the restaurant has a great vibe, but we refuse to patronize a restaurant that doesn't have a clear reservation policy and doesn't honor reservations on a Saturday night.  Shame on you, Edi & the Wolf.
