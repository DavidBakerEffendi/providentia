I heard so much about this place that decided to check it out. It wasn't bad at all although my partner didn't enjoy it much. We had mussels for appetizer and it was my least favorite. I love pickles but then after having like more of them you really feel this acid and vinegar in your throat. My favorite was the corn soup. It was really yummy. The salmon ceviche wasn't bad either but I also wasn't wowed by it.
