Great BBQ but also where the boys are... The smoked meat is to die for. We tried the pulled pork, brisket and ribs- the brisket was my favorite but the real star is the beans with burnt ends. I never had them before and I could make a meal of just that. So delicious. Lots of sides to choose from. Great beer on tap. What blew me away were the amount of men ordering dinner to go. If your looking to "meat" men, check out the BBQ line.
