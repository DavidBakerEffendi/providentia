this place is way overrated and the owner is a jerk. I went there the other day, stood in line outside for about an hour.. Even when it started to rain a little, I had no umbrella but decided to wait in line because I wanted to find out what all the hype was about.. It was finally my turn and after I ordered my takeout pizza and paid, the owner says "ok, wait outside".. knowing that it was raining outside. Who treats their customers like this??? Had to wait some more for them to make the pizza, and after getting the pizza, I ate 1 slice and gave the rest of the pizza to a homeless man on the street. The pizza no longer tasted good to me. -talked to a customer outside of the restaurant and they said "yeah, Grimaldi's take their customers for granted"
