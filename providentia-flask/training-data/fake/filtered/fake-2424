Went here on a promotional Wednesday night which was posted on Facebook as 1/2 price wine and buy 2 get 1 tapas. We asked two servers before we even sat down if this was a case, they said yes and we began to order. The end of the night the bill comes and it wasn't honored. The manager or owner did not approach our table but went outside instead for a smoke with his buddies sitting next to us. Extremely poorly run as far as deals and customer service go. They scam you in the door. Arrogant manager/owner, food is tasty but not worth the price. There are plenty of places in newark to get cheaper and better food.
