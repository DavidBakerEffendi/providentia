The LAST Time.  That is is, the bagels are good but the attitude of the staff is just not worth it.  There are many other place that have the same quality or even better bagels then here .  I am guessing that in the other places    the staff actually acknowledges you with more then a head tilt,    actually GETS THE ORDER CORRECT (hard to do with a two bagel order        apparently) and     actually say "thank you" Common courtesy is not much to ask for but at the Bagel Box apparently difficult to come by.
