I had a terrible experience at this place. 15$ for awful Chinese food? No thanks. Poor service? No thanks. I have had many Chinese Buffets in my day and I can tell you this had to be the worst one I have ever been to. Normally the price is about 8$ for dinner and is much better than this. Top it off with the pushy and rude waitress that we had. We paid for our meal and she then kept reminding us that the tip goes on the table. Annoyed I opted not to tip because she did not do anything and was rude. She then proceeded to follow us out of the restaurant and yelled about the tip. Saying how we didn't give her anything. First off, the food sucked. Second, it was 15$ which was way too much. Moral of the story. Just order Chinese from one of the many hundred places on the Post rd. You will get much better food and will cost you about the same.
