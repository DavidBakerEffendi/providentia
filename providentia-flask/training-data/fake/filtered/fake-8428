I've been to Jones several times before and it's always been a Philly favorite.  They have awesome comfort food in a laid back, cool environment.  My main reason for writing this is because we had a party of 7 go in last night and had called ahead for seating.  The wait wound up being about 3x as long as promised.  That said, the manager, Steve, was nothing short of kind, accomodating and gracious.  He went out of his way to apologize and make sure we were taken care of.  I think a sign of a good restaurant is the way in which it is run and how you take care of your customers.  All my friends, who had not been to Jones before loved it and would absolutely come back.  Thank you to Steve, the manager for knowing how to treat your guests.  And do yourself a favor and get the nachos, they are superb!
