VEGGIE DREAM! What outstanding vegetarian and even some vegan fare.... Taim is a touch pricey for a hummus-falafel and salads, but worth it to me. It's in a cute location (Perry St. in the W. Village off 7th Ave.) and though small and quite busy on weekends, some comfortable window seats and outdoor benches in nice weather make up for it. Menu's a bit tough to navigate until you're familiar with what they offer. For first timers, I suggest looking online at the Â menu first. Excellent middle eastern flavors executed in each dish with very fresh herbs and spices used in balance to make everything satisfying. All their bread is most excellent. Ginger mint lemonade too. Recommend the falafel sandwich with any salads BUT the cabbage. Unless you love sweet cole slaw. I'm not a huge fan o' that.
