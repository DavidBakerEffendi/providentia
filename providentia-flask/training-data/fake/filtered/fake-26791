I usually get their pad thai, chicken satay, and som tum papaya salad whenever I'm in the hillborough area. Â The food is good & light which I like. I don't like spicy food so it's great they have levels of spiciness you can choose from, because every time I go to other thai restaurants, and I tell them not too spicy & they say okay, it comes back to me still spicy!! The times I've eaten here the service was prompt, the restaurant was not crowded at all (usually families with kids or couples), and the food was good.
