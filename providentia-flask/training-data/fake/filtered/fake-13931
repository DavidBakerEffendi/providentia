I would just like to share my experience at barbuzzo with everyone. Now I don't live anywhere near philly, in fact I'm in the coast of nj. I made a reservation here for restaurant week. Both me and my gf have been going to different restaurants during rest week for a few yrs now. I called up barbuzzo to see if they do in fact participated in which they said they absolutely do. So I made a reservation online. I get there today to be greeted and told that they do not in fact participate in restaurant week on Saturdays even though I have the call log and reservation info saved on my phone to prove it ... I called the manager over to discuss this with him discussing that I traveled over 3 hours to get there and how I made the reservation for restaurant week and proceeded to show him the confirmation on my phone. Not only did he refuse to serve us the rest week menu he would not make any accommodations for us whatsoever ... I will NEVER even go close to this place ever again ... Thanks for ruining my girlfriends birthday..
