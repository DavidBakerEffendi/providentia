We wandered in here for drinks on a nice Sunday on a recomendation from a friend. The music was eclectic and original, I couldn't figure out if it was a juke box or someone's playlist, either way I was digging it. We were equally entertained by the attractive and hilarious bartender. She was mixing up these scary good drinks that were called mountain dew. On a recomendation I ordered the pretzel roll burger; between the mayo sauce and cheez whiz smothered between the juicy beef and huge pretzel roll bun be prepared to have lots of napkins ready. We contemplated on ordering adult milkshakes, which looked so good, but Â we were way too full, next time. Will definitly be coming back for more drinks and good tunes.
