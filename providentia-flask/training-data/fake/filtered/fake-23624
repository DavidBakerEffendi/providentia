I was surprised how disappointed i was with this place. I assumed the good word and long lines would lead to something worthy of either. What I found was a cheeseburger that was too greasy, cooked incorrectly and lacking anything memorable. Bareburger is half the price and SIGNIFIGANTLY better in all seriousness. We also had a fish item which was as honestly as I could say, just fine. The seating is tight, the crowd is nerve-gratingly 'cool' but I can say the space has character, even if the food doesn't.  I could best describe this place like a Louis Vuitton hand bag.  Everyone (in certain circles) wants one, the price is too high, those people need to be seen with one, but at the end of the day, it is just a bag with a bunch of weird L and Vs all over it posing as a $2000 superbag without any of the merits to warrant it (not that the place is outrageously expensive, but my point should stand).... If you want a burger go to bareburger, if you want bbq go to bluesmoke, I guarantee you better food at either.  So, in conclusion, other than the 1 in 1000 shot of seeing Jay-Z, too much hype, not enough substance.
