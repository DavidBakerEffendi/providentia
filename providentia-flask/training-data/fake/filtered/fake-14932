I agree with those who have reviewed the owner poorly.  On my second visit, I ordered a salad and calzone.  Both of which were good at the time.  Because the salad is so large, I took the majority home to eat the next day.  After opening the container they stored it in for me, I found a dead grasshopper on my fork underneath the lettuce leaves! Absolutely disgusting!! I called the restaurant to make the manager aware that quality control may be lacking and wound up speaking with the owner. Not only did he yell at me for calling to complain, but never apologized and actually hung up the phone on me. How can anyone eat at a restaurant where the owner cares so little about the quality of his food and nothing at all about the customer. I will never return again.
