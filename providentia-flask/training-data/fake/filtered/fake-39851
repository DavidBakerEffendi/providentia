Yummu Yum Yum! This is one of my favourite Thai restaurant. All kind of the noodles are so great. I love all of them. It's real Authentic Thai noodle in town. Pure is not only the most delicious Thai food in the city, but it has no MSG!!  For me, that is the purest of gem findings in nyc food categories.  I've dined in and have gotten delivery from this amazing tiny restaurant.  Be warned, it is small, so it's probably best if it's just 2 ppl, or else you'll be waiting at least 15-20 minutes for a bigger table during semi-rush hour
