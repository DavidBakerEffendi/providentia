Recently went to the Boil with my husband and friends.  Had the crawfish & shrimp bucket in cajun sauce... DELICIOUS!!!  SO FLAVORFUL!!!  The crawfish & cajun flavor was a 1st for me... luv luv luv.  The seafood was fresh & the prices were very reasonable.  Our waitress was friendly and very attentive making our visit an enjoyable one.  A casual, comfortable place to have a drink (did i mention, there's a full service bar) and yummy seafood  with friends or the family.  Would like to try some other dishes so will definitely go back soon.  That time can't come soon enough!
