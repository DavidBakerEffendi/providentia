We ordered from Mozz Boss and placed an order via phone at 11:00 and the delivery did not show up until 12:55. When the order was placed it was made very clear that our lunch hour was between 12:00 and 1:00. They said it would be there by 12:00. After calling several times after 12:00  we were given many different explanations as to why it wasn't there and naturally they gave us an attitude! After opening our food, the order was wrong. The soup was cold, which is  it  to be expected after the delivery being so late, olives were placed in a salad, which they were asked not to be placed in the salad ( due to an allergy) they forgot salad dressings and gave an eggplant parm sandwich when a fried eggplant sandwich with fresh mozz and balsamic was requested.  Another call was placed to them after the order was not correct. The person on the phone was extremely rude and did not offer to correct their mistake.  We were told to call back and speak to the owner.  We finally were able to speak with the owner, Rob, who could care less that we missed our lunch time due the delivery taking two hours and that the order was wrong.  He did not offer to give us our money back or fix his mistakes. We are frequent customers of Mozz Boss, which he was made aware of. After much fighting with him and receiving an attitude he said well what is that you would like me to do, I will get you guys next time.  At this point his attitude and lack of customer was disturbing and will never order from Mozz Boss again. -Former Frequent Customers
