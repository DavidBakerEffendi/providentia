As far as I can see Pacifico has mixed reviews. I am here to tell you I had great dink, dinner and service the night I went with my party. There were five of us total on a busy sat. night. I started off at the bar and had some of the best mojito's that I have ever tasted! Kudos to the bartender, I think his name was Al. Very friendly and chatted me up while I waited for my other guests to join me! When we were seated the hostess had a smile and took my jacket. Our server appeared a few moments later and once again there was a smile on her face as well (if you can't tell I have dealt with some unpleasant servers lately). She asked us what water we would prefer and Â explained the special drink for the evening, a few of my friends ordered it and she was right it was delish! Asd the time went on it got busy there and the staff didnt miss a beat. Our server came back and described the special making our mouths water. We oreder our entrees and the server asked if we would like a guacamole to start, boy am I glad we took her advice, they make it at the table and it was super! The server fluttered away and we were givin bread and a tomato spread by her helper. When the entrees came the presentation was lovely and everything was cooked just right. I orderd the shrimp and scallops on recomendation of our server and once again she was spot on! She checked back with us to make sure we were happy with everything and smiled the whole time:) I was very happy with my experiance at Pacifico and will be back very soon for sure. My friends had never been there and were most impressed as well. Keep up the good work!
