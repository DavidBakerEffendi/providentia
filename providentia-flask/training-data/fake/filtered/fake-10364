My girlfriend and I love this place and it's not  really the food that keeps us returning. FOOD- good, not great . (I am half german, so I know a few things about this type of cuisine) and I would have to say that the food ranges from good to average.. Not all items are fantastic  but overall its pretty good eats esp if you are real hungry as it all tends to be on the heavy side. The chicken paprika is one of the dishes I like alot.. BEER -  selection is awesome, always some nice selections on tap, STAFF- is very good, friendly and down to earth. AMBIANCE - The high ceilings, exposed brick and large windows make for a very comfortable and pleasant experience.. The  crowd is usually lively and interesting. We like sitting at the bar and eating,  but the tables are good too.
