Fabulous salads, fresh and crunchy. My daughter said "I usually don't like crunchy but this is the right kind of crunchy." We walked in just as they were closing and they stayed open just to serve us, and all the veggies were still super fresh. The service was a bit slow but I think that's because they had already packed everything away and had to rake it out especially fie us. The proprietors are super friendly and helpful and even though we didn't show them the Yelp offer, they gave us ice tea on the house.
