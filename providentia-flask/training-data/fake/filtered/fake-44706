LOVE Pietro's.  LOVE them.  I have eaten in and ordered from here many times and I was only disappointed a little once (with the fried Calamari) other than that... LOVE it.  They have awesome lasagna, meatballs, sandwiches... I have a VERY VERY picky Nonna who likes NOTHING that she eats out...ever....this is the only place where we order and she'll say "Now these people know what they are doing."  It's great.
