If you're going to charge $7 for a falafel wrap at what is essentially an outdoor food fair (Madison Square Eats), it better be fantastic. It wasn't. Fresh ingredients to be sure, but for fall-apart, surprisingly bland falafel balls with some greens and tahina sauce, $7 was just too much. For example, at a gorgeous, classy restaurant I was just at (Turkish Kitchen), I paid $7 for the falafel appetizer, which consisted of five beautifully large, filled-with-herbs falafel patties and tahina sauce, where I was served and sitting in a dimly lit, air conditioned establishment --- not eating in the hot sun standing by a metal pole in the middle of the street. Also the pressed chicken sandwich, sounding so yummy with it's description of "with garlic whip and vegetables", at $8, was a very bland letdown. Some cooked chicken with no flavor topped with a light mayo and some cucumber.
