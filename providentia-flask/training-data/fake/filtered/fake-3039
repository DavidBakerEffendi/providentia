After reading the reviews I almost didn't go, fearful of the service and concerns over the food. However, I'm glad I went and loved the place. While it might be mayhem on a weekend, simply go during the week for a lively night of excellent cuban food. The paella and enchilados (cuban shrimp) were both amazing. And yes, it is certainly BYOB. Monclair seems to be a hotbed of critical reviewers, I've no idea why. For some people nothing seems good enough, service or otherwise. As for the stories of people being thrown out or yelled at, perhaps sometimes the over preening get what they deserve.
