Went into NYC for the Christmas Holiday and was looking for a special place to have dinner Christmas Eve without costing us a fortune.  Researched Yelp and came across La Sirene.  The reviews were fantastic and I have to say so was this restaurant.  And to top it all off it was a BYOB, practically unheard of in NYC.  In fact, our lunch that day was more expensive than our dinner at La Sirene!   The restaurant is really cozy and the food was DELICIOUS!!!  We mostly went with the recommendations from our waitress.  Some of the outstanding dishes were the goat cheese tart, grilled octupus in a fabulous sauce, the filet with foi gras.  Really and truly everything was fantastic incuding dessert.  This is my new found secret place and I plan to go back there again and again!!!
