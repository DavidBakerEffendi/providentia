I love Houlihan's, but this location is very badly run. The last time I went there, I ordered a sangria which was unusually watery. Then, I found a hair in my fish tacos... gross! Someone else at my table found a hair in one of their entrees as well. The Houlihan's in New Brunswick is a trillion times better than this one, so I always go there instead.
