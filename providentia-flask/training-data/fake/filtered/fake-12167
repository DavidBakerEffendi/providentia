Oh, my god, this is the worst Japanese restaurant I had ever been to! 1. The wait time was one hour! It was a Friday night. Maybe that is excuseable. But one hour! Come on!! 2. The price was sky rocket high! We went for Sashimi but were charged for the price of a whole whale! $180 plus tips for 3 of us and we are still hungry! 3. No lemon in this "Japanese" restaurant. We asked for a piece of lemon and the waitress said they "don't carry lemon!" I swear to god this is not a real Japanese Restaurant!!
