Probably one of the best japanese meals I have ever had. Makes you feel like you have found a hidden jewel with it's basement location, and the decor is awesome. We had the white fish in vinegar marinade, teriyaki chicken meatballs, sake marinated deep fried chicken chunks, and one of the specials that night which was beef cooked over a hot stone with an amazing ponzu sauce. Absolutely wonderful! My only wish is that I lived in NYC so I could eat here more often.
