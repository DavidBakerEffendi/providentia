Awful food. The Worst food I ever ate besides Pietro's Pizzas in Hartford. The owner Dave Rice and his son Nathan are very rude to the customers and treat their employees like garbage. The prices are way over priced.The food and the service is the Worst that I ever experienced. The delivery took over three hours and when I called and spoke with the owners they said "hey Screw you, you will get your food when we deliver it to you.  I took one bite of the food and I vomited. If you ever need to vomit Pietro's Pizza and Sargent Pepperoni's are the two places to order and eat from.  They both have Horrible food and horrible service .Very  Bad delivery time and very bad delivery drivers.
