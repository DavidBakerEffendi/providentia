I cant say enough great things about Tenstone. I've been a customer since day one. Tenners easily has the best beer selection around. Marvin always picks the best flavors. I cant count how many times the bartenders have got me drunk. Tenstone is thee definition of local corner bar. There are plenty of trendy places around to have a craft beer, no one treats you like the staff at Tenstone. In addition, Tenstone is not a gourmet gastropub, its a corner bar. Treat it as such. The menu... Fantastic, burger, wings, filet cheese steak, fantastic. Dont come through expecting dill on your eggs or some bullshit french twist on the burger, sack up, drink like a man, shoot pool, play darts, or take your pansy suburban overly analytical palet to village whiskey they'll be happy to stroke you off.
