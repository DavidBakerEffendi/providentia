Over priced for small portions.  After waiting 25 min for my order I  had to ask the owner(who was dancing behind the counter) what the hold up was in order to get my food.  I got the Southwest Mac and cheese for $10.  Food was just okay,  but once I finished I found myself still hungry and wondering where did my $10 just go? You can get a side order of Mac and cheese the same size at any other restaurant for about $5. I could have gotten double the amount of food for $10 at a place like Cars,  and get it delivered. I was really rooting for this place to be great,  and they still might, but I doubt I'll go back anytime soon.
