I tried the other location when it was open, and was happily surprised to find out there was another one. This one was a bit of a drive for me but I had time today and went for it. This time, just as my trip to the other shop, did not disappoint.  I just cant explain how cool it is to see what they do with a waffle! I came at an off our between breakfast and lunch so my friend and I had a little of both. The waffle sandwich with egg and bacon was really very good. We also split a turkey sandwich which I thought was great for a turkey sandwich.  It was fresh and hearty enough without being overloaded like some cheap deli. The brioche was tasty and fresh as well.  Of course we finished with the stuffed sugar waffles with of course taking some to go as well. The coffee and fresh lemonade was delicious. This place should be everywhere. It's only a little more expensive than say a pizzeria, but it's like a specialty cafe and to me it seems worth it. I'd give this 5 stars but only if it was closer! PS I know everyone is different but I don't know where the neg reviews come from. This place is so unique you really can't compare it to anything else. Its certainly no common deli, or a cheap greasy spoon breakfast joint. Taste is one thing and we all have our own, but some people take this review thing a bit too seriously and come off to me as just frustrated wannabe food critics.
