I went in there for the second time the other night and ordered a burger and decided to add onion rings and a drink.   I thought the price was a little high $4 for the onion rings so I deleted them from my order.  The owner took my order and when it was completed he included the onion rings no charge.   This was the perfect thing to do and shows excellent customer service.   I was so pleasently surprised with what he did and wanted to write a review. The burgers are huge and delicious.   I found my self driving away screaming in my car that was so f....ing good.   Been a long time since I had a meal that I could remember days later.  The price for a burger is 6-8 bucks and has all kinds of choices but they are really a good size and one will fill you no problem.  This place blows away 5 guys and have told many of my friends to stop by. Thank you again to the owner for your kindness and the onion rings were incredible!!  I hope you do very well at your new place
