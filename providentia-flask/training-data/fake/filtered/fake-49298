This place is amazing! I absolutely love their food. It is consistently delicious. There is great vegitarian selection and they are very willing to customize and adapt orders to personal taste. Additionally, their bubble tea is wonderful. The tapioca is perfectly cooked and sweetened. And the tea tastes like tea not like artificial sweetener and milk like some places. My go to order: a mild vegitarian pork or tofu bah mi and a Thai ice tea with tapioca.
