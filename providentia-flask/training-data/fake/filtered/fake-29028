We were settling for the burger chain next door when we noticed Tender Lovin' Grill's Grand Opening sign. Happy to have another choice for lunch we gave it a try and were not disappointed. We ordered two of their salads, a burrito, potatoes and the Bosco chocolate soda. Everything was fresh and delicious. The owner stopped by to speak with us and said that the teens working the counter were his sons. They provided great service, even bringing an extra chair outside when they noticed there weren't enough for the three of us. Â We'll definitely be back to try some of their other items.
