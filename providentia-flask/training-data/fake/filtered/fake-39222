I don't get to eat out often with 2 young children at home - but when I do, I want to make it count. This restaurant bats 1000 every time. If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would! They have 2 sides to the restaurant - the less formal tavern side, very family friendly yet sophisticated, with a comfortable menu of classic favorites - burgers, steaks, sandwiches, salads, something for everyone. The Rockingham Dining room adds a touch of understated elegance with hand-selected decor from the owner's family home, just-right lighting and white tablecloths. The menu for the Rockingham Dining room is nothing short of melt-in-your-mouth creative cuisine - familiar staples with a unique preparation or interesting combination of flavors has made my dining an adventure every time. They have additional rooms available for group gatherings, so it's the perfect venue for business or family celebrations. I can't wait until my next opportunity to dine here again!
