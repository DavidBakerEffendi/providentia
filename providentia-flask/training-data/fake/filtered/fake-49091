I've had breakfast here plenty of times, and it's always been your typical diner fare... 3 star food and service. However, I went for dinner, and had a completely different experience. My order, which was straight off the menu, no substitutions, came out wrong twice. The server couldn't have been nicer, but the manager was incredibly rude and condescending. I don't think asking for my dish to be what was described on their own menu is asking too much. The cashier was incredibly rude as well, as if we were the ones who had done something wrong. There are plenty of other mediocre diners close by where I don't have to put up with such unacceptable customer service.
