Sally's Pizza will always stand as the worst restaurant experience in my life.  I just can't see any other place topping it.  For starters, we waited outside over 1 hour, all the while seeing large parties with so-called reservations go right in.  Once seated, with his back turned to us, the waiter leaned over and placed the menus on our table.  At this point, my Dad wanted to leave but my Mom was hungry and wanted to give the pizza a chance.  We ordered a pie with 4 toppings which by the way is the maximum toppings allowed..oh and mozarrella is extra.  Yes, it's not considered part of the regular pizza!  While waiting for the pizza, my Mom noticed that parties that were seated after us had already received their pies, multiple pies mind you.  We only ordered one pie!  After 1 hour of waiting for our pie and seeing others enjoy theirs, we got up and paid for the soda (begrudgingly) and left.  I can't tell you how the pizza tasted but I can tell you the experience left a severely foul taste in my mouth.  No pizza is worth being treated like crap! For those who say it is, go find some dignity.  FYI:  Pepe's Pizza is delicious and you don't wait as long (no reservation crap) and the staff at the very least treat you like a human being.
