Brought my sister here for her birthday and we had a delicious meal.  Service was spotty--we had to wait about 25 or 30 minutes for to even put in a drink order which was frustrating.  That said, once we did put our order in, our server was very accommodating--ensuring that more attention was paid to us and we weren't then rushed (but paid attention to!).  Had a cheese plate app and salad both of which were fabulous and had Salmon and Scallops and both were really good.  A bit pricey but tasty.  I would return.
