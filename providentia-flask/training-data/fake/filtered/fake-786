The tacos are fabulous and you cannot beat the price. The only disappointment was the service. I had to wipe the table myself. Then, a foul smelling man bothered me and my sister for the duration of our final taco. He was not a paying customer and should not have been allowed to stay. But the workers did nothing. He was annoying, and he tried to sell me a phone and other merchandise. He sat at our table and it ruined an otherwise enjoyable meal.
