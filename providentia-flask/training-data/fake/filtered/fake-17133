Been here twice since they opened. The first time was a disaster so we chalked it up to a new business being a new business. Second try confirmed that the place is a mess.   The server forgot to place our order, then offered us a drink as consolation but charged us for the beers. The server did not know anything about the beers on tap, which is the main focus of the place. The burger: tasty, juicy, everything a burger should be but a bit overcooked. The fries are terrible, they're too darn crunchy!  Fries are supposed to be the perfect mix of crunch and fleshy inside These are like potato stix?!? Oh lemme guess you make them in house?  Whatev! Chicken & Waffle: chicken was bone dry and the waffle tasteless and doughy.  Best in Brooklyn Ha!  Mr reviewer How are you related to the cook? Won't be back sorry ugly duckling, too many options in Bk
