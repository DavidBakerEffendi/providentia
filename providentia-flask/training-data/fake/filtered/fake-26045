My girlfriend and I ate here while staying in Hartford recently.  The beer selection is great.  I had the pork platter and was pretty impressed.  The ribs and pulled pork weren't spectacular, but the andouille sausage was amazing.  My girlfriend got the fried catfish and really enjoyed it.  Also, the fried okra and pickle chips are great.  Live music too.
