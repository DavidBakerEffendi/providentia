Greek Lady is really a staple in the West Philadelphia Area. The food is delicious and portions are large and there is always something for everyone to get. The atmosphere is also really great and the owners of the restaurant are welcoming. I have been to many events that have been hosted there and its a great place to dance, eat wonderful food and enjoy yourself.
