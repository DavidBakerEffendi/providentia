well, today was the second time that i came to this place. the first time i came was half year ago. it was ok at that time and people there was nice. However, i had a bad experience this time. the food, waters and everything were getting worst!!!  especially the waitress today, such a bad manner, it looked like we own her something! and food was not that good as ppl said.   overall, it doesnt worth waiting for sooooo long and dont expect too much.
