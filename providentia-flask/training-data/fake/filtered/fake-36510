I had dinner at Osteria Morini with a couple friends the other day and had a wonderful time. I don't really remember what we had exactly, but the meatballs and the tagliatelle ragu was excellent. However, the restaurant was a little crowded and my elbow was constantly bumping into the person sitting behind me.. Apart from that, we all had a good time during dinner and will definitely come back.
