I love Han Dynasty!  I've been there at least 10 times, and once for the tasting menu. For sure, go for the tasting menu.  It's an incredibly good deal.  Just remember, it's a marathon, not a sprint.  I stopped eating after the appetizers because I was too full! Favorites  are dan dan noodles (a must!), cold cucumbers, scallion pancakes, three cup chicken, chicken in chili oil, beef and tripe in chili oil, whole fish, wontons in chili oil, and beef with scallions.  Han is welcoming and so nice. I'll be moving to a new apartment three blocks from this place in Philly, so I'm sure I'll be here every day!
