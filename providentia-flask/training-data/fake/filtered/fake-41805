Not only does Santucci's  serve fresh, delicious food and the best pizza,  the family that owns the establishment is extremely kind and went out of their way to assist my daughter when she got a flat tire outside their store at closing time. They actually removed the flat tire for her and put the spare on as well!  We are extremely grateful for their willingness to help others in need. It is always good to know that there are people out there who will lend a helping hand to others.
