Went here for the lobster...food was good! Had twin 1 lb.lobsters and my husband had the 1 1/2 lb. It was cooked well and served with some nice sides. Better than buying, cooking and eating at home when you are craving some end of summer lobster. Service was nice, mellow. Room for improvement...no one acknowledges that you are leaving....thanks for coming would have been nice to hear from one of the several people standing near the door.
