I wanted to love Palma.  The garden is 5-star ambiance and the place feels like it should be great, but it didn't live up to my self-created hype. The food is excellent. For brunch, we got eggs benedict, the burrata and a salad and everything was perfectly cooked and served. We had the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake for dessert. Just get it. The the service was just as good. Our waiter was attentive without being overbearing. Palma...welcome to my small list of restaurants that kick some ass.  Simple. Honest. Good.
