What a dump lousy pizza and middle brother was totally rude ordered 3 pizzas and then saw the sign for 2 one topping pizzas for 24.99 middle brother said they had no obligation to tell me about the special even  though it was a take out only special.  they would not adjust the pizzas I ordered,  I then tried to order o fourth pizza and have him adjust my price he would not do this either.  After confronting him about how ridiculous he was being he just walked in the back  and if I,m not blind I truly think I saw him spit on one of my pizzas.  I,m still stunned with this situation but will be calling the states attorney generals office about not upholding advertised prices.  and of course will never return to  3 brothers again.  any one reading this do not go hear and warn family and friends.
