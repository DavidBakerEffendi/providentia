Just had it for dinner.  Went there at about 6 pm for fathers day. We ordered 2 suck ling pigs, a skirt steak with portugese sauce, steak w/ egg, and 1 goat. The suckling pig was terrible. Brought to table cold.  Clearly cooked earlier during the day.  They didn't even bother to try to heat it up.  Skirt steak was your standard sliced beef w/ brown sauce.  Too much salt in it.   Steak and egg was good.  And the goat  was.. like goat, and probably the best dish we ordered.   Basically, Don't order the suckling pig. It sucks here. Its not a whole pig. And obviously they cook it before hand and just leave it out for your order. And don't get your hopes up too high. There is a place in elizabeth nj that is better. caso de leitao.
