Wow...we just ate here today.  I t has to be SI's secret.  I don't live on SI but after the most beautiful walk through Snug Harbor we had dinner here.  The waitress was totally engaged...helpful w/choice.  My partner and  I chose the $19.95 special...she had the bean & rice bowl and me the spinach salad which we split ... we chose Nepoleon's Sword which was a kabab of chicken, steak and pork w/green peppers and red potatoes in a thin sauce...wow...so good.....dessert we had the creme brule which they light at the table.  Made to perfection. I'm not a big SI fan but it is worth coming to SI just eat here and a walk in the gardens of Snug Harbor would make a great day...or a visit to the Alice Austin house where you can walk on the grounds at the water's edge and it's only a few blocks down from here in Rosebank....I tried their New Orleans light beer...loved it ... everyone was friendly..we asked for coffee if it was made recently. She said she'd make a fresh pot.  Guess what.  She did!  No I did not try their fried ice cream.  Oh, nothing was spicy that we chose but I'm sure you can get a lot more spice w/other orders
