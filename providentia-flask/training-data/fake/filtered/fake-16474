Went on Valentine's Day. Food was okay but overpriced. Was NOT happy that they arbitrarily decided to not honor a Living Social voucher I purchased in December. NOTHING in the fine print excluding any days of week, etc - only restriction was that it couldn't be combined with another offer (and there was nothing "special" or "offer-like" about a date on the calendar - in this case, February 14). Made reservation about two weeks in advance (nothing about not being able to use voucher), showed up, sat down, show waitress the voucher and she says "Oh yeah we decided not to accept those vouchers today. There's a sign on the front desk." I looked and there was a tiny sign - which, in my opinion, is a terrible way to do business (esp when people make reservations in ADVANCE and are not told their vouchers won't be accepted). If there were exclusions/limitations, they should have been CLEARLY stated on the advertisement/promotion they sold and that many people purchased in good faith. At that point we felt stuck - every other restaurant in the area was super crowded and had no tables available. So we stayed and ended up paying for overpriced drinks and an "okay" dinner. However, I would have rather spent the $125 at a better place like Bricco Trattoria, Flemings, etc. Won't be returning to this place - they are dishonest and shady.
