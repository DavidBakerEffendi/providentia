So this is my second review of the place, and I have to say my impression stays the same. THis place is awesome! I read somewhere that the portions are small. That guy must be 7 feet tall and 400 pounds, because their portions are HUGE! And as far as being over priced, they are right in range of any other upscale restaurant in town. $180 for 6 people is nothing. If you can't afford to go out to eat, don't. People bash this place, I think, because they have no concept of Greek food. This place is more authentic than the other 2 Greek establishments in the area and the staff is way more accomodating. This time around We split a Mousaka, which is like a Greek Sheppard's Pie, a To Piato (mixed grill) that was cooked perfectly, a greek salad, and the prawns. You gotta try the prawns. And their homemade desserts are to die for.
