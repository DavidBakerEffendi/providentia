This place is amazing! I'm not gluten free but it doesn't really matter. Food is great, really authentic italian. A little super cute place, cozy atmosphere, friendly and helpful staff. The owner was there from Italy yesterday, introduced himself and told us a bit about their story. They grow their rice in Verona and it's the same rice you eat in the restaurant! I'll be definitely going back !!
