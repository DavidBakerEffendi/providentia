Went to dinner at Benito One for the first time this past Wednesday night with a group of 12.  The staff welcomed us as we trickled in and arranged the tables for us.  Service was immediate, professional and very welcoming.  Bread was brought out immediately and was plentiful and delicious. Drink orders taken and delivered right away. The waiter suggested a couple bottles of wine, both of which were very good.  The menu selection was exceptional.  My favorite dish is veal parmagean.  I travel quite a bit and look for places that serve this dish so I ordered it.  It was off the chart good as were the breaded clams I ordered as an appetizer.  If you love veal parm like I do, pounded out thin, nice seasoned breaded and pan fried just so the breading is almost crisp then served with plenty of bubbling slightly browned mozzarella so tender you can cut it with the side of your fork, this is the place.  My first time there.  I will go back next time I am in NYC.
