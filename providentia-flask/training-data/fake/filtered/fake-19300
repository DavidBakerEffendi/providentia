this is quite possibly my favorite place to eat and or just stop in for some drinks. i always have a good time. cant say i ever had a bad meal here. and i have tried numerous items of the menu. cant go wrong with $2 endless chips and salsa, and a normal hour happy hour as well as a late night happy hour from 10-midnight which is perfect for me since im usually out late. the servers are all super friendly and attentive, plus they have out door seating in the summer , if your looking Â for a chill spot to just eat and drink and not spend all your money then i highly recommend el camino
