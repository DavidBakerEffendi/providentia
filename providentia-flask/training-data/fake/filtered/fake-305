This is a great little local coffee shop that serves excellent coffee and doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for it. The atmosphere is great, with good music, cool art and folks enjoying their day together or clicking away on their laptops. They also have a wide array of baked goods (some of which are vegan) and everything I've sampled has been delicious. I love to stop here and enjoy coffee and a cookie when I'm trying to get some work done and just want to get out of the house.
