Our party of four had a great meal. The menu was a pre fix, which I was a bit surprised by, but totally enjoyed.  Music and decor were excellent, and all the food came out perfectly seasoned and delicious.  Only minor issue we had was the club music next door seemed a  bit loud, but it was 10:00 on a Friday. Definitely reccommend
