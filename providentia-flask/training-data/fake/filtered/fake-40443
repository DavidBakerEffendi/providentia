Like it's sister restaurant Joya, Song is utterly fantastic. Prices are the lowest in the slope for Thai (and just about any cuisine), the food is unreal, the portions are intense, and the atmosphere is killer (DJ spinning eclectic 80's, etc). I went on a Friday night at 8:30 with 4 other people - we were seated in about 25 mins, which is the perfect amount to get a drink or two at the bar (which serves HUGE glasses of wine). Try the green curry & always order what's on special. Â I have been living the the slope for a while now, and not only is Song the best Thai restaurant, it maybe my favorite overall (for now....). They have free delivery, but watch out, they don't take credit cards!
