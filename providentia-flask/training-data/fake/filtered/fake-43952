I didn't know rude was on the menu!!! I understand that they are under new management but this is no excuse. When i called to place a order for pick up... I got a very rude greeting followed by the most unprofessional response to me ordering something they do not offer anymore. Cursing was involved (not directly to me but about the fact she has to look up the item and that they don't offer it). I can only assume they changed their menu yet again... because this was from a menu after the new owners. This was such an unpleasant experience we went somewhere else for lunch. This is a shame because the food was really good but after this experience I will not be going back.
