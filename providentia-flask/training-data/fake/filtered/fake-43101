Friendly, family-run place. The owner is a trained chef and it shows. Even though it is a low-budget place that caters to American tastes, Â the food is safe (the most important thing!) and delicious, the portions are generous, and the meat is from whatever animal the menu says it's from. None of these are consistently true of other take-out Chinese restaurants in the immediate vicinity.
