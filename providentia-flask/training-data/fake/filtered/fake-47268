The first time we ate here on a Friday, we came back on Sunday because we could not stop thinking about the menu! All the pasta is homemade and outstanding and if that werent enough, the daily specials are always fantastic! Â I am recommending this restaraunt to everyone I know and have not disappointed anyone!
