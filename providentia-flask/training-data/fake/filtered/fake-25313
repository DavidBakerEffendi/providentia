This sandwich shop is the best in town!! First off, the owners are so friendly it's a pleasure to eat at Union Jack's. They always have a smile on their faces and are wonderful to interact with. The food......it's phenomenal!!!! All their food is made in-house. They bake their own bread, slice their own deli meat in front of you, they even hand chop their own romaine lettuce!! Believe me, it makes a difference!!! The only problem is, their food is so good, it's hard to choose what to get!!! I work on Shelburne road and try to eat here once a week. Chicken Cheddar Bacon melt is to DIE FOR. Just with no onions... ; ) EVERYONE SHOULD EAT HERE!!!! AMAZING PLACE!!!
