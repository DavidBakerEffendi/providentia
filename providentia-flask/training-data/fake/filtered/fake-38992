Based on other reviews I'd read my sister and I decided to try this place out.  We got right in around 9pm and were quickly served drinks and our app order taken.  I had the flat buns and my sister the polenta...sooooo good!  I'm not usually a proscut fan but this was like comfort food.  We both had a ravioli dish and ended the meal with the hazelnut gelato.  For apps, drinks, meal and dessert we felt it was reasonably priced.  Would definitely recommend.  We got a good night and a wave from the entire staff as we left....
