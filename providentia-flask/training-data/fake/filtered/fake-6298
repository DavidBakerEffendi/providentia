This is a great little restaurant. Probably the best vietnamese sandwich I've had..just delicious! I was visiitng from California, and I've had a lot A LOT of sandwiches (Lees, Coffee Lovers, etc) and this is better. Good pricing, and the mood is great with all the pictures on the wall that the owner took himself. The green papaya salad also tastes great; it's so refreshing! If you're in the area, stop by!
