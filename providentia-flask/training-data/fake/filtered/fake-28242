Lovely, casual, neighborhood-feel that transports you to its Belgian roots with a greeting in French at the door.  Clean, good food with Frites that are out of this world in plentiful supply. Mussels in many style are at the core of the menu but there are many lovely choices. We came in with a reservation for a large party and would have preferred that our tables were available and not wait.  The service was a little slow.   BUT The food was so good and the choices of beer and wine so lovely, that we forgot about the rest of it and we are coming back with another party in a month!
