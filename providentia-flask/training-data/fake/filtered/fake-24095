So excited to find a healthy option at a rest stop!  Good To Go Organics was such a welcome surprise - I wish they were in more locations. The food was delicious and the staff was informed and friendly.  The menu has tons of options - all healthy and food you can feel good about eating. I would highly recommend Good To Go!
