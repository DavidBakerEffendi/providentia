My Family and I have been coming and ordering out from Brazilian Spices for a little over 2 years and I must say that from the past 9-10 months the restaurant, the food, the staff members, the services have improved over 200%, not to mentioned that the food has improved and I would not drive to other towns that have the same type of food. We are always treated very well,the owner is always greeting customers with a smile and takes the time to come around and speak with us whenever we eat in. There has been times that they have even changed the TV channel to a Cartoon or Disney channel so that our kinds (5 and 8 years) could feel more comfortable. The delivery time is good given the time we order for delivery (rush hour) and when school is out, so I can give a 5 star to the delivery as well (the drivers are also very nice, we live on a 3rd floor apartment complex and they actually come up when we buzz them in to our door, other places the drivers makes us go down to get and sometimes its hard when you have kids.) Give it a try..I am sure you will enjoy every bite.
