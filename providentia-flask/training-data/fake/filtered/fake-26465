I actually have visited Tico's and I really like the place.  very clean and friendly. The burritos and quesadillas are off the hook. Also about the smoothies, I actually asked one of the guys if they used real fruit and they said yes except for the guava and passionfruit....which they use the pulp.  If they used the real thing...the smoothie wouldn't be affordable.  All the other fruit is on display for their juice bar.  So for me...Tico's is great food and drinks and it is the most reasonably priced place in Princeton...go check it out.
