Great drinks from a true pro. Loved his Mescal drinks and had good knowledge of wine. After drinks we went to our table. Wow what a nicely decorated place. Very romantic, great style, unique, cozy. A bit small and cramped but hey, it's NY and it wasn't too cozy. Waiter was all pro, very knowledgeable and helpful. Food was amazing. Chef owner really knows his stuff. If you like true Spanish food, this is your place. If you like great drinks, this is your place. If you expect great service, this is your place.
