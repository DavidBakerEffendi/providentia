A couple of nights ago I went to Est Est Pizza and ordered a small pizza, some wings and a snapple. The pizza was very well made, the sauce was very rich and tasted amazing. The wings were very tender, cooked to perfection and not greasy at all. I think this is one of the best restaurants in New Haven and I will deffinetly be coming Â back soon!
