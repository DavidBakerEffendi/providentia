Meal was great!  Good ambiance, delicious food, and wonderful service.  Got the shrimp cocktail and artichoke and spinach dip to start.  Artichoke dip was to die for.  For main course I got the shrimp risotto and my fiancé got the filet.  Risotto was great with nice fresh tasting shrimp and the right amount of truffle butter.  Fiancé enjoyed his steak.  We were too stuffed for dessert but they had a nice selection.  Will go back for the flourless chocolate cake.  The owner was very gracious and came around several times to check in and chat with us.  Plenty of parking.  Will definitely go back soon!
