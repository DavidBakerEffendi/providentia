We were staying down the street from Alice's this past weekend and decided to walk over for dinner. Though there was a bit of a wait, the owner of this new establishment was very kind. She runs the restaurant up front while her husband does the cooking in the back. The restaurant was well decorated and had a small bar where we had a glass of wine while we waited. The food was excellent along with the sourdough bread that was served before the meal. Â All in all, a wonderful restaurant with just the right small town feel.
