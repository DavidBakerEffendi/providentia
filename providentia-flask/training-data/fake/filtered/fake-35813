So with turning one i have been trying to find a nice mellow spanish cultured bar in which i can really unwhind after work and it wasnt untill i walked into lucha cartel tht i had found what i was looking for . The staff was all friendly and the food was amazing ! Prices were also very fair and i was lucky enough to stop in for salsa tuesdays in which they give free salsa lessons . It was a great experience and i will definetly be returning to this bar :) also might i add that the decor was to die for !
