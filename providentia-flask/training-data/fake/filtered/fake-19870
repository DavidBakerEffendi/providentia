Having real southern cajun-creole food in New York is amazing! Traveling here from New Orleans to eat this wonderful food creates for me the cultural memory of growing up and living there.  All of the Louisiana folks that I have met on my two visits, have found the missing relationship with the types of food they really miss! People linger in this comfortable atmosphere. New Yorkers are discovering this cusine for many for the first time in their lives.  Whether or not you really get cajun-creole food is not the point. People go out to eat because they are hungry. When the heat hit New York this weekend, people wanted the comfort food that Sugar Freak  offers. Congratulations to the owners and to the Chef Airis, thank you for sharing a taste of southern living to New York Bon Appetit!
