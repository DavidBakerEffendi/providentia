I eat here pretty often as I work about 3 minutes from it. For the price I find the value outstanding. There's plenty of variety and I haven't had anything that was stale or out too long. One portion of their selection is not what it says, but that happens at almost every buffet with some of the items being obviously something different. Their hibachi is pretty great in my opinion also.
