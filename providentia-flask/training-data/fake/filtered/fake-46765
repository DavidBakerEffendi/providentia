Went here on a Thursday night with my wife and had a very good experience, and will definitely be back. I had the Snapper Marichaira, and my wife had the Filet. Both were excellent, and the snapper came with a healthy side of pasta. The snapper alone is a reason to come back as is the stuffed artichoke. The staff, including the visible owner, were all very friendly and you tell they have a good-sized following of regulars. This place is a perfect neighborhood restaurant with high-quality food. We will definitely be back.
