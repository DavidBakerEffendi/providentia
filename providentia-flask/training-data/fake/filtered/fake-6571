Recently went to dinner for a friends birthday. There were seven of us and we unfortunaley made the mistake of ordering off the tasting menu and the dinner menu. Although we knew the timing would be off it never occured to us we would not eat for two hours. When the food finally did arrive it did warrent the wait. The halibut was overdone, we had to ask for bread, and the scallop dish was unexpectedly raw. The polenta sticks were amazing and the desserts were adequate. The waiter was friendly, knowledgeable about sports but unable to anticipate our needs such as silverwear, water, olive oil etc. I would not go back nor would I Â reccomend. By the way they taxed us on the gratuity.
