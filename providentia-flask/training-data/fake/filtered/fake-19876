Came across this place on Why Leave Astoria, and since my boyfriend is a big fan of Cajun food, we went their second night open. The atmosphere is great - very comfy, warm and inviting. The staff is really sweet, and nicely attentive. We decided to share a few things to get a taste of what they had to offer, so we ordered the fried catfish, jambalaya, mac & cheese, and collard greens. Everything was cooked really well, and though my boyfriend and I are not big fish eaters, we enjoyed the catfish. The mac & cheese is divinely yummy, especially with the bread crumbs on top. My only complaint is that the jambalaya portion is super small considering it's $12 - it feels more like a side dish rather than a main entree. To round things out we had the chess pie, which was delicious! I could have eaten two of them! Overall it was a great experience, and like another reviewer stated, this place is a welcome change from the European fare on every corner of this part of Astoria. Sugarfreak belongs on 31st Ave in my opinion, but that's neither here, nor there :) We will definitely be back - I can't wait to try the friend chicken!!
