I had a late lunch with a friend the other day and I loved it. For New York, and Chelsea in particular, the pricing was decent and the portions were more than satisfactory. There are no reservations needed for lunch. The staff seated me and despite my friend getting lost and turning up 40 minutes later they never pressured me to order anything or bothered me much at all. I just had one drink while I waited. The staff was very friendly which is something I find is missing at a lot of places in NYC these days. You never felt ignored but you never felt smothered either. The only real downside to the place was it was a tad loud but it didn't interfere with having a conversation at normal volume at your table. Overall the place was nicely decorated and with the open doors and outdoor seating it was very light. Now, onto the food. I heard the mac and cheese was unmissable and when I realized they had three kinds (Chedder and Fontina, Smoked Gouda and Bacon and Truffle Oil) I was excited to see they had the "Mac Attack!" which was a sample of all three. There was enough to share for the two of us but I could have eaten it all myself it was so good. If you only pick one I recommend the Truffle Oil. After this I had the Watermelon Salad and my friend had the Shaved Artichoke Salad. Even though they were not an "Entree Salad" they were more than happy to size them up for an entree. They also added chicken breast to my friends with no problem and only a very small additional cost. For dessert we split the Deep Fried Oreos and Peanut Butter Cheesecake Pops. Both were great and again in fairly large portions yet not too filling. The end cost for two of us ordering an appetizer, two salads sized up to entrees and two desserts came to a little under 100 bucks. Depending on what you order I would say it's great for a quick lunch out or taking someone special someWHERE special. Will definitely go again.
