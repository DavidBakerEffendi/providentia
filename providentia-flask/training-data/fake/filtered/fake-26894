Don't know much about the food cause we never got a chance to eat there. Walked in around 6:45-7 pm. Granted it was a Saturday night, but there were a LOT of open tables. We walked in and Maitre'd was more interested in looking at her phone rather than looking up. Next we asked for a table of two, and remember the place had a lot of tables open, and her reply was "Ummm do you have a reservation?" My gf and I looked at each other than said "no" and we were told we would have to wait 20-25 mins. We thanked her for her time and walked out. Got to admit I wanted to try place out and was disappointed. Ohhh well...another restaurant got our business that evening.
