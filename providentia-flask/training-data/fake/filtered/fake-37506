I stopped in aroun 8:00 to get a glass of wine. Despite the numerous seats at the bar, I was told I could not sit there because I wasn't eating.... okay, but then I had to stand in the cramped aisle (there were seats but then I would be sitting in the aisle and have to get up, move my seat, move mysef, move the seat back and sit back down every time someone walked by). I ordered a glass of merlot and I have to say it was some of the worst tasting merlot I have had- I didn't finish it, mostly because the place was that cramped, I kept getting bumped into and the wine that poor. I think they need to redesign their area to accomodate those who go into a wine bar for wine, I mean really, a wine bar and you can't sit at the bar to have a glass of wine? I must have tipped enough (see other complaints on the rude wait staff) since no one complained to me about that.
