Ordered standard fare- chicken & broccoli and shrimp & broccoli. The chicken itself was flavored very nicely but the shrimp was awful, there was almost no gravy to speak of, very little salt in anything outside the chicken, and the egg roll's taste was not good, not even recognizable as an egg roll. The rice options with a combo are only plain fried rice or white rice, i.e. no pork fried rice. This is not worth the distance/wait for where most Yale students live or anyone downtown. Thoroughly disappointed. I've lived in the tri-state area all my life- this is not the Chinese food I'm used to.
