Good, but not as good as I had hoped. The welcome was warm, service attentive, the wines excellent and the food good, but not better than many other restaurants/bistros in Soho. My steak tartare in particular was rather bland and uninteresting. I hope Balthazar will invest in some new cutlery - what was provided was not very excited and detracted from otherwise smart table settings.
