I went to Maialino 2 weeks ago for dinner on Friday evening.  I had a couple of  'tapas-appetizers' (prosciutto di Parma and Parmigiano Reggiano).  The portion was too small and overpriced.  The quality was very good, not exceptional.   Then, I had spaghetti alle vongole. It was perfect.   I also tried the pasta with meat sauce. Very tasty, maybe a little too much... in overall a good dish Desert: I tried a couple, simply awesome! I want to go back to try more dishes.  I will write an update For now I give 4 stars
