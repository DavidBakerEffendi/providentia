In my opinion, this is the best lunch spot in downtown Trenton.  The staff is uber-friendly and very efficient (impressive since it gets pretty crowded around lunchtime).  I've tried a variety of menu items and have been pleased with all of them.  My favorite thus far is the breakfast wrap (breakfast items served all day!).  Be sure to check out the specials board.  You don't be disappointed.  The homemade mac and cheese is creamy and has a slight peppery kick that is to die for.
