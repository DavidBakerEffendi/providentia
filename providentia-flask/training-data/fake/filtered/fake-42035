The first time i was introduced to Empanadas Cafe my cousin brought a bag to work for everyone to try.  They were great.  I quickly took a drive by to the store to see what else they had.   i love the corn and whole grain Empanadas.  They are to many to mention as which one is my favorite.  Only negative is that they are small but I just order more and sample a little of everything.
