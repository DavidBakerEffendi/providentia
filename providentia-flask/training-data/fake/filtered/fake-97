I'm sorry, I just don't get the hype. My friend visited Philly in 2007... she had one of the "famous steaks" (I shared some of her awful, soggy fries) and she got food poisoning right after that. The steak was barely cooked, and lukewarm. And they weren't even busy. I'm not into the completely unfriendly staff, either... if you are new to the area and don't know EXACTLY how to order a cheesesteak, you're screwed. Just not into it. Great-looking place, no doubt.... but no thanks. Genos gives me a great reason to become vegan, as I've been trying to do for months.
