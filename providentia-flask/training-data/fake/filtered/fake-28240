I'm shocked to see the four stars here. For anyone who's ever eaten in Belgium, there's a big difference in the food quality. The French onion soup was just a bowl of cream without onion or real taste. The dame Blanche ordered looked and tasted nothing like a real one. The chocolate sauce didn't have real chocolate and when we explained about what a real dame Blanche was about (as friendly as possible) the waitress replied: "Do I look like the cook? I'm not the cook!" It was a feedback, and I hope it will somehow come through. Food was really not good, esp. For that price (60 usd per person).
