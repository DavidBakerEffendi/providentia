Jim Cosgrove runs a great establishment and that's why everyone knows his name. The food is fantastic and my favorite is the chicken gnocchi. Cheesy garlic bread is a must order every time. Easily my favorite restaurant. I went to Jim's former restaurant for many years and followed him to Salute. I know many other people did as well and I think that says a lot. Food is great, decor and ambiance is perfect, and the service is top notch. This is the place to be on a Friday or Saturday night (or any time). If you've never tried it you must and be sure to make reservations.
