ABC Kitchen is one of our favorite restaurants in NYC.  The dining room is made from salvaged materials--and it was done so with quite as much visual and gastronomic panache.  Just Beautiful.  The menu is a sprawling collection of small and large shareable plates--but unlike so many, it features reasonable pricing and dishes that all seem to work well together.  We ordered Bow-tie pasta with kasha and veal meatballs, raw Maine shrimp, clam pizza, arctic char with Romanesco, ice cream cake and everything was divine. It exceeded all that has been said - delicious food, great design, attentive and very knowledgeable service, great atmosphere.
