First started coming to Mediterranea a few years back as a nice place for a group of friends to catch up and enjoy some hookah, but it soon turned to be a regular spot. Every time I bring a different friend to this place, they always wanna go back. The atmosphere of the place alone sets it apart from any other hookah/middle eastern restaurant I've been to. It can get dark and cozy inside, to alive, and sometimes packed outside on the patio. The staff is super friendly, including the owner himself, who likes to interact and engage in conversation (something to definitely appreciate). He's also known to create custom hookah flavors and even hosts Hookah Tasting Nights where you can try new upcoming flavors and meet new people. We went to one a few months ago and it was a really fun night. The crowd that comes to Mediterranea can be very diverse and makes it a very social place. I've met some cool people just by sitting one table over. The food is great and authentic. We usually get a bunch of appetizers (the falafel tastes like the ones id get from Lebanon) but sometimes well get an entree (the swordfish kabobs are amazing!). They also have a kids menu that offers boneless wings and fries and lastly, the hookahs. They offer traditional flavors and have a menu for delicious specialty hookah flavors that changes often, which makes you want to come back and try something new! Overall, its the perfect place to hang out with friends, even bring a date, enjoy some great food, hookah, some wine (BYOB). The pricing is pretty reasonable compared to other places, and if you go with a group, even better.
