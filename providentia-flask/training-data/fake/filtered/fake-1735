I really think it's the sauce.  They put crack in it or something, it's soooooooooooooooo good.  I could taste the clean tomato flavor and fresh basil really takes it to the next step.  Simplicity at it's best this is a double stopper for me on my trips to NYC, even if it's just to pick up a pie and sit on the curb catching up with my friends if the waits too long.
