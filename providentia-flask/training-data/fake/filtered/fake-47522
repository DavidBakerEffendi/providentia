Food tasted freshly made but.... We went there as part of a way to see Brooklyn as we wanted to have the NY pizza experience.  It was the Sunday night on memorial weekend.  We waited over 90 minutes in line.  I give this place 2 stars because it's overrated.  Pizza was a little burned especially the crust.  They also ran out of ice, so I had warm soda.  Like others have said on previous reviews, it is a tourist trap!
