A real find in the restaurant wasteland that is Midtown West., OCabanon is a place you'd walk right past if you weren't looking. We were greeted by a French accented man and that set this transportive moment straight to Paris. The food was delicious and the wine list is impressive and OH, THE BREAD. Delicious coffee too. I real find for lunch...I plan to go back for dinner. The decor is modest but homey. I love OCabanon. Jo NYC
