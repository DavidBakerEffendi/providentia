Gosh I hate it when local (cheap) restaurants get blown up by the NYT or Zagats and Patsy's and the Red hook ballfields are prime examples. Lines of hipsters and out of towners mucking up a symbiosis well achieved for many many years.  Anyway, I heard enough of Lucali's and called up an order and was told to pick it up in a hour (strike one), I get there and am told my order would be another 15-20 minutes (strike two), and see there prices have now gone up since the recent press (strike...two and half).  I got pie home and took a bite and I am a huge fan, the wait the price the lines all those bad memories went away with each crisp crust bite, with splashes of charcoal markings, fresh ingredients, basil, olives yum, and I do not even really like olives. They got me. Damn them! It really is that freakin' good.
