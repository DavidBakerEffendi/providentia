Animal cruelty. Animal cruelty. Animal cruelty.   DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!! They leave their dog outside, year-round.  Aside from being outside for hours-long stretches, and often times overnight - the dog barks until its bark changes into a howl.   The owner of this place should be thrown in jail.  His liquor license should be revoked.  That's the next call I'll be making. PLEASE GO ELSEWHERE FOR YOUR VIEW.  DO NOT PATRONIZE THIS ESTABLISHMENT!!!!!
