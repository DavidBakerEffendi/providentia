Terrible food! Definitely disappointing considering the great location. Outdoor seating is nice and the inside is cute, video games are fun but the food is really nasty. You can tell they haven't cleaned the grease out of the fryers in ages one bite in. Even my father who would eat anything spat out a bite of my sandwich. If you're going for drinks, you should be okay but don't get anything on draft!
