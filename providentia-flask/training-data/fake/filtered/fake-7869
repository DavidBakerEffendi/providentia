My boyfriend and I ate at Sandra's a couple weeks ago and we absolutely loved it! First of all the peach, mint iced tea was fabulous. My boyfriend ordered the cajun fried chicken with mac and cheese and corn and I ordered the meat loaf with mashed potatoes and candied yams. Everything we consumed was delicious! Â The waitress we had was also a sweetheart and very attentive. Overall, I was impressed with everything. It is so nice to encounter a place that serves real food in a comfortable atmosphere. I'd recommend it to anyone.
