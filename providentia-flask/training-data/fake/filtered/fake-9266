I drank Prosecco (whiskey later).  Ate the 'Mista'  salad and 'Neapolitana' (sp?) pizza.  For New Years eve with my friends.  Then I was comped, cause my roommate is a cook there, to go downstairs for the disco!!  Nina Simone was there. Each element was fierce.  Truly fine. The pizza,  Naples style,  was IT.   This is modern NYC living.  Don't miss it. Marcel
