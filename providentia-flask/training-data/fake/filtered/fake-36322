I came to New York from California to check out the restaurants owned by various food network chefs I had come to respect, Scott Conant being one. So I made reservations for a Saturday night at 10pm for myself and 2 other friends to come and dine at Scarpetta. We arrived on time but had to wait in the bar over a half-hour to get a table. By the time we were seated it was past 10:30pm. Due to the lateness of the hour and one friend who felt it would be bad for her to eat so late in the night, due to a digestive disorder, we opted to just have dessert and drinks. After we requested dessert menus from our waitress the maitre de came to our table to inform us we must either order dinner or sit in the bar. At this point there were very few patrons awaiting tables, none-the-less we were embarrassingly bumped from our dining table and relocated at a rather ill-positioned table by the stairs in the bar. I will not return to Scarpetta due to what my friends and I can only say was arrogant and snobbish treatment. I do not care how great your food is nor how famous your owner is, your patrons are your MOST important asset!! Treat them like you know that and they will return.
