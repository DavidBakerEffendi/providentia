This is by far one of my favorite places in NYC. I've been a few times with a friend and we usually go on a weekend when it's packed. I recently took some out of town friends visiting from Florida and they raved about it as well. I haven't had anything so far that was bad. Tip- the Yuca Sunrise cocktail is super yummy. Frozen margarita and sangria. Nice combination.
