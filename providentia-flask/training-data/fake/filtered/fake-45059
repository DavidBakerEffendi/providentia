WHAT HAPPENED HERE!! I went to Cranbury Pizza about 2 weeks ago and had pizza. It was wonderful! I came in today and it was the worst pizza I had ever had. I would rather go to Papa Johns.. I had a simple LG plain, and it was burnt, cheese was all over( the little amount the pizza man put on it) and the tast of the pizza was just bad.
