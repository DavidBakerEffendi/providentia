I was in Chelsea for a meeting today. Walking up 6th Ave. I passed The Hummus and Pita Co. With a line full of people, I stopped in for lunch to see what it was all about. The place is really nice inside, you can tell they just opened up. The first thing you see when you walk in is the oven where they make homemade pitas and laffa. I started with taboon chicken which is cooked in their own taboon oven. After having a samole of the laffa, which is like a flat bread, I went with that. I filled it with Israeli salad and topped it off with chimichurri sauce. Side of hand cut sweet potato fries please!  I grabbed a table and dug in. The chicken was tender and very tasty, combined with the salad my first laffa experience was a good one. The fries were nice and hot, seasoned perfectly. I am very impressed, this place is going to be a staple in the NYC restaurant scene for years to come. I wish there was a Pita Co. near my place. For about $15, I got a great meal with a side and a drink which is great for the city.  The dining area has plenty of room. The staff was friendly. The place was clean. Next time I am in Chelsea, I will def stop in to try some more items on the menu! I recommend this place to anyone looking for a fresh healthy meal on the go in NYC.
