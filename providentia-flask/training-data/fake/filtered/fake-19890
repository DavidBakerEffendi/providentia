Been coming here for the past 9 years. Always get the "mixed with everything" (chicken/lamb/rice/lettuce). Extra white sauce! Gotta be careful with the hot sauce, cause it's REALLY spicy. I remember when a platter was just $5, but the price increase never really bothered me. The only thing that DID bother me is when they stopped including tomatoes with the lettuce. That was YEARS ago, but tomatoes compliment that dish well. Still though, this is great stuff, and I sometimes order 2, so I can have one for lunch the next day. FAT!
