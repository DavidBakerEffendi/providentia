The food was good but the prices are ridiculous!!!! I came just for dinner, and was charged a $10 cover charge to come into the restaurant for an event that taken place downstairs, and I had dinner upstairs. 1-THE EVENT NEVER HAPPENED 2-I TOLD THE LADY I JUST CAME FOR DINNER, AND SHE TOLD ME I WAS PAYING FOR THE DJ. I don't appreciate ordering from a menu that doesn't have prices, and being surprised with a $45-50 bill, and my partner and I just ordered 2cups of ginger ale,  2 chicken wings meals that came with, fries and coleslaw.  I get more for my money at Buffalo Wild Wings ( you receive a bigger portion of chicken wings plus fries and drinks(free refills) all for for $25). They do not have a liquor license so the B.Y.O.B is implemented, and the waitress (WITHOUT TELLING ME) charged me $3.00 on my bill for a small plastic cup with ice. The waitress with the POM POM ponytails needs to be retrained, she acts as if she's doing us a favor rather than being happy to serve the customer. IF THIS IS THE ONLY RESTAURANT OPEN IN THE LATE NIGHT HOURS, I RATHER STARVE THAN BE ROBBED BY THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!
