Wonderful Gaia! Fine real italian ingredients go to fill fabulous "ciaccina" freshly baked every morning, as Gaia herself told us; the result is her really very nice panini. Also to be told the italian ham and salami appetizer to be shared (I don't remember the name), the quality is very good, and a special note for the pesto, really tasteful and fresh. We tried meatballs in mozzarella sauce too... great! Gaia and all of the staff have been very nice with us. Next trip to NYC we'll surely be back.
