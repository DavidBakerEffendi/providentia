Cheaper than cheap and delicious. I've had the pork and chive dumplings (fried and steamed) and the sesame pancake stuffed with beef. I love watching them make the giant sesame pancakes, which are eventually cut into triangles for your culinary pleasure. You have to be a bit aggressive to get up to the counter, and make sure to monitor your food being brought up to the counter, or it will be snatched. I've seen people walk up, put a couple dollars down, and take whatever was on the counter (despite yells!).
