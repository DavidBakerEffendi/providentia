It's a sad day when your kid (who adores your cooking) tells you that *this* is "the best grilled cheese I've ever had." What's worse? When you can't be mad because he's RIGHT! Being a bit of a food truck 'foodie' myself, I can't tell you how great these guys are. In fact, I will often check their Facebook page to see if I can be wooed away from whatever I brought with me for lunch...just because I can. The bread is crispy and delicious (and appropriately buttery), and whatever the filling, the result is nearly always delicious. The guys running the truck are nice, the service and quick and the sandwiches - YUMMY! If you're in the area, find them on Twitter or Facebook to see where they're parked that day and GO!
