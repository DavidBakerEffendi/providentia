I love this place.  The food is inventive and delicious.  i would never order chicken in a restaurant, but here, it is incredible.  Double for the cauliflower and the fried olives.  i don't love eggplant but even this girl enjoyed the bruschetta.  Wine list is unique in that all wines are at minimum organic.  Well thought out across the board.  happy to return time and time again.
