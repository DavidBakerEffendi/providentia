For the price, this place can't be beat. Their $1 fried dumplings is really tasty. I don't recommend the boiled version, or their vegetable dumplings. The veggie dumplings in soup was especially nasty - they were a bit heavy with the white pepper. The pancakes are also another hidden treasure. They're best fresh out of the pot, with vegetables. The beef with veggie pancakes is good too. And plain, it's a dirt cheap 50c for an extremely filling, tasty fried dough. Their soybean milk drink is pretty thin. I wouldn't pay 50c for it, let alone a dollar. This place is SMALL. There's barely room for anyone to sit.
