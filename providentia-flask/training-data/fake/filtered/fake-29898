have been going here for many years, but since they changed chefs a year or so ago it was never the same.  boring menu and no taste food. decided to give it another chance last night and very dissappointed.  not a special experience as i used to feel.  waitress acted like she was on speed pills or something, no focus not attentive.  food was bland, had to add a lot of s +p,  fennel salad was horrible.  i have to say the filet mignon was delicious, that's the only thing that made the trip even worth it.  way over priced for what they have to offer.  unfortunately will not go there again.  i think it is now more of a bar scene....
