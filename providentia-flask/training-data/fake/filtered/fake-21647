It was all awesome . Been here Thursday night with group of fifteen.. Booked early so we got nice sitting arraignment. And the "best Indian food we've ever had " Fresh, flavorful, and well presented, Decent service, Harsh   is amazing waiter and the lady behind the counter was very helpful  . I will definitely go back with more groups..
