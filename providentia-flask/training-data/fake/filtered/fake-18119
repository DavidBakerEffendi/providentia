Outstanding food, service, wine list, ambiance, everything was wonderful. Our server Maggie was impeccable. Shrimp and lamb are cooked perfectly, don't forget to ask for the homemade hummus and pita before your meal. Theater menu allows appetizer, entree, dessert for about $30. Appropriate portions, left very satisfied.
