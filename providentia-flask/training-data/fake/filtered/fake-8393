Lets start by saying that I love barbecue, and more importantly I love pork.  I have spent a week in Spain where I lived exclusively on swine.  I have eaten barbecue in Texas and Tennessee, Syracuse and North Carolina.  I have created whole social events around seeking out and devouring barbecue.  So this isn't my first rodeo. The build up was intense: this pork was equated to a religious experience and delicious enough to create a black market around its resale.  Bottom line: it had a lot to live up to.  . Initially worried I hoped that having the pork leftover may have even add to the explosive flavor.  I reconstructed a sandwich on a fluffy brioche roll; carefully layering and stacking the pickles, tender meat and peppers.  I poured a cold glass of chocolate milk.  And I began... Fast forward approximately 3 minutes: What the hell just happened?  Everything is gone, I am licking the plate.  I'm sweating slightly but in a good way.  I feel nearly euphoric, intensely satisfied, tipsy even.  I think I may have seen some fireworks.  I don't want to brush my teeth so I can savor the flavor for the rest of the day (that's gross).  I want to meet the man behind this meat and shake his hand, potentially even give him a big old man hug.  I want to write glowing Yelp reviews.  I want to laugh at vegetarians for closing the door to this. I want another one.  NOW.
