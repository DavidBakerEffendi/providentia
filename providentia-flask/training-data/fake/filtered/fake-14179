I used to be a fan of Molly's - solid burgers, cozy feel and generally friendly staff - but I won't be going back after watching the (very drunk) bartender berate two couples that were in there last night.  I'm not sure what he claimed they had done - it was hard to understand what he was saying, as he was loaded - but it didn't seem like they were doing anything wrong (weren't drunk, nicely dressed and seemed friendly).  This guy came around the bar and got in their face and then followed them outside.  It was a genuinely ridiculous and uncalled for scene.  And from reading the reviews it looks like there's been problems there before.  I'll be taking my business elsewhere.
