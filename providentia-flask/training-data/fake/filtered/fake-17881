Great place! They are very clean. The staff members are very friendly. The food is also very delicious.This is to Mr AR that posted a bad review about the owner having an attitude. For those who know the owner, he is a very friendly more of a People pleaser, so go shopping and cook your own food instead of being an a******! I have been all over the Middle East, mostly in Israel. I believe this is some of the best Middle Eastern food that I ever had. I ordered the chicken shawerma plater that was very delicious, and my kids order two falafel sandwiches. Of course I had to try it, and I must say it was ABSOLUTELY devine. To go experience When I first entered falafely yours, the owner and staff members greeted me with a warm welcome. I ordered an immense amount of food for my mothers dinner party. Business was slightly busy, so I figured it would take at least 30 minutes for the order. I ordered a catering size of the hummus with pita bread, Four orders of the falafel sides, and they suggested for me to try the morrocan carrot salad. I must say it was so good, I ordered one for myself while I waited. The owner is impressively attentive. Without telling me, he worked on my large order and I was out of there within fifteen to twenty minutes! Wow!!!! what great service.
