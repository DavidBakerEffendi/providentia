If you like craft beer and want to see what your local brewmaster has to offer, this is the place to go. And yes, NJ does have good beer! Lots of taps that get rotated regularly so you get great variety. You want to talk beer? Say hi to Jesse :-) Food is tasty- great burger, great steak, and my favorite the Reuben (although I am the weirdo that likes it with provolone cheese Lol) This is the spot to go for a friendly, "Cheers" kind of environment.
