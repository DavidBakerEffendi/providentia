I'm so over small plates restaurants trying to pretend that giving you tiny portions of food 'to share' is anything other than a way of saving themselves money on produce and generating massive profits. Flinders Lane is another in a long line of places trying to con you into thinking that 'everyone getting to try something' is value for money. We were advised to have six plates among three of us; we picked half a dozen oysters, the fluke, the squid on grilled watermelon, a tofu dish, the sausage roll, and a tandoori rabbit which I'd looked forward to trying since looking at the menu online. What we had ranged from good to excellent -- the rabbit, in particular, was tender, with great grilled flavour, and came with very tasty naan and julienned green papaya; the baby squid (rings and tentacles) were perfectly cooked (it's easy to get this wrong) and the grilled watermelon an unusual and clever thing to pair with it. Here's 'Mod Oz's signature fusion cooking, involving Asian flavours and good local produce, done really well. But we more or less needed a microscope to be able to see the portions. The room is spacious and well set out; a touch of soft furnishing might cut down the clattering ambient noise slightly -- though in fairness this is something many restaurants don't seem to understand. The soundtrack -- a neverending mashup of indie and pop tunes -- was clever, fun, and well-judged. But our server was a joyless fellow who seemed to resent taking our order, and I can't really give anywhere more than 2 stars when a dinner booking results a $300 bill (for food, drink and taxes) and three guests wandering out onto Avenue A, still hungry, Â looking for somewhere to go afterwards and have a more substantial plate. I'd recommend Flinders Lane dispense with the silly sharing-small-plates gimmick and just serve decent portions. This food is done no favours by being so minutely meted out.
