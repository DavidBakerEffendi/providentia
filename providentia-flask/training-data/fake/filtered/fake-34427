I have been eating here since the restaurant opened and I continue to return. As a person who used to live in CA right above Baja, I can tell you, this food is good.  The rice is to die for!  It's perfect!  Fresh chips and a great salsa bar that included pickled carrots that I love. I almost always get the tostada with a side of guacamole and rice.  The taquitos are fantastic too. I have never heard anyone dislike other items on the menu.  And the flan!  Oy!
