The restaurant feels a little overwhelming when you first enter, somewhat cramped with a menu the size of a lecture hall chalkboard. Despite this, on the Sunday morning we went there was a nice, relaxed atmosphere. There were a few other patrons scattered to the corners of the dining area and the servers were chatting casually behind the counter. I ordered the Irish Breakfast with toast, which consists of grilled (purple) potatoes, two eggs how you want them (over easy in my case), apple, and fresh tomato and mushrooms. All of this arrived only a couple minutes after the order was placed; however, the toast was just warm bread and I had to ask for it to be toasted further. I was initially leery of the purple potatoes, never having had them before, but they wound up being fine. In spite of the purple tone throughout they tasted like a garden-variety potato you'd pick up at the grocery store. The eggs were cooked well, with a thin, runny yolk and little firmness like I was expecting. I was slightly disappointed by the tomatoes and mushrooms. The tomato was very fresh and delicious, but the mushrooms were lukewarm and would have been improved with a little more heat. All in all I was satisfied with my meal. Sending back the toast was minor and fixed immediately, the waiter was very understanding. While not perfect, the mushrooms were delicious and the tomato was excellent. I had one major qualm: which was that the price on the big board for my meal was inaccurate. Besides that, I had a good experience, and would be happy going back.
