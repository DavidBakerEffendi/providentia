Very slow service. Expensive prices. And snooty waiters. I came here with 3 other friends and I saw that the portions are huge, so when we tried to order 2 meals to share, the waiter rolled his eyes, grabbed the menus and ran. Then the rest of the night the dishes and utensils were basically thrown at us with an attitude. Food was decent, you can tell the seafood was frozen and not fresh. But again very snooty waiters!!!
