DO NOT USE NICO FOR A PRE-SHOW DINNER!!! The service is absolutely terrible and slow.  They seat you right away...then it takes 10-15 minutes for a waitress to take a drink order...and she takes the food order at the same time....10-15 minutes later the drink arrives, but so does the appetizer...so, now they are jamming plates of food onto the table while you are trying to enjoy your drink...10-15 minute gaps in time seem to be the norm because that is when the entree arrives....they know you are there for a show, but you barely get out in time for the show...we had to wave the waitress down for our check and just barely got into the theater before the show started.  The food is only OK and it if think there is a convenience factor for eating there before a show, you are very wrong.  This is the second time this happened to us.  The last time, the table next to us still didn't have their entree 15 minutes to show time.  From what I can tell, the management is doing a poor job in running the place.   Not enough waiters and waitresses, the bartenders are not serving drinks for the diners fast enough...they seem to be focusing on the people at the bar...not enough attention being paid to the clock and how long each diner has been waiting for service.  By the way, that bar area is very noisy and the people at the bar are hanging over the railing watching you eat your meal...I watched one of them order a beer and pull a saran wrapped sandwhich out of his pocket to eat while he watched us eat our pricey dinner!
