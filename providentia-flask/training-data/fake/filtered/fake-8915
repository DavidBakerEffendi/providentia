pitiful very rude hostess and owner appears to be racist went for lunch with half black daughter and her boyfriend and after complaining of poor service and one of the meals not being good the police showed up saying that the owner called and stated that thewere threatened by us?! what an outrage we were not rude or disrespectful in any way i am the wife of a soldier and PTA mom locally and was very shocked and disappointed at the bias behavior of this diner we were asked not to come back and falsly accused of making threats i would not advise any of my colleagues friends or family to eat at this establishment cant say enough how disappointed we were at theyre behavior i have eaten here with other family members in the past and thought it was a good place to go! myself as well as my 9 month old baby were not diruptive or threatening in any way?! very poor buisiness and look forward to reading about it in the Ewing Observer! I have been a longtime resident of Ewing and am very well liked by my community outraged that racism is still so alive in my town
