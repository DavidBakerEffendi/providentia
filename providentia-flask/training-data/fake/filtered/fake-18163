I'm out every night in New Haven and have dined at every restaurant in town. I'm usually drinking red white. I ventured with my significant other one Wednesday night at about 9 PM after a Salsa lesson and decided we needed a couple of diet cokes. They hit me up for $3 a diet coke (no problem - a place has to pay the rent) although the glass was long and skinny and maybe held 1/3 of a can. The young waitress comes over after we've taken 2 sips and downed them and asked if we wanted refills. We did. The food, as usual, was very good. We ordered the pita/hummus and 2 other dishes. Of course we ran out of pita and asked for some more. So, I get the bill and I've been charged $12 for 4 diet cokes and and extra $1 for some pita. Are you kidding me? Trust me, I've spent more, but it's a Wednesday night in New Haven and you're charging me $3 for a diet coke refill. The place has a nice vibe but it needs to stop nickel-and-diming patrons. For my money in New Haven, you're better off at Temple Grill or Barcelona.
