OH MY GOD. I know they have a captive audience, but the service here on jan 12th was beyond pathetic. I sat for a full eight minutes in a hal empty dining room before anyone approached me to as much as acknowledge my presence. My server had the personality of a DMV worker. The first two employees I flagged down made sure that I knew that they weren't my server, and how dare I bother them. When my order came it was missing the side (cole slaw) when I asked about it I was told they were out and were making it. When I had completely finished my sandwich and drink I inquired again. Still no slaw. I asked if I could have chips instead. With eyes rolling back into her head in disgust at my expectations of some modicum of customer service, she sauntered away only to return 5 minutes later and tossed a bag of chips at me. A few minutes later I finally got my check and she actually stared at me as I signed it as if to intimidate me into tipping well. I don't intimidate easily! Needless to say, If I am ever unfortunate enough to have another layover in Newark, I will find somewhere else to eat!
