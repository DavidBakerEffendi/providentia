Whenever I make it out to Astoria I must make a stop my Sanfords, I've done anything from soup and salad to their pulled pork sandwich.  A few of my favorites are the chicken club, the cobb salad and especially the pecan crusted chicken salad. Weekend's seem to be the most favored day to dine in, so I tend to order carry out or delivery on the weekends.  Services is fast and efficient and I can't say I have ever received a bad meal.  Very creative dishes and also plenty to go around.  If you order two meals its enough to feed three average side individuals.
