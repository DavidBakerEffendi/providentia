Best dinner in NYC so far! We started with the wild king salmon tartar on warm garlic-herb toast and the crab toast with lemon aioli. For dinner I had the black sea bass stuffed with chilies and herbs served on spinach and baby market potatoes in a lemon/olive oil broth. I highly recommend if in NYC! Â Also - the clementine fizz was yummy and I had the basil lime daiquiri which was delicious!
