Classic NYC, smoky flavored, thin crust pizza, baked in a coal fired brick oven.  Pizza is made with their own sauce, as well as fresh mozzarella and basil.  Grimaldi's is in DUMBO, just over the Brooklyn Bridge, and can easily serve as a jumping off point for a great walk (or bike ride) into the city, and a view of the new Waterfalls exhibit on display through the fall. And don't forget that Jacques Torres chocolate factory is nearby, and the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory on the Pier. For more information, go to:  thefoodbully.blogspot.com
