My wife and I ended up at this restaurant after having a bad experience at another Iron Bound eatery.  That's correct, they should be all called eateries and not restaurants.  While here, my wife ordered the chicken in garlic over linguine and I ordered the veal scaloppini over linguini.  Both plates when served came back over spaghetti.  My wife was somewhat okay with her dish but my veal must have been deep fried because the edges were crispy and too chewy.  The food was not worth what we paid.  The service was mediocre and it's the last time they'll see us.  I should have gone to the supermarket and made my own dinner.  With the money we left there we could be eating gourmet at home all weekend long.
