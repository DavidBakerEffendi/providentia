LOVE THIS PLACE. I've gotten into the habit of coming here for dinner on Sunday nights to unwind after a long weekend of working multiple brunch/dinner shifts. Pizza is solid comparable with (maybe better) than Roberta's or Motorino. Love the Specials. Osso Bucco a few weeks back KILLED and more recently the fried shrimp/squid salad was crispy without being heavy or greasy. very well executed. Always get here too late in the weekend to try the fish specials which are always sold out. bummer. I'm really into the house wine as well. On the cheap without tasting cheap. Attentive/polite service without being overbearing or rushing you. Good espresso. My only compliant is with the dessert menu. Everything I've had has been passable but it's all textbook. Creama catalina, chocolate moose, tiramisu. panna cotta Â All cold desserts obviously designed for easy pick up. All classics for sure but needs a modern spin. Seems like it was an afterthought. Will continue to eat here every Sunday night I can.
