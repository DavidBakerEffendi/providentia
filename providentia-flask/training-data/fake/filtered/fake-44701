We ordered Mussels, Provolone and Roasted Peppers, and A Plain Cheese Pizza.  Mussels ( like Roma Ristorante) were phenomenal.  The Cheese and Peppers (Like Roma Ristorante) also excellent.  HOWEVER... the Pizza was/is a disgrace.  This pre fabricated piece of garbage belongs in the trash.  It was tasteless.  The pie was PERFECTLY ROUND indicating a machine was used.  As for taste/flavor  A machine might as well made it too.  Bland, tasteless, and nasty!!  We enjoyed our apps and ordered a Real pizza from the ITALIAN VILLA!  Order Pizza from Pietro's at YOUR OWN RISK!
