Nice, little family-owned Deli with a small 8 booth or so indoor dining area.   Serves your typical deli staples with a menu that varies and a rotating daily hot special.  The prices are about 10% higher than some of the other sandwich shops in the area and fall in the $6.50 - $9.00 range not counting chips and drinks. As an added bonus, The Cone Zone, an old-fashioned ice-cream stand, is practically right next store.
