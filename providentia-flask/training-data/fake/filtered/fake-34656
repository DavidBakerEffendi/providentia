I love Mai Thai! I had never eaten Thai food before so this was a perfect introduction. My food was cooked with just the right amount of spice for someone new to Thai food. The staff was incredibly friendly and the food was prepared quickly. I recommend Mai Thai to all my friends and family. They will accommodate any dietary request and the menu is large and diverse. It is a small restaurant so you feel like you are eating in someone's home. Overall, a great experience and I will definitely be back!
