went there last night... had 8:00 reservations .... got seated at 9! served us out 1st round of drinks n never got another... watched burger fall on the ground! then they pretended it didn't and attempted to serve me it! and lets not forget how the waitress put her hands all over my friends husband! SICK SICK SICK place!!! HORRIBLE!!! if I could give them no stars I would! do your self a favor n skip this joint a burger isn't worth getting sick or assaulted !!!
