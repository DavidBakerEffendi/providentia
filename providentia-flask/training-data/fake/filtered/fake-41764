As a personal trainer in the city it is always nice to have a great spot to go to between clients that serves some healthy and delicious menu choices. Several of my clients are locals of Bakehouse and the restaurant gives off a very noticeable family vibe. Great staff, great food, great service. Try the Tuna Nicoise Salad, Scallops, Â or grab one of their fresh juices to go on a Saturday or Sunday morning to start the day. Three Thumbs Up and great addition to the West Village and NYC!
