The Confessional has an amazing atmosphere. One of a few romantic bars on this corner. I would recommend Confessional mostly for the atmosphere- and the location. Confessional is a great place to start the night, end the night, or as an in between. After drinks you can go here to collect yourself, or to surprise a newfound romantic interest with the brilliant atmosphere inside...
