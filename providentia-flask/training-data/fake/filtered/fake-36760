Hamburgers, Shakes , Beer, Music, Girls- Would that be something that you would be interested in? ... Well I am, and I enjoyed every minute of it. Went on a Saturday night and it was very busy this tells me I'm on to something. Ordered a P.Y.T. burger and onion rings. I was expecting for it to be a minute or two but I took the time to enjoy the views. Understand what the server went through based on some reviews because I could hardly find my own table when I returned from the bathroom, and the other people jumping from table to table looked like they wanted to play hide and seek from the waitress. Anyway the burger was amazing and the rings tasted like delightful little laser beams touching my lips ( really good). Unfortunately the only shake I had was when I was killing it on the dance floor, another bonus here because I can loose some of those cals and make room for the alcohol. P.Y.T. stay frosty and remember if you had all the qualities of a 5 star restaurant it would kill your vibe. Your unique and I like that.
