My girlfriend and I went here for my Birthday recently and we had the most amazing meal. As mentioned by others, its not just the food that is wonderful, it is the whole experience. We were greeted extremely warmly at the door by a gracious frenchman who I assumed was the waiter but later realised was the chef. It was quite an experience to be so up close and personal with the chef of our meal (certainly rare for manhattan). He recommended certain dishes, shared his enthusiasm about them and informed us what our wine would accompany. A charming passionate man and a frenchman at that! The food was lovely. We started with crab cakes then my girfriend had the lamb and I had the filet mignon, all highly recommended. The vegetable side dishes were delicious too. A really heartwarming scrumptious meal. As a somewhat incorrigible drinker when out, the BYOB is a divine offering! I almost didnt write this review as I really dont want it to become busy. Definitely gone into my list of favourite places in NYC. Guillaume
