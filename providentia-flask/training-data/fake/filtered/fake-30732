What a relief to find an Italian Resturant where the food is great and the owner is hands on and on top of the service and food . Mike is the best the food is always fresh and right on , the pizza is unbelievable ! every entree is very reasonable and very affordable . I have been back many times and told lots of people about Leone's. THE ARTICHOKE WAS AMAZING !
