Love this place! Unassuming from the outside, The Gander wreaks of very talented people doing there best in an unfortunate location. The up-side to the storefront choice is there's no annoying tourists passersby's looking for "Moules Frittes" or a Kids Menu. Just solid food and a very respectable wine selection. I wont talk about the brisket tots only because there a given! Fluke collar & Cuttlefish ceviche Nice! Sea Trout tartare with the salted crispy trout skin, reminded me of Noma's Cod Roe dish without the plane ticket or price tag (well done chef). Pea soup w/ oyster and borage, clean, beautiful,  nuff said. Duck breast, perfectly cooked,  fig puree was a lovely backdrop. For dessert chef Christina crushed it with the banana parfait. Saffron can be a hazardous ingredient if too liberal but she managed just the right touch. Chocolate custard with malt and coco nibs is worth a tip of the hat as well. All in all, the service was super friendly and made us feel welcome, even after the second to last table left (yep, we shut it down). The chefs did a great job showcasing flavor before all else. Chefs Jesse and james are doing it right. We will be back!
