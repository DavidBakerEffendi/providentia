SOOO UHHHHHH YEA i had to come back and review these guys.I miss this pizza place so much since i have moved away from the temple area:( The pizza :orgasmic ,flavorful,juicy,the toppings nice and crunchy and caramelized everything you can imagine a pizza can be they have it here.They are always very freindly and they have some hot looking cashier guys too:) They cater to your diet needs too.If you want your burger bunless"You got it"!and its just good i can go on and on keep in mind i am not a spokesmodel for city view pizza but they have left such a great impression on me i really miss this place.
