Is it just us or what? Me and my family dine here and we all agree that the food is toooooooo salty! we ordered the crab toast and the lunch prix fixe menu and the meatball pasta. the crab toast is good but not like insanely or heavenly good described by other reviewers.... all the other dishes (actually include the crab toast) are super salty. I have a hard time eating my meatball pasta... and the sea salted caramel ice crea...same..it's just...OK.... only good thing is their service, very attentive and well trained... was very disappointed...maybe because i expected too much :/
