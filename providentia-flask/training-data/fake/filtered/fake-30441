What can I say that hasn't been said before?! I'm a Pitts boy through and through, and they just don't make 'em like this down my way. I went to this place with someone who was very familiar with Philly, and she swore by the place. It was a pretty long wait that seemed longer than average for the line length, but at one point an extra employee came along and helped speed things up just before my friend and I reached the ordering spot. I opted for the mushroom cheesesteak (provolone) with fried onions, mayo and hot peppers. My friend swears by ketchup as another quality condiment selection, and I noted others doing the same, but I couldn't do it! Ended up eating a little less than half of the whole sub in my car, before making my way home with the remainder, which I reheated and ate today. It was totally awesome the first time, and still very, very, very good reheated. AWESOME
