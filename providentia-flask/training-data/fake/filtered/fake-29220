My husband have been eating here since they opened and they're food has been consistently fresh and flavorful. One thing I HIGHLY recommend is their soups! It was one of those husband wants mexican food days, but i was really craving soup, so I gave their soup a try. I never ask what the soup of the day is, I like for it to be a surprise and they have always been Â very delicious!! If the chef wrote a cookbook on soups I would totally buy it. Their tacos, burritos, dinner entrees etc are superb too, but I felt that no one ever mentions the soup, it's seriously good.
