It's painfully frustrating that a place with such good food has such bad service. I don't really want to be a yelp-ranter, but we have gone multiple times and time and again, they have proven not to know the basic tenets of hosting, waiting, or general service. From waiting 45 minutes for our food after ordering, to being seated in locations where we literally could not back our chairs out without bothering other customers (when the restaurant was about 1/4th full with plenty of open space), a host telling us every aspect of the table before us and when they may be getting up rather than just giving us a wait time, bringing the incorrect food, broken baby seats (a safety hazard), any quite a few other instances. We consistently go back about twice a year because the food is so creative, but it is getting harder and harder to overcome the terrible service.
