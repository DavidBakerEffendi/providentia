Extremely disappointing!  I have lived in New York for over 25 years and have tasted much better Italian food for less than half the price.  When a family member visiting from out of town suggested that we meet at this restruant, my family and I had our doubts since the restruant is located in the "touristy" area.  We were taken with the ambiance and the friendliness of the staff.  However, the bread turned out to be the best part of the meal!  Three of us ordered the lasagna at $27 each (a speciality of the house).  The presentation was "artsy" however, it turned out to be one-dimensional: little cheese, little sauce and very greasy.  In fact, at least three tablespoons of grease leaked out of the leftover bag!  One of us ordered pasta carbonnara; the portion was very small and again it was loaded with grease! Our visitor ordered a fish dish, which she said was good, but like the other dishes was swimming in butter.  In all, these five dishes (no drinks, no extras) cost $153! I am disheartened that this restruant is not up to the standards of NY cuisine.  In fact, it leaves tourists with the misimpression that NYC food is overpriced and mediocre.
