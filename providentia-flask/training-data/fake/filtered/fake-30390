I LOVE this place. I'm becoming a semi-regular because my boyfriend lives nearby. Brought my family here for Mother's Day, they were impressed. I have dreams about those mussels. And those Frozen Margaritas with the chili salt are amazing. My dad said the Bloody Mary there was the best he had ever had in his entire life. I can't praise this place enough! There is always room, I've never had to wait. If I had to state a con the 1 bathroom can sometimes cause a little lineup, but I usually just run to my boyfriends apartment and then run back, haha.
