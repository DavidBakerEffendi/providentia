I lived in California for 13 years and this was the worst white hipster version of mexican food I ever had. To, me having an NYU student or hipster kid squeezing hot sauce out of a squeeze tube all over the burrito with huge servings of rice and a plop of guac ontop  was gross. There was no art to it.. no "Mexican" too it. No onion, freshly chopped ingredients...no mixed ingredients , was washed down, bad, lazy version of food slop with mexican food ingredients. There was way too much rice, no fresh cilantro,or veggies. The guac was too creamy. The sour cream was liquid, the bill wasn't cheap. no chips unless you paid for it.. no where to sit. The hipsters couldn't be bothered to make a beautiful dish or burrito. It felt like a place I would go in a mall if I was starving... and there was nothing else.. or an airport. I was very dissapointed. I threw half my burrito out.. was crap.. with ZERO taste. Plenty of places in Brooklyn (that still aren't California or Mexico) come alot closer. Anyone who likes this place.. must have never left the east coast.. and doesn't know what real mexican food is. I realize I have alot of attitude.. but, I hate hipster places that act like they are doing it right... and they fail miserably. I will , however complement them on their nice selection of mexican beer and black cherry sodas and other drinks. Also their use of Greenware is  a good move and thank god more places are doing this.
