While they iron put a few kinks having only opened on Friday, the food is amazing! Â The decor is a bit odd, especially the outdoor space - slightly confused, but that does not detract from the food. The menu is limited but varied enough for both vegetarians and carnivores. If for nothing else but the menu, highly recommended. It is not cheap, but not terribly expensive either. Perfect for small groups too.
