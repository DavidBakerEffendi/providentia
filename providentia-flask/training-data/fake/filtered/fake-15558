Bought a Groupon deal here a few weeks ago and went tonight for dinner with the GF. Burgers were cooked perfectly, fresh beef/toppings...one of the best burgers I can remember. Fries were equally good, fresh and crispy. I would definitely go back in the future even without a Groupon deal. My only concern is that this places is in an odd location, I hope they can stay busy enough to keep the place open...but based on food alone they absolutely should be. Bullseye BBQ Burger and A1 Blue Burger come highly recommended.
