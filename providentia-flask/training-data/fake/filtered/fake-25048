My wife and I celebrated our 10 year anniversary here. When I called to make the reservation "Zach" answered. He got us the best table for the occasion even though this place gets packed pretty much every night! When we got there we waited only 5 minutes for our table. Zach actually walked us to our table and I asked him what he recommended. He said the " pork bellies ". Wow was he right. They where sweet and flavorful. They had very, very little fat but still packed plenty of savory goodness. Then he mentioned the "Black Bass". So we went with that! Another good decision. This was the best fish dish my wife has tasted-ever. I enjoyed the "seafood enchiladas". I have been exposed to TOP Mexican food since I lived in TX for years. These where top 3 ! Our server was "Matthew". He was very professional and polite. He did not reach over the table. His manner was very pleasant. Finally, you know when you have only 2 main desserts they have to be good. We went with the chocolate cake. Its too complex (in a good way) for me to describe. You'll just have to experience it yourself. We have visited the "best" Mexican places here in Philly in hopes in recreating our TX experience. Well we just surpassed it. Btw, Zach is the GM you would have never known. He is so down to earth and attentive!
