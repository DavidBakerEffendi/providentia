If you are interested in this restaurant, you do not wanna go there on weekend, at least on Sat. for lunch, if you mind sharing table with strangers. Here what we ate: 1, duck half. I am not sure it's supposed to be served as cold or warm. If it should be a bit warm, the flavor would be better. Anyway, it tastes good. 2, Wonton soup. It is good. 3, Fried cruller rice crepes. Highly recommend. It is very fresh and very tasty. 4, Beef belly noodle. If you have been HK, you do not wanna try it. Actually the service is very efficient. Some waiters are with smily faces, some are not. Waitresses are more friendly and with big smiles.
