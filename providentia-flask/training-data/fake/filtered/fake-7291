OMFG. Is that allowed on yelp? Well, it needs to be, because that is what my taste buds said when I popped a frite doused in mango chutney into my mouth. The fries are humongous, and a large (to stay) can be too much for 2 people with medium appetites. The to go portions, oddly, are double the to stay portions. Don't know why. I don't really care. It's the sauces that are the important part. We also got the wasabi mayo, and the rosemary garlic mayo. They tasted like what we expected them to taste like. Enjoyable, but not mind-blowing like the mango. Can't wait to go back and try the pineapple one! Love the tables with the holes for the cones. Wish it wasn't as cramped so big groups could have a good time, but it's what you make of it. Get a to go portion and savor it in Tompkins Square Park as you watch the interesting folk of alphabet city go by!
