Was prepared to be impressed, but was disappointed. We ordered boneless chicken wings for an app, which was excellent, but I also ordered soup and specifically asked for it to come with the wings, but I had to ask for it a second time after the wings were gone and when it did come, it was lukewarm. Four of us ordered burgers and the fourth burger came so much later than the others that we had to let our food go cold to be polite. I had the portabella panini, which somehow was cold upon delivery despite being toasted. The onion rings were old, like they had been sitting for a while,and were tough. At almost $20 per person (we didn't even ordered alcohol), it was a lot to pay for mediocre food and service. I was surprised we weren't comped the fourth burger. I will say this: the atmosphere was great and the music was fun. The waitress was friendly and I"m not sure if the poor service was her fault or kitchen timing. I'll give it another chance.
