It is with heavy heart I have to say I was again disappointed by what used to be my favorite Italian restaurant in Connecticut.  It started with slow service (does it really take almost 15 minutes to ask me if I want a drink?). The mushroom appetizer (about 10 bucks) that came out was 3 quarter sized stuffed mushrooms.  Three? Really? Our veal dishes were very good, but my Eggplant rollatini was what many places would serve as an appetizer. It was good, not great. Coffee and 1 dessert (a very good dessert crepe) and the bill was close to $150. Like I said, this used to be a favorite and now it just disappoints.
