This is true Hell's Kitchen Treasure! I've been going to Nook for over 4 years and it has never let me down. The food is delicious, the d√©cor is great, the waitress is wonderful and very funny! The restaurant's somewhat cramped tables make it a perfectly friendly NY joint. Typically I get the same order - mushroom cigars and filet mignon - and have never been disappointed.
