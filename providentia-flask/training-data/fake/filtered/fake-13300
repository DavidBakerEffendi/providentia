This restaurant was fantastic. As you would expect the food here was sensational. In addition the staff went above and beyond to make our dinner to celebrate our 3 year wedding anniversary even more special. The restaurant gave us personalised menus, complimentary champagne to start and 'happy anniversary' was written on our dessert. A great night all round!
