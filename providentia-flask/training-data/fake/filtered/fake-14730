I couldn't wait to try the new Bagel Pizza Restaurant in Clifton but I should have never entered the joint...  The pizza was terrible!  Before my family and I ordered, we all laughed and said, "How bad could it be?...It was absolutly disgusting.... My 3 year old son was physically sick through the night heaving and vomitting till 3am..he has only gotten sick like that once before during a stomach flu....Don't even waste ur time or money...needless to say we won't be going there ever again.
