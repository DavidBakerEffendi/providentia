We made a reservation for Valentine's Day for 4. 30 days in advance. Which seemed reasonable for a date based holiday at one of the best restaurants in town. We have family in town to visit for the weekend. There was nothing on their site or open table about a tasting menu. We were contacted 15 days before the 14th and said no one makes reservations 30 days in advance..(excuse me, yes they do). And were told that they were having a Â tasting menu for Valentine's day and we had to go by the tasting menu if we were going to use our reservation. I told them I would ask the group how they felt about the price point. When I called back to confirm that we would like to keep our reservation they said too bad they already canceled it. It was not too late to secure a reservation at another one of our favorites. 1. Thanks. 2. Great planning and communication team Mercato 3. Learn how to take reservations, or don't.
