Extreme bad experience:                My partner and I arrived at B on a rainy Wednesday afternoon. Despite our protestations, we were told to deposit our umbrellas onto a pile of sodden umbrellas at the door.  Even though the restaurant was less than half full, we were refused our choice of tables and directed to sit at a small for-two table. When I asked the waiter for salt and pepper shakers, he never returned. Mid-way through our meal, my partner noticed his umbrella was no longer in sight. After he confirmed it was missing,  he notified the manager, who informed his "It is not my responsibility." Things went seriously downhill from there.  I will spare you the details, but we walked out, which is something in my 71-years-long life I've never done. They were content to see a patron leave their restaurant in the pouring rain for something they were indeed responsible for.  There was a general tone of calloused indifference, mixed with a willingness to lie, that added insult to injury. By the way, we think the food is good and moderately priced, and yes the decor and the location are good,  but my stomach would never tolerate the kind of treatment we experienced.
