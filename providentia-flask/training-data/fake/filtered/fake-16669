I recently visited Dive B&R after a 'long' day at work--and I had no idea what to expect.   I went in solo, which can be a scary thing to do in West Haven, yet I was greeted by a  cheery young lady.  Now, composed and settling in with a snifter, yes snifter, of Dogfish Head, I began scanning the menu expecting the usual grease-and-salt standards.  Surprise, conch fritters and Mahi Mahi! An actual wine list!   Tourist drinks!  Commercial-fee contemporary music!  I had a great meal, in a cozy room with a great view.  Finally, West Haven has a good place to sip and nibble.
