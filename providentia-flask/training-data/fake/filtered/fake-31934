the workers in this place are despicable. The blonde yuppie man at the bar is the nastiest queen diva I have ever met in my lifetime in NYC. He kept bringing me the check so our party of 3 could leave early, after we were not even nearly done with our food. He kept grilling us and rolling his eyes at our table and then bashed us in a conversation with another co-worker. On our way out he yelled "Hope you enjoyed your TIME here with us" in the most sarcastic diva tone. This was because he wanted us to leave since we spent a little over an hour there (but we spent more than $100 on pizza and wine). This is not the first time the staff has been incredibly rude. The mexican busboys are the coolest and kindest workers in this joint. The out of town yuppies pretending to be hipsters are over the top hostile. The hostess was also rude, and told me the wait was 30 minutes. Fine, no prob- It was just me and another friend. Â like ten other people who came in after us were seated before us, and after an hour of waiting, her response was "well, whatever if youre angry maybe you should just go eat somewhere else." WTF kind of a response is that? Bottom line: food is decent (of course if you don't really know what real pizza is, you'll love it) Bread pudding is fantastic, and overall can't complain about the food. (Of course its because the mexicans in the back whip up the pizza's, and they get no credit for all their hard work). If you are looking for good service, this is definitely not your place. In fact, if your looking for just mediocre service, this is not your place. I like going here bc its in my neighborhood, but I swear I have to restrain myself from punching the asian chick in her face, and the biatch man behind the bar.
