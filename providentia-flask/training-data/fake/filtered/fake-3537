Started our lunch off with some TOTS for the table, absolutely delicious. I ordered the retro burger and I have to admit, this was one of the best burgers I have ever had. Served on a toasted english muffin, the blend of meat inside was so tasty my mouth is watering right now thinking about it. The staff was incredibly friendly and fun and the beer choices were perfect. Thanks to Gust for the amazing hospitality, great drinks and mouth watering food!
