Coffee lovers, go elsewhere.  I ground the Costa Rica and Mindbender coffee beans on 6 separate occasions (3 times each) in a french press, and they are both awful. There is no way this coffee is pure, fair-trade.  It smells and tastes like cheap, Dunkin-donuts coffee.  I have travelled the US, and have tasted hundreds of fair-trade roasts, and Bodhi Coffee's beans were the most tasteless by a landslide.  I would not recommend this establishment, as I question whether its coffee beans were switched out as a fast rip-off, or if they are simply terrible.  For anyone looking for a decent coffee experience, there are far better places in Philly to go.
