A very nice restarant with rustic decor and pleasant and relaxed atmosphere. Everyone from the hostess to the wait staff are exceptionally polite and helpful. My friends and I went there for brunch and enjoyed the starter dishes that were brought to us before we ordered the main dishes all of which were delicious. We were also offered an extensive selection of cocktails which we fully intend to come back for some evening. From reading the other reviews I learned how serious is the management of the restaurant about protecting privacy of its customers even if it may lead to some unpleasant consequences and would like to thank them for the effort. I presume that there are many people who are getting tired of having their meals interrupted by some inconsiderate individuals who can not refrain themselves from talking, texting and snapping pictures with their gadgets with no regard for other people.
