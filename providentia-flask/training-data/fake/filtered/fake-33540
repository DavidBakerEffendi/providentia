Had a yummy brunch here on Sunday. Boyfriend had an oyster omelet which he loved, and I had an eggs Benedict dish with kale and butternut squash. So nice to eat somewhere for brunch that has relatively healthy, meatless options that extend beyond yogurt and granola, so thank you! I think they just opened for brunch and are still working out the service kinks.. there weren't that many people in there and the busser had a hovering issue, which is annoying when you are trying to just chill out with your eggs and your hangover. There's also a pretty bad beer smell, but it's a bar so what can you do. It will be really nice in the spring when they open up those windows. A great addition to the hood.
