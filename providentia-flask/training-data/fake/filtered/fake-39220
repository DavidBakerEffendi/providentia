Rocky Hill Inn has great food and 2 great places to dine.  The formal dining room is beautiful, tastefully done.  Perfect for a special night out.  The Tavern is a great space and the bar serves up 16 (yes 16) beers on tap.  The food is great, ranges from the unique Rocky Hill Burger to Pork Chops,  Fish and Chips to a delicious Bouillabaisse. Something for everyone.  Service is excellent and Chef Evan Blomgren does a terrific job  in the kitchen.  Live music on some evenings.  Totally recommend you visit for a wonderful meal and evening out.
