Great place to eat! almost anything you would choose will be Great. the shwarma sandwich, or the falafel of course (u can actually have a shwarama and ask for a 3 falafel balls on a side), or the shish kebab plate is great... on tops, the deserts are just fantastic! i love the baklawha at most. the reason for 4 stars and not 5, is that a place that based on "pita food" and has pretty lousy pitas (always falls apart...) needs to make some improvement .
