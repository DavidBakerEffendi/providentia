It's really hot.  The whole place is sticky with heat- including the tables- your skins adheres to the table tops.  Maybe I'm not in the East Village after all.  Maybe I'm actually in New Orleans- the sticky heat, the faded red velvet upholstery, the relaxed and friendly smiles on the wait staff all remind me of some faded glory bar in the deep south.  The food did nothing to deter my impressions:  easily some of the best fried chicken in the city of New York, creamy grits (I know- Anson Miils is NOT in the south. but so what? They're great)), the extra sweet cornbread, andouille sausage in the shrimp and grits- the very fact that they actually HAVE shrimp an grits on the menu (!),  blueberry fried pies with lemon ice cream- fabulous; the tendency to fry things (shallots, lemon peel) for garnish and LOTS of bacon (vegetarians beware!) as well as sweet tea with mint.   Any complaints?  Yea- Lead Zeppelin's "Whole Lotta Love" as background doesn't help me enjoy my food- I mean- jimmy page getting off while he's singing is supposed to help my appetite? I don't think so.  I relaxed when the hit track went to Johnny Cash.   Jazz would have been far better and better suited the atmosphere.  And I wish the tables weren't sticky.  Go for the food and forget the rest.
