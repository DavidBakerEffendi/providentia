I chose this place because Carmine's was booked until the late evening and I needed a place who had great Italian food. Many reviews said this was the place to go. However, comparing this restaurant to CARMINE'S this place has nothing on Carmine's except you will save a few extra dollars on your bill! We ordered 7 entrees 2 salads and one appetizer. Â The chicken parm was good and Tonys Salad was OK. Nothing to write home to your mama about out at all! The other let down is they didn't do refills on the drinks. But the best part about our dinner at Tonys is they don't charge to slice the cake! This was a small party of 8 celebrating my daughter's HS graduation. (PRICELESS)
