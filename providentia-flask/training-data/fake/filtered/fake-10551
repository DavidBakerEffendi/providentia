Very accurately replicates the experience of being at a party in highschool that you were not invited to.  We had brunch at the bar and spent an hour listening to the staff cut down customers as they sat in the restaurant and reduce passers-by for sport.  Laid back is great but this kind of studied coolness is tedious.  The food was fine, nothing mind-blowing.  Go somewhere friendlier.
