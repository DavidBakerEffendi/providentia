Last evening 16 of us gathered at Cafe Antonio for a celebration dinner. What followed was truly a feast in the Italian tradition.  The wait-staff was courteous and efficient. The chef-owner Antonio (from Carini, Sicily) and the affable manager Maurizio (from nearby Naples, Italy) were ever so accommodating to make  our visit to Cafe Antonio as pleasant as we could ever have hoped for. In addition, Italophiles  do have an opportunity to banter in Italian with Antonio and Maurizio.  Lastly, rumor has it that a Governor from a nearby State  holds business lunches , from time-to-time, at Cafe Antonio.
