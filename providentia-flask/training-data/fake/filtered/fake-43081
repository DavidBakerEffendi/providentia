Having worked through lunch, I pigged out for dinner--and was fortunate to have been recommended this place to do it at. Starving, I couldn't decide whether to start with the pate or the blood sausage in polenta--so the waiter brought out both! The pate was easily the best I've ever had--rich and buttery, complemented by microgreens and marmalade. And the blood sausage/polenta was as good as it sounds. My main course--a flank steak rolled with egg, bacon (?--could be wrong here--I forget the exact ingredients at this point), and spinach--was so tender I could not only cut it with my fork, it literally--literally--melted in my mouth. Desserts followed, which were amazing as well (my wife and I shared a chocolate tort with candied peaches and an avocado flan-like something-or-other). Incidentally, the bartender also hooked me up with a dessert drink that was a mystery to even the waiter, but was out of this world. (It looked like a mini, frothy cappuccino in a tiny liqueur glass--had a hint of mocha, maybe also Bailey's, and was very sweet.) Next time I'm there, I'll have to get the name of that concoction... Beyond the food, the decor was understated but elegant, the atmosphere relaxed and cozy, and the service, flawless. Suffice it to say, this spur-of-the-moment restaurant choice was a very, very pleasant surprise.
