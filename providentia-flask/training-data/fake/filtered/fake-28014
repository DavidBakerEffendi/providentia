I've discovered that I am definitely not a fan of tapas. I came hungry, I left hungry and broke. The flavor was okay, considering everything was small plates and they do mean very small plates. Gave it a try and it's not my kind of place. I guess if you're a foodie and like to brag about the latest overpriced restaurants you've been to, than this is the place to be! Our waiter was frustrated because we didn't know what we wanted, yet didn't lend any help or suggestion, we had to ask which was followed by a deep sigh. Too snooty for my taste. Don't get me wrong, presentation was nice, clean and beautiful just def not for me
