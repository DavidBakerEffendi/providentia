The food is very good...everything is classic Italian cooked the way it should be. The reason for the 2-stars only is that the owner is very rude and always has an attitude dealing with customers and with his employees. I walked in one day and he was screaming at one of his workers for a wrong order, then gave me an attitude when i tried to pay separately for a pick-up lunch order. Its a shame since the food is good....I just don't need to deal with poor service and to be treated like crap. He can keep his good food as far as I'm concerned.
