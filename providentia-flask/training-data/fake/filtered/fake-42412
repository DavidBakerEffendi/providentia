One of my favorite restaurants in Sunnyside. The food is always fresh and delicious. They make good seitan burritos if you are a vegetarian and an awesome skirt steak entree if you are a meat eater. We usually order in from here, but when we do eat at the restaurant, I love their freshly made lemonade in the summertime and hot chocolate in the winter time.
