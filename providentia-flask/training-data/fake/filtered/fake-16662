The waiter is very polite and friendly.  We ordered seafood and shish kebab.  The food come in a reasonable amount of time, they are fresh.  My lamb kebab was so juicy and tender, I love it.  The rice must have some secret ingredient that it is a bit addictive.  Is it butter??   Anyway, it is a nice restaurant with pretty wall decoration.  I will come again soon.
