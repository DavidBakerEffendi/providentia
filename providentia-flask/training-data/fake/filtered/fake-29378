I've had several of the new menu items and really liked each one of them!! The menu offers an affordable variety of "bar food" as well as salads, sandwiches and entree specials.  Some of the things that I have had and really enjoyed were the buffalo chicken dip, mussels with chorizo, and the chicken cutlet.   AND all three cost less than $10.  Each time I have come there have been some different beers on tap...but I usually stick to Alegash White...a great pick!!
