My wife and I are both of Eastern European descent. We enjoy variety and love to try different cuisines. Occasionally we feel the need for a latin food fix so with an Amazon local deal in hand, my wife and I decided to come here on a Thursday for a, post lunch rush, lunch and as it was the place was empty. Maybe the fact that the street outside was being re-paved kept the customers away. Sad because the food was very good if not excellent. We were greeted, seated and served by a fellow I suspect to be the owner. For starters we were offered a freshly made split pea soup which, my wife and I agreed, was to die for. Next my wife had the Salteado de Pollo, which is chicken sauteed with onions, peppers in a vodka like sauce, served with white rice topped with a Â patacon(flattened and deep-fried plantain). I tasted a bite and we both thought it was delicious. Since I love seafood I ordered Cazuela de Mariscos, a seafood casserole with shrimp, calamari, fish, mussels, crab meat in a lite tomato sauce, also served with white rice and a patacon. This was very good but for the price I'd go with the Salteado de Pollo. I had a Sangria which was just barely OK, and my wife had coffee which is a freshly ground Colombian. The owner claims to import it from a specific growing region in the Colombian mountains that now I can not recall. The coffee was dynamite. There is a bakery next door associated with the restaurant that serves this coffee to go, and they have these melt in your mouth pastries filled with fruit that you absolutely have to try. The coffee is available for sale in 4 or 5 lbs bags unground for those so interested. Would certainly recommend for a casual date or couples night out. Nice, pleasant, well-mannered atmosphere.
