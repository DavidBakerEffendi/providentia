Visited Ziggy's and was awesome to walk in.  Lots of TV's, pool tables, huge bar.  Sat down at a high top table and got menus right away.  Huge selection of beers on tap and I could not decide so ordered a four beer sampler along with our meals.   Beer was good and cold.  Finished sampler, but no sign of meal.  People walked in after us and got their food while we still waited. Polished off another beer when the sampler was done, wife had a second beer ....still no sign of food.  After 50 minutes was asked for our meal or the check. Check came, never saw the meal.  Paid, left, zero tip.   Will never return.  If only I could do less than one star .......
