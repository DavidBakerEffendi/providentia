Wine! Wine! Wine! Everyone on here is talking about the food but where Hillstone beats everyone (and I mean everyone) is on their wine list. Cakebread chard by the glass for $16. Vineyard 29 cru for $16. Silver Oak for $98 and Continuum for $150! I cant buy these wines in wine shops for less than that let alone get these at another restaurant for even double their price. Seriously, I would go in and have a bottle of wine in the bar and not even have any of the food
