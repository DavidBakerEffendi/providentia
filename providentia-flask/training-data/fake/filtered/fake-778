The food and service transcended taste and class. I was almost moved to tears (of joy) by the tremendous generosity of the employees. While my friend and I, let's just call them "Barbara" for now, were lucky enough to get a seat quickly, others toiled in a long line. But alas, the staff kept on bringing treats! Orange slices, honey toast, fries and even water. A sight to behold, but better experienced than told! Go here or risk losing one of life's greatest joys!
