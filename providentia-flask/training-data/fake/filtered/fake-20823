Baja's is my favorite Mexican restaurant and I've been going there for about 9 years.  I've tried several Mexican restaurants in CT and they have the best dishes.  Their mole sauce is the best I ever had and you don't want to stop tasting it.  My two favorite's dishes are enchiladas with mole sauce or the seafood chili relleno with spicy diablo sauce.  They have a special with enchilada and cheese chili relleno so I can get both my favorites in one dish.  They have a salsa bar with many varieties and they are all very good and this is free along with their homemade chips. The atmosphere could be a lot better, and I wish they would do the place over to make it more inviting and cozy.  However, the food is so good that I will never stop going there.
