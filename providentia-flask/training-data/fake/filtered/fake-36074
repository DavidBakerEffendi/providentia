I love this spot! The food is great and the owner Al is an awesome host. I try to test Italian restaurants by ordering the simplest of dishes, spaghetti and meatballs. I figure if they can do that right then I'm in. Their spaghetti and meatballs are phenomenal! The music is great and their service is exceptional. I recommend this place to anyone who loves Italian food.
