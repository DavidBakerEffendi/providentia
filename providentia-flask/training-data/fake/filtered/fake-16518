This place was the biggest joke.  I don't know if the manager paid the other reviewers to say nice things.  We could have eaten a better meal at Olive Garden and paid less for it.  Nice ambience aside, when it came to the food, this place failed to deliver.  The bread brought to our table was dried out and stale (I'd say it was at least three days past any semblance of freshness).  Our antipasto salad had pieces of wilted greens in it and bland unripe tomatoes (it is early September in the Garden state, why could they not serve fresh tomatoes?).   My husband's chicken parmesan was nothing but a thin frozen breaded chicken patty reheated with some tomato sauce and two pieces of square cheese melted on top (since when does mozzarella cheese come in thin square slices?).  His side soup of seafood chowder was straight from a can.  And the pasta he ordered with the chicken parmesan was wayyyy overcooked.   It only gets worse.  Having been taken in by the nice setting (although there was no one there but us at 7pm on a Sunday night), I changed my order at the last minute to one of the "specials"--lobster ravioli.  What I got were seven ravioli that had some mushed up unidentifiable seafood in it (tasted more like crab than anything else).  This was not "homemade" as touted on their literature.  Having worked for Aramark catering for years, I'm sure this was frozen food from some food manufacturer.  To add insult to injury, when the bill came I was horrified to see that they'd charged $24 for the "lobster" ravioli.  Some special!!!  This is a heist to overcharge you for pre-made, poor quality food.  Olive Garden does better disguising their dishes--Cafe Mulino could take a few lessons from them. The dinner sucked and it sucked our wallets dry.  I've never been so disappointed in a restaurant.  I will never go back, and I will keep spreading the word that this place is horrible.
