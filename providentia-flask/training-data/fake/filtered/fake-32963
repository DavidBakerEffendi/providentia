Great place!  The food was delicious. We shared a couple of seafood  tapas dishes which were yummy!. The chorizo was spectacular.  i happen to love steak and sauteed spinach so i couldn't resist ordering the hanger steak, which was amazing.  The service was attentive and friendly ..The  ambience   is really lovely. Overall, it is very appealing to the eyes and the tastebuds.
