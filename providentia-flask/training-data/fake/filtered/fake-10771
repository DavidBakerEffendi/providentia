The food is great. I have been going for years now. You will love the sweets as well.  Try the rasmalai there, you will like it.  The food there is unfortunately all very high-calorie.  And a note to the reviewer-Anjali below, Are you serious sweetheart? The food is fabulous. Maybe it is your tastebuds.
