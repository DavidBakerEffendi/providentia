Lunch was wonderful today.  The Bolognese sauce was delicious!  My son and husband loved their chicken and veal parmigiana. Everything made fresh, nothing pre-cooked. Then, we had Italian ices and I took a cannoli home.  It was the best cannoli I have ever had! The ricotta cream was smooth and sweetened just right.  The best thing about the whole experience was the wonderful family owners that we met.  The whole experience was outstanding and genuine.  Great to meet people who love what they do and do it so well.  Thanks!
