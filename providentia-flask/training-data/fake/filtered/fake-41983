I rate this place a full 5 stars. If you love Vietnamese food this is the place to go. It's the best place to go on a budget. They make the "best" avacado shake. I tried many different places and Pho Xe Lua makes the best shake there is. Their xtra large Pho is truely Xtra Large. if you really wanna go cheap you can buy one xtra large and split it with you and your friend. LOL. Â I am sure that is frowned upon.
