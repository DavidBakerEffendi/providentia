I did like this restaurant but primarily because of the service. All the staff were just excellent, they were so happy to help and all of them had interesting and friendly personalities and it really was a pleasure going to Basso56 for that reason, while I liked the food, I definitely think that it could have been better. I felt that the food was kind of lacking something, but it wasn't bad or anything like that and I would still recommend the place because my wife said there was absolutely nothing wrong with her meal so I'm sure there's nothing wrong with the place or anything like that. We aren't in New York that often and when we are we are usually both very busy but I think we will definitely try and make the time to go back to the restaurant because it was a pleasant night out after all.
