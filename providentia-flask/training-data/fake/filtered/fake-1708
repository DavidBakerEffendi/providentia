Technically, I could give this place 5 stars (within its price range), but we have dined at the very best restaurants in NYC.  I really cannot say anything bad about the place, and I highly recommend it.  One particularly nice aspect of this palce is that we can drop in without reservations if we're willing to eat at the bar.  Food made from fresh products, high quality, and great service.
