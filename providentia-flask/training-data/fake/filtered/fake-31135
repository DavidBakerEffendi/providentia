Zorba's is the best Greek restaurant in the city.The best cold dip sampler, the salad that they make is delicious. My chicken souvlaki was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. My girlfriend had the lamb sank in red wine and tomato sauce which she loved and pleasing me to go back,she can not forget how moist the meat was. she even bought Â a take out lamb but because they where out of the lamb sank she get the leg of lamb.At the end we had baklava for dessert which was perfectly baked and very well dressed with the homemade syrup.I'll defiantly go back next week but i'll make sure to reserved a table.
