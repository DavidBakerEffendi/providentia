We just loved our experience at Rubirosa...had a reservation for dinner on a Thursday night and were seated right away.  Although it was a bit loud, we could hear each other fairly well.  The waiter was outstanding, patient with our inability to make a choice.  So many good options.  The calamari was oneof the best I've had...each one of the four of us had a different entree and they were all delicious.  Great melange of flavors in each dish.  Generous portions and fresh homemade ingredients.  Probably the best dinner we had over the weekend.
