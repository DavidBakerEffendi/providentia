Sorry, but I don't care if the food is good...the setup of this restaurant and service are enough to drive me away for good. Cozy seating? More like elbow to elbow with everyone around you (so much for romantic). They should really re-think the seating arrangement, as not everyone enjoys being packed into the place like sardines. Friendly wait staff? Laughable! They were so rude, and inattentive I seriously thought I was on candid camera. Prompt service? We probably spent a good hour between each course waiting on food (45 minutes to appetizer, 45 minutes to dinner), and then decided to skip dessert because we were tired of sitting there. It's cash only. I'm not sure if they had a sign hanging, but I sure didn't see it. That's nitpicking on my part, but yet another inconvenience. Tip: If you come here in the winter, make sure you're wearing a very thin shirt. No sweaters or anything as thick, because they keep the heat unbearably high. We stepped outside between our courses just to get some fresh air. In conclusion: If you can overlook everything above, then go for it. The food is good and worth a try. Personally, I would be embarrassed to subject anyone to the aforementioned problems. Stay AWAY!
