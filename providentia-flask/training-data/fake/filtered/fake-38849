A fantastic meal . I chose the Chef's Tasting menu. Each course was phenomenal ! I have been to Degustaion many times through the past 6 years and this time was really special. There are a couple of new cooks there now. One in particular cut his teeth at Marea and EMP. You can tell the bar is raised. Some of the dishes we had were scallops with squid ink paella ,lamb belly with slow poached egg. We had a great time!
