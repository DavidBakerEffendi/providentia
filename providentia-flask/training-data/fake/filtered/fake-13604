Noodle Pudding is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.  The food is brilliant and the wine is delicious (you can even get a glass for $4).  Service is admittedly up and down, but if you go with a big appetite and the understanding that you're here for the grub and the Brooklyn experience, Noodle Pudding will become your fave too. Cash only. Gluten free pasta available too!
