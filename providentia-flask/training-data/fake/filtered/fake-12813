I use to love going to West Park; love their food & if it was wrong they would fix it. Then they got a few new staff member's which was great. One day me & my husband went to have dinner and one waitress which was new, spanish, fake blond, 5'2, light skin started to flirt with my husband right in front of me. At first i thought I was just too tired but she kept circling our table at all times and she wasn't even our waitress. i let it good but when everytime we went the same thing happen until one day we had her so I asked her what was her problem and she ignored me. i complain to the manager and nothing was ever done to her because we still went until I gave her no tip & never ever went back to their restaurant!!!
