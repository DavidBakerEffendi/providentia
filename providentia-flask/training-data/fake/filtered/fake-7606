Went to this restaurant for the first time with my cousin.  I never went before because I thought that it was a little pricey.  I have to say that it was wonderful. I had the sirloin at the habachi and even though the rice was a little salty for my taste I have to say I thuroughly enjoyed every bite.  The habachi chef at the table behind us was much more entertaining then our chef but that is ok!  Definately a place to go if you are in the area.
