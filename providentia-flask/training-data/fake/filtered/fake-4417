Am I missing something? My friends all love VPB and always want to go here...so I go, and every time I fail to love it the way they do. The beer isn't bad, but the food and the service are distinctly unimpressive. I do like the sweet potato fries, so my recommendation would be to go with some friends, get a pint or two and have some appetizers, but nothing more. The overall vibe is pretty good. Definetely do not order entrees. I don't know, I don't have anything against it, really...it's just kinda...boring.
