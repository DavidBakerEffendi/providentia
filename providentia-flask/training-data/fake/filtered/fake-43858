Good food and fast service, once the manager knew we were off to see a show in Hartford. We did not wait for a table despite being a party of 8. Wait staff was very attentive. The kitchen staff needs to learn how to stack large orders. It was obvious the simpler orders were ready long before the complex ones as the simple orders arrived lukewarm. We also had burnt toast on one order and a complete mistake on another. Both issues were corrected. Overall the food was good and I would go back.
