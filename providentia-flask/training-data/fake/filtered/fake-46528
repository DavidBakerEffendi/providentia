My husband and I really enjoy eating here.  The food is always fresh and served in reasonable portions (not huge).  They are now located on Columbus Ave in a bigger space.  I always feel like it's too noisy, except on our last trip there, we discovered the seating downstairs.  It was fantastic!  It's got booth seating, which is great for families with kids.  The wait staff are friendly, courteous, and prompt.  We've always been pleased with our meals, especially the octopus appetizer.  The traditional Greek salad is also tasty!  Definitely worth a trip if you're on the UWS.
