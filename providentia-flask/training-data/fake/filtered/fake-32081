I know this place for 10 years. One thing I don't like is waiting for long time to be seated because it is always busy. But I am soba noodle lover what can i do ! There are 3,4 soba places in new york city but here is the best ! Price is little expensive but it is valuable if you try this you will see it make sense.My favorate is tanuki soba this is about $12 and desert is wonderful, try satsuma puddiing which is flan with sweet potato, you will like homemade ice cream with yuzu taste,house radish taste, etc. Â green tea ice cream is pure taste!
