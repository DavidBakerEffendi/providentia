Food is really bad, everything is store bought from the hummus to the stuffed grape leaves. The meat was really dry, I asked for yogurt and they said they didnt have any, I mean yogurt is a basic staple for mid east dishes. They don't even have Doners and the rice is nasty too... sorry but for Â montclair you have to step up to the plate guys :(
