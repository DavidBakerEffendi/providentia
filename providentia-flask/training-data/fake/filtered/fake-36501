After Casa Mono, one of my favorite places, we followed up with Public. Public has been around for ages, back to the days when I lived in New York, but I had never gotten around to coming here.  It's a great space.  The food overall was extremely good, use of fresh, farm ingredients, in interesting combinations. Produce was first rate - the oysters and the venison were amazingly fresh, the combinations, such as the salsa verde and cabrales dumplings with venison were original and worked very well. We had initially planned on sharing the appetizers, but open the arrival of the foie gras (remember we had foie gras last night) and oysters, we decided I'd have the oysters and my friend would have the foie. Fried hama hama oysters with shiso, sansho peppers, and wasabi-yuzu dipping sauce - fresh oysters, perfectly deep fried which combined well with the peppers and the sweet, bitey sauce. I then had New Zealand venison loin perfectly prepared medium rare, tender and a nice gamey flavor, with salsa verde, on top of oyster mushrooms and cabrales dumplings, cabrales being a Spanish cheese, cows milk from the north of Spain, akin to a blue cheese. Sticky toffee pudding which reminded me of all those great sticky date puddings I had in Australia, so moist, sweet and rich, with Armagac ice cream, creamy with a bit of zing and hot toffee sauce.
