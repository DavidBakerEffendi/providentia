This place is a must-avoid on a Friday/Saturday night. Filled with Penn fraternity members, this place was like a dining hall combined with a frat party, complete with patrons throwing drinks across the room. The floors were sticky and covered with various fluids. The food was alright, but served extremely sparingly, Â despite being described as 'buffet style', with people serving themselves BY HAND. Perhaps worse was the communal drink policy, according to which the customers were requried to pour their liquor into a communal margarita pitcher (not frozen, with no salt, and a patron backwashing into it). This place was clearly attempting to spare as many expenses as possible - there were not enough seats for everyone, the food was served with styrofoam plates and a dearth of plastic utensils, and a waiter even searched for a "DJ" to work for free among the patrons. Drinks and ice were thrown at my table and other tables. The host merely shrugged and ignored any sort of indecency. Calling this filthy establishment a restaurant is a gross overstatement. It needs a serious reevaluation.
