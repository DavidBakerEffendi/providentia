I am SO EXCITED about this place. I live in the area, and I was walking home a slightly different way than usual and BAM: What's this I see? Warm bare tungsten bulbs, an lovely exposed brick wall, hand-chalked sign, wide-open front... It's so right that it smacked me in the face. I've never seen anything like it before in Bay Ridge. The bar tender flashed me a smile and I was hooked. I've been back 3 or 4 times since, and I'm always greeted by name and a handshake. Not only is the food Â delicious -- it has a local vibe; It is pleasantly rustic and creative. Try the pickles! And the burgers! And the latkes. My favorites so far. I can't wait to go for brunch. This is a gem.
