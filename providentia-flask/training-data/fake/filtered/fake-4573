Excellent. I went there on a random thursday moning I happened to wake up early, and took a couple books with me. The food was awesome, the servers were very cheerful, (but not the fake, nauseating kind of cheerful), and the vibe was exquisite. It was just such a NICE, happy place. There were people with dogs, a healthy portion of bubbly couples, dads with their kids, and tattooed bikers sitting side by side with cute old ladies. And a few girls in beautiful sundresses heh heh :D Oh yeah, and the food was killer. I had the eggs benedict - awesome spices on the hollondaise, crisp, buttery english muffin... eggs poached to perfection..... ulllllgghhh. The hashbrowns and peppers were interesting too - perfectly browned outside and soft moist inside, with a myriad of delicious spices. Definitely gets 5 stars from me. Can't wait to try everything else on the menu!
