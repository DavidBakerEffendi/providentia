The service is rather poor, but I have never been one to hold that against an establishment. Â Busy place= service issues. But, I must admit I was rather disappointed by the food. Our dishes were oily and not all that spicy (even through we ordered spicy food.) The patio was rather charming, but the trip was hardly worth it . . .
