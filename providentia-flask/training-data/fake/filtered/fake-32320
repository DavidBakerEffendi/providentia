So I usually won't eat any halal unless Â it's 53rd and 6th halal but after eating this i know why they are called the king of falafel the food was great as well as the customer service they even give free samples I can honestly say this was even better than 53rd thanks to my friend Bruno for bringing us the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they ran out of BBQ sauce will definitely return most likely next weekend lol
