Excellent South-Indian Vegetarian Food that has an authentic and delicious taste. There are a wide range of options including a variety of Dosas, Uttapams, Vadas, Idlis and deserts. These are accompanied by great chutneys and Sambhar. Overall, We *love* the food and service here. We especially recommend Â Tuesday and Friday nights which are the "All you can eat" buffet nights with different South-Indian and other regional foods (such as North Indian Chat and Pani-Puri). The owners are very attentive to the needs of the customers and the service is prompt and very courteous. We highly recommend this restaurant.
