Definitely the best thai food in Montclair. Now i have my favorite one in queens, but when i'm in Montclair and i'm craving Thai, spice II is where we go.   Was there a few weeks ago and had the Thai dumplings which comes with this amazing ginger sauce that i could literally drink by it self! the Chicken satay , which my kids always eat is juicy and very tasty. for our mains we always order the Kee-maw, and panang curry prawns, and basil fried rice which are all good. My only complaint is that when it does get busy, the wait can be a little long,they  must have a small kitchen, but definitely well worth the wait. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is nice and cozy. We'll be back soon!
