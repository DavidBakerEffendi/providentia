Oh Hu Kitchen how I love thee! This place is amazing-AMAZING!  I started going here just for the smoothies (I had heard good things)  My absolute fave is the Green Nebula-it's so good I always think about ordering two.... Recently I went back and decided to explore what else they had to offer. I had the Nutberry Oatmeal which was delish.  My friend had a quinoa bowl with veggies and loved it as well. Hu also offers lots of to-go options and yummy sweets (grain free fudge brownie I'm looking at you). So go...indulge and enjoy!
