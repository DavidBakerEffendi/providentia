If you like the idea of dining at Walmart on Black Friday, then Eataly is the place for you. If you've never experienced loathing for your fellow man, then go to Eataly on a Saturday and spend twenty minutes standing huddled at a bar with seven random strangers and their pointy elbows, eating a twenty dollar wedge of cheese and a block of stale bread, all while trying to catch the attention of a waitress who, for some reason, hates you with the fury of a thousand suns. This place is like some hellish labyrinth designed by an architect with a vendetta. Even if the food was extraordinary (it's not), and the service was decent (it's not, the waitstaff gets their cues from Luigi Risotto), it would not be worth an afternoon spent navigating this culinary jungle.
