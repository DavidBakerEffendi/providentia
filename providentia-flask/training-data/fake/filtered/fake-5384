Moving back to jersey has been an adjustment. Finding a great place to eat out is always a challenge. I was introduced to "Rice Bowl" the first time I mentioned I like Chinese Food. The food has continued to please my stomach and my clients that I continue to them to. Rice Bowl is one of those places that just keeps evolving taste wise at such a wonderful affordable price. And their home made Ice Teas are always refreshing
