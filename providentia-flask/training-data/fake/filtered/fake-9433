When they say "little", it's no joke, as this Fire Marshall's nightmare has maybe 10 tables in all. But once you're seated, all of that becomes meaningless, since the food is wonderful. The small menu manages to provide surprising variety, and everything came out hot, fresh and delicious. Fairly priced. Decent wine list. A very good meal in a quaint setting. Highly recommended.
