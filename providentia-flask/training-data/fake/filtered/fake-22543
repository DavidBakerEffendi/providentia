This place used to get 5 stars from me. Definitely not anymore. Their food is great in-person, and they're nice people, but when I order delivery, I expect the same high quality food and service. I don't want a pizza that is impossible to eat because of poor delivery. I don't want mozzarella sticks that are raw, crushed, and have all the marinara sauce from the container spilled all over them. I don't want to pay for extra cheese just to get a terribly saucy and cheeseless pizza. Come on, Del Rossi's! You're so much better than that in-person. Why can't you do the same for delivery???
