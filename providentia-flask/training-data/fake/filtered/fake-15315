Went there with my boo on Friday night (04/19).  The small place was packed, so we gladly put our name down & grabbed a drink elsewhere.  When we returned we were seated promptly.  The place was still jammin and lots of parties were waiting for a table to be available.  Our host/busser/server/runner was the same person.  She was lovely & apologetic, but the service suffered because the place was so understaffed.  Every table was looking around for something, the check, more water, more wine..  We were looking around for our drinks.  They came after the appetizers.  We couldn't even drink them because we were stuffed with salty food and wanted to get down to our main course.  Maybe the bartender (the only other front of the house person) could of walked them over, or maybe he was weeded too.  In any event we paid for our drinks that we didn't drink and tipped 20% on service that wasn't good.  Cafe Ghia, I hope someone called out because if this is how you operate every Friday night you're giving real bad service.  The server was so sweet, but no one can do the job of 3 people.
