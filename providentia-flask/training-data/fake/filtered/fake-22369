I am giving it one star because I have no choice, can't leave my review without giving it a rating!  The place was nice, the service was OK, but the food was horrible!!!  First, the artichoke that was ordered for an appetizer was hard and not cooked, awful!  The waitress took it back and no replacement was offered.  My co-workers ordered  the steak special.  They ordered their steaks medium rare and I ordered the chicken parm.  We got our food after 40 minutes, the restaurant was not packed, only a couple of tables were occupied.  Their steaks were RAW!!  Not rare, bloody and cold!  One of my of them sent hers back and was returned burned!  When she complained about it to the waiter, the chef/owner came out and started to argue with her that the steak was cooked and she should eat it!!!  My co-worker was so embarrassed and we were embarrassed for her!  Imagine, the so called chef coming out and arguing with a customer about her food!  When she said that she didn't want it, he went on and on about it, very loud! The other co-worker was afraid to say anything and took hers home for her dog!  My chicken parm was awful!  How can you mess up chicken parm!!  Well they managed to, the breading was nasty and the sauce was watery..  The only thing good about it whole dinner, was the water and it was free!!  Stay away from this place!!!  This nasty dinner experience cost us over $250.00!!  without tip!!  This was my first and last time in this restaurant!
