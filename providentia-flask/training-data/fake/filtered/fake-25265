I been coming to caf√© Mogador for years now, although I usually go to their East Village location I decided to give a shot to their new place in Williamsburg. The design is amazing, very welcoming feeling. The food is very taste, you get a real Moroccan authentic meal, my favorite is the Grilled Hanger Steak its so juice. Its a great place for a weekend brunch.
