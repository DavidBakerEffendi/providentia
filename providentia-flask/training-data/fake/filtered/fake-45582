I could give this place five stars for the almond cookies alone.  Do yourself a favor and try them; they are spectacular!   More generally, this bakery has a wide selection of excellent cookies and pastries.  The bread is great by most standards, but not the best I've tried in the Franklin Ave area, which has serious competition among good bakeries.   The staff have been exceptionally friendly every time I've visited.  This shop is definitely worth a visit.
