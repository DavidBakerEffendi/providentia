I have to say, this is one of my favourite bars of all time. My fiancee and I were holidaying from Australia, and happened to be staying around the corner. Not only was the bar inviting and comfortable, but I have never felt more welcome in a bar in my life. This place is clearly owned and staffed by people who love working in this bar and who know they are giving their customers great produce. In the 2 days we went, we had the happy hour special which is great value (6 oysters of any kind + any beer for $12, can't get better than that!), were given great advice about where we should go in the East Village for food/drinks and general sightseeing and were offered free beer samples and fed complementary whiskey cake. I am sad to be on the other side of the world, because I'd proudly call Upstate my local.
