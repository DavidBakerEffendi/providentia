We've discovered our new favorite stop for lunch and brunch!  Burgers are superb, and the gyros tasty-perfect.  We're fans of diner food, and this is the area's best, bar none.  It's a little out of the way - read "middle of nowhere" - but it's worth the drive from just about anywhere.  Prices are very affordable, and the service is neighborhood-friendly.
