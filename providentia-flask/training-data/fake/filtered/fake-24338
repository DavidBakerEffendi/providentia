If I could rate zero stars, I most certainly would! let me start by saying that this used to be one of my favorite places to order from. they recently modified their menu, and now, not only did they remove literally ALL of their good food/half of the menu, but now there is legit NO options for modification on their remaining items. I tried to order a 'build your own burrito' and they refused to serve me ground beef (their reply was 'well if you try to order beef, I will just chop your steak real small') and there is no option at all to remove onions and peppers or do anything differently! on a BUILD YOUR OWN burrito! let me finish by saying that the man who was on the phone with me was rude, wouldn't let me speak, wouldn't let me ask questions, and was just in general very short and unpleasant with me. bottom line- this place sucks and I can't possibly fathom how they could be open much longer, and I hope they are not!
