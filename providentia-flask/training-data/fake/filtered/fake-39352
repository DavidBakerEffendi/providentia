This place is literally just steps away from my apartment. I love the French inspired cuisine as well as the fact that the menu changes every so often. It seems as if each time I've been there, the menu offers a different variety. The menu, however, is very small. Those who like having many options might not enjoy the experience. It can also be loud because it is next to the elevated JMZ train. The atmosphere, however, is quite cozy. Make sure you cash when you go, as they do not accept credit cards. It is worth it though. Trust me on that.
