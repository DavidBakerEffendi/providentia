Finally someone got it right in NYC. I Â can't but just love this place. As someone who is from Italy, I can say you got the right stuff!!! Keep it coming! Meatballs amazing! Pizza WOW, not the American over cheesed stuff but just the right amount of great ingredients. Servers and Staff very attentive and very sweet. Great wine selection also. I can't wait to add to this from my future returns. Thanks for a great experience, and the desert was divine!
