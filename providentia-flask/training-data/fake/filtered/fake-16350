This corner deli can't be missed they always have bags of charcoal outside the door.But the best is inside.They have the nicest freshest fruit and vegetables nicely displayed.I love the massive display of fresh rolls and pastries and always fresh.These Portugese know how to please.But the real deal is the Owner who takes great pride in his butcher dept.His meats are top grade.I am a Hamburgerand Steak fan and my wife is Portugese but he takes his time to explain the difference between his meats and supermarket brand.I purchased burgers and steaks and my God He was on the money.He was not throwing a sales pitch but he was telling me the truth .He does have the best tasting meats in the area.It''s hard to believe that such quality can be found in a little corner deli.I call it a diamond in the rough. If you're looking looking for a Old School,Old World Experience in taste and customer experience come to Simoes you'll be glad you did.  They also  make awesome deli sandwiches from the different size Portugese rolls.The prices are very awesome.These people and the guys behind the butcher block are so friendly.                                                             Gus Mimikos
