I have been going to CO Jones at least once a week for almost 2 years.  There drinks were great, but there food was definitely the main reason I would go.  I loved how much variety they had, and how they had all the basic options for burrittos and quesdillas, but also some interesting unique options.  I recommended CO Jones to EVERYONE for good Mexican food.  And the atmosphere was friendly and inviting, and the staff welcome our regularity.  However, last night I went there ready to try their new menu and was EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED.  Everything on the menu was gone, everything was different.  There are no more basics, bye bye Chicken Fajita Quesidilla, Hello SQUID TACO! Its terrible, its nothing but another trendy, pretenious resturant in New Haven.  The staff is completely different, not as friendly and welcoming, the seating setup is completey unaccomodating (which I had already known because they changed this a few weeks earlier), and when it came down to it the food wasnt even that good!  The quality (and quantity) was much better before.  I left there hungry and incredibly disappointed. This place is good if you're into that trendy crap but if you were a CO Jones regular like I was, be prepared to be disappointed.  I defintely will not be going back weekly, if ever.
