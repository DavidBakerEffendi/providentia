Long story short: - Food is great - Staff is f* shit Waitress for rude because my girlfriend didn't order wine immediately, in Europe we like to pair the wine with our food.. Same waitress forgot to put bread on the table and sneered when we asked for it. I've been looking around for a new glass of (too expensive) wine but there was no one who would look our way. After the main course we had a cheese platter, again no wine was served. After the cheese platter we got presented the check.. But we still wanted desert and coffee. After the plate with the cheesecake was literally thrown on my table I had enough of it and decided not to tip at all. This was really the worst customer service we've experienced in NY
