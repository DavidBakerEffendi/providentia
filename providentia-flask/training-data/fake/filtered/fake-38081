I have been to Samba twice now and have thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  The food, service and ambiance are all outstanding.  Last time, we had a special appetizer which was like a chicken salad, but so much better than any chicken salad I've ever had.  I asked it they served it for lunch on a sandwich, but they said they did not.  My shrimp entree in like a tomato broth served with rice was so good that my husband can't wait to go back so he can order it.  My husband rarely orders salmon and he's ordered it both times we were there.  I also really enjoyed the tilapia with the shrimp sauce.  I'm not really a big dessert person but I really enjoyed the passion fruit mousse and the flan like dessert with the coconut.  The atmosphere of the restaurant feels like it could be located somewhere in The Village.  Looking forward to returning again very soon.
