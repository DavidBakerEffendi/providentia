I'll be quick and concise. This is not a good restaurant. One main issue is the fact that the sodas are four dollars each and there are no free refills! This is obviously a sign of owners who are not aware of American customs yet. Another problem is the communication. The server that we had are barely understandable and it's impossible to request even a slice of lemon. It's understandable that with Rhong-Tiam serving thai food, there would be many dishes with coconut milk, however, almost every dish is just drowned in it causing the dishes to lack flavor. All in all, not a good restuarant. Does not belong in Plainsboro. Stick to Aljons, Romeos, and Steak and Hoagie.
