Very poor service, long wait for the food and it comes cold. The worse aspect of the dinning experience is the neglectful and negative attitude by the waitresses. For example, we had to ask for coffee three times with no success. When my wife was there with her friends for lunch they reported similar experience and will not go back. My friends and I tried the place three times and the experience had the same results. We are also not going there again.
