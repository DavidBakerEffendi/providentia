Amazing subs, I usually go with a hot roast beef w mozarella and gravy. My only complaint is that there is no dedicated pickup line at the register. If you order ahead and go in when it is very busy to pick up subs you still have to wait for everyone to order and pay before you can even say you are picking up an order.
