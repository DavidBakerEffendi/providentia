This place is easily the best chinese spot in town. While I was in there I was chatting with another customer and they were from Fairlawn. They came all the way to bloomfield just to enjoy their food! After dinner I can see why! I've lived around the area for a couple years now and I have tried pretty much all of the places around bloomfield/belleville and this is by far the best. I order the mai fun and the general tso chicken and they were seasoned beautifully. Will be coming back quite often to try the rest of the menu!
