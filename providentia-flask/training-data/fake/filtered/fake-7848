This  place has exceptional food for a pub and although it can pretty busy, it is worth waiting in line for if you have never been.  Sadly, the last time I went (about 2 months ago) they charged me for the fries with my burger!  I personally think fries should just come with a burger, but hey that is just my opinion.  Also, try the Woodcuck hard cider...it's local and very very good.
