Great sandwiches and salads. Some of the best on their menu include: Meatloaf sandwich (with chipotle mayo, grilled onions, cheese, and pico), buffallo chicken sandwich (their cutlets are seasoned and cooked perfectly), Oriental salad, and philly cheese steak. Slightly higher prices, but also a higher quality of food.
