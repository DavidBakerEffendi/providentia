I had the bread with nutella.  7 Dollars for three small pieces of burnt toast, not even whole pieces.  What the hell guys.  That is crazy, never again.  I'll get the coffee, but no more food for me there.  Their prices are outrageous.  Once again local restaurants trying to make a quick buck from the locals.  Not cool.
