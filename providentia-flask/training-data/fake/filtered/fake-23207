If I could give it zero stars I would. I guess the one star can be for the food. It was ok. Waited 25 minutes for our waitress to come over and even welcome us. Waited another 25 minutes for drinks, and we only had soda. Then after 24 additional minutes we hadn't even gotten our appetizer. The waitress brought out free guacamole. Waited 25 more minutes then she kept asking us if we wanted more chips. Still no appetizer. We cancelled it. 30 minutes later our entree comes. We eat it. We see a cockroach crawling down the wall. The waitress brings free dessert. Finally the check comes and the appetizer we never got was on the bill. Needless to say it was a miserable experience.
