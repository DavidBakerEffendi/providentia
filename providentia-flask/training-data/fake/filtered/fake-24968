My papa's cousin was Carlo Denino- the owner. When he passed, his daughter Carla took over. She's the best! Also, most of my cousins work there, so it's not really fair, but they are nice, funny, efficient, and great chefs! The pizza is best around. When I asked my friends in school Â "hey, have you heard of Deninos?" My friend went "yeah! My dad takes me there all the time!" Then he went on his iPad and searched it up and he found that it's a place very well known in Europe and Europeans come here just to eat at Deninos. My friends from Louisiana said it was the best. Honestly, the decor is amazing, the food is amazing, the staff is, we'll... My cousins. But they're amazing too! EVERYTHING IS FREAKIN AMAZING YOU HAVE TO GO HERE !!!!!!
