I came here before my flight to China last year for some real food before I'm stuck with airplane food. My uncle worked here for many years and still does so we got a table really quick and food came out quick too. I wasn't sure what some of the dishes were since my uncle ordered but they were delicious. We had xiao long bao which was a soup dumpling. It was so great that we ordered another one. At the end, I had fried milk for the first time and it was awesome. They gave us a lot free drinks some pomegranate flavored in a bottle that I wasn't too fond of. Great experience overall!
