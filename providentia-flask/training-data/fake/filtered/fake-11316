OK....I've got to say, that I've been twice now and really loved it both times!  I think it's a fun setup.  Shopping in an uber-Balducci's type setting with a great variety of delicious cafes throughout.   It's not cheap at all...and can be quite busy too.  But, get over it...it's FUN and the food is delicious and fresh!  I've eaten at the wine bar area, which is like eating in the courtyard of a festive Italian town.  I ate at the pasta cafe which was terrific.  And, the last time I went I ate at the seafood cafe...equally as delicious and very fresh.   I'd take out-of-towners here any day of the week.  GO!
