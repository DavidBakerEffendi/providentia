I picked up some take out from there on a Wednesday night, and the two dishes were OK.  There was nothing really fancy nor authentic about their food.  The Panang curry was more like rice with a very light curry sauce mixed in.  More hot than flavor. I have spent time in Thailand, and try to frequent as many Thai restaurants around the country in my business travels, and I would only rate this one as OK.
