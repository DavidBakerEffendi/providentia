Good Food, great beer selection, very convient and fast, and a good value I have only eaten off of the lunch and dinner menu, but I have not been disappointed the 3 times I dined.  The sandwhiches are simple but yummy, the mussels were fabulous, and our services was fast.  I think the prices are reasonable too, where else can you get that quality of beer and food for two people and have it only cost $30??  This place has fast become our go to eatery when we don't want to cook.
