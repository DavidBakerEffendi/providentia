Otolith Seafood is a welcoming, innovative, green, and fair priced seafood market.  The owners are very knowledgeable and welcome any  questions you may have.  Their events are great too.  They use their own product to showcase the quality and it shows. Overall, I recommended that everyone at least try some of their product, if not to take home then at an event.
