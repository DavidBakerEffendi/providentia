AWESOME food!  If you can get past the smell of the entire restaurant, the food is REALLY good!  I visited Philly with my mom and her friend and they were craving some bbq Chinese meats.  We saw some hanging through the window and they all looked really decent so went in to give it a shot. Walking in, we were met with a wall of stench - it was rather rancid, like 2 year old gym socks mixed with some rotting stuff. I'm really surprised we stayed because on a regular basis, we would have hightailed it right out!  It was DEFINITELY worth ignoring the stench (we got used to it after a while). The BBQ meats were flavorful and very tasty, and all our other entrees were on our top 5 lists! They seem to do alot of take out, especially to lots of families and families that order just the BBQ meats.  We will DEFINITELY come here again!
