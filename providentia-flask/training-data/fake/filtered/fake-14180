One of the best lunch places in the area, in terms of food.  Really good sandwiches. Beware of the crowd within--and don't forget your design-ey tee and hot jeans before you order. Recommended highly for the food itself.  If you are wearing a polo and khakis as I was when I went during the summer.......go a different day.
