I have to say I find simple ingredients the best when it comes to Mexican food, nice bold ingredients that stand on their own ...we enjoyed your beef taco and chorizo we tried five all different last weekend, also I am a cilantro lover, that said most of the tacos we had that night were swimming in cilantro..Fresh tasting guacamole but as others have said a bit bland and the salsa was bland also, we didn't try the Verde.  The ceviche left a lot to be desired if it hadn't been takeout I would have returned the dish I seldom throw away a 10.00 appetizer but one bite and that was it I simply could not eat it.. Growing up in New Mexico and eating Mexican food all my life does make me a tough critic, but I was disappointed overall and believe me I long for a Taqueria that could be a weekly watering hole. I love corn tortillas but these were over cooked as were the chips that came with the salsa on the edge of being to overdone.. When I pay 40.00  for dinner for two, for 5 tacos,salsa,guacamole and ceviche,I expected it to be a better experience.  We love the Farmhouse and eat there frequently and we were looking forward to feeling the same here..  This is one time that the farm to table just didn't come through and we love supporting local food and locally owned establishments, I may try again I hope it improve because at this point I wouldn't recommend this to my friends.  I wish them good luck and hope that all these comments that all the people have left get read and that they make some changes because it could be a fun place. We had takeout so I can't speak to service although the Woman who took my phone order was nice and helpful.
