There's always something fun and new to try at Reading Terminal Market.  They have tons of meat counters, seafood counters, mini farmer's markets, and sandwich joints.  If you don't know what you want for lunch, just take a stroll through here and you'll be sure to find something that will get your mouth watering.  The only downside is that it gets quite crowded and closes kinda early (in my mind), I think around 6 or so..
