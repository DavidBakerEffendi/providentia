I came here for the first time with three other people.  None of us got the Pho, though it sounds like we should have.  If I came here again, I would try the Pho, but I expect that other restaurants nearby would be more appealing.  The food here is cheap in price and quality, but you get a lot of food for what you pay.  I would rather get less food of a higher quality. The waiter was not as rude as we expected from other reviews.  He was only a little curt with one of us, but also spontaneously provided helpful information about dishes before we ordered. My curry was appropriately spicy, but had lower-grade chicken.  The peas in it were great, but the bamboo was not.  One of us got a seafood dish full of imitation-seafood, which was very disappointing and not mentioned on the menu.  I would never expect imitation-meats at a restaurant.  Rice and noodles were good, and vegetables were good in all dishes, but the meats were consistently poor.  Portions were unnecessarily huge. The bathroom was relatively clean and comfortable.  The place was crowded and loud, but that did not bother me.
