I have gone to dickie dees for years just for their italian hot dogs, my boyfriend has never had one so we decided to drive there all the way from nutley (although there are places closer) we went to dickie dees bc i have aten there multiple times and was never diappointed. Although this time when we got there me and my boyfriend were the only customers in there along with three men who worked there one who wa sitting at a table drinking a beer while working and the other behind the counter makin the hot dogs. The entire time we were there they were being loud and obnoxious laughing hysterical screaming and making littlw comments feom the time i had ordered untill the time we left. I was sure they were laughing at us bc as we were eating i heard the one guy say to the other that he was elbow deep in his nose and while i took a bite he made a slurping noise snd said eat up i guess by his comments he was saying that he picked his nose n then made our food and to him it was funny .. We just wanted to leave and not even pay but we finished our food payed our bill and left as we were walking out the door the one worked screamed eat up bitch .. I thought it was extremely immature and not how employees should act ehile someone drove over just for your food from another town and was trying to how my bf how great the place and there food was unfourtunately we will not be going back to dickie dees even though i really enjoy their cooking and food next time i want an italian hot dog i will try the place Â by me .. By the way the one man had longer hair pulled back jnto a ponytail with a hat on and he other had short hair eith a goatee .. Oh and not only was te experience horrible but i had to repeat my order three times to him before mking it becaue he was to busy laughing and paying attention to the orher guy and then had to adk for my drinks three times before getting the two cans of soda.
