SO not good.  We ordered a Caesar salad, one of their "gourmet" pizzas, and a penne with pesto sauce and chicken.  The Caesar salad came out first and that was the first red flag.  The first thing we noticed was that the majority of the "greens" were, in fact, brown.  We ate around them as best we could, but after a few bites, realized that eating around the brown lettuce was pointless.  There was absolutely no taste to the salad, it was as if they just gave us a plate of brown lettuce with a few croutons and cheese. Horrible.  So we were hoping that was just a fluke, and that it was entirely possible that no one from the kitchen to the server noticed the salad they were serving us. So our pizza and penne came out.  The pizza was ok, but definitely not worth the ridiculous price.  The penne, however, was awful.  The pesto sauce that was listed on the menu had no pesto flavor whatsoever and was basically penne tossed in olive oil.  The chicken in the pasta was also fairly scary. It was extremely dry and chewy, and tasted as though it was cooked three weeks ago and set aside for when people want to add chicken to a dish.  I'm usually easy to please when it comes to food, but I also have this crazy notion that when people spend their hard-earned money on food dining out, the food should actually taste and look appealing. Save your money with this place, there is much better food in the city and you could probably find better quality food in garbage cans.
