I can't go back.  They have discontinued grinding beans.  Since moving to Philly, I have probably bought about $500 worth of beans here and they always made the trek downstairs to grind my beans.  Not anymore says the woman working this morning. Buy your coffee across the street at DiBruno Bros.  The generic "DiBruno" coffee is La Columbe and it's $2 cheaper.  Cool staff with eagerness to help.   They will grind the beans for you there, too.
