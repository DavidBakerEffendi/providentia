My favorite pizza! I come here for the regular and Â sicilian pizzas. Their pizzas have a generous amount of sauce and their pizza bread is soft. Over all a mouthwatering juicy pizza. The sicilian pizzas are soft and full of cheese; while the crust is crispy with a hint of butter. My family has been going to this place since before I was born for good reasons.
