Yeay!  They fry in PEANUT oil. Unfortunately, the clueless amongst us have posted.  Peanut oil is one of the more healthier oils to be used in cooking.  Furthermore, diets high in peanut oil are as effective as olive oil in protecting against heart disease and are more heart healthy than very low fat diets are. Remember kiddies, a *little* knowledge is a *dangerous* thing.   Google is your friend.
