Today at lunch my guest was served a salad with a live cockroach in it. When this was pointed out to a waiter there was no response from him other than to take the salad to the kitchen and return to our table with another one. No apology was offered by the waiter, by any staff member or by management. It was bewildering behavior. We left the restaurant.
