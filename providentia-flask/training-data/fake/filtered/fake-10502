Went Friday night with small group.  What a great evening! We walked into the cute and cozy restaurant and at 8pm it was pretty busy -- all tables full -- but we were quickly greeted and they immediately began evaluating how to accommodate us.   Once we were seated, we started with cocktails -- there are 10 to choose from and was tough to choose as they each looked interesting.  Of the 3 I tried, all of them tasty, I ended up liking their margarita the best.  Everyone in the group really enjoyed their drinks. We started with the guacamole while perusing the menu options.  It was exactly what guacamole should be - creamy avocado and very fresh.  We were having a tough time choosing on the small plates and ended up letting Lisa (one of the owners) select some items for us -- the empanadas, chile relleno, and the vegetarian Mexican lasagna were all just amazing.  The flavors were just right and the presentation quite lovely.   Friendly and accommodating service, fun drinks and deliciously filling food made for a great evening.
