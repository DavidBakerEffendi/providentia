Sabrinas Cafe on Christian Street is absolutely our favorite place to eat! We have become regulars there because the food is always delicious and the service is great. A few of our favorites are the fried calamari light and crispy and the marinara sauce is spicy but not too hot, the greek salad which is served with pita bread and hummus. Mels chicken cutlet is so delicious with spinach, cheese and long hots, the fish tacos (very tasty) and i really love the salmon with sweet potato mash! Â You will love this place!
