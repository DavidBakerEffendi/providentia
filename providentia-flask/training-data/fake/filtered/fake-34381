Conclusion (Feb. 2009): There are better Italian restaurants in this city with both better service and better food for the same price. Try Centolire or Gnocco. This restaurant serves bland, overcooked pasta (priest stranglers were an insult to pasta; Trader Joe's sauces on al dente pasta would knock the socks off most of the pastas served here). Risotto was passable, mostly thanks to the seafood. The bread was tasteless, some pieces were slightly burned. Their versions of appetizers like the Mozzarella di Bufala and the bruschettas were simple and would take little skill to do (better) yourself. I saw nothing on the table (group of 10) that was prepared well or would have required particular skill. The staff was efficient but that's about it. When we first arrived, the host gave us a lecture on how we were behind "schedule" and repeated several times that we'll have to leave by 9:30. He was acting like it wasn't going to be worth his time to seat us for the 2 hours remaining of our reservation window. Hopefully we made it up to him with the $400 we left there, but we won't be back again. (I'll post this review elsewhere, since I hear Yelp lets restaurants pay them to remove posts.)
