Locanda Verde is a perfect spot for brunch, lunch and dinner.  It has a great cozy atmosphere with a reasonable noise level.  You can even pick up coffee and pastries on the go if you don't have time to sit down for a full meal.   The menu offers diners varied choices to select from -- whether you're craving fried chicken, seared scallops, pasta or seasonal vegetables all for relatively affordable prices.  The wine list, whether by the glass or bottle, offers something for everyone. Overall, a great addition to Tribeca!
