Went to Black Eyes Sallys last night with a friend and my cousin, celebrating my cousins 50th birthday. Less than stellar experience.  Waitstaff was bad. Wait time was awful and the place was not very busy when we got there about 6.  Staff had no enthusiasm, did not have the warm Louisiana feel you would expect. I had blackened catfish (no flavor) but the rice and red beans was very good. My cousin and friend had the mac and cheese, which Sally should have gotten a black eye for that. Although, they did very much like the fried chicken and collard greens.  Waitress did not recommend anything or even come back to check if we needed anything would have tried a dessert but she brought us the check. Guess it meant time for us to go home. Then as we were leaving hostess and several employees were at the door, no one said a word, just talked amongst themselves, Not a bye, thanks for coming, how was your meal nothing.  Wow, we just spent $114 in your restaurant and we dont even get a have a good nite. Last time I was here was when it first opened, should have kept it that way, had better memories from then. Not going back to many 50/50 experiences, with the food, staff. etc. Oh and you cant tell the staff from customers, they just wear anything.  We needed extra napkins and didnt realize about 3 staff persons had walked by til we saw them go to tables to take orders. We thought they were customers. Not good presentation of professional staff.  Seems like a way to save money by the owner. You would not see this in Louisiana.
