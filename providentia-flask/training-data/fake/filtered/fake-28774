A really quaint little restaurant where the dining is split across the first and third floors of the building with a cosy bar situated on the second floor. The food was good, staff were friendly and the wine list was decent. I felt like this location offered a little peace from the craziness of the New York streets and dining scene and, being so close to Times Sq and the Theater District, that can be hard to achieve. I would recommend a stop-off to the Hourglass Tavern. Definitely pre-book as it's a small venue.
