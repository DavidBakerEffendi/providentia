CUBAN PETE's is SLACKING ! I used to love this place. A few years ago, I was completely in love. The ambiance was great. The food was superb, the customer service was attentive but my have things changed. The last four times I've gone, my orders have been messed up and some of the waiters were down right rude! I would see my waiter about three times, once when they took my order, once when they gave my food and once to pick up the bill. I had to wait so long that I didn't even get any refills and I stayed for nearly two hours. This is not right. This place would be so great if they had more staffing. Also, my waiter completely forgot when I requested twice for them to greet my aunt on her birthday. The place is crammed, loud and lack staff. They need to have customer service training. They also messed up my order twice in one day. I am so disappointed with their customer service. It's a shame. I keep coming back thinking things will get better but they haven't. Â  I give two stars because their food is okay, but again, their waiters are terrible.
