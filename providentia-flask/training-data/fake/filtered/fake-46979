Went last saturday night, second time there this year. The first time was fantastic and this time equals. We were determined to simply share some pastas, but the special was the suggling pig..how could we resist...outstanding. My best meal this year (sorry Gramercy Tavern). The place is beautiful and confortable, the service i outstanding and the food near perfection............. everything from cocktails to dessert was perfect. I will be back..over and over again. Actually I was tempted to write a bad review just to keep everyone else away...but that would be selfish. Enjoy.
