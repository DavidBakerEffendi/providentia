The DW has a great eclectic crowd and exceptional food. I've been there a few times and always wind up leaving after a great conversation, great food, and awesome beer. Also, I'm kind of obsessed with Mindy - she's not only charming and attentive, but gorgeous. Cheers DW - great experience all around.
