PRINCE STREET between Elizabeth and Mott. I love the atmosphere of Cafe Habana. In NYC, or any cities in the world, there are certain places where you can just hang out and automatically get recognized as the "cool" and the "hip" regardless of who you are. Cafe Habana is known for that sort of instant hipster-generator effect. And then, the food! Cuban sandwich and the corn will satisfy you very well!!! One thing I always find uncomfortable about this place is the space! The limited space only allow us to have a couple inches between tables. So my elbows always hit persons sitting next to me. The crowded environment, however, signifies the dining experience at Cafe Habana. Plus, food DOES compensate for the uncomfortableness.
