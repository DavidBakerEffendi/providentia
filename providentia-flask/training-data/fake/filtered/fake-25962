Service overall is good. Food is awesome. One of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Don't know why people like midtown.  Adriennes has great salads.... Siciliana, margarita, sausage/broccoli rob pizzas are the best.  No better place to spend a nice summer night than outside on stone st at adriennes.......
