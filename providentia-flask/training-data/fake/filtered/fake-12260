The turkey burger earned these stars! Delicious, fresh and came out quickly. The draft beer selection is good too. Bartender walked past (I was sitting at bar), my empty pint 3 times (& looked at it!!), before I had to ask for more. I know that seems frivolous BUT as a former bartender, I know that you're tips depend on the attention you give your patrons. See my empty glass...offer to fill it!!!
