My experience was good but not exceptional. If food and only food is your thing, then you'll probably give this place an honest four stars. The peppery bark, as someone put it,  gives it a good kick. The fatty cut left just enough juice to negate the desire for a sauce and left just enough to be absorbed by the white bread.  SOLID. The service was alright.  Maybe once all the hype dies down, prices slim a bit ( You already knew a :[ was coming with that $20 a LB price), and they get a booze. It might be a "go-to 'move' ". Until then, I see it being an occasional delicacy.
