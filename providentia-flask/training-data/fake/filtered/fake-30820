I ate at this joint tonight and I'm real sorry I did! It was awful! You have to order food at the window, and then wait for what seems an eternity until they decide to bring it. Drinks are separate, and you must order them at the bar - IF you can catch the bartender's attention! I asked for an iced tea, but they didn't have any. Huh? When the burger came, it was decent, but half the size of what you'd get at Five Guys for the same money! Oh and talk about "ambience"! Whoever told the previous reviewer that no children were allowed after 5:00 wasn't there the night I was! Right in front of me were two couples with two infants. And no, I'm not a patron of Farrell's, as a previous reviewer who posted a 5-star review would have you believe! I just like to have a nice, quiet meal free of the whining of bratty children and that I don't have to wait for until Kingdom Come! Why eat at this dump when you can eat at the Windsor Care or at Fez Cafe farther up the block?
