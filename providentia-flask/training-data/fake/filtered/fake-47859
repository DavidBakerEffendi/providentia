With apologies to "Cheers", if you want to go to a place "where everybody knows your name and is glad to see you"  go on down to this place. It is a real "joint" and I mean that only in the best way.  Great old-fashioned place, and I know whereof I speak being in my seventh decade.  All ages, every kind of patron.  Want a great roast beef sandwich with horse radish and a mug of beer, this is the place!!!
