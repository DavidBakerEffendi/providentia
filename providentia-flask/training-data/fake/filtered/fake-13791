My food was really good.  I had a petite fillet Mignon. Our appetizers were awesome. The atmosphere & service was also good.   BUT be prepared to pay!  Drink prices are really higher than the average place. (In my opinion) One thing though - we had a drink at the bar before we sat to eat and the bartender actually snubbed us for friends of hers that showed up after us!
