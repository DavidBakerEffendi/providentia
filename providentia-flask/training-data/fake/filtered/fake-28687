The Malt House was not only the perfect bar for my boyfriend and I, it also was part of a memory that will last a lifetime. We are city visitors being that we live only 30 minutes outside and we walked by The Malt House while waiting for our dinner reservations down the street. The bouncer had such a great personality and the ambiance was so pretty from outside that we had to come inside to check it out. Their beer selections were great as well as it being served in mason jars,which I loved.  We had a drink and left for dinner and I said we just had to go back later on. It was fun with an amazingly friendly staff.  Later on my boyfriend ended up proposing, which I had no clue at all and it was the most amazing moment of my life and now we can visit The Malt House to always remember our favorite moment. The owner Darren is so friendly and personal, they really make you feel like part of the family.  Like I said this was a great find. Good beer, great staff and beautiful ambiance.
