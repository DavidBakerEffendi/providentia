My girlfriend and I ate at here last week but I have to admit I had one of the best steaks (filet) that I ever had and I love red meat.  It was better then the Capitol Grill or Mortons (My opinion anyway).  Don't know what the girlfriend ate and I don't care, mine was too good to pay attention.  She did mention that she loved it as well.  She always nit-picks places to my annoyance but I am glad to have had a little piece and quiet, which is the ultimate compliment for the place.  Staff was friendly and punctual and the price was surprisingly reasonable.
