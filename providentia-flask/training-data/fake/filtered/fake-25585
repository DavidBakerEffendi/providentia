Visiting family in nj and needed some decent grub for everyone.I wished I ate in instead of taking the food back to my relatives house. My mouth dropped when I took the cheese fries out of the bags. The cheese fries were burnt, greasy, unrecognizable and unfit for human consumption. The meatball sub was bland and the sauce was pretty bad. My cheesesteak was actually not too bad. If it wasn't snowing I would have taken the food back for a refund. Wish I read the reviews before I went here.
