I went to Eataly Italy twice in two days ... saturday night 7pm and told 90 wait for table, so sunday night returned and got instant table for two at fish restaurant. Octopus started was devine as was the salad for a light start. My partners fish main was NOT nice.  The Halibut special was an over cooked piece of "what could have been".  I had the scallops which was what it said on the menu and 'nice'. atmosphere was great with a great buzz of people and venue.   Service was disappointing.... waitress looking around at other tables and people as mentioning the specials ... waitress asks 'how's everything' during meal, and before i can respond she has turned around to another table and not even listening .. The best move was the gratuity example amounts circled in ball point pen for me to 'notice' when signing the credit card slip... desert (two small italian delights? passionfruit something, and nanoli?) was delicious with a lovely espresso made by a really nice barista. i'd go for the venue and atmosphere, but not the meal...
