Where I live in East Hartford Chef Greg worked just around the corner and that restaurant was my Favorite place to eat because of him.  Homemade sweet potato ravioli with a balsamic drizzle and fried basil...ummmm. The most amazing innovative dishes, everything was a treat from soup- Tomato Sausage Florentine, one of my favs, to desert- that summer he played with creating ice cream flavors, I have to say the ricotta tart with basil ice cream was crazy good!! Nolita's made their BEST move inviting Greg to this lovely place where he is encouraged to create his wonderful, delicious, gifts.  We had a reservation for 9 last  Friday and each and everyone LOVED the soups, entrees, and deserts that we sampled. Thank you for giving Chef Greg the best quality ingredients and a place to create his flavorful art.
