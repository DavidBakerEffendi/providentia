This place 100% gets 5 stars. I always get annoyed by places that set up shop in developing areas that are WAY overpriced, but this place is not that at all! It's trendy, but welcoming to everyone and very down to earth. The prices are very affordable and totally worth it. They have an incredible happy hour special that they even have on weekends! This place is so great, and their meatballs and every single pie is amazing. Don't miss out on the delicious hazelnut gelato either :)
