Certainly not the best falafel I've ever had (Cafe Rakka is still the best in my opinion) but I eat here like maybe 2 or 3 times a week since its so close to the L train. The falafel is good, and they really pack on the toppings too. My only compliant really is that the falafel isnt made fresh, it lies there in the frying basket (probably because its such a high traffic area...stuff gets eaten up fast). I guess in short I can really count on Oasis for a good, fast, and reliable falafel. Â Cheap too! And the fact that they are open 24/7 is also awesome.
