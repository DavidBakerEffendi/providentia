I tried Claire's yesterday. I drove about 20 miles and was disappointed. It was my first time and last time. I bought a quesadia with spinach and tomato there was about 4 Small spinach leaves and three or four slices of tomato. I paid almost $10 with a little cup of salsa with no cheese. The spice they put on it was all on one part to the quesadia you may say I had no filling in the quesadia. I think this is very high even for organic. The staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very nice. They were busy had to wait in line about 10 min. and another 10 min. to get the food. If you had a thumbs down I would have used it. I felt like taking it back but decided not to go back.
