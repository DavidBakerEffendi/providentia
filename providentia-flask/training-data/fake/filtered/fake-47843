***WARNING: CONTENT OF REVIEW MAY RUIN YOUR APPETITE.*** Having had a few bad experiences with diarrhea after eating out, I developed the D-Scale, where I give grades based on the reaction of my bowels.  The scale works as follows: A = No diarrhea! B = A loose stool hours later that may or may not be attributable to the restaurant reviewed.   C = Diarrhea hours later.  Pretty sure it was what I ate.   D = Diarrhea upon coming home or back to work.  Or frequent diarrhea hours later F = Had diarrhea in the restaurant and/or had diarrhea for more than 4 hours.   I hold a one strike and your out policy for C grades and below despite the taste of the food.   Now, my review of Udon West: D-Scale Grade: D+ I should have known not to order the chicken teriyaki curry.  So I gave them a D plus because I should have known better.  The picture on the menu already looks like diarrhea.  When I came back to work, I felt like I had to fart but wasn't sure if it would actually be excrement.  When in doubt, always err on the side of caution.  Long story short, it was a two flusher and had some longevity.  I don't know if it is a two-parter.  I still feel uneasy.   The service and food itself was great.  I may break my one strike rule and try something that is less likely to to give me the runs.
