I used to rave about this place when it first opened.  It was pricey, but the food was so delicious that it was worth it.  I haven't been there since April 2013, and now it is a different story since executive chef Senat left.  The food is just a touch above mediocre.  I only had two dishes - the palak chaat and peshwari naan.  My palak chat was more like a spinach salad.  Instead of frying the spinach leaves whole, it was cut up then slightly fried.  The peshwari naan only had a hint of cashews and could have used some ground cardamom.  It also lost some of that naan fluffiness - granted, whenever you get a stuffed naan, it is not as fluffy, but this naan was virtually flat.  Perhaps some of their other dishes are better and still up to Senat's standards, but the reviews here don't make me want to try it.   I would have given this three stars, but my experience of ordering online for pickup made me dock it a star.  My email confirmation stated pickup will be ready in 30 minutes.  I go an hour after I placed the order to pick it up.  I had to wait 15 minutes while they prepared my food.  I know this because the bartender gave me a glass of water and told me that they were "preparing it now."  Obviously it should have been ready, maybe even a bit cold since I was late picking it up. If you can't handle pickup/delivery orders, then don't offer the service. I was just a bit disappointed with my overall experience.  Not sure if I will be eating here again.
