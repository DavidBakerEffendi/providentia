I live in the neighborhood and came back from an event out of town. Just needed to eat something before I crashed, so I stopped in and sat at the bar. Had the country pate to start and the grilled salmon they were running as a special as my main. Bartender was really cool and tried me on both a red and white by the glass, both were interesting and really hit the spot. Haven't tried the dining room yet but it looks so cute back there I will definitely be back with friends for a more elaborate dinner!
