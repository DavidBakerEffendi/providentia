I probably dine at Parc on a bi-monthly basis.  Their food has always been reliably good, their service has mostly been on point, and their atmosphere strikes a really nice balance between casual and bistro elegant.  While it's not the best I've ever had, I recommend the onion soup.  It will definitely hit the spot if you're having the craving.  The entrees are generally good, but I have been a little disappointed with the desserts.   One word of caution, the chairs are really light.  If you place your coat on them, there is a good chance they will tip over.
