I don't live in West Hartford, but I do work in the area(have been for a couple years now) and spent many lunch breaks looking for that perfect place that offers good food and fast (without being fast food) and one place that Never disappoints is Harrys Bishops Corner!! Â My day may drag a little more when I know that's where I'm headed for lunch, but the anticipation is worth it! They have a number of incredible slices available if you're looking for a quick "in and out", or if you're lucky enough to have time to sit and eat they have an even more incredible menu to choose from. I've heard a lot about their "TB" (tomato basil pie), and I finally got the chance recently to try it, and let me tell you...one of, if not the best slice of pizza I have ever had! Looking forward to the day I have the time to dine-in without having to rush back to work!!!!!
