Call me what you like, a hater, a nay sayer....First time I went to Grimaldi's was about 15 years ago, it was amazing....on my most recent visit, about 3 months ago - the product is seriously not what it used to be. Yes I think they have a good pizza, best in brooklyn FAR FROM IT it's simply not what it used to be....but my word wont affect the lines, or their success - people will still follow the reputation
