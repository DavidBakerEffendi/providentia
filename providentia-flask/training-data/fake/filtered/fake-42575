Great ambience on a beautiful old ship, world largest four-masted ship still floating built in 1902.  The food is beyond excellent, made of fresh ingredients, light and well-balanced and an artful presentation.  Small European style-portions.  Good choice of unusual desserts all site-made such as the apple-crisp icecream. Cordial service which provided tourist info on Philly.
