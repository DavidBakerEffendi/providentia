After reading lot of good reviews and hearing the food was good there, We had booked their party hall for lunch, the time slot was between 12-3 and they served the food @ 2:50 PM almost at the end of the time slot. the rice they served was half -boiled ,It is poorly managed, i am not sure about their regular dine-in restaurant , i would not recommend anyone to book their party hall.
