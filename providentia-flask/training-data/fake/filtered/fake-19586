I went last night. I was ecstatic with the guacamole and chips. The salsa / red sauce that came with the chips was good, but lots of onion flavor, and not that hot. But the best came as my entree: I ordered the cheese enchiladas, but asked for onions to be placed inside the enchiladas rather than simply on top. This is the way cheese and onion enchiladas are supposed to be. I went to college with friend of Mexican descent. She grew up in a mansion in Dallas, TX, with her parents and brother living behind the garage, and a cook who was from Mexico. Tia, as she called the cook, made enchiladas to die for. My friend gave me the recipe and taught me how to make these cheese and onion enchiladas...authentic Mexican enchiladas. The sauce is the key, and Tres Jalapenos has an almost identical enchilada red sauce. It's authentic as well. The onions inside the enchiladas may be the structure that the weekly reviewer was looking for. That's all I've tried, so far, but I've been looking so long for decent enchiladas in Philly, I may never try anything else. So I'm surprised and loving it at Tres Jalapenos
