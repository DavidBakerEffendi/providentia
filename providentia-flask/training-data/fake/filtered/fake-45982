There are a lot of diners to pick from in Harrison, and they all serve pretty similar food. Pancakes, French toast, eggs benedict, burgers, chicken strips, stuff like that. Now take everything you know about that type of diner and throw it out the window because Tops puts all of them to shame. For one thing, their menu is over 20 pages long if you include the drink menu. There's almost literally nothing you can't find there if you're in the mood for it, and it's all great. They do excellent cheesecakes, and their breakfast foods are always perfect. Their burgers and fries are always amazing. They really do a lot of stuff here, and they do it all incredibly well.
