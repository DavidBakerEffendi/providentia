The service & staff was horrible. I will never ever go back there for sure. The drinks was terrible as well. The sushi was not good at all. I also had an entree off the menu and my food was cold. I had to send it back. Please dont waste your time going to this restaurant Kona grill & Aja Asian Cuisine is soo much better. Save your money..
