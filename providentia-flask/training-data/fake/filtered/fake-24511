Live across the street and have been dying for a new cafe. Athom rocks but it's just a little too far to walk to if I'm in a rush in the mornings. This place is great and I love the fact that it doubles as a bar. The breakfast sandwiches could definitely be a little cheaper, or they could offer some cheaper breakfast options (pastries? fruit/yogurt? etc.) but I love the fact that it's spacious and there is plenty of seating. Crazy to think that this was the Beauty Bar, then Broomie's (wtf was that?)... and now it's this. Guess the transformation is pretty symbolic of the neighborhood as a whole, though.
