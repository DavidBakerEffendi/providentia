L'Artusi, I love you! Why do you make it so hard to get a reservation? :*) Came here last Friday with my girlfriend and then came back for some more with my partner. Yummm! I've started with the nantucket bay scallops which were fresh and so very delicious. As well as the roasted asparagus which had a fried egg on top. The delicate egg yolk mixed with the flakey parmesan cheese gave the asparagus a kick of saltiness as well as added an extra moist texture. So good! There was also a special on the menu - Wagyu beef tar-tar served on 2 pieces of warm toasted baguettes. In addition to the traditional ingredients, they added extra raw onions and perhaps a touch of jalapeno. It was probably the spiciest but yet tastiest beef tar tar I have ever tasted. To follow, I got the gnocchi which came in an asparagus and hen of the woods creamy sauce. The creaminess was perfect and not heavy at all. After downing the whole bowl, I used the bread and cleaned up all the sauce. I felt like I was in heaven! I'm going back this weekend just so I can eat more! From the pesce menu, I've had the poached cod which is served with clams and a toasted buttered piece of baguette soaked in the sauce. I wish there were a few more clams and the fish was a tad bigger but my word did they make that dish well! From the carne, I've had the hanger steak with the crispy potatoes. The hanger steak wasn't anything spectacular but the potatoes were fabulous! The outside was crispy and the inside moist. There was also a sour cream and onion dip in the middle of the plate which paired up perfectly with the potatoes (this dip doesn't come with the potatoes if you order them alone just as a side, so if you do, ask them if they'll give you some!) For dessert we had the special of the evening - rhubarb pie. I personally detest rhubarb but thought they did an amazing job. Well, I ate the whole piece so go figure!
