You would think with the new decor and new name that perhaps they could get some good clientele in there but not so much. Went to Rho 3 times in the last few months to see my favorite band. Not only did I bring over 30 people but thank GOD I did b/c the place was empty all 3 times. The drink prices are ridiculous and the food is not that great either. I love the band SIDEWAYS but to go to a show and only have the people you brought is not really the best night out. They need to really advertise and understand they are in Trenton, not Manhattan. The place is going under and quick. There was nothing special at all about the place. A cover, high drink prices and no people.......The band rocked the house aqll 3 times and kept everyone dancing but as soon as they stopped the place was empty...CRICKETS! I'll find somewhere else to bring our group to watch the band.
