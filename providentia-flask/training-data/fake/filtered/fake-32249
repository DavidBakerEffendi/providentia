We absolutely love "The Russell".  Whether we are entertaining friends that are here from Boston or New York, this establishment has the vibe that is neo-soul.  The upscale menu is terrific, if you have not checked it out...please do!  I actually chose The Russell as the venue for my husband's upcoming birthday.  We are not into the club crowd and The Russell is the perfect setting for our celebration.  The food is wonderful the drinks are delicious and reasonably priced...it just made sense.  The owner was accomodating and I know that we will be back to The Russell to celebrate other occasions in the future.
