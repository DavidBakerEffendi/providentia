This weekend I discovered a "hidden treasure" aka Luke's Lobster!! Everything about this place is awesome. The setting, food, prices, energy and variety were all great! Most importantly the Staff was on point, knowledgable and friendly. I haven't met a manager yet who could explain the entire menu(with a smile) and help you make the best decision for your dollar,.. Until we met Sam... Great job guys, we will definitely be back!
