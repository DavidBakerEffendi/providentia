my husband and i traveled into the city for a fun day and dined at this new restaurant.  it was fabulous!  the food was absolutely out of this world!  the service was perfection and the decor right out of a magazine!  i also must add that the desserts were amazing!  so beautifully presented!  the homemade ice cream and the eggnog cheesecake were  heavenly.   the hand painted chocolate christmas box with the handmade chocolates were nothing i ever tasted before!  i asked who the pastry chef was and they said it was a woman named genevieve meli.  wow, i sure would love to have her come to my upstate home and cater my christmas party!  we are so looking forward to returning  and will do so next month.  best experience ever!
