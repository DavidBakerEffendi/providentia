Native Philadelphians already know this, rendering this review functionally useless for anyone from the city- but for those who come from farther and more distant lands than Cherry Hill, Dalessandro's is the best cheesesteak in the world. The flavor, the cheese, the meat, the bread, the onions. Besides being the only 5 ingrediants necessary to make a cheesesteak, they also happen to be the 5 areas in which dalessandro's absolutely murders the competition. It is impossible to describe the taste. You have to go yourself and experience it. Order a "Cheesesteak. Provalone. Wit'. To eat in." Your taste-buds will thank you for the rest of your life. That isn't even to mention the service. If you go enough times, every time you set foot into the cramped joint everyone working behind the counter, yes the ENTIRE staff, will shout a welcome in your direction. That would be because most of the people working at "delo's" are career cheesesteak preparers. They have been there for years and are passionate about putting the best product out on the plate (or more accurately, in the tin foil) every single time. I could not recommend any cheesesteak more highly. If you are a sandwich fiend on the holy pilgrimage to find the best cheesesteak in philly/ the world, skip the lines, racism, and poor product that flows freely from Geno's and Pat's, and stop at Dalessandro's. You will not be disappointed.
