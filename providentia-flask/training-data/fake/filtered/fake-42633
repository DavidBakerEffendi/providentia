I work right down the street and have only been in about three times, but I find the help to be a little less than friendly.  I actually went there today and stood at the counter for about 5 minutes while being totally ignored by one girl who walked past me at least 5 times and the extremely cold girl behind the counter who never bothered to say "I'll be with you in a moment" or "Can I help you"?  I have a feeling it had something to do with me being in my 40's (I get the feeling they like a younger crowd in there).  A young lady in her 20's approached the counter right after me and the girl behind the counter couldn't get to her fast enough to take her order.  The vibe is very nice, sort of like a New York coffee shop, but a little too much attitude for me.  Good food too...they just need to work on their customer service and learn how to smile a little more : )
