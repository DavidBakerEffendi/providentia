One of the best and only tofu specialized restaurant in heart of Korea Town NYC. I usually get the mushroom or dumpling tofu soup here with Ribs. The food is always fresh and services are excellent here. It does get busy around lunch time Noon to 2PM, and you may have to wait in line for 10 to 20min, but totally worth the wait.
