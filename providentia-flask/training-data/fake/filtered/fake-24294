The Thai food here is amazing! I really liked the green curry -- it had the right amount of spice and the coconut milk taste wasn't too strong. The seasonal soft-shell crab curry was also delicious, though on the expensive side. If you check in on Yelp at Ngam for the first time, you can get a free drink or cocktail with any entree you order. I got the Scented Jasmine cocktail which tasted great because there was some lychee in it, but the drink wasn't very alcoholic. The decor is cute and I am also a fan of the long dining table they have set up in the middle. I am looking forward to going back again!
