This evening was my second time, dining at Kanella. The freshest of ingredients, leading to the most appetizing and delicious food. Everything, from the bucolic decor, to the wait staff , to the presentation of our dinner, to the actual freshness and quality of our food was over the top. Five stars, does not do this finest of establishments, justice. Add Â two more. An epicurean delight, Randy I.
