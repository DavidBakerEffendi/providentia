I have frequented Nicola's as a lunch patron many times as my coworkers and I love their soup and salad. However, the service is TERRIBLE!!! Especially when the tall blonde waitress with the short hair is working. (the latin man is the best waiter however!) Anyway, you wait forever for bread, water, your food and then when the bill comes it's always a different price! Seems Nicolas like to charge customer at their whim! I am fed up with the bad service and inconsistent bills and I will not be going back no matter how good their soup is.
