Love this place. I go here once a week at least. The food is consistently great, they have pretty fun specials that change frequently, the staff is super sweet, and the ambiance is adorable. Their burgers are delicious, juicy, and come in beef, veggie, and tuna, and there are like 6 topping specials! Im closing the place down for a private party because I love it so much! Hesitant about having a pretzel as an app? I dont much care for pretzels but I order one for an app each and every time. The queso dip and wasabi mustard are mouthwatering. Trust me ;) Oxcart! What would I do without you?!?!
