This is my favorite restaurant in Philly. The Happy hour is the best in the city. I almost don't want to mention it to keep people away. Half priced hummus and cocktails. Soo awesome. The turkish coffee is amazing. The whole dining experience is nice. Servers, bartenders and cooks are awesome. I eat here atleast once a week. Theres no better middle eastern food in Philly. Just go and experience it for yourself
