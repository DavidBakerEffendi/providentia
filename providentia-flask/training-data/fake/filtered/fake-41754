Great place! Very welcoming staff, great sushi! My wife and I love sushi, but could not seem to get not even good sushi in Newark, untill we found Sushi house 21, GREAT sushi! We recently tried the Sushi House 21 again since we found out that they were under new ownership, what a change!, The fish, rice and soups are very fresh, you flavor it right away. My five year old son loves tobiko and they do not hesitate to please him without blinking an eye and always have a kind word for my son and family if I go with or without them, thank you! Welcome to the neiborhood! You have earned a customer and friend!
