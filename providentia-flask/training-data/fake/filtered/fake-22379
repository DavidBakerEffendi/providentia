The food at Stephanie's was terrific!! Â My fiance and I went there last week for dinner and our meals were hot and tasty. We had the fiocci and chicken marsala.The decor is newly designed and has an old world charm of rustic Italy. the owner even came by and asked us how our meal was. All in all the service was great and the food even better. This is a great little italian spot we found. we will definitely be back again next week.
