My husband and I love this place!  We live locally which is an added plus.  Really great food for a very reasonable price!  The best pork fried dumplings!  Also, not sure what all the fuss is about with the staff.  I always find it pleasant when I'm there, Orlando is great and always very pleasant!  I've never been told that it would be any longer than a 30 minute wait for take out, and we order from House of Chao often.  When I get there, my food is hot ready, and everyone is very pleasant.   If you are looking for a great local restaurant, that has awesome food and a great staff, House of Chao is the place! See you soon Orlando :)
