Best doughnuts in the state (and believe me, my sweet-tooth family has tried most of them)! It's more than the unique square shape (though some believe that makes them cook differently and taste better), it's all the creative types they have and the batter they use. My says the true test for doughnut places are the honey glazed, and theirs is phenomenal. I personally love all the cake-type doughnuts, and I don't have a sweet tooth. The only downside to sharing this information is that you might beat me there and clean out all the doughnuts first. Must tries: the Turtle, PB&J, Caramel crunch, glazed, chocolate, and blueberry. Owner, family, and staff are all fantastic as well, you won't regret trying them out!
