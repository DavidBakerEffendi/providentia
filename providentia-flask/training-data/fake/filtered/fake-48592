While the food wasn't entirely deserving of 1-star, I found the service to be the worst I have encountered in NYC, to the point that it actually had a negative effect on my enjoyment of the meal.  Why I understand that a restaurant has certain "policies", I typically assume these are based in some sort of logic.  Not allowing a four-person table (which was only seating three) to order four entrees in anticipation of a fourth person arriving prior to any food arriving, is silly, contrary to a for-profit business, and rooted in poor business management.  What may be even more unsettling was the amount of attitude from the hostess, who was kind enough to stop by our table after our fourth person arrived, immediately after placing our order, to inform us that they will allow for our orders to proceed to the kitchen.   As someone who has loved the East Village location since its inception and was overjoyed to have a location open in Midtown, I must say that I'm very disappointed at the lack of appreciation and humbleness I would have expected from Ippudo, a place that openly greets its diners upon being seated.  Further, I'm nervous to think about the consequences to this establishment if they continue to deny placing orders for certain individuals based on a "policy" founded in neither logic or supportable basis.  And to have a situation where the hostess gets involved and instructs the waiter not to fill the order with the kitchen until he gives the "okay" is appalling and beyond inappropriate.  Fortunately for New Yorkers, Ramen is an amazing art that is perfected by enough incredible chefs in this city that there is no need to dine at a place with a hostess that dictates whether your order can proceed further or not and forgets that, if not for the loyalties of its diners, a restaurant popular today is gone tomorrow (only the truly best survive the test of time in this city).
