Can't rate the food...although the place was NOT packed...actually 5 empty tables and 2:50 pm...we waited 18 minutes and no one even offered us water or drinks....much less the menu....another couple walked in sat down waited 7 minutes...same thing they walked out, we followed two minutes later...I even called on the phone and got a recording...kindda pathetic!
