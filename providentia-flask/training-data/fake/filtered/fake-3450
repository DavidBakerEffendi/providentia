My friend and I got take out here and the service was unacceptable. it took much longer than the "10 minutes or so " advertised by the woman who took our orders and when we did get them they were wrong.  the fries were soggy and bland and the burgers were not cooked to order nor did they have the requested toppings.  The fruit cups were also old and not to order( my friend asked for pineapples and was told sure but no pineapples to be found.). about the only good thing about it was the burgers sizes.
