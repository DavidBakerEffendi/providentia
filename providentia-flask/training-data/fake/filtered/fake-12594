Giorgio's left me entirely unimpressed.  I ordered the special pasta of the day, which was "fettuccine with wild mushrooms and winter squash in a light marinara with a splash of white wine."  I was excited to have their fresh pasta... My meal came.  There was no winter squash to be seen.  Or tasted.  The pasta was so thick!  Fettuccine means 'little ribbons' in Italian.  The fettuccine at Giorgio's was like 3 pieces of ribbon had been welded together.  And it wasn't really al dente.  It wasn't overcooked.  I just think that with that thickness the pasta  gets chewy. The mushrooms were good, but they couldn't save the dish all by themselves. I left wondering in what form winter squash was incorporated into that dish...was it some sort of infusion?  Like maybe they put pieces of winter squash into the marinara, stirred them around for a while, and then removed them?   Oh and the bread that someone raved about?  I think they sliced it that morning or the day before. The non-crust part (is there a name for that?) was faintly hardened at the surface.
