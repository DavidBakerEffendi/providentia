I would like to give this place at least 4 stars because I really enjoyed the drinks, but unfortunately I cant.  While the bartender was very nice, my  husband was served in a dirty glass with a lipstick rim. I thought that was completely unacceptable, not to mention unsanitary. No wonder they have a B grade.
