OK so with so many choices when it comes to eating heres my two cents and my review based on my latest visit.  A group of us and I went here after driving home from NJ on my cousins recommendation as he had been to the bar section before with friends from work.  We hung out drinking at the bar.  Bartenders are fast.  Bar was cool atmosphere.  You have to tell them make your drink right because like all these bars they want to be stingy with the licky.  I don't play that game.  I tell them straight up first drink if they serve me juice.  I'm not paying for juice I'm paying for a drink make it stiff! When we arrived we were told it would be a 20-30 minute wait, WOW even though the place didn't seem that crowded. The wait ended up being around 45 mins, despite there being several open tables in the dining area.  Wasn't too happy about the wait but it is what it is.   From that point on everything improved and was well worth the wait!!  That is pretty much the level of service offered the entire time we were there. We ordered apps to start which took  no time at all to arrive.  Drinks came quick.  Our waitress was awsome!!  She felt bad we had to wait so long.  Our dinner was great. Overall the food is decent. Our nachos were awesome, . The burgers were cooked perfectlyl. We all ordered burgers with cheese.  My Tuna was excellent.  Even if it was bad I was so drunk I wouldn't have realized it.  Oh the fries they were really good to. So if your in area check this place out!
