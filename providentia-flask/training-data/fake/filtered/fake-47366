I've been here twice so far; that number would be higher if I was in the area more often.  I found it via a quick Google search for ribs near New Haven.  With a name like "Rib House," you can imagine it came up first. From the outside, the building resembled a run-down bar, but the inside had a very "homey" feel to it.  The atmosphere was very casual. The wait was a little longer than I usually like, but ribs take a while so I didn't mind much.  The service was very friendly. My personal favorite is the baby back ribs, although I find the St. Louis style delicious as well.  All portions were very generous; I almost couldn't finish my meal.  Our waitress recommended the onion loaf - that thing was huge!  It took 5 of us to finish it. I noticed that large platters of wings and ribs are available for take out if you need some for a party or function. I liked this place so much that I insisted on taking a minor detour on the way back from going to a Red Sox game in Baltimore.  I will be returning the next time I'm in New Haven and have time for dinner.
