Hands down one of the best sandwich shops i''ve ever been to, not just in new jersey, but in the whole country.  The food is amazing (love the #9 with everything and the grilled chicken panini... its all good but those are my favs) and these guys really know how to make a sandwich.  I once heard one of the guys instructing a new hire on how to correctly make a sandwich... you should have heard the passion and the detail in the instructions... when to put the lettuce on, what order the toppings should be arranged in, how to put the oil and vinegar on so it doesn't soak the bread, absolute fanaticism for the perfect sub. If you get there and there's a long line, don't stress it, they go through it so fast you'll be done before you know it. And everyone there is so nice, always ready with a smile or a joke, and they either remember your name, or your order, or both.  I really can't recommended this place enough.
