Mirabelles made my wedding cake 7 years ago and it was sublime.  But...  I ordered a cake for my inlaw's 50 wedding anniversary last week and it was sadly very disappointing.  It looked pretty from the outside, but when we cut into it there was more buttercream frosting on the cake than cake itself.   It was like eating sweet butter, and sure it sounds great, but it's really not.  In an attempt to salvage the moment, we ate the cake between the layers of frosting and the frosting stood up like beeswax.  Wish I had take a picture of it to post. On the other hand I had great wait service while I was picking up the cake.  Friendly waitress and support staff.
