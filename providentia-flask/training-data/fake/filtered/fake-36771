This place is amazing. I know a lot of people like the tasting menu (where they keep bringing you culinary creations of the chef's choosing) which is wonderful but we prefer a few particular dishes and so we usually order from the regular menu. The food here is fresh and delicious and the service is delightful. I go with my family a few times a month. Excellent place to eat!!
