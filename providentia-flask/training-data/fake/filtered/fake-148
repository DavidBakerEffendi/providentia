Pro:  15-25 dollar plates, not to cheap but not to pricey          Good size portions          Great seasoning and marinades, great charcoal cooking          Amazing taste and variety           Con:  Lots of meat           Below reasonable size of vegetables and sides Overall, had the charcoal platter for two.  Was impressed by the quality of the meats and flavors.  Wish there was more of the delicious rice to go with my meats.   This place has bring your own wine service.
