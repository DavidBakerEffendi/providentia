OH MY GOD. i have never loved salmon as much as i do here... EVER. Absolutely amazing!!!!! Miso glazed salmon with brown rice.... it's my new addiction. Not to mention the fact that it's less than $10!!! And comes to the table in like, 6 minutes. Come on, where in SoHo can you get THAT?!? Also, I noticed there doesn't seem to be a microwave ANYwhere on the premises, just an open air kitchen...pretty sure nothings ever frozen as well. Rarity yea? Or maybe, I'm just a bit idealistic? I'd like to go with the former... my tastebuds rarely lie :) We ordered the grilled squid and split the snow pea wonton soup to start... completely NOT disappointed! The curry sauce on the squid was amazing, and the squid was fresh and cooked just well enough. The garlic in the wonton soup was absolutely fantastic, really great flavor. Finished it all off with a bit of Key Lime pie :) which was a legit key lime pie... none of that awkward green food coloring some people seem to use to make you think it's "real"... limes are only green on the outside people...NOT on the inside, which is used for a pie. Ahem. Learn a little something. And I'm not sure, but I think all the recipes are from the owners' family secrets, yea? So, awesome job Mooncake family!!!! Many fantastic generations of fresh food to come!!! I shall return!
