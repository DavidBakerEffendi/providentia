Great beer selection.  Not a huge selection, but it's always changing so I've never had the same thing twice.  The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable as well.  The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is the food.  It's average at best.  I'd like to see as much though go into the food as the beer lineup.
