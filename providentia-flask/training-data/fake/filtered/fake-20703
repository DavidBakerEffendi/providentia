My second visit. The first visit was "iffy" at best, but it was their first week and so one has to cut them so slack. Plus, I'm a local resident and wish only the best for new businesses. My second visit wasn't worth much, however. I ordered a drink (the wrong one was delivered) and tried to start my dinner with the soup (one has a choice of clams or chickpeas. I chose the clams. Mistake!) What arrived had a skin on it so thick one could make a handbag and the clams were so dry, there was no earthly way they were fresh. When I sent it back, I was billed for it anyway. Some gentleman (who didn't introduce himself) apologized on the street for it, but made no effort to remedy the situation or refund my money, so what was the point? Did he want to be known as "a nice guy"? I'm sure he is. All the same, it was dreadful and I won't be back.
