A group of friends and I were celebrating a birthday and decided we would like this spot out. I called the day before to find out if they'd take a reservation for 10 people. The girl I spoke to said that they don't take reservations. After attempting to get an idea of what kind of wait we would be looking at, we decided to give it a try. We arrived at about 6:30 and the place was empty (which was great!). Most of our party had arrived but they wouldn't seat us until everyone was there. The host asked if we would like to sit in their sitting area to have drinks and apps so we followed to the back of the restaurant and were led to what looked like a jail cell. The host then left and returned a few minutes later to inform us that their policy for large parties is that we each had to spend a minimum of $30 each. I told him that the woman I spoke with the night before hadn't mentioned anything and their website doesn't state this policy. We had traveled 40 minutes from Staten Island to come to their restaurant and they just throw this "policy" into the mix. We wound up leaving and going to SEA thai based on the principal of it! If I call and ask about a reservation and you have this kind of policy in place, you should at least inform your potential customers before they take the time to visit your business!
