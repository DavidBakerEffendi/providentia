the worst brunch experience ive ever had!!!.... past weekend went to brunch with a group of friends.Resrevation was for 6ppl.The service was bad (server kept forgetting multiple things; coffee, cranberry juice, toast, english muffin , even when reminded about them about 3 to 4 times).Cuban sandwich came out not toasted, cheese was not even melted, than 2 people ordered turkey BLT (and it was the only BLT on the menu) and got only plain BLT... NO TURKEY!!!Sausage for 1 of my friends was raw and pink inside.  When 1 of my friends approached the manager half way thru the meal to let her know things are not going well, you would expect at least some what more care, so the reminder of the meal would go smothly.That never happen.The itmes that came out incorrect were removed off the check.I understand things can go wrong, but at least try to rectify and save the situation...thats what managers are for. The main problem presented itself when manager Nicole (tall blond) came up to the table with a major bad attitude and spoke to us with VERY unprofesional manner!!!Everybody at the table was in complete shock.She made a comment that since our table grew from 6 to 8ppl that that was a problem....really?!?!?  Isn't that how restaurants make money?!?!?? ... She spoke to us as we were children!!!!..... i've worked for 8years for Four Seasons Hotel in Philadelphia and the way we were treated and spoken to by the manager was simply UNACCEPTABLE!!! I will most likley never return to this establishment, because of the cruel treatment from the manger!!! I really enjoyed "make your own bloody mary bar" and since i live in the neighborhood ive suggested the brunch @ London Grill.Now i feel ambaresed and that i have disapointed my friends. You are more than welcome to contact me for more detail feedback if you'd like.
