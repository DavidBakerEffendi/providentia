Went here last night. At around 9.15pm it was a 30min wait for a spot at the bar for 2. I've been wanting to go here for years and finally was in the neighborhood and decided to pop in for a small bite. Had the long island fluke from the raw bar. It was very interesting with the kumquat had a salty yet sweet taste to it at the same time. After that had the smoked ham, something with a b but not benton, which was delicious. This was my favorite dish that evening. Yet, it tasted great but only got 2 slices of bread even though the plate comes with about 15 slices of ham, we had to ask 3 times to get more bread but only got 2 more slices then. This was a bit odd. Then I had the sirloin tartare which we both didn't like at all. It was still frozen and you had to mix it in with the egg and onion chip pieces as well as some sort of creme fraiche/mayo. I guess, since I love steak tartare I was envisioning something completely different. Also the house sake wasn't too exciting. All in all, it was great to have been here, however service lacked attention to detail. Our waiter failed to ask us whether we wanted any drinks with our food, so we didnt get them until we were eating the 3rd course after several attempts of placing our drink order. Then the place is crazy loud. It was hard to understand your own word. Overall, I would not go back but still want to try Momofuku Ko.
