NOT impressed. This evening I ordered broccoli with garlic sauce and paid $9.60. YES, $9.60 for some broccoli!  Another Chinese restaurant I frequent in the Trenton area while at work,  a large Broccoli with garlic sauce runs me $5.65. Lotus Garden food had little to no flavor. The Broccoli was very tender and had NO taste. If I could do it all over again I would drive to Trenton. Personally I think the food is over rated, over priced and not even worth the drive.
