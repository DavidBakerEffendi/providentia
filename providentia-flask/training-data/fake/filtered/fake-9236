We held a rehearsal dinner for my son and his fiancee at Kitchen Zinc last week.  The food was amazing---everyone loved it---a great selection.   Everyone has been talking about it since---really enjoyed it---and it was so nice to be able to use the outdoor space as well---the perfect spot for an event like that!!   The portobello, the tomato, and the sausage pizzas seemed to be the favorites.  The appetizers could have been a meal in themselves.  Can't say enough about how nicely we were treated by the manager and the staff---would highly recommend it!!
