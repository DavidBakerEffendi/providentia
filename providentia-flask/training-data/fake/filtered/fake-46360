This is my go-to hangover joint for top-notch fried food.  The "Tater Heaven" lives up to it's name.  The way they fry food is somehow different and it's amazing. I want to give this place 5 stars but I've had to pass on eating here so many times because it's too small and there ends up being a 30 minute wait because all 5 (6?) tables are occupied.  The key is to just go during off-peak times, it's well worth it.
