went there with a party of 12. the food was ok. wine, not so great.  servers didnt really have it together...but worst part....they kicked us out to seat another party...after we dropped over a grand on the dinner.  plates of dessert had to be left so they could accomodate the next group.  rude & i will never go back there.
