I took my girlfriend here for a special occasion, and we enjoyed our experience thoroughly.  At first we were taken aback by the size of this restaurant.  Easily the smallest I have ever been in, but it was cozy and we were comfortable.  The service was excellent, as there were not many others in the restaurant.  The food was great, albeit rather pricey.  A nice place to go in Old City Philly, and I would recommend it to others.
