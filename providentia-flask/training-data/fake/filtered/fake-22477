I always feel at home at the Eagle Rock Diner - Great food, wonderful service, and just a solid, cozy diner. I have brought everyone from my out-of-town brothers and friends here; my husband and I make this our Tuesday night spot! (and sometimes Saturday and Sunday too!) Â I am definitely one of your loyal fans. I wanted to show my appreciation with a positive, happy post. I have a business of my own and I know how hard it can be with disgruntled people who don't always get their way - they do things out of spite - like adding really nasty reviews online. Well Eagle Rock Diner - believe me you have many loyal fans! We love you!
