What a great spot! I love the vibe here and there is something for everyone: the lively bar area, the more intimate dining room to the side with the secret entrance to gin den Madame Geneva, and the darker sexier downstairs area. We just ordered entrees and asked them to fill in the rest and boy did them! Seafood platter was fresh and so good that it was sweet. The sides and apps were as good as our entrees but the entrees were still necessary and perfect...each with unique but necessary flavors. I had a Manhattan and it was the smoothest and best Manhattan I ever had. Our waiter offered some insight but we asked about a few other things and he answered all that with knowledge plus provided great recommendations drink and food wise. The only minor complaint we had was the enthusiasm of the wait staff to fill our water glasses many, many times. Its okay to wait until the glass gets below half empty. ;) We will definitely be coming back!
