This is definitely a place that you would pass on the street and not bother looking twice at unless you were looking for it. But what a find it is indeed. As far as dumplings on and near Canal Street go, these are great but probably not for the hardcore dumpling snobs or pretentious foodies. The menu here is simple and rustic, as it should be. The fried pork and chive dumplings have always been perfectly seasoned and are cooked to order as well. The result is a plump, juicy dumpling that can rival the soup dumplings down the street at Joe's Shanghai. The other varieties are nice, but the pork and chive are the main event for good reason. The only negative is the fact that the dumpling skins can tend to stick together while cooking in the recessed pan used by the proprietor. This leads to some messy serving, as the skins sometimes tear while being separated and served/packaged, causing a not-so-pretty presentation and the juices to leak out. But again, this does nothing to harm the flavor, which is still fabulous. Ignore the sight and enjoy the taste! The real draw of this establishment is the pricing. At $1 per 5 dumplings, this is an excellent choice for students, backpackers, and those of us who just happen to be misers. Remember to ask for a container of sauce, and be prepared to take your dumplings to nearby Roosevelt or Seward Park to eat them. Seating is virtually non-existent inside.
