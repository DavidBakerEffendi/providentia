Wonderful new spot just down the street from SEA on Williamsburg's restaurant row. Such a relief to see a creative menu for once - nothing tired for a change. Lots of surprises in the food selections - along with some whimsy. Atmosphere is great - with an roof deck upstairs if you need some fresh air. Watching the sun set over the East river drink-in-hand can't be beat. I shall return - so many cool items on that menu I never heard of before. Tip: Take the elevator - the place is well hidden upstairs.
