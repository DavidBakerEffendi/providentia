This place is not bad, but, in my opinion, overrated when compared to other Italian restaurants in the same price range.  The variety of pasta dishes on the menu are also somewhat limited to spaghetti in a few different variations. We were seated outside and my chair happened to right over the cellar door so it was kinda shaky and noisy, especially when the waiter or busboy walked upon it to clear a table or bring food to it.  I suggest you avoid that particular seat.  The outside seating is also rather cramped, so leg room is limited and the next table is no more than a foot away.   The Saturday night we ate there the food seemed to be hit and miss. We had the mushroom salad which I thought was just OK but hardly worth the price.  We then had the eggplant appetizer which was tasty and different.  For the main course we had the salmon with lentils.  This dish was very disappointing, not only in look, but in taste.  The lentils looked like mush on top of the salmon which looked like it was just thawed out and dead.  The preparation of the dish will not win any awards. The chocolate cake with whip cream and berries  was fabulous, as was the coffee. The staff and waiters were all very friendly and accommodating.   I suggest you get there early if you don't want to wait to be seated.
