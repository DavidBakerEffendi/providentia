It was a while ago but I still remember. I was looking for work in the area but was hungry so I ordered a cream cheese bagel and a chocolate cupcake. It was really yummy it makes me want to go back but I don't have the time. The staff was Great and the person that attended me even nicer he ran out behind me to make sure I had the correct order. I think it was wonderful of him, It shows they really care about their customers. I love places like that when I get a chance I will go back. Thank you and keep up the great work!
