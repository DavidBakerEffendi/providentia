I was pleased to enjoy not a delicious, but an extraordinary food with my family this afternoon at Bella's Cafe. Everything there was so exciting that we didn't want leave. The specials were very creative and unique... Â amazing!!! The service was impeccable. The place itself might be the best kept secret in New Haven.
