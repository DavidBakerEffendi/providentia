Falafel-ly Yours is the real deal. It's a great addition to South Orange. Me, my wife and children went for dinner. We had a bunch of appetizers and a few entrees. Â Everything was so delicious. It was so busy, we had to wait for our food for about half an hour but it was well worth the wait. It is a new restaurant and they're still working out the kinks. Yes, they do need another register, but the owner already assured us that will be remedied by next week. We will be back for sure!
