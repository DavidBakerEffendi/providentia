Absolutely the worst service I have ever received. The bartender was possibly the rudest, most arrogant person I have ever met (shorter white dude with black hair and a black polo). I used to bartend, and how this guy has a job is beyond me. Asked him if they had ginger beer and he looked at me with a look of disgust. I asked him for a mule with tito's and he said he couldn't make it. This confused me a bit as I was staring at the bottle of tito's behind his head, and he had just told me they had ginger beer. He copped an attitude with me, at which point I told him to forget it and I walked my happy ass down to a bar a few doors down who seemed to have a little bit more stringent hiring procedures. Don't waste your time with this place. Try the DMV ,or possibly just squirting a lemon directly into your cornea.
