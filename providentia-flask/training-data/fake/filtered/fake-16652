Absolutely fantastic. Friendly service and super-flavorful food... I could have eaten my weight in that hummus, man. They must put crack in it... Perfect in every way. The lamb kebob I ordered was so perfectly cooked and taste Delicious. My mouth is watering just remembering this meal. Well-done, y'all... I'll be back
