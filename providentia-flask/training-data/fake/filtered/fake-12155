I was here in December 2008. This place is seriously the best sushi anywhere in the area. From elaborate "special" rolls, to standard favorites like spicy tuna rolls, to quail eggs, sashimi and more... we ate a wide variety of dishes here and this place does it all perfectly. The fish is completely fresh. Everything I had was made with great care. Down to earth, friendly service too. They treated my toddler well and hooked him up with some cookies at the end of our meal. Very cool. BYOS (sake). I can't wait to go back. (Updated: Went back again at the end of April 2009. Without question, still the best sushi. Uploaded some pictures of what I had. The Tuna Dumpling is really awesome: a giant, soft and crunchy dumpling actually stuffed with fresh crabmeat. See pics of Nobu Roll, Central Park Roll and white tuna. So goood!)
