First time at Noir was with a friend that knew people that worked there.  Everytime since has been with all new people, and I have been treated better and better every time.  The food is top notch, the prices are what they should be, better than what they should be!  They keep you coming back for more, great service, smiling faces and they remember you when you come back!!   When the owner Donna remembers you, and thanks you, its a place you wanna go back!!   Not to leave staff out but I think it was Francesca, Colin, Nicole, Chuck and Julian, that makes this place worth going again and again!
