This place is a WOW!  Another one of Astoria's many hidden gems.  First and foremost their food is off the charts!  Everything I've ever tried from here has been busting with flavor in the most delicate way.  The menu is constantly changing to accommodate the season (which is always a plus)  and they also have a decent wine list.   The atmosphere is SO charming, we're talking exposed brick and candle lit cuteness- its the PERFECT date spot.  Plus for what you're getting the prices are really very modest.  I'm into it.  I will say, the service can be a little wacky.. they've "confused" my order there on multiple occasions but the incredibly tasty food has always more than made up for it.   If you're a "foodie" and you haven't tried Vesta you are seriously missing out.
