Great salad bar selection - I loved all the options. The people at the front were friendly and my chicken and steak were tasty. I would recommend this restaurant if you looking for some place to sit down and eat relatively fast. It has a lot of options that are all priced well. I have been to American Steakhouse several times and plan on going back soon.
