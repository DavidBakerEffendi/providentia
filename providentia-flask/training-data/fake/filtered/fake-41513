I needed to purchase sandwiches/salads for the bridal attendants for my daughter's wedding while they were having their hair/makeup done in the hotel next door.  Bessie was so helpful in getting me a menu ahead and I dropped off the order and it was done on time for a great price.  My husband and I also had breakfast there two mornings and the food was great.
