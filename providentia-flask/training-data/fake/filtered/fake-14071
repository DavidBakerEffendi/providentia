We went to Ginza after learning that a nearby sushi place that we wanted to go to first was closed. The interior was pleasing and surprisingly chic, despite its location. the waitrons were nice enough and easy to get a hold of. The sushi and the food was delicious! Presentation was great and we were wowed with the signature rolls that we ordered. We ordered hot tea as well, and were pleased with the attentiveness of the staff at keeping our cups filled. The most disappointing part of the meal was the wait. My party ordered twice seperate times, with hour waits between the orders. The first time, we ordered takoyaki and three rolls of sushi -- we expected to wait a little bit but were astounded at how long it took to get out food. We did not come during a full dinner rush either -- it was Sunday night at 7PM. We weren't satisfied with the first order, so we got one more roll of sushi. We ended up waiting for another hour -- still very hungry -- and ended up getting seaweed salad to make up for it. We were happy with the food. We were still willing to order food at the end, but we were afraid of waiting another hour to eat and decided to leave. Ginza makes great sushi and has great food -- but our visit was marred by really long waiting times. I thought the sushi was also a little overpriced ($15 per signature roll? Wow) and there are other deals in nearby areas. But it was a good visit all in all.
