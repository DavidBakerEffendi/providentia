Definitely a fan of this place!  Always looking for different types of cuisine than the normal Italian and American places, so to have a German and an Irish place once block up and down Davis from each other is heaven!   Sauerbraten, wursts, spetzle, all delicious.  Great German beers too.  The outside is always a hoot in the summertime.
