GREAT food! GREAT atmosphere! GREAT service! We went for Valentine's Day.  They had a special pre-fixe menu for 4 courses plus one cocktail.  We both were very impressed with the food-a perfect combination and blend of flavors and none overtook the other.   Looking forward to going back with friends to see the extensive regular menu - and of course or fantastic server!
