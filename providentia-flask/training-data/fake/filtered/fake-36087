I have known Al and his staff for years!! My daughters and I stumbled upon La Fourno  during a wickedly hot summer 7 years ago when we first moved to Philly. We were  hot, starving and looking for some place to eat. We had already walked up and down South Street and non of the other restaurants  were family friendly to mention closed . At first we thought it was just another pizza shop until we were invited to sit and dine  regardless of the hour- passed closing. Al and Jim were both there that evening and were so warm and welcoming to me and my girls that I almost cried. We ate off the menu and ordered two pizzas to go. Once we left and were about six blocks away, we discovered that we left without the pizzas. We called up and THEY TOLD US TO STAY PUT, THEY WOULD BRING THE PIZZAS TO US!!!! What's more they did not charge us. It was a Thursday and Al usually changes the fresh flowers , He gave both of my daughters two bunched of  white flowers. This moved us. My youngest daughter 5yrs old at the time, decided she wanted to marry Al..lol. Here is the thing, we were feeling the burn from newly relocating to Philly and knew no one there, we wandered around to familiarize ourselves with South Street and were on the brink of declaring Philly one of the most unfriendly places ever! But a visit to La Fourno changed all of that. My daughters call this place Al's and Jim's' restaurant because they were warm to us and one of them is always present when we dine there. We make it a point to stop by when in town or for my youngest daughter's birthday, and I am planning to dine there this weekend. La Fourno is "our spot" a slice of home , when away from home. Love you Al and Jim.  From : Simone , Cidnee and Francina...
