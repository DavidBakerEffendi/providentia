I was here recently for Friday night dinner. Duck leg, really really good. Pig's head was ok, not necessarily impressed. My boyfriend had the beef entree which was really good with the broccoli. I had the duck entree which was pretty good, but I was stuffed from the pig's head and duck leg. The cocktails here are usually good and tasty. Service and management here is SUPERB. I can tell everyone here is very professional and ON POINT. I am very impressed with that. This is probably one of the best service I have ever experienced.
