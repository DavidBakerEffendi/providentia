My first impression was, this is going to be a good dining experience....WRONG! spicy olives on the tables, verygood, pretty restaurant, no bread on the tables, given out very sparingly by the bread boy carrying a basket. Tapas to share for four of us, ok, so then why bring brucetta for 3? crab cakes, 2 for the table,tasty but no texture and watery. Salad without dressing, had to ask and waiter got flustered. Main courses were a real dissappointment. One of the four had homemade fettucine with meatballs that were definately not made there, they looked and probably tasted like alpo. Sorry, I cannot recommend, I really wanted to like this place.
