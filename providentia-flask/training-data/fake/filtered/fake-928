Stopped in for Sunday lunch. Decided on the Ropa Vieja & it was amazing. Also had the Tres Leches for dessert which as also delicious. Will be back soon to try other dishes. The staff was great. Some might take issue with the space but for lunch it was comfortable. I would make reservations for dinner, if at all possible.
