I like threir salad with Fried goat cheese( like really breaded ), roasted red pepper, tomatoes in a bed of mixed greens, and they do have a great selection of imported beers, i had their pulled pork sandwich which i thought was way too heavy on the bbq sauce and the bread wasn't fresh. Â What really threw me off there was the service, even tough there were a couple of bussers trying to make up for the lame heavy-set waiter, service was far from any good. Might come back and give them an other try. i actually feel like tasting different beers over this laborday weekend, Sanford might just do it.
