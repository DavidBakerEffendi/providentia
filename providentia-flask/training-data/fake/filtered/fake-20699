For my first experience in Clinton Hill I decided to go to Three Letters following the yelp reviews. I was very disappointed with the quality of the food and hygiene. I didn't like the people hanging out between the kitchen and the bar plus this girl coming out of the kitchen and sitting at the bar. I didn't get to try the pork ribs for what I came for but my salad was just ok. I didn't want to eat when I saw the girl in the kitchen. They have a good tap selection but the lady behind the bar is very slow. She's nice but too slow like she just started bartending a few months ago. It's a cute place, but I think it's over rated.
