Amazing food and atmosphere! First of all, I love the interior and decoration of the Pines. The beautiful paintings of the staff gives the space a personal touch. Everything is well put together and makes me feel very comfortable. The bread was the best I've ever had! They had different kinds of rustic bread with amazing homemade butter (I could eat that everyday!) The restaurant uses local and seasonal products, so everything was super fresh and tasty. I ordered some grilled lettuce with nasturtium, with an wonderful dressing. I had a great combination of soft, crispy and crunchy. The agnolotti was cooked to perfection. Divine! The pasta was the most all dente I've ever tasted and the stuffing was rich of flavor. For dessert I had a chocolate cake, one of the best! It was still a bit soft and had a rich texture. Every dish had a perfect portion and I didn't feel stuffed at all. The wine pairing is definitely a recommendation! They have beautiful biological wines that go perfect with the meals. The restaurant manager (I think his name was Anthony) was great! Super friendly and hospitable. He explained every dish to us and our waters were filled when they were empty. To be short: go to the Pines because it is an AMAZING place.
