Simply a wonderful place. Their menu re-creates classic options in a delightfully creative way. Their menu is insightful, the take away-coffee smart, the ambiance is stunning, the prices are just right, and the location is perfect. And when they once forgot my cocktail, I got it for free 15 minutes later. Awesome, and I couldn't be happier that I can call them my neighbor. I'll say it again: Just a wonderful place.
