Stella Rosa,....You are the worst!  Went here with my sister and husband before taking my husband to Jefferson for some major surgery.  We were starved and Pizza sounded the best since fire hot ovens were being used.  We got seated okay, ordered a pizza with two toppings and a salad.  The Pizza was the worst pizza that my family ever ate.  HOW can you mess up Pizza?  My sister felt ill from it and my husband was NOT at all impressed!  We complained to the waiter and he could of cared less.  Just kind of shook his head.  Never asked what he could do to make it right.  WE WILL NEVER GO THERE AGAIN OR TO THE STELLA ROSA in Downingtown, because it's got a bad reputation also.  People, go somewhere else where you'll get good food!After my husbands stay in Jefferson, said the Hospital food was better then this!
