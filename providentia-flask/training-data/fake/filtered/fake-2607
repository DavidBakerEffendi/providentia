A haven in the UES. Soooo good. In love with the pear/gorgonzola salad. The crab/avocado appetizer is also delicious and every pasta I have had there was great and very fresh. I like the simple whole wheat spiral pasta with the simple red sauce with basil. The cheese melts in perfectly- it's like a warm bowl of heaven. I think it says a lot when the simplest dishes are just mouth watering. Also, the mascarpone and strawberries with bitter chocolate powder sprinkled on top is perfection. I love this place, can you tell? Besides the food being great and decently priced, the wine list is fabulous and the ambiance is really cute. A true UES gem and one of my favorite date spots. If only they delivered! They are nice enough to do carry out orders (though I don't think that's normal for them). LOVE LOVE LOVE. The cute Italian waiters don't hurt either.
