I placed a Togo order and they totally screwed it up.  How do they leave the chicken out of the chicken Cobb salad.. I called and complained spoke to someone that seemed apologetic, took my info and claimed they would mail me something well that was over two weeks ago.. I would of given them a second chance but not now... I will no longer eat there or place a to-go..  It's a shame since I usually attend the fundraisers... Poor customer service means your not getting my money again!!!
