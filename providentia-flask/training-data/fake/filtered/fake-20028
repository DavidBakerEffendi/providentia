This is one of my favorite restaurants in NY and Philly. It's great for date night, and a night off from the kids. The shrimp appy is delicious. I could eat the slaw on top straight. I absolutely adore the sashimi-- fresh fish and bright citrus flavors. I spend my summers in Maine, so I am always a sucker for Lobster on a menu. We also had lobster fried rice, the basil and saffron provided for a surprising but subtle twist. Next time I'm going with the Malaysian Lobster. I like the braised short ribs, but the seafood here really shines. The "content" cocktail is to die for. After one or two of them the decor looks particularly beautiful.
