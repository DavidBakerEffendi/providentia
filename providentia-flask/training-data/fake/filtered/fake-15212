I'll keep this short. I never ever ever write reviews for places, but I loved TTK so much I had to show them some love. This restaurant is amazing!!! Went there for brunch and ordered the Frisky omelette. It was AMAZING!!! I couldn't believe how delicious everything was. This place is legit and I can't wait to go back. I'm so happy they're in the neighborhood.
