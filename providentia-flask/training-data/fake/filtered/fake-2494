We went to Fogo De Chao to celebrate an anniversary not to long ago. Its still fresh in my memory so I wanted to rate it, also we will be heading back in the next few weeks. Firstly, this is definitely a place you want to make reservations for if you want to be seated quickly. We have found that even calling earlier in the day is important, because they really get a lot of foot traffic off the street. The wait staff are very very attentive this includes servers and actual waiters. The wine listing is pretty nice, but pricey. However, based on the rest of the listing of options it's a fair option. We decided to try the Sangria. While it was good, they will say they have a "special" which is an interesting wording for really expensive. They have a nice salad bar which has a select choice of cold cut meats, olives, salads, and cheeses. It is quite the nice spread but definitely save room because all of your meat options are good from the chicken breasts, to bacon wrapped steak, to parmesian topped chicken, to the sausage. You will be offered side dishes of bananas, massed potatos, and plantaans. Go here when you have a stomach to feed. I have been here with a large group, and a intimate couple. The dress code is interesting. You have folks that are dressed up next to people that are wearing jeans and t-shirts. To me this is a special occasion place, where you go for a really nice out. I'd say give it a try with a group because it's a lot of fun, just remember flip you coaster green to go, flip it red or the food portions will not stop! You will get your moneys worth.
