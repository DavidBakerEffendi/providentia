What a joke! Ridiculously overpriced, portions are inconsistent. I went with a bunch of people who had similar dishes and ingredients, and all had different portion of rice, quinoa tabouli, beets, and other ingredients. Their pudding keeps shrinking in size every time we go there. The food is actually pretty good, it is just a shame this place is SO inconsistent and portions are just tiny. So, if you want to pay $14 (inc.tax) for a small portion of salad; and $5 for a tea spoon of pudding, then it's the place for you.
