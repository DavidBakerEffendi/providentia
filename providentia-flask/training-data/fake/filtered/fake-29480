I frequent AR's quite a bit, I love the food... so why not? I brought my family here (they were visiting from out of town) after raving about the fried chicken. Boy oh boy were we disappointed. First of all, the chicken breasts were HUGE. Its obvious that they either aren't using naturally raised chicken. If i wanted genetically modified chicken, I could just go to the fast food chain up the street. Â And second the oil was FAR from fresh. We could tell that other foods had been fried in the oil... most notably, fish. It tasted as if we ordered fish with our mac & cheese and collard greens. If it looks (somewhat) like chicken, it should taste like chicken... not fish. I would give them a pass as it was the weekend, but its obvious the oil hadn't been changed in a while... at least a week. Hopefully they can get it together and resolve the issue. It will be a while before I go back, I want them to take all the time they need to resolve things. I REALLY love Amy Ruth's, and I hope you guys are able to work what ever the kinks are because its really hard to find good southern cooking these days. You guys have all the tools (great food, good service, new decor) to make the business work.
