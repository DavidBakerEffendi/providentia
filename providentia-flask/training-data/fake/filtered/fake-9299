This is a great place for any holiday or special occasion. So far Ive been to Mulberry Street for Christmas Eve, Valentines Day, Mothers Day, countless birthdays and any other excuse my family could come up with just to go back. We all agree, we love this place. Between my whole family and myself we have probably tried the entire menu and we have yet to taste anything bad. Everything always comes out delicious and in impeccable time. The only waiting Ive done at Mulberry Street is for the occasional table and its well worth it considering the house specials seem to be updated constantly with new meals you wont find anywhere else and unique twists on classic favorites. Regardless of when in the year you go there, your gonna find something on that menu you just love.
