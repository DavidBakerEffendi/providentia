I ordered a plain BLT with regular mustard. My girlfriend ordered the california BLT. My BLT came with spicy mustard that burned my tongue and when I asked the guy to take it back he rolled his eyes at me! My girlfriends bread was very soggy! When we left there we both had very bad stomach pangs. This was by far the worst place we've eaten and have no intention of ever going back... It was terrible.
