The thing I like most about this place is that you can have a very expensive meal, or a very inexpensive meal, and feel like you have had comparable experiences. My favorite dishes are the spare rib sandwich, the endive salad, and the steak (we vowed not to order it because we wanted to try some of the smaller dishes, but of course the couple sitting next to us ordered it and raved about it, and you know what happened next). Â Good drinks, although I don't love the concept of a pitcher of old fashioneds.
