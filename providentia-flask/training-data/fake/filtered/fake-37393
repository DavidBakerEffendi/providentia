I was lured in by the nice, new exterior and 1/2 price happy hour specials. The bar was good, drinks weren't bad. The atmosphere is really nice, and the service was good because there weren't many people there. The only thing that disappointed was the food. For a restaurant off Oak Tree in Edison, you except much more. If you're on Oak Tree, you have to bring your A game or you're not lasting long as a business. For a place called Urban Spice, the chicken was lacking some spice. The paneer dish we got was also bland. Deep fried appetizers were good, but it's difficult to mess that up. Didn't want to even order dessert or 3rd round of drinks.
