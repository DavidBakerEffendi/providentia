I've been to Llama tooth three times in the past two weeks and it's so delicious!!!  The servers are so helpful with recommendations. They have the eggs benedict burger breakfast which is amazing at brunch with their bloody mary's!!! MMMMM!!  I love Llama tooth, it's so chill at night, they have a huge outdoor area with a great tiki bar. Great place to go drink and eat!!!!!
