Fantastic experience in a wonderful restaurant. From the minute we came in the door, owner Debbie expected us and led us to our table. Wait staff were great and attentive immediately. The menu is unique and original with food sourced from the best they can find, especially locally. The house-made ricotta drizzled with honey, oil, pepper flakes and mint on crusty bread was so amazing we had seconds!! The burger was delicious, the salmon as fresh as I've ever had in a fantastic lemongrass/shitake/broccoli rabe broth. Get the bread pudding for dessert!! We felt like we had known Debbie for years! Can't wait to go back and try the brunch menu!
