Love the Belgian Cafe - for its beer and atmosphere.  I lived in Amsterdam for four years and the Belgian Cafe reminds me of being in any corner bar throughout the Netherlands and Belgium, minus the cigarette smoke - thankfully!  Yesterday was the second time I ventured into the dining room for some food.  Both bad experiences!  Most recently I ordered the salmon shepards pie.  The description on the menu is yummy.  This too was confirmed via our waitress Sara.  The dish came out with a thin crusted top but hidden underneath the surface, the mashed potatoes and salmon chunks were SATURATED in oil.  So much so that I took the salmon chunks out, dried them on my napkin and showed it to Sara.  It was an INEDIBLE mess!!  I read some of the other reviews and it seems like one should stick to the mussels and obviously the vast selection of beers.
