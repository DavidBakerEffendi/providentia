My friends and I all LOVE Sripraphai! The food is great, the prices are affordable and it has a comfortable vibe. Their menu is HUGE. I really like all the fish dishes that I've tried so far. A lot the food is really spicy so if you're a bit of a wuss about spice like me make sure you consult with your waiter before ordering.
