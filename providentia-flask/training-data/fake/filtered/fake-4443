Was here last week for the first time because a friend recommended it and man was it good! I had the roast pork with some provolone and rabe.  Just the right amount of juice and salt combo to really make this totally delicious.  The cheese was a bit hard which I thought was perfect and the entire thing melted into my stomach.  SO good! I used to see this place on TV all the time so it's really nice to have finally tried it.  Wait time can be long during lunch but it is totally worth the wait for the price and what you get! Awesome stuff.
