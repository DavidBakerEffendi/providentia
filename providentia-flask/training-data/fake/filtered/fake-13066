I heard about this place from a well cultured Italian friend of mine. She's critical about everything, especially food from her country, so needless to say when she raved about the food I knew I was in for something good. GREAT FOOD. The atmosphere seemed a bit trendy, but as soon as the waitress came by i knew they were not trying to be a trendy place. She was amazingly nice and the manager even offered me and my date a place at the bar after dinner. NICE STAFF
