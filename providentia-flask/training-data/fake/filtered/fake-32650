I love this place me and a friend stopped here around 1:00 in the afternoon to grab something to eat tv all over the place nice lay out. Bartender Sam was a sweetheart welcomed us answered all the questions we had about the menu I got blue moon gingerbread beer that was on tap and I ordered a top gun fat burger that was cooked to perfection has bacon a fried egg a must get if you like burgers. While we waited for the food Sam told us about the Mustang Monday and Latin Saturday and a country night they have. Definitely will come back to the place to catch a football game
