Absolutely love this place. I've gone a good 10 times in the past year. Great wine list :) Musts: ricotta best ever- I've tried to reinvent a version at home. Â octopus- for garlic lovers but such great flavor. Pumpkin buratta is always one of my favs. The spaghetti squash scallops is a go two every time but I am never scared to try something new. The chicken amazing great flavor, you can always tell a good restaurant by the way they do their chicken. Bronzino was unique and so flavorful. I can keep going. The menu is perfect. Always consistent. Service great we love Robert in the bar!! Must get panna cotta and warm cookies!! And brunch is just as good!! Great atmosphere
