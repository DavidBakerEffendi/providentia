I've been a fan of Mexicali since before they moved to their new location. My girl and I both enjoy the food enough to return regularly. The prices are great and the service has been incredibly awesome every single time. Its great to see a local business among the sea of soulless chain stores. If I lived closer, I would hang out at the bar and watch the game sometime. Seems like a really nice bar .
