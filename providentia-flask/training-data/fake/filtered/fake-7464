I like when a restaurant goes beyond the buzz of sudden popularity in the "it spot" phase, through the "wanna-be" stage and then comfortably rests in its rightful place as a truly classic and classy dining establishment. This is Balthazar -- the sage teenager of restaurants in New York who has in its 15 years become far more than the keystone of Soho chic. I am certain that if he were alive to enjoy it, E. B. White would most certainly have included Balthazar in the tapestry of his essay "Here is New York".
