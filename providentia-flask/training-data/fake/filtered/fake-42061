heaven on a god damn platter! Best halal around no questions asked. The combo is amazing. Lamb and chicken over rice with white sauce. The hot sauce is great too just be careful. I recently had the bbq sauce which I was highly against but it was delicious. I usually get a platter when I get out of work on the later side since I work in the area. 6 bucks and your full and satisfied! If you haven't had 53rd and 6th then you have lived.
