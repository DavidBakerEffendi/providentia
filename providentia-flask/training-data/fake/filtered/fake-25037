This place is the place.  I've had Portuguese BBQ all over NJ and I'm very impressed with the portion sizes, taste and selection.  I had the chicken and am in LOVE.   The chicken is juicy, perfectly spiced and enough to save and keep for later. The only watch out is that they only take cash so I had really search the bottom of my purse since I'm not a cash carrier. Five yums up!,,
