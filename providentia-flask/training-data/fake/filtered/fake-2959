Ate there a few times, main dishes are mediocre at best, I'd recommend sticking with tapas.  What keeps this place packed on Fri, Sat nights is fun atmosphere and low prices.  Expect long wait if you come on weekends.  If it's warm out, a cozy patio is a nice option.  May have problems getting a large party seated, happened to us and to our friends.  Management staff is rather unaccommodating and the owner is pretty unstable, at best.  It's ridiculous that the guy was allowed to mock state liquor laws.  With this food and attitude the place would not survive in or close to NYC, but in a NJ suburb where anything outside of a chain restaurant is considered hip it flourishes.
