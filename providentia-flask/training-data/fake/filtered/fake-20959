This might be the best place for banh mi. Why? Affordable, packed with ingredients, fast, delicious! Love the fact they use jalapeno peppers when requesting a spicy 'wich, gotta appreciate that. Their chicken, pork with pate and pork chop options are really good. I haven't tried their other things that are offered on their menu but I'm guessing they're just as tasty due to other patrons' purchases. Bonus: Want some jewelry with your sandwich? Take a gander at the in-store's jewelry shop. It's odd, yes, but hey, I'm sure you've encountered weirder things right?
