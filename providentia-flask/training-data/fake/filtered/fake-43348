Horrible food.  The food is stuffy and filling.  It is not that fresh.  The waitress is rush you out when they saw you are eating desert.  They will give you a bill. Nothing is impressive me.  I go there after the name changes from century buffet to ocean buffet.  This is the first time I eat there.  However I will never go back there again and I would not recommend this place to people.
