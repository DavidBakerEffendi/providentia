Always busy, always friendly, and the food is great too.  Most authentic Steak and Cheese in the area, and the Keating Salad is my favorite.  Their soups are by and large really good - the pasta and beans is very hearty, and whenever they have french onion we order it.  The standout is their clam chowder which seems to have very fresh clams. They've got a page on myspace where they post their daily specials so check there.  If you're in a hurry, call ahead - otherwise just go, stand on line and place your order, then case the 5000 kinds of chips they have while you wait for them to call your name to check out.  They're surprisingly quick turning out the food. Only drawback is that there is minimal seating and it's all bar-style seating.  I always get my lunch to go, so that's not an issue for me. Aside from the outstanding food, the service is really outstanding.  Definitely a must-go if you're in the Hamden area.
