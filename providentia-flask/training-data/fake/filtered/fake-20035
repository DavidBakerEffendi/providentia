One of my favorite restaurant in china town. I really love their Char Kuey Teow. It's better than Penang restaurant by far. Their Kangkung stir fry Â vegetable and Indian Mie Goreng also really nice. They usually give you free desert or free oranges at the end of the meal. It's BYOB, so I always bring wine to share with friends.
