We just attended a family affair at Stingers.  The food was excellent!  We all especially loved the pork with sauerkraut and apples....delicious!! The service was great.  Everyone was very friendly, courteous and extremely helpful.  I would highly recommend this restaurant for any event, whether dinner with the family or a catered party.
