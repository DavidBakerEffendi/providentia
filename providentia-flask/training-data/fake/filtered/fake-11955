im not a fan of thai as much but my friend brought me here i wasn't happy with my food that much it tasted okay a little dry.one thing thats weird is you cant have coke if you want ice cream at the end whats wrong with this place? very nicely decorated but i dident like the food i rather eat nothing because this food was so bad would have been 1 star if they didn't decorate it nice bathrooms are very clean and place isn't that loud wouldn't recommend to anyone unless a super thai fan
