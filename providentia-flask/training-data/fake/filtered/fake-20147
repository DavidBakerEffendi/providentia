Live in north Jersey and after visiting this place, they need to come up north! Owner is super friendly and asked exactly what I liked and made me an order of a mix of everything! Chips are by far the best I tasted in a long time and by the taste of the fish, I can tell they get good quality food. P.S. Must try the fried oreos!
