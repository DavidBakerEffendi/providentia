Probably The Best burger I've ever had. It melted in my mouth. I don't typically eat hamburger for quality of meat reasons, but this beef is from locally raised, grass-fed cows. I support restaurants like this one that use local and organic and sustainable ingredients. Food, service and atmosphere are great!
