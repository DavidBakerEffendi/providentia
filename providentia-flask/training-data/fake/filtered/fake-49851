Celebrated our  anniversary there. Had a a great time. Loved the food, and the servers were friendly and pleasing to the eye. The DJ, had me moving in my chair the whole time. Great DJ! He played a little bit of everything, that is hot right now. Loved the lounge feel. Modern, yet cozy décor. They have an outside patio, with huge curtains and sofas. So Miami style. Loved it. Great experience, that this Saturday, we got a VIP and are celebrating my Birthday, and watching the Mayweather fight...:) Thanks Lobby!
