I had been excited to try Funni Bonz as I always buy the BBQ sauce at the grocery store and love it.   Tonight's experience was anything but a delight! THe food was average, but the place is FILTHY!!!!!   Our feet stuck to the floor and when we went to sit down, one of the staff had  run a rag over the table.   It was still VERY dirty and sticky!    The walls are a mess, napkin holders have tons of dust, and the baseboards are disgusting!   The place desparately needs a thorough cleaning.   THis was first and last trip there.
