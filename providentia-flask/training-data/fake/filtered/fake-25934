This place is 3 blocks from where I lived as a college senior and you can be assured that I wasn't usually coming here for the food. That said however their bar snacks were usually very satisfying, their nachos in particular (the most filling vegetarian ones I've ever had) and the pommes frites were decent too. Came here with friends once and the chicken wings were undercooked, but I feel that may have been just a one time fluke. Great list on tap with 20 brews to pick from. The staff were typically very friendly however I do remember an instance when one of them shouted at everyone in the bar for banging their fists on the tables during a Flyer's game. Seriously this is Philly, lighten up. Overall however I have good memories of Devil's Den and feel its definitely a nice addition to a part of the neighborhood that was lacking in places to grab a great beer.
