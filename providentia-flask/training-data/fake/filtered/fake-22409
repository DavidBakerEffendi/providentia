Queens Comfort sucks.  It doesn't take a genius make food moderately tasty if it's fried and slathered in butter and fat - which is pretty much how I would describe every single thing on their menu.  For the love of God, please offer at least ONE option that doesn't end up making you feel sick, filled with regret, and take you one step closer to diabetes.   The crappy, unfriendly service and overly-pretentious hipster vibe don't help their cause either.
