I've dined here twice for sushi and have gotten takeout a few times. It is a very welcome addition to the sushi scene in this neighborhood. I highly recommend the specialty rolls - particularly the Osaka roll and the sweet heart roll. They also have a great deal if you order 3 rolls. It's slightly more expensive Â than Tsuki's or Vik's 3-roll sushi specials, but the rolls at chattime have more to them and are more filling. Highly recommend!
