Went for happy hour and dinner with friends on a Friday night. Wasn't too packed when we first showed up so we quickly got a seat. The one negative is that I wasn't told by the bartender that the happy hour only included wine on tap and not by the glass... But no big deal. The food was fantastic! Loved the deviled eggs and the bacon wrapped dates. Our server was fantastic! Very friendly and attentive- which unfortunately can be a rarity in the city especially on a Friday the more packed out a place gets. The manager came by to check on us and how satisfied we were with our meal. I will totally go back again!
