For sure the best cuban food in New York, Monday's tamal en cazuela, lo maximo, Rene and Baldo owners for around 40 years allways there for you, their older brother Sindo starting this business in el Cacahual, Habana until Castro came and take everything from them, excellent food everyday. Nice place for families.
