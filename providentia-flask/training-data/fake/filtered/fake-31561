Ate here last Saturday and everything was absolutely perfect. The food was incredible as was the service. My boyfriend and I were a bit late for our reservation, about 20 minutes but the hostess, I think she said her name was Syeda (sp?), was so understanding, so sweet! And that lobster mac and cheese was the best I've ever had. Was a bit of a trek from Harlem but, honestly I'd rather go here than the bougie places in Manhattan.
