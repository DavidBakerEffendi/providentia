Three years ago I made my first visit to Philly and vowed to never go back. Then earlier this month I was called away on business (Gambling in Atlantic City) and decided to meet a friend in Philadelphia for the drive. The first stop we made was at Rosa's Fresh Pizza and the slices didn't disappoint. Â Only $1 for cheese and $1.50 for Pepperoni plus all the red pepper flakes and oregano you could ever want. Not only was I pleasantly surprised with the taste but the staff was exceptionally friendly. Mason (the owner) was exceptionally handsome and polite and even asked us about our experience in the shop and for feedback on the store. I told him that the only thing I would change is if he played more Rap music and he immediately put the Marshall Mathers LP on the speakers, a surprisingly effective compliment to the environment in the store. What really sold me about Rosa's was the story of the owner. Mason was a former Wall Street Finance guy making his money doing excel modeling and blah blah blah when he decided what he really wanted to do was sling pizzas for a living. So he quit his job with the intentions of bringing quality, $1 per slice pizza to his hometown. This may sound cheesy but I believe Mason does this for more than the pizza, he has a pride for his hometown that he wears on his sleeve and from the brief time I spent at the store he seemed extremely happy to be bringing a cheap and delicious Pizza to the people of Philadelphia. Because of Rosa's I will go out of my way to make it to Philadelphia and I'll be sure to get some $1 pizza while I'm there.
