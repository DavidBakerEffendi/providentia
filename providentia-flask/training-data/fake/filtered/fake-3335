I ate here the other day while on a business trip with a few partners (we have various real estate investments in the Philadelphia Area).  I must say, the food was beyond amazing and the friendly staff complimented the outstanding atmosphere.  Being a bit of a foodie I always enjoy the innovativeness of menus, and Bareburger's was one of the best!  Offering types of meat one might never see on a menu left my mouth watering before even ordering.  Opting for the El Matador Burger with a side of fries and onion rings I was more than satisfied!  Will definitely return next time I am in PA on a business trip! 5 stars + a few more :)
