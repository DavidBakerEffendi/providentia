this place is under new ownership - food is delicious - he makes the sauce fresh and the chicken is perfect every time I order. The salads are fresh-crisp. I've been recommending to many people. They are open for breakfast on the weekends which is a nice place to go after a rough week of work! Good atmosphere and large menu which is why I go 2-3 week!
