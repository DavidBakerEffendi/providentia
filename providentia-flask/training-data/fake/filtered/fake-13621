This place was fine. The best part of the experience was the service. We had a great server who totally went above and beyond- My girlfriend wanted some mint tea, which they don't have, and the server went out to the garden to pick some mint just for us. We had a pizza and the pork belly entree- pizza was good but the pork belly was underwhelming and overpriced.
