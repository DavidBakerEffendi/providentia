I'm not here to rate the bathrooms. Their fried clam strips, french fries, soups, and cole slaw are just awesome! I have been going here for many, many years. They haven't changed a thing, and that is a good thing when it comes to regular patrons. We want consistent quality. That's what you get at Jimmies. Yes, the dining room could use a facelift. I have noticed they are not as busy as they were when I was a kid. I could remember having wait a good 30 minutes for a table. Even on a Friday now, I don't think we have had to wait more than a few minutes. Big portions. One thing though... if you have a favorite, don't stray from that. My wife has been disappointed when she changed her mind. If you love the clams, stick with what you know and you won't be disappointed.
