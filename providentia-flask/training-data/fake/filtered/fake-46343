My boyfriend and I visitied Ippudo and absolutely loved it! We went on the reccomendation of Claire Robinson after her review on FoodTVs 'The Best Thing I Ever Ate'. And she was right. Simply an amazing Ramen soup! and in such a huge bowl! And the steamed rolls, YUMMY! We had the shrimp ones and it was so tasty and the shrimp was coated in great sauce. My boyfriend tried the pork ones as well but said the shrimp ones were tastier. The whole experience was quite enjoyable, from the loud japanese yells coming from the kitchen to greet customers to the waitress who was nice enough to take a few pictures for us. If your in New York City, DEFINITELY check this place out!
