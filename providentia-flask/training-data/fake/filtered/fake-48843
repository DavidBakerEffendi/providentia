I was told by a co-worker to check this place out when visiting Brooklyn. It happened to be walking distance from my cousins and a favorite of her and her husbands as well. We were not disappointed. I had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and the flavors were amazing. The chicken fell right off the bone. It was probably my favorite meal I had while in NY. My fiance had the Oxtail and ranked it in his top 5 meals ever eaten in his life! We left full and happy. I highly recomend this spot!
