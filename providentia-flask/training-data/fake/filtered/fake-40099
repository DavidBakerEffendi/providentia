I find it ridiculous that some people are complaining about the price going up and having to put the sauces on yourself. First I'd like to say that did you know that the price of grain has gone up alot this past year. Also having to put your own sauces on only makes the wait quicker. Stop complaining and enjoy. BEST IN NYC AND I'M SURE IN AMERICA!
