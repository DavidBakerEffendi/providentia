It's been a while since I have visited Amy Ruth's.  We always used to eat here and I can now say, I will never eat there again!!!  My brother ordered their chicken wings and as the waiter came over with his food, he tipped the plate and off flew a wing to the floor.  Waiter says "i'll bring you another", and in one nano seconds comes back with a "new" wing on a plate.  Needless to say, he didn't eat it as we suspected it was the same runaway wing.  Food did take forever to arrive, and forever to be cleared as well!  As we were leaving the dining area, we see people scurrying and noticed there's a huge roach "waterbug" running around the entrance of the dining area where the hostess is located!!!  I will never eat here again!!! Gross!!!!
