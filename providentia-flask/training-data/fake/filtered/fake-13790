Excellent location and excellent food, and a very friendly environment, prices are very reasonable. A family friendly. Excellent specials for Football season, the service is very good. The bar service is excellent and they some of the best cocktails Â in Mercer county. The lemon drop is heavenly. I recommend this place over and over again. Family owned and a family member is always there to make sure that the customers are given the best food and service.
