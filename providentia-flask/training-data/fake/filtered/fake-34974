The main dining areas are attractive, but despite a reservation, we were seated in a windowless basement area with cold air blasting on us from ceiling vents. The service was incredibly slow and inattentive, and when the food finally arrived, it was truly mediocre: my "roasted chicken" was barely cooked and nearly room temperature, as if it had been sitting. We waited nearly 20 minutes for our dessert order, and when it came, the waitress announced that she had prepared it herself because the kitchen was so backed up (this was now 9 p.m.) Portions were relatively small and decidedly overpriced. Given the lousy food and the even worse service, we won't be back.
