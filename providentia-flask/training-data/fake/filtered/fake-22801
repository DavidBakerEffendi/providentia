I have always loved Max restaurants and Trumbull Kitchen was no exception. The atmosphere is sophisticated but unpretentious and invigorating but not noisy to the point where you can't hear the people at your own table. The food, drinks, and staff are excellent! I highly recommend the crab cakes, pork shank, the Moscow mule cocktail, and the ice cream sandwiches! The price is worth the fine dining and fantastic service!
