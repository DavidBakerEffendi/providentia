Dragonfly blew me away for the area.  The food was excellent.  I had the calamari for an appetizer and was very pleased.  The sushi is really fresh.  I was told they have fresh fish flown in from hawaii everyday.  I really enjoyed the sea-bass for dinner it had a great taste.  Also the plum wine sangria i had was really good.  I loved the atmosphere in the restaurant.  They had a great jazz band there wednesday night when i was there.  I will definitely be returning to eat. i was also very excited to see all the different types of sake they had!!
