First off let me the 5 stars is based on Service 1st, food quality(for an upscale deli type joint, and over all experience. Monday night, just arrive, needed to feed family. No wait and got sat on patio, was off to good start. Our server Alex(rockstar server, I'm in the biz,so these things stand out to me) got my wife a glass of wine and me barcardi/diet on table before i could finish deciding on an app. Buffalo wings and Hummus to start, Awesome! I went with Alex's suggestion of Brisket melt, my son's a Ruben, and Swiss burger, and my wife BBQ Chix salad. Great size and all great tasting. More drinks and dessert. Carrotcake cheese cake, rasberry swirl, and chocolate mouse cheescake. OMG! Some of the best cheesecake I have ever had. Great place to have diner. Great prices. Best of all Great service. Ask for Alex and see what I mean. Will definetly be back
