The interior decor of this establishment was very pleasing on the eyes- clean, sophisticated. I came during lunch time on a week day, and there were very few other customers at the time. We ordered poutine and mac and cheese, which were both very good. However, it took a ridiculous amount of time to receive our food, especially since there was almost no one else there, and during that time our waitress never came to check in with us or offer us more water. The wait staff takes their orders with iPhones, and as that is not a very common thing in VT, it took us a minute to figure it out. Perhaps this concept should have been explained. Thankfully, our waitress was v pleasant, so their customer service was at least reassuring. Overall, I was still able to enjoy the meal and would go there again to try something else off their simple menu.
