DO NOT go to this restaurant!!!!! Went there for my daughters birthday(a party of 13) and were told the wait would be 2 hours....but it wasn't  2 hours..Mr."Cuban "Pete himself kept pushing it back another 40 minutes then another 30 minutes..by this time it was almost 11pm....when asked if we were ever going to be seated he told us we were off the list and he gave the table to another large party,When someone in our party went to compalin to him..his response was "YOU F*#*+*#G WHITE PEOPLE"!!!!!!!!!!!! Never in my life has a restaurant owner spoke or treated me or my family in this manner. It is obvious he  feels he can treat people like this and they will continue to come back to his restaurant ....I hope not.
