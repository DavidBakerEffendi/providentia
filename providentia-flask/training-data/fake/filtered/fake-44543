Made the mistake of going with my family here today for lunch. With the way the interior looked  I honestly had higher expectations for this place. One of my cousin's forks still had a little bit of food on it. which was disgusting  Service was terrible. Waitresses were overly sassy and just plain rude. One of them sounded like she was accusing us instead of asking if we ordered an extra Pad Thai. I also cannot tell you how long it took for me between 2 waitresses and a waiter for them to give me the extra side rice I ordered. Unbelievable....   Food was decent, but other people are right...it is overpriced.  Definitely have had better Thai food and better service. My family and I probably will not go back..
