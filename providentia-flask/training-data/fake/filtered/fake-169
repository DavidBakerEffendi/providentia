The meat had no flavor. Â Maybe it the person that was making it, but I don't think Geno would server this sandwich. Pat's had more flavor in the meat. The bread was the same in both places. Both places were clean and the food came out fast. For me on this day, it came down to the flavor of the meat itself and it didn't happen at Geno's today.
