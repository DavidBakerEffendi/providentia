I planned a special brunch for my bachelorette party and made reservations here three weeks ago. Â Two hours before we were supposed to be at Vin et Fleurs, they called and canceled my reservation because they had a private party. I had several guests from out of town and had to scramble last minute to find somewhere else to celebrate.
