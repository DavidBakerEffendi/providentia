Came here on a Thursday at 11:45am  thinking that we could get brunch and relax and take our time before a 2:00pm phone conference. It was busy but no wait. We were seated immediately and our orders were taken within the first 5 minutes of sitting. We sat and waited for food until 1:20 at which time we asked for it to go.  It took another 20 minutes to get our bill and food. We were told our food had taken so long because a large party that had come in and a large order that had been called in.  We waited almost 2 hours to get our food to go. We were offered free drinks to go and 5 dollar gift cards but no discount on our 35$ brunch bill.  When we finally ate the waffles that were supposed to come with real maple syrup were packaged with fake sugar free syrup, the burrito that was supposed to have avocado, chipotle sauce And cheese, came with one small sliver of avocado at one end, cheese that was melted over the 2 cut ends but not throughout and no chipotle sauce on or in it.  Terrible terrible experience. Wouldn't recommend to anyone!
