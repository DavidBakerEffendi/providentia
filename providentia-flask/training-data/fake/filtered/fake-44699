OK so here the deal on Bellini s, in Avenel .I am 47 from Brooklyn and live in Woodbrdge. I still work in Brooklyn and visit the best Italian restaurants i NYC. I am also Traditional Italian ,American. Bellinis in Avenel is excellent old school Italian Pizza and dinners. The service is good ,The owner always there and try the salmon amaretto" out of this world .The best fish dish I've ever had.
