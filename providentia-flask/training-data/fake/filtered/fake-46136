Harvest on Hudson.   Terrible food, clueless service, rude staff, front door greeter more interested in showing off tatoos than being courteous to guests.   The view is great and wonderful setting but after paying for a pricey meal, it's not worth it.  fyi, other reviews saying you'll never find or be able to contact a manager to offer feedback.   that's obvious
