What Â a disappointment - from the website, pictures, menu, etc., my friend and I highly anticipated eating at Northern Spy. We wish we hadn't. He ordered the pork and it was so fatty that every bite felt like it was wrapped in slime. I had the risotto and it was both bland and blah. The flatbread with carmelized shallots was OK. Staff was semi-friendly. The best thing was the decor/environment - truly lovely and inviting. But too bad about the food!
