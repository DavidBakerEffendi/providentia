went to pylos last night with a group of 4 and was so impressed! definitely the best (most authentic) greek food i've had in new york.. . .not to mention extremely reasonable in price. we started with several small plates - artichoke moussaka, saganaki, grilled octopus, the three dips (taramosalata, Â melitzanosalata, tzatziki), and dolmathes. the tzatziki was fabulous - extremely thick and not runny which i find at most other places. the octopus was delicious and not at all chewy. we shared the branzino (perfectly cooked!) as a main course for the table w/ two sides - spinach rice pilaf and swiss chard w tomato (which might have been my favorite!). the fish was perfectly cooked loved the ambiance of the restaurant - the clay pots on the ceiling are a perfect decorating idea! not to mention the communal table in the back if you don't have reservations. all in all i can't wait to go back!
