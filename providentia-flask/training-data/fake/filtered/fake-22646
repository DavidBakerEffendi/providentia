Even delicious food doesn't mask the icky taste in my mouth from the nasty, arrogant staff. From the guy who deigned to seat us to some guy doing head of house to the sour-faced server, everyone made us feel like a major imposition. And it's not like we asked for substitutions or extra plates or anything else that could make a server cranky. I don't want to feel like someone's doing me a huge favor by letting me sit down and pay to eat. Not sure why, but I went back again, just for a glass of wine. It was early and there were only two tables occupied. We asked if we could sit in one of the tables by the bar to have a drink. The host looked at us and gestured to the bar. He wouldn't even speak to us to say that we couldn't sit at a table. Weird. Get over yourselves. And use your words.
