I don't understand how in the world this place has such good reviews. I've been to Lombardi's two times and each time I got the margarita pizza. NO FLAVOR. I had to load it up with parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. It had no spice, no flavor, no umph. Maybe I'm missing something. I gave them two stars because the service was good. The pizza, for that price, I think $18 or $20 sucked ass.
