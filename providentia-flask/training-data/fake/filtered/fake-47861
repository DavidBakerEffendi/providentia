A dying breed in the eyes of many, Billy Murphy's gives you any and everything you'd want out of a local bar.  Good food (and rapidly improving, I might add), a solid beer selection and above all, good people.  The owners of the establishment have always made both myself and anyone I've ever brought there feel like part of the their family. Whether it be Turf or Tatu, Mike or PJ, Chris or Rob...the staff treats you how you should be treated...as an individual who is there for one thing, a great time.  I've spent many a night at Murphy's, and I'm insanely proud to call these guys not only my favorite bartenders, but also, my friends. I cannot tell you how many times I've run into people at this bar that I hadn't seen in years.  It's a true neighborhood gem that will welcome you with open arms and make you part of their family.  And if you're really lucky...on a random Wednesday, you might find a really handsome guy working there known simply as "The Hammer."
