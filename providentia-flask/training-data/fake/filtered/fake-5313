Excellent Greek on the UWS. I have been coming here for a while I first went when they were located on 79th street. The food was excellent then, it was just ok for a little while when they first opened at the new location and now wow, better then ever. I went last night we had the octopus appetizer and shared the lamb and branzino. Everything was great, the food and service.
