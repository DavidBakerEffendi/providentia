My family came in from California and they heard we had to try the pizza at Grimaldi's.  We got there with a line outside and it went pretty quick which was good.  Once we where seated we ordered two pies and sodas.  We got our pizza and that was the last time we saw our waiter.  Needless to say the pizza was mediocre at best.  We ordered tartufo for dessert which was very good.  Being that we went there for the pizza though which wasn't good and the service was terrible I will not be going back nor recommending this place to anyone.  If you want good pizza in Brooklyn go over to L&B spumoni garden.  It's not a thin crust pizza more of a deep dish square slice but delicious. The food there is also great.
