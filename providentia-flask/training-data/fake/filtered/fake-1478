Enjoyed the Native American dinner every Fall and 2009 New Year's Eve celebration,  casual dinners and Judy's special program dinners.  Spur of the moment lunches on Saturdays were a treat.   We even hopped on the buses and joined in on political protests she organized.   We're not happy about  the changes by new owners.   We used to gladly pay the prices and go round and round the block for a parking space  to enjoy delicious local, organic, White Dog  food and their local beers but no more. My favorite food was their fabulous beef, any form ...steaks or hamburgers..even though the one I had recently was much smaller and didn't taste quite the same.   (Thought the regular chef was off that day.) The truth.......according to writer Daniel Denvir,  they're no longer buying their beef from local, organic Chester or Lancaster County people as before. Close your eyes.  What do you hear?  A TV in the bar blaring news and sports announcements?   With that addition, White Dog has the same ambiance as any neighborhood taproom or sports bar.   Blah hamburgers, shouting heads on walls....White Dog isn't special anymore.    Yikes!
