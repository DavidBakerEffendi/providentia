I was looking forward to coming here based on the reviews, 1st time I tried for lunch there were about 7 people downstairs which made it crowded (it is so small) so we had to leave and ended up at Frances Tavern Tried it a 2nd time when a coworker told me they opened the 2nd floor for lunch. We got there early which was a good thing as it got busy. First of all the bench seating on the 2nd floor does not match the table height, the benches are way too high or tables way too low which ever way you want to look at it! It made it super super uncomfortable trying to have lunch. They seemed to put a lot of money into the place yet they couldn't measure the benches properly???? The food is only ok, there are much better options in the FiDi area for lunch. The apps were greasy and the steak sandwich was tough. Server was sweet however I will try it at night time again to see what it's like but on this experience it is going to have to majorly up it's game before it can get me to leave my favorite cocktail den-Vintry
