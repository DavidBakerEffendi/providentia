The Boil is a great place for a large group and even for dating. I had visited this place twice in a month. They have varities of seafood choice such as crawfish, crableg, shrimp, and clam. So you can order them by the weight. Their special sauce is delicious and must try. Although this place is famous for crawfish, but I think crableg taste better than crawfish.
