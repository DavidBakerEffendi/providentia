Service was absolutely disgusting. The worst I have ever ever experienced. No menus left to look at. Told we can go online to look at a menu however no wifi available. Girls standing around talking when dirty tables needed to be cleared. One worker looked like she should be working at a strip club the way she was dancing around. Food made up for it although a bit expensive. Was given my food to take back to table and when asked where my wings were she snapped at me and told me to go sit and she would Bring over to me when originally I was told to wait for all my food and to bring to table myself. Very very rude. Service is not hard to get right. I will never be returning there
