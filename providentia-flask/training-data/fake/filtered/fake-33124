First let me say that I enjoy Westville. Their food is very good and they have had a good Food/Value ratio in the past. Welcome to 2013. Prices have gone up across the board and the portion sizes have gone down. I will still go, but not as often. I do resent the tactic of reducing portion size to squeeze out another buck of profit.
