This tapas inspired menu is always interesting and delicious. Every dish is big enough for two people to enjoy or 4 people to taste. It's fun to try so many different things during the course of a meal. The small space ends up feeling warm and inviting rather than cramped. The list of spanish wine is inspired and when you order by the glass you get a mini-carafe, which really makes it worth the money. I have had somewhat variable service here, but never bad service. I have been with some people who found the food to be on the salty side, but it has never bothered me. The only real downside is that the desert is not worth eating and this isn't really a place to come with more than 4 people. Other than that it's one of my favorite places.
