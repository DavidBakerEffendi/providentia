Went to city steam the other day heard they had great beer from some friends! I love beer i make it myself at home and i am always down to try some micro brews. I also have seen that their beer is in package stores witch makes me think it must be good!!! But when i went to city steam i was asking some questions and found out that they do not make any of the beers that is in the stores! witch was disappointing to hear!!! Â Also they did not have a lot on tap witch caught me off guard. For someone who has a rep as they do! Then my friends and i ordered food 3 of us got the some thing and all 3 of ours did not come out or look the same!!! Also the place was very dirty fruit fly's everywhere my lemon was very slimy like it was not kept cold! Then when it was time for the check we waited for at least a 1/2 hour and once the check was given to us we watched our server go up and down the stairs multiple times before coming back to our table! not impressed at all. very disappointing Not going to be going back anytime soon!!!
