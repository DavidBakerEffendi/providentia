I go to Gleaner's almost everyday.  I feel weird when i dont go, like something is missing.  The coffee their is the best and the sandwiches woooooooooooooowwwwwwwww amazing.   Everyone their is really great.  And the hot guys that come in their ummmmmmm.  Oh yeah the girls that work their are really nice and cool.  If you ever need to know anything like what to wear on a date, advice about lifes descions, or directions to some place great.  They know everything.  And during the whole conversation you could drinking their coffee or eating some awesome.  Oh yeah the art is really great, like it should be in a really gallery.  Dont forget to check it out , grab a latte and check out the cuties
