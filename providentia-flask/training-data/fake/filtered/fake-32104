Love this place. Great food. Authentic! Even though it's a chain. You would not think it was. They have the BEST Grilled Wings. Temp Hot every time. Flavorful. All dishes are delish! Great outdoor seating in the summer. Great for get togethers. Not the best view, but that's ok. Cause the music changes that. The wait can be long on weekends.. But that's OK. It's worth it.
