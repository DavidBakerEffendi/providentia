This place serves a lot of food at a reasonable price. For under $10 you can get a large amount of Hibachi Chicken, Veggies, and White Rice. More students at TCNJ should know about and use this restaurant. Although it is a hole in the wall in terms of size, the quality/price is fantastic. One note: Stay away from the mac and cheese!
