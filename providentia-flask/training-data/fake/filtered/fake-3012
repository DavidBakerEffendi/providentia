Love this restaurant!  It is the perfect place to go with a group to celebrate a birhtday or other special occasion.  I have the say-the food has gotten better as time goes by and there is a great lively atmosphere.  The outdoor seating area is a great spot on nice nights.  The only reason for 4 not 5 stars is due to very long wait time that can occur.  Sometimes the wait can be an hour long!  I do think they take reservations for large groups though.
