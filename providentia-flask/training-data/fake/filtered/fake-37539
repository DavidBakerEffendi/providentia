This place is a diamond in the dirt. The food here was amazing. First thing for me is customer service. The service here is attentive, polite, warming (like your eating at your best friends kitchen). The resturant interior was clean and inviting. Diamond's is a hidden gem, and a place that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys great Italian food.
