We had lunch here on Saturday Nov, 10, 2012 - me, my cousin and her kid. The food was a 3.5 out of 5 The service was a 3 out of 5 - efficient and courteous; in a friendly but "what are you doing in this neighborhood" kind of way.   And then at the end of a pretty good creme brulee, we found a hair stuck on the dish. Ruined what was a perfectly good experience till then. At our request our server had brought the check with the desserts.  A guy (manager? some other muckymuck?) came to pick up the payment.  My cousin pointed out the hair. He didn't say anything as he took away the dish and the check. He brought back the charge slip and said they took it off the bill.  But no "sorry" or apology of any kind. The guy also chose not to acknowledge us on the way out, even though we said thank you in their general direction, and the hostess and some other woman standing around responded in kind. The guy's attitude is explicable only if he thought we put the hair there ourselves. Or, if he thought - what the hell, we took it off the bill, didn't we? (My cousin and her kid have long hair, I have none;  but we could have plucked it off someone's head at the next table. Or, plucked it off his head since he had the right length for it.)  We left the usual 20% tip regardless. I understand accidents happen. In all kinds of restaurants. But the difference between a place I would go back to and one I would not go back to is how they handle it. Usually, even in Chinatown, they don't blame the customer for their accidents.  And I would not have bothered to write this review but for the passive-aggressive, holier-than-thou, we-couldn't-possibly-be-at-fault-it-must-be-you attitude that came with the hair in the dessert.
