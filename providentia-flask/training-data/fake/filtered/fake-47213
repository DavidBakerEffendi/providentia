This place is great! The atmosphere and the decor are beautiful, the food is absolutely amazing from the hummus appetizer to the kid's chicken fingers and french fries everything is great. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. The hookahs are awesome! They have so many flavors it is hard to choose just one to smoke. They have a $12/minimum per person which is pretty cheap. When I go out to eat, my friends and I usually spend about $20+, so I think 12$ a person is reasonable.The service is excellent.  The staff is very friendly and accommodating.  They are willing to answer any and all questions as well as help you to get the meal you were looking for.  I wanted the broiled salmon, but I wanted it grilled with vegetables and not rice, and the servers had no problem accommodating my requests.  They were wonderful.  And the management is amazing as well.  They are very accommodating and reasonable when it comes to any concerns we have about seating or the food.  My boyfriend had the lamb and it was a little over cooked, so the manager and the server took it back and he got a new one cooked the right way within minutes. We couldn't have asked for anything better!  I have suggested to all my friends that this is the place to go!
