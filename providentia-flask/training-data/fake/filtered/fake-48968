I was completely delighted by the meal I got there.  I am very rarely in that neighborhood and I just saw it across the street. It looked clean and cozy and inviting and the real deal  The people who work there are kind and responsive and gracious, and the lamb cous-cous was some of the best I have ever ever had.  The piece de resistance for me was the sweet strong mint tea with a hint of rosewater in it  Also the homemade hot spice which is incredibly fresh and which the proprietor is justifiably proud.  I completelty recommend it it on all levels.
