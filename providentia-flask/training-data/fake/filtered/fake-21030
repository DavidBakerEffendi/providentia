I have gone to Kanella numerous times now, and I would say that it is, by far, one of the best, most interesting, and most satisfying restaurants in Philly. The food is outstanding, with love and passion clearly poured into making it by executive chef Konstantinos, the service staff is attentive, quick, helpful, funny, and entertaining. Ambience and decor are superlative - the place has the authentic feel of a Greek island taverna, yet the food qualities belies an understanding by the chef of the polished cuisines of western Europe. Five star rating from this user!
