I can have breakfast anytime. Not greasy! This place is straight out of Europe with OWNERS ON PREMISES. Always patient with me when I venture outside my comfort zone. So chill. Best French Toast! La Maude's and N3's top brunches in NLibs. I predict 2013 health-related resolutions stick--this place on 4th street makes jumping off the "Honey's Bandwagon" an easy transition.
