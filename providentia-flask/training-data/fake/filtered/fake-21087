Don't come here if your hungry, was really disapointed in this place that i've been wanting to try for a long time. never heard of a chinese restaurant that didn't serve mustard sauce ,duck sauce, or soy. had chicken and brocolli how can you mess that up was bland no taste and the veggies were real tough my wife's dinner was worst.have a local chinese restaurant that'l blow this place away and for alot less money oh yea did i forget to tell you bring alot of cash their not competitive.that's for sure!!!
