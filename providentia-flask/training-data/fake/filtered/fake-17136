Excellent selection of beers plus three big screens - went there at lunch time to watch the arsenal football game - based on the great service and good looking menu I took five back for diner. Starters - humus excellent - mushrooms small but tasty - main courses - sliced sirloin excellent but smallish - salmon excellent - ugly duckling burgers excellent - ugly duckling salad tasty but too small. Fries were good but not outstanding. No ifs no buts service was first class. Food arrived quickly and was hot. Prices were very good - The ugly duckling burger which includes a quails egg and pulled pork on top was 10 dollars which is very good value. Dessert menu small but appealing. Five stars for excellent service, great prices and good to very good quality food.
