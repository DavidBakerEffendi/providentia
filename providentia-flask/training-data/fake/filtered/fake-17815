The atmosphere was lovely and the food was excellent. For the first course I had the duck quesadilla, which was enjoyed by all 6 of us at the table. simply wonderful. My husband had the duck rillettes, which was also quite tasty. The butternut squash soup was a hit, the bone marrow dish was apparently wonderful (though I did not try that myself), and the gumbo (soup du jour) was amazing. For the second course 2 burgers were ordered, and they were loved by all. Both the crispy skin trout and the striped bass were simply perfect. The steaks came out perfectly pink. The desserts were macaroons and creme brulee, both of which were stunning. Really, I'd have licked my brulee dish if I could have. The waitress was a bit to chatty for my taste, but not everyone would agree with that I'm sure. She was friendly and perfectly competent anyway. My only complaint was that the coffee was weak and the decaf was slightly burnt. It was a sad way to finish an otherwise perfect meal.
