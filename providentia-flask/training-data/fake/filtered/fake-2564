I had to try this place because of the line but I was surprised to see that the reason to the line is one slow service. The pizza itself was a hart attack; I won't be surprised if one slice is Â more then 2,000 calories. I ordered 2 slices but I couldn't eat the second one fearing for my life. The amount of cheese they put on is unbelievable, way too much for me. If you ask me it isn't worth the line or the high cholesterol.
