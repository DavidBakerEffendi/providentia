The Rosa's Margarita here is absolutely amazing. It sounds extremely sweet but it was perfect for my taste because I hate sweet drinks. The decor is just how I like it. The bar is in a separate room from the dining room so that's one less noise to deal with other than your neighboring tables. The chips and 3 different kinds of salsa fill you up so quickly I'm glad my date and I didn't order an appetizer. I told our waitress that I love spicy so instead of shoving a cheap hot sauce in my face she gave me the habanero dip which was exactly what I wanted. Sorry for the 3 stars guys but it is a very pricey place for Mexican food and I'd rather go somewhere more pocket friendly.
