If I could pick no stars I would.  We have used Hummus Grill several times for catering. If there isn't a problem with us ordering over the phone we have other issues. Today the order was an hour late and totally unacceptable.  We enjoy the food a lot but we've dealt with either rude or disorganized.  Shame food is quite good but not worth the hassle and we will not be ordering again.  Beware.
