I can't get enough. I'm a vegetarian so I'm very open to trying vegan places, and this place surpassed all my expectations and has become my favorite vegetarian/vegan place in the city. Food is all super fresh, clean, and has great flavor. It's the kind of food your body feels good eating. Love the black rice, too - I honestly can't even look at white rice sushi the same way anymore. All other sushi has become inferior. The carrot salad is better than any carrot salad should ever be. And the rolls and wraps are all outstanding - my favorites being the sweet tree, spicy mang, and la fiesta. I bring all my carnivore friends here, and time after time, they enter skeptical and leave saying, "that was the best sushi i've ever had." i would encourage everyone to give it a try, regardless of if you're a vegetarian, vegan, or otherwise!
