I would like to rate it 1 star so no one goes to it so it remains the best spot in old city to hang out, but apparently its not a secret anymore. Set beneath Weblinc, a web development company, this bar has great food, a fantastic beer menu, and hosts a number of unique and entertaining events each month. $5 burger and fries for lunch (best lunch in town for $5).  I had chicken ticas once that came with a mango chutney that was absolutely off the chart good (so good I keep lobbying for it to replace the red cole slaw side.  Down with Slaw, Up with Chutney!).  The bartenders are all cool.  There is a dog with a lightbulb in its ass.  I really don't know what else you could ask for...
