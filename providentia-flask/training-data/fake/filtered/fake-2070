Pommes Frites is basically the best place to go when you're drunk and really hungry. It's possible that I only think it's so good because I've only been there while somewhere between tipsy and fall down drunk, but there is nothing better than a big cone of hot fries with several flavors of mayonnaise. Anything with 'mayo' in the name is well worth your while, but my favs include roasted garlic mayo and dill lemon mayo.
