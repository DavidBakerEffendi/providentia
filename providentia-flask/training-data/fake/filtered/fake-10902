Chris, Jon, and Michelle have turned over a great ne w pizza joint where Zuchetta's was.  Incredible pizza (especially the chicken, bacon, ranch) and those cheddar bites are excellent, as well!  Living in Montclair for over 20 years has proven over and over that excellent pizza, fabulous owners, and accomodating staff will make quite a statement where once a lack-luster pizza shop once existed!  I'm sure these folks will make this small pizzeria a huge success!  They have my vote!!  Friendly, honest, and great to talk to!  Keep up what you're doing - you've already made a name for yourselves!
