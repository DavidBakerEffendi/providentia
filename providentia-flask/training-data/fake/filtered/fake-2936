We have been going to this restaurant for a lot of years.  The food has always been good.  The issue I have run into every time we have been there with friends or parents, who are now older is that the music is very loud.  Its really loud enough so that it is difficult to have a conversation over dinner, and its otherwise not necessary.  We have asked them to turn the music down before.  This time they did turn it down , but then they turned it up again.  This happened several times.  Finally my dad went over to the manager and asked him about it, and his reacation to my dad, a customer, was to tell himm that if he did not like it he could leave....  I thought this was pretty rude.  My parents do not want to go back and I was embarrassed. It's a pity because otherwise the food is great, and I always liked the music. Now I think they will lose my business.
