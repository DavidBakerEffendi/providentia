@Nina, not sure where you ate, but it wasn't @Tom $ Pats. Their sauce is definitely not acidic. They without a doubt have the best pie in town. I went with some friends to another pizza place in town claiming to have the #1 pie. It was oily, mushrooms were hard, sausage was watery, you had a trail of oil in your plate when you finished. Tom & Pats is the only place for traditional real pizza.
