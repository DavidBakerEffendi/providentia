I think, this is the best pizza SLICE you could get in Manhattan. I love the spinach & artichoke. The pizza is so creamy and delicious. I would also recommend the margarita slice. Not much needs to be said here. Only issue is the lines after a night out drinking. Be prepared to push and shove people to get a slice.
