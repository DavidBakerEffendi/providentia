I have read some of the reviews and I give it 5 starts.  For starters its a pizza place and I could care less if I get a menu and Eye contact.  I have only been on the weekend.  On each occasion I have waiting in line about 40 minutes.  However I have also waited an hour for Pepes down the road, which I did not like at all.  What my husband and I do is get there before opening and check out the lines.  We pick the line that will get us in the quickest.  There is a call ahead service you can all ahead for a large party and pre order your pizza.  Those people will topically get pizza before anyone else.  They make each pizza one at a time in order of the seating when you get into the restaurant.  It usually takes about 30-45 minutes to get your pie.  You do need to ask for cheese as this is the real ma coy and pizza in Italy does not come with cheese...  Cheese is a topping!  I can not wait to go back the pizza is fantastic!
