Delightful place in a quiet courtyard in Nolita/Lower East Side. We came in by accident; we were planning to go to The National but wound up here and it looked so inviting. Had one of their house special cocktails, and it was excellent and well made. Dinner was simple and good: grilled whole trout with a few vegetable sides. Attentive service, lively room, beautiful old building.
