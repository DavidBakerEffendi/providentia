YUMMY!  My husband is from the area and I have heard about Sally's for 15 years, to be honest I thought it had to be a case of memories becoming dream like it couldn't be that good.  When I walked in I was sure he had to be a tad disappointed it looked run down, I turned to him to see a huge grin!  This is the Sally's he remembered! Now to the important details the pizza OH MY GOD!! We ordered three small pies a pepperoni sausage a cheese and a white clam.  I had to be schooled in ordering as mozzarella is NOT automatically put on your pizza.  The wonderful waiter explained that the clam pizza is really better without it, my husband just nodded. So we ordered and waited ... ten the first pizza arrived the pepperoni and sausage. The meat is cut thick your mouth explodes with flavor.  I only had three bites when the other two pies arrived and the wait advised eat the clam while it hot trust me. Yes sir! I'm so glad I listened garlic clams olive oil HEAVEN ON EARTH!  I have never had a clam pie it is now my favorite!  My poor husband got a slice and I gorged myself into a pleasant pizza coma! I have never ate so much pizza at one time but it is just that good! I had to try a slice of the mozzarella it would have been wrong not to! The sauce WOW!!! I don't know how they make it but I'm thinking crack must be added cause it is addictive!  In short 15 years of talk and hype and I think he was selling it short!  Sally's you've stollen my heart and taste buds ... I will be back in a week or do on our way home!
