+++ This place serve great food. I like to go for lunch during the week, because it can be overcrowded during the week-end. Plus I prefer the lunch menu, with Bacon Egg & Cheese sandwich (with crispy string fries), the blueberry pancakes, and waffle/ricotta/fresh fruits. A-ma-zing. You can also try the Kale Salad if you're not afraid of (very) thick slices of (very) greasy bacon. The lemon and cream sauce worth it. -- I must admit that I prefer the Williamsburg spot, though. Service is faster, waiters are much more professionals. It can take ages to get a table at LES location... EVEN when there's a lot empty table !! Last week my husband and I waited for 15 minutes at the front door when Â waiters were laughing together at the bar, just because they hadn't clean tables yet.... And then, they propose a table in the back of the restaurant while there was lot of space on the front (and no one came later)... I don't know what there were trying to do... Also, get use to wait for 10/15 minutes to be served between each course, BUT they like to bring the check before we have any chance to ask for a dessert !!! Bad habits. The music is greeeat for lunch (good time old rock n'roll...!) but they like to turn on the volume with crapy Rn'B (2 hours of Boys II Men... WTF ???) during the evening. Pick a side !
