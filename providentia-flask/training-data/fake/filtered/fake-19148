I rarely am this negative about any restaurant but my experience was THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT WITH THE LEAST PROFESSIONAL STAFF I HAVE EVER MET.... Great food but expensive... Don't expect that the management to be of any help if you have a problem, just expect and get ready to BE IGNORED if you are under 40 years old!!!! The manager of whom I was told is apparently only in on Saturdays does not seem to be available, the assistant manager is quite keen on ignoring any issues. The "excepted time" (in the assistant manager's words) is approximately 1.5 hours to be served anything (if you're lucky) and probably around 2-3 hours for from ordering until your bill arrives (paraphrasing). The hibachi food is good if your willing to wait but the sushi is so overpriced that you may as well not order it. I had 2 mediocre experiences and the most recent was the worst. There was one 5 person family in restaurant aside from our party of four present in the restaurant. From what our waitress informed us a full kitchen staff was present. 2 hours and forty minutes for some hibachi steak and noodles... Not impressive for the 150+ tab for 3 people. My suggestion: Go somewhere better and cheaper because in my humble opinion it is not worth the wait or money for their food. ADDITION: After calling to place a complaint in a polite manner I was hung up on by the same assistant manager. Â  My personal and professional suggestion to the ownership of this establishment is to clean house, keep as many people as you feel necessary but hire a bunch of new people and fire the incompetent ones. I hope that if I ever return to this establishment that they have cleaned up their act.
