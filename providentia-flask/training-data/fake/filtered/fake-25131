Overall for my first Verti experience I was sorely disappointed.  I was highly disappointed and will not return.  Most everything was disappointing from uninterested bartender, overcharged at the bar, failure to transfer bar tab to table check, (we were honest though!), seated 26 minutes after our reservation in the bar area not in the dining area, the first 2 desserts I asked for were sold out.  There were 2 saving graces, lovely table service and the food was pretty good.  We had high hopes and after all the bells and great reviews we read the expectation was that they could deliver on that and for us they most certainly didn't.
