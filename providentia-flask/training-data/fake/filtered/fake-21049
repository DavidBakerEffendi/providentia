The only good thing I can say about Mamoun's restaurant is that you can get a meal here practically anytime.  Most of its activity is late at night.  Customers aren't so picky when they're half in the bag and ready to fill their stomachs with anything.  This restaurant is dirty.  It is cash only (huh?) and it smells bad.  Paper plates soak up grease and disintegrate into dishrags.  Hard overcooked felafel among other indigestibles.  Not my idea of culinary excellence.  Much better middle eastern food just up the street at the Kasbah Gardens.
