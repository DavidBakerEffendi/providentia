We stumbled upon this place over a year ago when Firebox was closed. How lucky were we? Now a stop at the Kitchen is part of our daily routine! Sometimes for breakfast AND lunch! The muffins are deelish, usually a different one each day. Couple that with a cappuccino or iced coffee, and you got yourself a lovely breakfast.  For lunch, some of my favs have been the goat cheese and tomato tartine, the turkey gobbler, or the chicken salad.  Great soups and traditional sandwiches are also on the menu.  Bring your laptop and stay a while! The people are incredibly friendly!
