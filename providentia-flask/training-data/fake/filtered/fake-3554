I feel so stupid for waiting to get a table for over one hour!!! one thing is if you are waiting to have a fabulous dinner but that was not the case at all! food very average, staff arrogant and rude service, very pricey for no quality at all! I was expecting so much more then what it was, I have one word for this place being so busy MARKETING! honestly that's the only reasonable explanation to me. As a food lover I was very disappointed.
