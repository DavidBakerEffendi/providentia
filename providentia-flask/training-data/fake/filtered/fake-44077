Amazing pizza, fabulous service!  I came here with friends a couple of weekends ago.  There was a private party inside, but they brought out a table for us and set it up on the sidewalk so that we could eat outside.  The entire staff was extremely accommodating and super friendly.  The pizza was amazing!!!  We ordered two pizzas (one crab, one with vodka sauce) and they were both outstanding, as was the Caesar salad.  Definitely worth the trip over from Manhattan!
