For special occasions, I go to Isabella's on the UWS.  It's a beautiful restaurant with the most friendly staff and I usually run into someone I know here (which can be good and bad haha).  The food is as fresh and delish as can be.  Their cocktails are so good and the bartender is really friendly.  All in all, this is my go to place for when I have friends come in from out of town- NEVER A BAD MEAL HERE! Brunch is pretty badass as well- They are always crowded because the museum is right around the corner, so make those reservations early on!  Love you Isabella's- I'm sure we'll have many more dates to come!!!
