Horrible experience. I took my toddler to the bathroom and come back to hear the owner asking my family to leave the restaurant. The owner had the audacity to ask my brother In Law and husband if they were Italian and told them that Cuban Pete's was not an Italian restaurant were you didn't have to wait for a table. All because they inquired on the wait of the table. He screamed at my mother in law and threatened to call the police on her. No one was being loud but him. Terrible experience. After reading the reviews we are not surprised since he has disrespected many of his customers. Makes me wonder if I had asked how much longer the wait was, since I'm Hispanic perhaps he wouldn't had acted like such a racist ass. Too bad we didn't bother to read the reviews prior to going there.
