I've heard good things about this place & tried twice before to get in when I happened to be in the neighborhood. Both times, it was a long wait. I went elsewhere.  So when I was again in the neighborhood on a rare late (10pm) night outing this week, I tried my luck.  No wait!  Yes! Hostess seated us 2 at the bar closest to the door even though there were tables available inside. I didn't press for a table-- perhaps they were anticipating a late night crowd.  Our server was not the friendliest. Rushed us to order, then gave us the stare down when we asked how many skewer came with each yakitori order.  At those high prices, you would think it may be more than 1 skewer.  No.  This is midtown. Fine. We ordered a bunch of dishes. The food was good, but not exceptional. I've had better yakitori in NYC before for much less.  I also noticed when you order cold beverages, you would get about 4 sips in before you realize your plastic cups is left with a full cup of ice.  So we basically paid $3 for a cup of ice. Our server rushed us through our meal by taking our plates as soon as they were partially emptied. Efficency?  Maybe. Then he also took my napkin before I asked for the check. Didn't ask if we wanted dessert and gave us the check. When I asked to split it in half credit-half cash, he looked at me like I grew a second head.  Our meal ended up about $50 per person.  We walked out barely full.  I vowed never to return and was thoroughly disappointed.  Not quite sure why this place is so popular and exclusive.
