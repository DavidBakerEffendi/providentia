First things first, not receiving good service puts a damper on the entire meal and the mood at the table. I was not overly impressed with any of the meals that came out. The fried chicken with red velvet waffles, were not hot and maybe it's me, but it's hard for me to wrap my mind around expensive fried chicken. There is nothing you can do to make fried chicken an expensive meal, not even drop it next to a red velvet waffle. Sorry. I may be a bit biased, being from the south. I think all the sides were pretty good though. The Red beans and rice and the mac and cheese were the redeeming factors on our plates. On a positive note, the place was really cute. Next time I would head out there for drinks and grab an appetizer or a couple of the side dishes.
