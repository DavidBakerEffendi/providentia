This Place is the best.... I don't know what you people are talking about!!!! First - The coffee is spectacular!!! Second - Â the atmosphere is super COZY!!! The story with the 30 min. time limit is just when it's off the wall inside, not during relaxed hours.....I've seen people there from early morn till late eve. Not when you are in deep conversation with your pals. the small coffee is about $1.60, I have been charged more by almost every other cafe in town!!!!! and that's with a buck refill too. The food is great with very reasonable prices. To sum it up, I am a regular there and I love it because its inviting, its warm, the coffee is GOOD, and so is the food. the staff remembers my name and my usual orders. I really cant ask for more!!!!
