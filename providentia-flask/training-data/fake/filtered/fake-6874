I got takeout from here and, frankly, it was quite disappointing. The American Burger was not terrible when considered alone, but the level of service was atrocious. Although I called ahead to place my order and arrived to pick it up on time, they made me wait. There were only two tables of customers in the restaurant, but the staff passed me off several times until they found someone who could ring up my order. I live a two minute walk from Box 63, but by the time I got home, the fries were extremely soggy, to the extent that they must have been sitting out for a while before I was served. Additionally, I ordered my burger with no tomato or onion, and found both on my burger. This was not a very appetizing experience and the service was dismal. I would not recomment Box 63.
