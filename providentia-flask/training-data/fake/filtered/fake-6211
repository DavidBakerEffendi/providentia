I probably wont be back. Its a very outdated diner, needs a makeover in the worst way.Service was a bit slow, asked for my burger and fries well done, neither came that way. Too many good diners around to come back here. Also, the old man at the counter was nasty to everyone, his waitresses, customers. Never again.
