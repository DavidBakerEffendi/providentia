The crispy goat will make you feel guilty for ever thinking your mom's grilled cheese were the best! You cannot go wrong with any sandwich, especially at the price! I come to this place for more than just the food. If you are looking to keep it chill, you can order your food and drinks and hang out in the back or outside...HOWEVER...if you're looking for a good time the guy working the counter will make you laugh your face off. I've taken friends numerous times and have played Jenga on one occasion, Cards Against Humanity another, and just hung out with the bartender and let him entertain us another. Â Great music, epic food, and all around fun atmosphere.
