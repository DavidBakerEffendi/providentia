I would actually give no stars, if I could.  I literally live about half a mile from this place. Yes I should have just walked over.  In my defense, I called at 4pm on a Friday, completely expected to wait, due to yelp reviews. I was told it would take 45 minutes.  Ok.  It's been an hour and a half, still nothing.  This is crazy.  I have no idea what the food tastes like, but, does that matter, if you never get it?  I don't think so.  If it is going to be an hour and a half, TELL ME AN HOUR AND A HALF! Ok, real sweet young man just delivered my goods.  Hard to be a hater to the delivery guy, (my son delivers pizza, lol), tipped him well, and....no salad or bread with my entree, (thought I was asked what kind of dressing I wanted????)  Bite of pizza I took, out of desperation was good, but, definitely NOT worth the freaking hassle.  Get your ish together, Bellini's! Never again!
