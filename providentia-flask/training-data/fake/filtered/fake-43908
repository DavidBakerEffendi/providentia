I love this place. The outside patio is great. You have the view of the city line without the traffic, since it's on Spring Garden Street.  The food was delish and very ecliptic with some regular favorite.  The beer selection was had my favorites and PBRs are only $2. ha ha. The string lighting, tiki bar, mural on the wall and patio were impressive. The inside is just cozy enough...
