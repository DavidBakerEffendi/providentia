Great restaurant with delicious food.  My roomate and I have gone here several times since we live nearby.  The food can be a little pricy, but it's very good and the wine is great as well.  There's a nice terrace outside and if you get there before 8.30 or after 9.30, you generally don't have to wait too long, but then again that depends on the night. I've been there about 4 times, and have always been happy with the service and food.  It's a nice place for a date or for catching up with a friend.  The music is good too, and the lighting is just right.
