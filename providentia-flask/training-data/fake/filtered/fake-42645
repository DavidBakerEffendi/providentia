The Pilgrim Diner was our favorite diner for Saturday afternoons.             But recently the place has not been up to it's high marks in cleaness.    The men's bathroom is awful and should be attended to.                      Families shoud be aware of this. The food is sometimes great and the music is sensational. The busboys  do stand around whispering when they should be attending to services like customers and the bathrooms.                     The service is fine and their are friendly faces that smooth over the faults with good cheer and assistance.But we will return when things get better.
