I absolutely love this place. Although I am not from the area, I actually dont mind driving 30 min just to have a cup of tea and relax in such great ambience. Pros: - Ambience is beautiful, perfect for dates, and to bring friends and family - The owner are really nice , Mary and Mike are very nice people - It is perfect to go alone as well. It is a cozy place to sit and read - They have vegan pastries and appetizers, I tried the "pani puri", the sampler appetizer platter, quinoa salad, lavender cup cakes... loved them all! I would give them 5 stars, but.... - extremely crowded on Friday  and Saturday  nights - The tea/lattes are okay. I ordered  chai latte w/soy milk, herbal tea, and i wasnt blown away with the taste. They were okay. - The service is slower than usual cafes. So expect to wait 10 min for a cup of tea, but the wait is pleasant :) Overall, it is a place that keeps calling my name and I keep going back. You walk in and it feels as if you would be walking to a cafe in Turkey :)
