I think that this place has so much potential!  Because of construction at the old AAA building, the street is blocked off----But Please don't let THAT Stop you from going in! It's Very Affordable for anyone. The BarTenders and Servers are very nice and sincere when they ask "How can I help you?" I felt like they were all happy to have me there!  I had the wings and really enjoyed them.....then I found that I wanted a dessert.  I heard from someone that they will soon have this amazing hazelnut-espresso cake for their dessert!  I am going to go back again!  For the Beer, The Friendly Service, and to try that new dessert!! It sounds like a good way to finish a meal!  I'll let you know what it tastes like after I go back in about a week or two!  In the meantime, go there and enjoy yourself, and see how nice this place really is!!!
