This place is over-hyped! My hubby and I went there for brunch this past sunday. The space is small, over-crowded and man it is loud! Waited for 20 mins to get a small table. You have to yell to each other, but only to hear your only conversation. The crowd were clueless, young hippie who pretend to be sophisticated... Â Go somewhere for nicer atmosphere and better food!
