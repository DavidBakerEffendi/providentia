Always happy to go to Fuji. The whole family is never disappointed. The staff is very friendly. Monday to Thursday is half price sushi from about 6-9 pm? (not 100 percent sure about the time). Yes the portions are a little smaller at that time - hey they still have to make money! But the sushi is great. They move a lot of sushi so there is never any doubt of the freshness- the most important thing with sushi! Â They have some unusual combinations but they could be a little more creative - that's the only reason they don't get 5 stars. And my kids love the fried ice cream
