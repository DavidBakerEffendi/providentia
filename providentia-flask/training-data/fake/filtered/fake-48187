I'm assuming everyone that raves about this place was either drunk or have never had good french fries.  The fries which really should be the staple of this place are basically out of the bag frozen fries which are deep fried.  They are soggy and oil logged, but you get to dip them in your choice of glorified mayo.  It's definitely a one of kind place in NYC, but I won't be returning.
