small place, but it adds to the ramen atmosphere. dont really have that much time to socialize. i feel like you had to be in and out in 15 minutes lol. just eat and get out. lol. but all in all, the ramen is great. everything is very fresh and original and does not take that long for your order to come out. noodles-broth-atmosphere; makes me feel like im eating at an authentic ramen place in Japan. (although, ive only seen it on the tele). you WILL wait a while to get in, but its worth the wait. the smell of the ramen doesnt help at all when your outside waiting. but worth it.
