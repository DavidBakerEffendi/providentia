My friends and I ate dinner at Trading Post this week, and had an incredible meal.  Definitely order the mussels and the iceberg slab salad!!  Our brunette Irish waitress was very sweet and helpful with the menu.  After dinner we moved to the bar for drinks.  Chris the bartender mixed us some fabulous cocktails and gave us a history of the building.  We will definitely be back!
