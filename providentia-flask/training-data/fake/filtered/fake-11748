Recently ordered "Shirmp Pad Thai" and "Vegetarian Red Curry" from here including white rice. Horrible Thai food I have had, extra spicy curry (they never asked me what spice level I wanted). Be careful about what you order from here. The jasmine rice was uncooked. Will never order from here again.
