We went there on an a busy Friday evening, they place was full. If you want to go there better have a reservation though we didn't have but we were lucky and got seated after 15 min of waiting. We ordered burgers, as this place is famous for, but they were not what we expected: dry, med-quality meat with lots of fatty sauce and mayonnaise all over the not so fresh bun. If you are in the area around, it might by not so bad to stop by, but it is not a place to go crazy about, there are way better burgers in the city.
