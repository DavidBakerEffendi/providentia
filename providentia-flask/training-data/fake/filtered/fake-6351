On 8/10/12 we had the Rehearsal Dinner at Spasso for our son's wedding the following day.  The majority of guests were  from Ohio, New Hampshire, California and North Carolina.  The food was amazing and the guests were still talking about their dinner the next day at the wedding.  We opted for butlered appitizers and a buffet instead of a sit down dinner and family style deserts.  Grilled calimari was a favorite as well as the veal saltimbocca.  Service was excellent too.  Thank you Spasso for making our affair a night to remember!
