The food is terrible, every time i went the waiters either gave me an attitude or told me they did not have the things i ordered. Last time i went they messed up my order. I strictly ordered a masala tea and it took them half an hour to get me A CUP OF TEA. not even a cup a small size glass that can be feed to the birds not even human size. NOT RECOMMENDED TO GO. PLEASE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.
