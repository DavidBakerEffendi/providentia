Really great beer selection, although a little on the expensive side ($6 a pint). Double Windsor varies the beer selection, so there's always something new to try. Service was quick and friendly. During my several visits, I only had one altercation with another patron -- a goth woman who looked really put out when I asked her to move her belongings from an adjacent bar stool so that a friend could sit down. Some people just don't get it. The rivalry on Yelp between Double Windsor's and Farrell's patrons is funny to read, but unnecessary. Sometimes you're in the mood for a microbrew flight, other times you want a Slurpee-sized container of Bud. You can have a good time hanging out in either bar.
