My girlfriends and I go to the North Star all the time. We happen to live in the neighborhood (well some of us) and the North Star is always the perfect meeting place to start off the night. The Happy Hour is great for unwinding and sometimes we end up just sticking around for whatever show they have that night. The bartenders rock and always crack us up (who can possible be in THAT good of a mood every night?!) Five stars for the North Star! Girls like rock and roll too! Woo!
