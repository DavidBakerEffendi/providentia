Very nice place with great ambiance and wait staff. Went for brunch and the food was delicious. I had the special Lamb porterhouse. It was cooked to perfection and very tasty. Potatoes were also very good-cooked just right. And if you are a beer lover like I am, the selection was awesome. I had a few Brooklyn Christmas Ales that were very good. I would definitely recommend this place and will return to try other menu items.
