I went here for a pre-theater dinner and was not so impressed with the food--though I did only order from the Tapas menu. Â The best dish was the Grilled Baby Octopus. The lamb kefteddes and falafel crusted artichoke hearts were only okay. The fried chickpeas had a funny, almost metallic aftertaste.
