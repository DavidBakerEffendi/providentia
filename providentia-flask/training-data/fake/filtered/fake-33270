I grew up in Uruguay and visit often and thoroughly enjoyed my night at Tabare.  The meal was perfectly delicious and the surroundings very comfortable.  We started with the melted provolone cheese and mussels in broth.  The portions were just right.  My skirt steak melted in my mouth and the baked potato was so flavourful.  Since it was my birthday, they gave me a complimentary dulce de leche flan which I think was the best I have ever had in my life.  The American version of dulce de leche is nothing like the real thing, and these guys have it!  I also ordered a white Uruguayan wine which was ice-y cold and superb with my meal.  I can't wait to go back.  It is such a treat to have something so authentically Uruguayan so close to home!
