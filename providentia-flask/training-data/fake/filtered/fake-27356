We ordered Â boneless spareribs . They were disgusting , like spit it out immediately disgusting. Weird awful texture, bad taste. My husband went to return, the basically FULL container , minus 1 boneless sparerib & they would not refund money , only credit of make us a new one. NO THANK YOU!!! WOULD NEVER GO BACK & WILL NEVER RECOMMEND!!!
