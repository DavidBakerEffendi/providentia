This is for Brunch - I haven't been for Drinks or anything else..... The Farm was found by our intrepid explorer (and his wife) while scooting around the southern edge of Prospect Park while apartment hunting last year.   It has quickly become our go to place when the belly rumbles on the weekends. Though this place is often crowded during brunch - but we've never failed to be seated quickly to our choice of - outdoor, inside table or counter.  Whichever mood moves us. A common disagreement often occurs with my wife as we both love the same dish.  But we've passed that hurdle as the dish is too good to pass on and neither one of us wants food envy. What's the dish - oh it's just the Trout salad with poached eggs over a latke.  Be the first in your party to order it - then don't share. To sum up    Staff - Excellent- soooo friendly    Atmosphere - Hipster, but inviting    Coffee - Very nice    Price -  Dead on     Eeyie, Eeyie Yo
