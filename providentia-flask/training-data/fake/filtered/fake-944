As a first time customer I will definately recommend Soul De Cuba (New Haven) to my family and friends.  I am not familiar with any of their dishes but, after having an appertizer I was tempted to order again.  Not only is the food delicious but also very appertizing.   I took my visiting mom who came from Cape Town, South Africa and she felt at home the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  The staff was friendly and so helpful and made us feel at home while we were having our meal.  They surely deserve a FIVE STAR.
