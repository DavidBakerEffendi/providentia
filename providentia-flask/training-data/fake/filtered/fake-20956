Salt & Fat. It's got everything. Â tasty food, reasonable prices, and warm and cozy atmosphere. I tried all most every menus here, but if I have to pick the best ones, it would be as the follows; Asian Pear Salad - unique taste.(fuji apple salad was better, but I guess they change it) Yellowtail Tartare - One of a kind! Korean Bbq Wraps - originally like Korean BBQ! haha Rice Krispies, Marshmallow Ice-cream - chewy and sweet! Mmmmm.....! So delicious!!! perfect portion for two (considering that my brother is like a huge teddy bear, worked well) the reason that I just gave them four stars... because the service is just okay(?)- it doesn't mean that the staff are unwelcoming, they are good! just hope to see more smiles on their faces when they get my orders, and one of the ones I like, the korean bbq wraps, are like ordinary korean bbqs I can get from any korean restaurant out there. The idea brought here is good.. but a little more upgrade will be needed for the WOW factor. Anyhow! It is definitely a good place -!
