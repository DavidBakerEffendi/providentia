The host refused to seat my friend and me at the bar-side tables although the restaurant was half empty but the bar was full on a not-so-busy early Friday evening. She stated that the tables were for "diners only", however there were no one sitting at the apparently available 3+ tables on the BAR SIDE. I understand that a hostess must anticipate space requirements for the rest of the night but this simply went too far. We were going to grab a drink while waiting for our friends to join us for dinner but now they lost all future business from all of us plus our friends. The only upside was that as a result, we finally went to Lloyd on Girard and had excellent drinks, meal, and service.
