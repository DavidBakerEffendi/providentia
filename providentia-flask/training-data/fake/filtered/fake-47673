what a big rep!  doesn't live up to it... pretty basic really, and pie sure did cool off quickly - lukewarm at best by 2nd slice!  if it wasn't sitting smack under the Bridge and written up from here to Tokyo, would it really be any more popular than your friendly neighborhood pizza joint?  well, maybe - great fresh tasty ingredients actually, including basil and creamy mozzarella, although small portions of onion & sausage on ours yesterday - a good-looking 18" pie with nicely charred crust, well-cut and delivered quickly - and reasonably priced considering it's a Tourist Temple - cold bottled Brooklyn Lager and fine service are definite pluses - celebrity photos on wall need good cleaning but otherwise basically well-kept - filled with customers having good time - staff cool and accommodating - just one john, but thank god they had that!  out-of-towners should generally enjoy Ye Olde New York location and ambiance but pie not so much more than Bertucci's
