I've only had the pizza & garlic bread from here.  The pizza is pretty good, but the garlic bread seemed stale. Too bad I'll never order from them again.  The first time I ordered, the delivery person didn't have any change.  I'm sorry, but aren't they supposed to have at least SOMETHING in case the customer doesn't have exact change?  Maybe at least call & give us some warning?  Anyway, I decided to just let him keep the couple bucks extra just to not cause any issues.  The next time I ordered, I paid by card to avoid this happening again.  I noticed after that I had been overcharged by a few dollars.  I called to ask about this and spoke to the owner, I believe his name was Phil.  He was actually very rude and seemed to not care at all.  He did say I could come pick up the money from him, but it really isn't about the money-- customers are being overcharged by your employees (or maybe you yourself).  How about an apology or an explanation? I don't see how someone with this mindset will run a successful business for very long.  If I had a bad experience twice in a row, I would imagine the same thing is happening to others and eventually people will catch on.
