We found Tiny Thai four months ago and love it! Whenever we have anything to celebrate, we go there. We can bring our favorite bottle of wine and just sit back and enjoy the food. And they are always packed! So that is evidence enough as to how good it is. The service is always fast. The Som Tam salad is so good, and my favorite is the Tom Kha soup with just veggies. My boyfriend loves the Crispy Combo! Their curry dishes are always amazing and huge. Their prices are very reasonable! And the servers always know what they're talking about. Last night I asked what the best dessert was. Without hesitation she recommended the Mango and Sticky Rice. I was leaning toward it but wanted to know what they really liked. And she was right, it was so mouth-wateringly delicious! Thank you Tiny Thai for another great meal and night out in Winooski!
