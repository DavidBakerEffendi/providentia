After a 20 minute wait, we finally got seated at one of the outside tables looking forward to the famous "Loco Tuesday" Tapas to be served. There was a huge selection of tapas available, and they were all for half-price. I can highly recommend the BBQ ribs and the Chino Latino. We started with a happy hour Sangria and Mojito which was out of this world! It was worth waiting for, the service was fast and friendly and we will definitely be back again.
