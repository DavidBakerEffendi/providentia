A beautifully decorated lounge serving a less formal menu hidden in celebrated Rat's restaurant located within the Grounds for Sculpture. For those that are looking for a less expensive dining option to Rat's, I recommend they try Kafe Kabul. Â Unfortunately, reservations aren't allowed, but I have never had any difficulty getting in.
