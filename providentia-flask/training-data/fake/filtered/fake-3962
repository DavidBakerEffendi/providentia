Made it out to Runner & Stone last week-- dinner for 4. The food was very good and the service was excellent. The atmosphere was lively but not too loud. I'll go back here again at some point because they have an interesting menu with several dishes that I think I'd like. The bartender measures out shots when pouring drinks, which I don't like, but what can you do.
