I would go back to this place because the atmosphere is nice - they have cute outdoor seating too.  But I felt the food was over priced.  I ordered the salad special.  It was tiny, it was 12 dollars, and it was NOT that good!  I was very surprised when I got the bill and saw that it was $12.  The pomme frites were not that good either (but they were only $4 so it's okay).  The drink specials are good - half off beer on Monday, half off bottles of wine on Tuesday, etc.  The service sucked and the employees seemed angry to be there.  I think I would try it one more time though.  I would like to go to the 20th street location because I believe they have live jazz on Monday.
