This is one of our favorite casual BYOB restaurants in Philadelphia.  We have dined here twice.  Wonderful fresh food, and friendly and attentive service.  Specials are always changing and there is always something new on the menu.  Wait staff is very down to earth and knowledgeable about the dishes.  Overall a very pleasant experience at a reasonable price.
