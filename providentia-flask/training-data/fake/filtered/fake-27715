Came in for an early dinner on a Friday. I was pleased and impressed with both the food and service. The pasta was cooked perfectly (I know it seems like a small detail but these details always matter to me). The fried calamari was great, everything was super fresh. We didn't try the desserts though, because we were happy, stuffed campers at the end of that meal. No big deal though, because I will definitely be back :)
