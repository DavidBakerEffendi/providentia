Amazing food, friendly service, and intelligent business sense. This locavore restaurant is the best around Brooklyn and manages to add some DIY clout to Bed-stuy. The interior is beautifully crafted with terrariums and driftwood and the menu has a wide selection to choose from. The cheese is delicious and can even be bought from their in-house store if you should so desire. Those who had an unhappy experience previously probably went during a time when they were getting the kinks out. Every business has their growing pains. Alice's Arbor is open to suggestions and continues to revamp and improve their dining experience. Come in with an open-mind and a hungry disposition!
