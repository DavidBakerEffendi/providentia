I ordered  two pies for take out and spent $34.00. The bottom of both pies were burnt. They were not edible. I called and told them about it but they didn't really seem to care. They did not offer to remake the pies. Usually the pies are very good but with their attitude and customer service, I don't think I will be returning. If you order take out make sure you check and see if the bottoms are burnt.  This place is very popular so don't be intimidated by the long lines. Make sure you get what you paid for.
