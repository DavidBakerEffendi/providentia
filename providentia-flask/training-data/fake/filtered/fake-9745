The restaurant has great appeal, and the food was excellent.  HOWEVER, the waiter spoke very little english, brought the wrong beer and did not offer to exchange for the right beer, just expected us to drink the wrong beer.  I only ate 1/2 my appetizer, waiter asked if I would like to take home, I said yes but at the end of our meal, he had no idea what I was referring to and I ended up taking home a garden salad.  Worst part is I think they are watering down their drinks.  I had two Malibu Beach Martini's, I should have been on my rear, my husband was drinking Kettle One on the rocks and he was sure there was more water than vodka.  Perhaps if we ate in the dinning room it would have been different but our experience was not a great one.
