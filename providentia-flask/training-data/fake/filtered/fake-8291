I live very close to the one on the BLVD. I used to go all the time to drink ONLY.  I have ALWAYS thought the food was crap!  Perhaps that is because the food is PRE cooked. The snob wait staff and bar staff totally deny it. Yet, magically, the food appears at the table within MINUTES of ordering. Not only that, The minutes ones pre cooked food arrives at the table, they present your bill and try to kick you out of the table! My hubby has known Pete for years. He grew up going to the original location.  He is a member of the PPD and he and his buddies would frequent the original place many many times. Then, all of the sudden the place got big and believe me,, It is in name only! sure ESPN and fox 29 love this place but in all fairness to the places that really have good food and service, Has anyone from those stations EVER been to EVERY bar and seafood place in the area?  ah, no.  I read that now they are opening up in MONT. county.  I'm from there. He was quoted as saying. He has the best mussels on earth.  Well, Pete take ur ass into the restaurant that happens to win best mussels every year in MONT. CO.  then, we will talk! P.S.  In all fairness to Pete.  He happens to treat the PPD like gold! My hubby would kill me if he knew i posted this.  So, thank u for that Pete!
