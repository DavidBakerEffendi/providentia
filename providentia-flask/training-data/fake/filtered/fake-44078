This place blows my mind.  I haven't been there, until last night, since they couldn't find a way to cook my chicken so that it wasn't raw - about 5 years ago.  Last night, I met my wife and 3 friends there after work.  I ordered the Pasta with Bolognese sauce.  What a disaster!  The Rigatoni was over-cooked and the sauce tasted like something that I might not feed my dog.  My wife tasted it and felt sorry for me.  I'm Italian and like a nice, simple pasta dish once in awhile - Italian comfort food.  Unfortunately, this was just a shade better than Chef Boyardee  My wife's  Chicken Milanese was good, but the rissoto was horrible.  Our friend's pasta alla oglio looked good and he liked it.  The one other terrible dish - believe it or not - was our friend's Eggplant Parmesan.  How can you mess that up?!  The service was great.  Our waitress was very sweet and  couldn't have worked any harder to try and make us happy.  All in all, I just can't figure out how this place stay sin business, given that its food is so wildly inconsistent.  I am not going back, unless i am dragged there.
