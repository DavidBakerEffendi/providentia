Went to Ahh Piz yesterday and I watched how the owner completely ignored the table of African American folks.. I eat and dine in Montclair all the time., part owner of a business in that same area...I waited to see if he was going to come to our table to greet us and ask us "if it was our first time here." ...because he certainly asked everyone else and even the folks that came in after us that sat right next to us. .It is hard not to assume when things are blatantly obvious. I know allot of folks in Montclair, half of my Clients reside in Montclair and I guess there is a certain kind of people you wants in your restaurant....!!! How can you open up a business in such a diverse community but yet still think and act the way you do, Mr. Part Owner. Wish you luck with that attitude, Money Is Green! Hate to see you lose business because of your pure ignorance. Well I won't be back and will be sure to let everyone I know about my experience.. I mean everyone..."Salute"! Here I come. I've already heard great reviews about it and look forward to bringing my business there.
