I've been to Agno several times now and have been pleased every time. I have Celiac Disease and need to eat gluten-free.  Agno is entirely gluten-free so I don't have to worry about cross contamination issues.  I've actually had a hard time finding gluten-free take-out/casual locations in Philadelphia so Agno is a wonderful treat. The staff is knowledgeable about gluten-free preparation and the food is fresh and flavorful.  Additionally, the atmosphere is open, clean and inviting.  If you are gluten-free and need a healthy, easy, trustworthy place to eat at I would recommend Agno.  It's really wonderful.
