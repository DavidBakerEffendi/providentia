The first thing I have to say is THE GREEK YOGURT IS AMAZING. Personally, I do not like yogurt, at all, I just never got into it. So I was skeptical of trying it as a dessert, but I am so glad I did, it is just the best thing ever. But now that I am done with that: Their Greek fries? Good enough to go on another rant about how great it is, but I will leave it at "you need to try it." So the basic outline of our dinner went something like: Pita bread with 4 types of dippings, the spicy cheese (which is not spicy) is my favorite, but definitely try them all. We essentially had an endless supply of pita bread and there is enough of the 4 dippings to last the entire meal. Then we had the Greek fries (Yay) Then there were the actual stix, I tried the chicken one, which was grilled perfectly. Finally there was dessert, which consisted of the Greek yogurt with strawberries and blueberries, and some type of homemade donut with honey and the option of chocolate. I don't even think that is an accurate way to describe the latter, but either way it was great. So if all of this means nothing to you just remember this: STIX HAS THE BEST GREEK YOGURT AND FRIES and YOU NEED TO TRY THEM BOTH. Also, you cannot go wrong with the pita bread, I think we had about 4 servings, so yes, it is great.
