For NYC street food, I swear for the past eight years they have yet to fail my inclination of delicious food at six o'clock in the morning. Order the chicken and rice platter with the white sauce, get yourself a drink at the cart next to them, pop your @ss on the curb and chow down and enjoy the overly intoxicated pedestrians that walk past you trying to walk, talk and eat their platters all in this exact order and you'll be graciously thankful you read my review! Oh, and be prepared to wait in line especially if its on a Friday or Saturday...it stretches down the block even with the additional carts they have stationed.
