Listen i think that the food is easily considered worth the price. However i would have to tell you that the wait, that felt like almost 3 hours, was honestly too much for me. The food by the way, sort of reminded me of Verde Coal Oven, a restaurant that i ate at a while back but never got a chance to review. Another concern is that the attitude that the staff seemed to give me and the customers made me feel like they were being a bit snobby. The other annoying thing is the atmosphere. This place truly reminded me of the sweat shop. But if its what keeps the young hipsters rolling in, then i understand the move they made. I'm just the type of guy that prefers a less run-down atmosphere. That's really all that i could pick appart from this restaurant.
