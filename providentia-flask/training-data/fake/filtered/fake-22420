I am going to start by saying that the coffee they serve here is amazing. Some of the best coffee anywhere in Astoria. With that said, I will won't be going out of my way to eat here again. I was excited to finally try Kickshaw after seeing various tv spots and from other reviewers. I walked in at about 10:45 in the morning. I was not greeted, but asked the person behind the counter if I could sit anywhere. He responded by telling me that they won't serve food for another 15 mins. Okay, so I can I sit anywhere I asked again and was told sure. I found a seat at the bar and after 10 minutes of being ignored, I waved down the counter person and asked if I could start with a cup of coffee. " Okay, what do you want" was the response. Being that this was my first time, I expected that the counter person would be a little more interested. I order my coffee and sat for another 10 minutes, by this time my stomach was not happy. I finally waved down the counter person again and asked when I would be a good time for me to order, that was when I was told that the chef would be not be in for another 20 to 30 minutes. Finally the chef decides to come in and I order my sandwich which was delivered to me without even so much as an " enjoy" or "here is your food". Â I ate my okay grilled cheese and drank my coffee. After waving the counter person down an third time, I asked for my check, paid and left, again without a word for any staff. Speaking of staff, while I was sitting waiting for the late chef, one server decided that the counter would be a great place to get some sleep after explaining to the counter person that they had taken a xanex shortly before coming in to work. All in all, I'll stick to Il Bambino for my yummy grilled sandwiches.
