I love this place. It is truly delicious. The chicken is better quality than the lamb, but I've found that it feels like there's an element missing without the lamb. Another note: going down to Central Park to eat is nice. If you walk to the park, then go straight down the steps on the right, at the entrance to the park at 59th and 6th, you'll see a nice little lake with benches. Just watch out for raccoons!
