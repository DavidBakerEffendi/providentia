Love this place! I am not a regular yelper I don't write review much. but I am a fan of this Thai place I have been eating here for more than 3 years. They are very good restaurant. Great food with polite service. restaurant looks clean. I am very picky about my food and they always make me happy with my food because I like it spicy and less oil. If you want authentic Thai food and not too crowded I am very recommend. You will get table easily with great dinner. Try Crying Udon noodle. My favorite menu!
