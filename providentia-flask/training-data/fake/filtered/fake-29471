So disappointed! Recommended by U of C friend of my son's.It was supposed to be a special treat. Chicken overcooked and greasy. Service terrible .Room manager was very rude. Young manager the restaurant Â was sweet and almost. Try Sylvias in tears because other girls were giving her so much difficulty
