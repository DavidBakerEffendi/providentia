I love pizza, and needless to say, when a friend of mine told me this was some of the best pizza you could get in the city of New York, I was a little skeptical.  Usually, when someone says nothing but great things about anything, it somehow ends up being somewhat disappointing.  This place, on the other hand, is a major exception.  The artichoke and spinach pizza, which the place is known for, is fantastic, its about as a good as it gets.  The other slices are good too, but the artichoke and spinach is truly outstanding.  The environment is also great.  A small place, but a fun, casual environment with homages to everyone ranging from the Beatles, to Muhammad Ali, to Jake LaMotta, to the Kennedys.  If you're in NYC, I highly recommend it, its some of the best pizza I've ever had, hands down.  However, only have one slice, I eat like a horse, and even I could only stomach one slice.  Definitely worth it.
