Love this place. Chips and salsa are always a plus and tejas chicken is great. I will not give this place 5 stars because I had to wait 40 minutes on a Tuesday night for a table. It is just too long of a wait. Waiting for my fajitas which I absolutely love!! Will def come back again. Fajitas were right on point again. Love the steak chicken and onions!
