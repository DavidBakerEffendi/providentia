wow! by far the best pizza i have ever had.  Ok, the wait is long, but it is well worth the wait, you will never have a pizza like this in your life!  thumbs up!  the first time i visited NYC i went there twice in 2 days, the last time i visited, i went there 3 times in 2 days.  please do not bother going to grimaldi's or any other pizza place in brooklyn, di fara is the place to eat NY / Italian pizza!
