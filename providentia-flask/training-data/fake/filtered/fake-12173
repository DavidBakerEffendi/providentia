I've tried with Miya's. Been in New Haven for 5 years. I love sushi, and the eccentric menu got me excited. Sadly the service complaints on yelp are ABSOLUTELY TRUE. I've taken groups of friends to Miya's in the last 6 months raving about the sushi, only to hear their complaining at the horrible service. The last 3 times I've gone have been a disaster. Once for late night, we only had 1 serving because the restaurant service was so slow. It was difficult to get the service staff's attention. The sushi chefs would rather stand around than to expedite food. The waiter made the excuse that "well it's late night, what do you expect?" Another time I took two other friends giving Miya's a try. After 95 minutes, we only got food once we threatened to leave right then and there. ONLY THEN did we get food, and even then we didn't get our full order. Meanwhile the chef was pointing at our table and laughing! At no point was the wait staff apologetic, or offered to comp anything. In the latter case, they acted SURPRISED that we were tired of waiting. Even worse, the restaurant has no problem seating OTHER tables and serving you last. We saw people without reservations come in, sit down get a full feast of food and leave while we were waiting! Insane! My friends and I were wondering why we always get served last...but it shouldn't have ever come to that. I e-mailed the chef directly who sent such an apologetic email and promised to send gift certificates as an apology/offer to give Miya's a new try. As a man of forgiveness I entertained the idea. But like the service at Miya's, that too was an unreliable promise. I haven't gotten anything in the mail or any responses from the Chef. One thing you gotta say about Miya's is that they are consistently inefficient. They need to be Gordon Ramsay'd ASAP.
