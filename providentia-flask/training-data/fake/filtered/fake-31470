Wandered upon this place with my two daughters (14 and 6), as we were looking for something yummy for lunch while on a break from classes at the Millennium Dance Complex.   So glad we took a chance on this place!  Beautiful atmosphere, simple menu, reasonably priced, great food.   I had lamb meatballs with chimichurri sauce - really, really good.  Older daughter had beef meatballs and marinara, with homemade spaghetti.  Also delicious.  Younger daughter had a side of mashed potatoes, which we agreed were the best we've ever had.  You'd think 4 meatballs is a small portion, but they are pretty big.  Definetly enough, especially if you get a side dish (which is optional).  We also shared a bowl of delicious French vanilla ice cream for dessert.   This is a nice alternative on South Street if you want a quality meal for a good price at a family friendly establishment (other than pizza/cheesesteaks/burgers). Portions are generous, you can definitely share side dishes.  Note:  they are cash only right now, they have an ATM in the restaurant which was helpful.   We will definitely be back when we are in town!
