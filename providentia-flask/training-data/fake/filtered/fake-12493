Neighborhood kinda place - fresh, flavorful, fast, and inexpensive.  You're there for the food, not the atmosphere.  Definite win in my book. Ordered the grilled squid app and it was cooked PERFECTLY, soo tender.  The dressing was a bit acidic, but full of flavor.  Main was the grilled lemon grass shrimp salad or their version of bun tom heo nuong. Pleased it was fresh greens with plenty of shrimp and a bit of noodles.  Solid dish. So, I sat at the bar and observed the cooks.  A takeout dish was being prepared that had cooked bean sprouts and what looked like beef, anyway, the cook placed the meat on the dish and wasn't happy with the look of the sprouts.  Showed it to the other cooks and tossed it. They grabbed a fresh bin of sprouts and remade the dish.  Got the feeling that it had nothing to do with me being there - we'll done guys!
