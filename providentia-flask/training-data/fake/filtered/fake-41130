I was sitting at the stand eating and enjoying my ramen when I overheard a waiter demanding a higher tip because he stated that the minimum tip was double the tax. This poor customer stated that he thought they had bad service and the waiter said "DO NOT COME BACK!". I was in shocked and pissed at the same time at the waiter, who was also my waiter. So I did the same thing the last customer did. Gave a 10% tip. Surely enough, he came to my table and threw my tip at me and said it wasn't enough. So I just took my tip back and gave a penny. I've been talking to several people about this place and they see the same thing and had the same encounter with this one waiter. This waiter (I should have asked for his name) was tall and Asian with long, curly, bleached hair making it brown. This is a good ramen (although not good enough to wait 2 hours) restaurant but this waiter needs to be fired because he is ruining the reputation. Either the owner/manager needs to education to his/her staff members about gratuity or I will not come back.
