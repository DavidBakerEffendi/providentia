This place is areal deal NY Slice.  Ive visited so many places that claim to be the best but Prince St really it.  Get the white Slice with Prosciutto and thank me latter.  The regular slices are everything you could dream for and the Square slices are killer.  They are no L & B but hey they also much more acceptable. The only downside is the pizza can be a bit pricey but it is totally worth it.
