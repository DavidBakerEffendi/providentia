I have been going to Andros for years. This small square does not have enough space to describe what I call the "Andros' experience". I love the ambiance, coziness and friendliness. I also love the family environment, the genuine attentiveness and care from each and every single staff member. Most importantly, I enjoy all of their decadent delicious food. The cheese cake, which no one to this day has cracked on its secret recipe, is to die for. One can tell that each and every dish is prepared with passion, heart and soul. I will definitely continue to get my Andros' fix.
