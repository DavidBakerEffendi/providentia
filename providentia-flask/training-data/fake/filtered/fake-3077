This is my all time favorite place to eat. As soon as you walk in, you are immediately welcome with the sweet aroma of Cuban food. The food is fantastic (especially the plantains). The staff are so charming and polite. The restaurant is designed to mimic the feel of Cuba and they did an outstanding job. Especially when I'm stumbling back to the car after a few sangrias (not driving) and realize that I'm on Bloomfield ave in Montclair :)
