I don't normally venture out of Manhattan, but with 30% BBE code, thought I'd check it out.  Was not disappointed.  Lobster was super fresh, and very affordable - even without the 30% off.  The ambience isn't much, so if you're looking for a dining out experience, this is not it.  I saw some people pickup their food, which might be a good idea if you live relatively close by
