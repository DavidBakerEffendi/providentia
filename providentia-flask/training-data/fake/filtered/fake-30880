For those who are nay sayers, well I am a yay sayer.  And that's not because this is my cousin Jim Barbour's restaurant.  The food is absolutely delicious.  We went opening day night and we all ordered the St. Louis rib platter with homemade mashed potatoes, gravy, and collard greens.  The price is right and it's BYOB should you decide to grab a seat and dine- in. I will be back soon.
