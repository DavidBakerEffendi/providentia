I'm now a flight attendant but mainly live in Newark.. Newark has awesome food but it can get boring cuz it's all Spanish & Portuguese food! This diner has always been my "to go" place for food.. Breakfast, lunch, dinner and even late night! Love me the Spanish skillet omelet with cheese and sweet potato fries! Great food and down to earth folks!
