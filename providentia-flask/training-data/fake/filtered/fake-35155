TREATS PEOPLE LIKE THEY ARE TRASH!!!  OWNERS ARE DISGUSTING!!! I went to Rho because one of my colleagues was retiring.  I did not know anything about the place other then what I saw on-line (their menu).  When I arrived, a nice young man with a blue shirt was standing there collecting parking money for the baseball team (the Thunder, I think).   He asked if I was there for the baseball game or the restaurant.  Of course, I said restaurant.  Then, two men start yelling at me and the kid about where to park.  The kid had just told me to park in a specific lot, and then the two owners/ managers continued to berate the kid.  They were cursing at him, threatened to break the windows of his car, and treated him like he was a piece of garbage.  I could not believe what I was hearing.  The kid stood there and took it!  The only time he spoke to them was to ask...YES, ASK, them to move away from him.  They continued to yell at the kid.  I could not believe it and I felt SO BAD for this guy, who was obviously doing what he was told to do. I will be contacting the Thunder today to make sure that kid is ok, but my first impression of this restaurant was 2 angry men yelling at a kid.  He did nothing wrong and those men should be ashamed of themselves.  Heck, they should be arrested!  I  Will NEVER return. If that's the way these people treat others- not their own staff- I'd hate to see how they treat their own. Disgraceful and disgusting. I will put this on every review blog there is! I hope that kid is ok.
