This place used to be five stars for us, maybe even six LOL!  But lately, the ribs have been overcooked and dry.  The beans are still great (yes, sweet and molasses-y), the cornbread is great, as is the pulled pork.  The brisket at Jersey Shore BBQ in Belmar is much better (they are Texas BBQ granted), I don't recommend the brisket here. I don't know if we are just visiting them at "a bad time" lately or what, but the dryness of the ribs reminds us why we don't go to Famous Dave's that much any more.  Our standards are from NC, SC, and GA (Georgia Pig), and we've never had dry overcooked ribs at  any of the stock list of real BBQ joints in the South. Recommendation is that they manage their ribs better, and don't let them get dry.
