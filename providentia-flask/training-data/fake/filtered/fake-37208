Not only does the waitstaff have a great knowledge of the menu and wine's to go with each meal, but they are very welcoming and kind to each and every table. Every part of the entire dining experience is wonderful and done in a timely manner. Even on a busy Friday night I don't feel as though it takes long to receive any part on my meal. It's always a treat to be at the Hillstone and I enjoy each visit. Drinks are reasonably priced for a NYC restaurant and the Pork Chop recently has been amazing. Always enjoy hearing the Jazz band, sharing a nice Artichoke dip, and polishing it off with a Steak and one of the well prepared sides. The staff is nice, the food is great, and the drinks are plentiful. Definitely bringing a couple of dates to this establishment. :-)
