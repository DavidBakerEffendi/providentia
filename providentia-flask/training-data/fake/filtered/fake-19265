Mother's Day brunch a big success. Four of us and all very satisfied with choice of drinks and dishes selected. Kale salad, oysters and burger were standouts as others have mentioned. Corned beef tongue a pleasant surprise with good balance of bold flavors. Too full for dessert, we tried anyway. Pots de creme surprisingly special for such a traditional dessert, lemon semifreddo tart and delicious. While Service was just a bit too casual with a couple of items forgotten, we sat for more than 2 hours never feeling like we were waiting for anything. We'll be back for dinner!
