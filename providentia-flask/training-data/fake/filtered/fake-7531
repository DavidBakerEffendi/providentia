Cool place with hard working staff, great food and nice atmosphere. The DJ was really diverse and it was cool. The layout is very spacious. There is a huge oval bar in the center so it's easy to get the attention of the bartenders. The food was off the hook. The salt and pepper calamari was mouth watering
