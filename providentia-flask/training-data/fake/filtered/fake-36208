This is a great place! Excellent food and good decor.  We had the ceviche pescador for an appetizer which was delicous. It has raw fish and other steamed seafood in a full of flavor broth. Dip it in to a green sauce that they give you to start out and adds a great spice to the ceviche. I got the chicken saltado for an entree which is stir fry.  This is also full of flavor with peruvian spices, french fries, onions, and a side of rice.  My boyfriend got the steak with two eggs on top and he was definitely satisfied. Their portions are big, but perfect to eat for leftovers the next day.  If you are looking for a good atmosphere, with great food and service I would definitely recommend this place.  Plus its BYOB which is a bonus.
