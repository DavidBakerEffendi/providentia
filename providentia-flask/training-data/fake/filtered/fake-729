My husband and I went to dinner at the Philadelphia Ocean Prime with another couple for the first time. The four of us have been dining out  together for years in Philly, New York, Europe, etc. We usually wouldn't go to a restaurant so new, preferring to wait til they work out the kinks, but we decided to take a chance. We were greeted by a bevy of friendly hostesses and sat promptly. The restaurant is beautiful. Dark wood, colored glass accents, and a glass enclosed kitchen create an elegant atmosphere. Our waiter, Chris was outstanding. Extremely personable and knowledgeable. He recommended and explained their house special cocktails in detail. We all took his advise and had four different drinks. They were all great. My gimlet made with cucumbers was soooo good. Chris went through the menu items, explaining preparations and making recommendations in every section.  We asked some questions about some of the dishes and ingredients and he had the answers to them all. They all sounded so good that none of us could make up our minds. After much hemming and hawing he suggested we let him put together a tasting menu of what he thought the best dishes were, and what wines would pair best with them. We left it all up to him and I'm glad we did. All the appetizers, main course and desserts were really, really good. The wines paired perfectly, and he didn't over order for us. (Which I've had happen with other waiters) A few of the standouts were the tuna tartare,  and a Scallop and braised rib appetizer. The sea bass and a bone in NY strip with black truffles were the main course favorites. The chocolate and peanut butter dessert was divine. We will be back. This is our newest Philly favorite. Make sure you ask for Chris if you want great service.
