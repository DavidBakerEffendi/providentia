This place has a Gyu-Kaku feel to it. Service is warm and attentive. But the wait is a little long, as the place gets packed so early and so quickly, and does not take reservation. A wait for two for 7pm is about 40 minutes, true to what i was told when i sign in, about two martinis time if you hang out at the bar (sipping not chugging, haha). Food was not phenomenal, but definitely tasty enough for something quick and casual. Noodles are a little too greasy for my taste.
