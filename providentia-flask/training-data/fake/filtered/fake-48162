My husband and I ate at the Highlands Restaurt for Valentines and it was a very dissapointing night. The soup was completely tasteless and the mushroom dish I had as my main course was boring. Both our desserts were delightful, but that was the only good thing. The fact that neither me nor my husband drank any alcohol seemd to upset th waiter and the service was bad. We didn't get any extra bread (the table next to us were asked if they wanted more on multiple occations) and we had to wait for a very long time between the main course and the dessert. On top of this, the seating made my back hurt. I really couldn't wait to leave and will never ever go back.
