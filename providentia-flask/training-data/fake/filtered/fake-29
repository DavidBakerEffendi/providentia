Friday night "all you can eat" sushi sounds good right? Not. My wife's dinner never showed up. I was practically done with my sushi before they came out and apologized for the delay. We complained...so they offered a lousy 10% discount -- but only on her meal. Needless to say we got up and left. I had a decent piece of salmon sushi but greasy tempura. Tuna and white tuna was just average. We won't be back.
