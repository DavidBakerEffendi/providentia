I had never tried Georgian food (and had no idea what it was) before going here, and it was definitely some of the best food I have ever eaten. We had the waiter give us recommendations (bc we had no idea what anything was) and everything was so unique, flavorful and delicious. The waitress recommended the Acharuli Khachapuri as an appetizer, which is a really famous dish in Georgia that consists of this huge hunk of fresh chewy dough with melted cheese inside, and warm cheese/a sunny side up egg in the middle. The bread was so fresh and amazing, and the cheese oozed out perfectly--the combination of tastes were delightful! We also got this grilled marinated veggie dish with eggplant, zucchini, peppers, and onions--the spices were all so unique and everything tasted so fresh. She also recommended the Khinkali, which are soup dumplings with beef or lamb. Again, they were cooked perfectly and everything was so flavorful--it all melted in our mouths!! For my entree I got a dish that the waitress recommended--I am forgetting the name but it was pieces of chicken in this really unique sauce with peppers and onions, and some chewy warm bread came with it. Again, the flavors were all very unique and blended together so well, and EVERYTHING WAS COOKED PERFECTLY. The meat was so tender, the bread was hot, chewy, and fresh, and the spices were blended perfectly. The wait staff was also very nice and attentive, and the owner even sent over a complimentary bottle of Georgian wine! It is a GREAT ATMOSPHERE as well--very cute and well decorated on the inside (a lot of Georgian flair!!) and there is a garden/waterfall outside where people can dine! All in all, a great experience. I cant wait to go back and try many other things!!!
