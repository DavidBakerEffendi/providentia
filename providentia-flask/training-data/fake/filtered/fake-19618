Be warned - the girl at the register will try to short change you if you look distracted. She's pulled that trick twice on me before. Don't let their smiles fool you - these people are shady operators and only care about parting you from your money. The sushi was also mediocre, overpriced (especially considering the cashier's "surcharge"), and gave me the runs. Princeton is full of sushi joints; this one's not worth your money.
