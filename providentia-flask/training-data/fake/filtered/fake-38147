I love the sandwiches here. I've had the opportunity to sample the majority of the menu, and I am in love with almost all of them. I'd recommend the Egg and Cheese sandwich and the Gouda with guava jam and pickled jalapenos. The tomato soup is also delectable, and I always get a baby bowl of it when I dine there. However, the service goes down the tubes when it's crowded and the music is almost always insanely loud, making conversation quite difficult. So even though the food is SO very worth it, it loses a star.
