Deceided to check out Roberta's last minute Saturday evening March 8th, 2014.  Walked in was 2 hour wait for table, so we decided to try to slip into the bar for seats.  We ordered drinks and were able to get a seat at bar fairly quickly with help from the bartender/server "Paris" doing an excellent job keeping track of people trying to sit.  Food was great, but the service at the back bar really made the evening. We will be back soon. Jason & Lizzy
