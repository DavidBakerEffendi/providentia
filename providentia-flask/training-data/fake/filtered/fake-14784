I do not know how this restaurant has bad reviews! I have only had GOOD experiences here. I started coming to Centro Grille last May. I know this location has been many different restaurants, but I decided to give this place a try. Each time I visit Centro, I try to order something different. Their menu is pretty extensive-- from fish tacos, to Italian dishes, there are a lot of options to choose from. I first ordered the Crab Salad. I was amazed when they brought it out. The portion was humongous! The dish itself was overall delicious. I have also ordered the Orchete with Broccoli Rabe and Sausage which has become a new favorite of mine. They also have incredible specials. I love when they have Ahi Tuna. I like tuna extremely rare, and they are one of the few restaurants that actually cook it to my liking. Their presentation of food is also very wonderful. The wait staff has always been friendly and efficient. One of the servers (I wish I could remember her name!) always says hello to me when she sees me and I think that's very sweet. I have never waited for more than 10 minutes for a table, even on a Friday night. The ONLY negative thing I would have to say about this place is that I am a little confused about their d√©cor. I absolutely love the high ceilings and beautiful large windows, however the restaurant is very open and a large tree with lights is placed in the middle of the dining room which seems a little odd. I get their modern feel, however there are some loose ends that need to be tied. Overall, I love this place and I always recommend it as a place to go- whether it's a girls night out, or a causal evening with your boyfriend- I know I will enjoy myself here!
