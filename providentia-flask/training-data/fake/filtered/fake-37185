My girlfriend and I were looking for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and we happened to walk right by Hillstone, so we decided to eat there. When we arrived, we stood at the hostess table and waited for her to come greet us. I took a look around and noticed that the place was quite empty (it was about 3pm on a Saturday). When we asked for a table for two, the hostess told us it would be about 15-20 minutes. When I looked at her funny, she explained that they had a short waitstaff because it was an off-peak time in the restaurant. We decided to just sit at the bar and eat, because we could order off the same menu. I got a beer while my girlfriend ordered a Cosmo. We enjoyed our drinks and ordered burgers. I got a California burger while my girlfriend got the veggie burger. I thoroughly enjoyed my burger; it was cooked to perfection and was a healthy size portion. My girlfriend hated her veggie burger; it was made of mostly rice and filling than any type of veggies. Not only was she not satisfied with the quality of the food, she was insulted that it cost $17. We asked for the bill, and wanted to be on our way. 2 beers ($20), 1 Cosmo ($16), and 2 burgers ($34). Add tax and tip and that mediocre lunch cost us almost $90. We live in NYC and are certainly willing to pay for a good meal, but this one just didn't measure up.
