We had dinner here and it was disgusting. The food tastes like it was microwaved, the drinks are seems like juice glasses (small). Service was so-so which means they are s  l  o  w  very slow. They put cone out in the street (not legal) which is against the law where are the police? Maybe they are eating for free or else bough commander might be getting a little something on the side, either way there is a law which says you cannot hold spots on a public street. So why are no summons being issued? I would rather eat across the street at the Elm Park Inn the portions are much bigger and the service is much quicker also the help is more friendly.
