The ambiance and the decor of this lounge is outstanding but that's as far as it goes. On New Years Eve my friends and family had a get together there and the service was horrible except for two young men (the busboys) who was there to assist and accompany all our needs throughout the night. The bartendar a.k.a. manager was all attitude and only came to check on us one time. (We were there from 8pm-1:00 am). Eventhough she nor the waiter helped us the whole night they had no problem with slapping each one of us with a bill with 18% gratuity.This for a service that was horrible. The two stars are definitely for the decor of the lounge.
