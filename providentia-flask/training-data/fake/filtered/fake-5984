We weren't sure what to expect from a restaurant in a store. We had one of the best meals we have eaten (compared on a global basis.) The vegetables were out of this world. Luckily we were there at the crossover between the peas many ways and the squash many ways, so we got to have both. Can hardly wait until next year when the peas come back. The staff was very informative and made sure that we lacked for nothing, including a little time after the meal to chat over coffee. Highly recommend this restaurant.
