Me being a fan of Indian food and being away from home, this is what defines home for me.. To satisfy my craving for Indian I often order a lot of Indian food from many different Indian places we have around but Kati rolls just get it correct..the street food craving of mine is satisfied here..it is not sweet typically as other Indian food are made..it has the right spices and right flavours.. I order them atleast once a week.. I cannot resist myself doing so.. For those who haven't tried food here I would recommend ordering their best aloo masala and paneer tikka rolls. I m an addict of their veg biryani and white sauce!! Me being vegetarian these are what I recommend! My co-worker tried chicken tikka and spice end platter and he,not being accustomed to India taste, was left wanting for more.. Definitely try those!!! Yes, the red sauce might get spicy so beware on that..but when mixed with white sauce in proper proportion , it makes a perfect dip! I am a huge fan of their sauces ,especially the white sauce,and always take a lot of extra sauce with my rolls and biryani which are totally free.. Love their ambience and love their staff! It's a good attempt at Indian fast food and I would continue going there until I move back ;)
