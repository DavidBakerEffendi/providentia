Will never go back!!! Owner is a complete idiot from when he opened his reservation book, on the day I stopped in to make a reservation. He was a show off, condescending, like he was doing me a favor to give me a reservation for a Friday night at the table in the window. When we arrived on time, and waited more than 1/2 an hour for our reserved table in the window, we found that it was occupied with guests just beginning their meal. The owner says, "don't worry they will be done soon. I'll get them out" I was embarrassed since I had 3 others with me and it was my suggestion to eat there. Finally after the awkward and long standing up outside in the street wait we were seated, ordered our meals, and in the midst of eating the owner kept coming over and asking if we were missing something from the table (wine). He was actually billigerent kept coming over half drunk, "you sure you aren't missing something?" Finally we left without Â dessert, just could not take him anylonger, the loud music which he would not lower and his disrespectful behavior towards us, his clients. The dinner was shorter than the wait time. Could not enjoy the food. He does not get it. Terrible experience!!!
