Dining at Continental was an amazing experience. My husband and I were in town to visit our daughter her husband and our grandchild. The service was excellent and the food was something that I will be back for every chance I get. We had drinks, which were fantastic and ordered many different things of the menu. EVERYTHING was perfect. I commend the chef he even made some special vegan dishes for my daughter and they were incredible. I recommend everyone have a night out here.
