If the Essex Street Market were not a destination in and of itself Brooklyn Taco would definitely make it one. This is one of my fave lunch places on the LES.  The tacos are so fresh and lovingly prepared, and reasonably priced, that they become addictive.  Sometimes I just find myself drooling over the idea of  a Guaco Taco.  Super fresh food, very friendly and nice owners.  Must try place. And, some yelpers have pointed out that the space itself is tiny with only 3 stools, please take note that there are booths on the northern end of the Market.  Plenty of room to sit and get your Bklyn Taco on.  Yummmm.....
