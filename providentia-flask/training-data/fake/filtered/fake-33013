Ugh! What went wrong here?? This place used to be good! Our party of 8 was seated at a 'private' table in its own little room. We were asked to remove our shoes. SURPRISE! Food debris on the floor -- lovely on the bare feet and socks! Sticky, dusty table added to the ambiance. The service was excruciatingly slow and it was definitely not crowded. After waiting over an hour our meals came one at a time over a period of about 20 minutes. We wanted to complain but the only staff around were very young (middle school?) girls who were frantically trying to stay on top of things. Never going back here!
