First off, the Social scene there is none!   So if you want to have a drink while waiting for friends - impossible.  It's also in a very dark, very isolated, off the beaten path in China Town, NOT Nolita.  So it's a bit scary going with your girlfriends all dressed up. The name has Social in it, trying to be trendy and upwardly mobile as New York can be.  NOT.  Mostly empty and well, a boring local clientele.  Hey, I'm calling it like it is. Ok, the food.  When you grow up Italian, you know what's good and it's the quality and care of the preparation and good ingredients.  As one of my girlfriends said "the food, it's way to salty and sweet or both." Ugh!  The food is cheap and well it tastes cheap. You know what's right down the street?  Yep, crappy Chinatown markets. I don't mind paying more for quality food and an Awesome Scene and you can go to Bread or Emporio or L'asso just up the street and as anyone knows they are always packed, Always - and they rock. I've been going to Bread for what, 11 years now since they've opened and it's consistently one of the top locations in Nolita (not China-town!).  You know the happening scene at the bar at Bread, lots of good-looking New Yorkers hanging out, this is not even close. Don't waste another second of your precious time and money - head uptown!
