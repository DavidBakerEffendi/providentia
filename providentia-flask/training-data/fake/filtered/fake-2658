Way overpriced and way small portions.  An emblem of where the East Village is going.  Okay, I get the premise of haute cuisine: you pay a lot, get a little and then pretend that it was all worth it because of the scintillating neuro-gustatory experience one presumably has.  I have had those experiences at some very good and very expensive New York bistros.  I also get the influence that "chef star power" vis a vis television exposure has on one's palate, as I write about marketing for a living.  EG, I know that consumer perception shapes consumer experience.  And the food was good.  But I found myself leaving the place angry.  Let me be plain: even the more expensive restaurants I've patronized in traditionally expensive neighborhoods would balk at printing menus that call an appetizer an entre.  essentially, Graffiti serves little appetizer dishes as entrees, or "dishes to be shared".   Even by New York fashion-cuisine standards these were small appetizer dishes for around $15 each.  We spent over $100 on four such dishes and two $5 beers.    We passed a sign on 2nd avenue after we left to go get dinner: "I can't afford to (heart) NY". Amen.
