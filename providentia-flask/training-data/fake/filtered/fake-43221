For this place to be located where it is, is a blessing for Kent Ave. My wife and I have frequented this spot since it opened last year whenever we happen find ourselves in the area, usually dodging all the nonsense farther north on Kent. We recently stopped in on a random weeknight to find there was a little liquor event happening.. which turned out to be a nice surprise! We both had cocktails that used the spirit (I had the Limey, really delicious, perfect for sipping) and had some snacks at the bar. We even met the rep who was super nice and got us talking with other folks sitting near us. I'd forgotten how great this place is! Woulda ordered the burger if we didn't already have dinner plans lined up. Next time, we'll make sure we don't have other dinner plans so I can get that burger again.. Good stuff!
