delicious food and great service! pizza is amazing, great beer selection, and awesome and friendly staff especially chris she rocked! liked it so much i returned two days later with my roomies. also LOVE the fact that they dont allow strollers in their establishment (the one place in park slope to escape the bitchy stroller mafia)
