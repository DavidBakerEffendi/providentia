I kind of don't get it when people complain about food being messy. Have you ever had really great barbecue? Haven't you noticed that (a rather large) part of what makes the experience of having really great barbecue so uniquely thrilling and pleasurable IS the mess? Throw care to the wind people, it's food the way it's meant to be. This is one fine sandwich. The chili mayo and the meat juices and the sriracha blend together and everything squirts out the back a little, and then you get to pick up the pieces of meat that fell out with your hands and shove them in your mouth like a heathen. I found that the toasty French bun held together just great and was crispy to the last bite..but maybe that's just me. Cilantro-haters beware, the stuff is stacked on there like lettuce. Definitely recommend the skirt steak, pulled pork, and peppercorn encrusted catfish, holy crap yum.
