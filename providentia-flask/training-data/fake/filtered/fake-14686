Such a welcome addition to the Bowery. Lively, good looking bar crowd, fantastic mixologist-made libations. And for dinner, if you are looking for the most romantic table ever, ask to be sat near the marble fireplace in the back room....flickering candlelight setting to enjoy your seafood tower or pork chop with quince. Great place for a romantic night out!
