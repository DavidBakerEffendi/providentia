If you're looking for delicious basic Mexican fare, look no further! Being from California I am a big big fan of great, hole in the wall taquerias with yummy, greasy, traditional Mexican dishes. While El Rey is not quite the same, it is damn close. Everything is basic but with more upscale ingredients. As in skirt steak tacos, instead of the usual carne asada - which can be lesser quality meat. The food is awesome. Very shareable. Between 3 people we split the guacamole, queso fundido, skirt steak tacos, chicken enchiladas, and grilled shrimp. They were all delicious. The guacamole was very fresh and flavorful. The meat in the tacos was tender and the seasoning was perfect. The shrimp were amazing and cooked to perfection. In addition, the margaritas tasted great and went done smooth. And I really appreciated that they only served tequila and beer - very authentic. Lastly, the vibe there is fun and unique. Very retro. You actually feel like you've gone south of the border. When I asked the waiter about the name El Rey and if it was based on the movie "Grindhouse", I was even happier to find out that it was inspired by the movie "From Dusk till Dawn" where their destination is El Rey. Being a huge Tarantino fan, I very much appreciated the decor and the old movie posters. I think Quentin himself would approve. From the music to the plaid shirts the waiters wear, it all sets the tone. The only thing missing was the song "Down in Mexico" by the Coasters. All in all awesome. It's safe to say I will be back, often.
