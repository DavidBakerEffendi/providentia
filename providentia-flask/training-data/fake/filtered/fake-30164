Amazing food. Such a tiny place with a lot of charm. I went there on a Friday afternoon with my boyfriend around 5ish and it was empty. We both ordered the roasted chicken club sandwich and it was delicious. We also got the cheesy bread balls as an appetizer and the guinness chocolate cake. Both were very good. I like that it's not too expensive at all either.
