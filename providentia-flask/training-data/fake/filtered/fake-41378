Would've given 3.5 stars but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   4.5 stars for the tap list. 4 stars for the food.  We tried City Tap House for Dining Days and the options for a vegetarian provided the bizarre path of having a margherita pizza as an appetizer followed by a second course of bruschetta (the veg entree was the seitan).  A great amount of food but not the most well considered menu for vegetarians (though I am not!).  The pizza was better than expected and the bruschetta was alright - the bread was a little too thick and dry.  We also tried the sweet potato fries with the 2 different sauces.  I thought the fries were great on their own and the sauces interesting, but less so.  I also had the herb chicken with fingerling potatoes. I was expecting both the chicken and potatoes to have more of a crispy skin and instead both were kinda soggy. Service was really slow though and the only reason I was grateful was that it allowed me a little more time to digest the Dining Day bounty.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu but would make sweeps across the tables in our section and then not appear again for another half hour.  Our dinner took 3 hours and it being a school night, we weren't entirely pleased. All in all though, I'm glad we tried the joint and will be back.  Would love to see a few more interesting vegetarian options and more consistent service.
