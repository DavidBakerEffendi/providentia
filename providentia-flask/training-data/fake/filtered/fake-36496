I've been to Casa Mono numerous times and it easily stands out as the best Spanish/tapas place in the city and might be my favorite restaurant overall (depending on what I'm craving at the time). I try to order different dishes every time I visit, but the pork belly and the goat cheese croquettas are essentials at each meal. You really can't go wrong with any of the choices here. For the few of you out there who enjoy Sherry as much as I do, Casa Mono has a good selection these, including dry Manzanillas, sweet dessert PX's, and everything in between. If you're not familiar with Sherry, try a glass - nothing goes better with Spanish tapas. The only complaint I have about Casa Mono is the very small size, which can make it difficult to get a reservation and almost impossible to accommodate large groups - although this probably improves the ambiance. If you're a small party of 2-3 without a reservation on a weeknight, you can probably get a table if you're willing to wait an hour or so. While this may seem like a while, you can hang out at Bar Jamon next door and nosh on some more traditional tapas until your table is ready.
