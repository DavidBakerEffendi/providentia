I went today for the first time and I ended up with a waitress who obviously had an attitude problem  and a hearing problem. She messed up on two of our meals and then had an attitude when asked about it by another waiter. It was a turn off. The reason why my family and I stayed is because of the French waiter who was very  professional and welcoming. As a French woman, I must say that the food was fine after it was corrected. I am not sure what was her problem...perhaps she did not like my unique family...not to sure. I was not going to argue with her because I had my kids and I was not going to waste my energy on rudeness. It was my first and last time in that cafe. Thanks to that waitress. Merci au serveur Francais:)
