Eating here was an a-ma-zing experience.  Had the 10 course tasting menu.  Hostess/waitress talked us out of the wine pairing since it might be overwhelming (not to mention, expensive, too).  She suggested a mini pairing of 4 different wines for the two of us, which only came out to $45 total.  So yeah, it was a great deal for this kind of food, preparation, decor, and service.  All in all, TOPS. And the food (not necessarily in the right order): Amuse of 1 each (ham and apple croqueta, cod skin tempura thing, potato tortilla wrapper thing filled with quail yolk) - this isn't counted towards the 10 courses!! *Razor clam foam thing *Monkfish liver in bonito broth with black radishes and blood orange Grilled cuttle fish with radishes Grilled sardine with Spanish blue cheese and grilled artichoke Duck confit on top of a crispy cracker thing *Goat meatball with squid fritters Duck egg mousse with lamb bacon Roast wagyu cheese steak Pre dessert - bourbon panna cotta with lemon foam *Torija - Soaked brioche that gets caramelized *These items were my faves! Wonderful eating experience.  Fun to see the chefs cooking in front of us.
