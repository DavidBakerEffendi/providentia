Great place, great service, awesome breakfast. Went on a Sunday morning around 11:45. I had the Farmer's special and was very satisfied. 3 egg omelet stuffed with cornbeef hash & onions and "real" homefries (fresh potatoes). Ashley was in East Hartford for over 30? years on Connecticut Blvd but a Walgreens took over the corner so now she's a star on Main Street Hartford (almost a year now) - right next to the Hook n' Ladder Restaurant and the fire house. I also liked the toast - big slices of rye cut from a bakery like loaf. Looking forward to going again.
