I recently ordered the spicy house special lo mein. It had the perfect amount of spice that cannot be found at other local resturants. The chicken was very tender, the shrimp was not too rubbery or scant. I also ordered the spring rolls which come with homeade ducksauce and not the fake watered down duck sauce that nearly everyone has become accustomed to. So in my opinion if you are looking for some great chinese food, szechuan chili is the place to go.
