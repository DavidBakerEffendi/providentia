So good it deserves way more stars, but there you have it.  Five of five. Sausages, beers, wine, great burgers.  Food is stellar.  Casual and fun.  Great back garden and excellent atmosphere.  You can't go wrong.  Ballgames at the bar.  Nice bartenders and staff.  Relaxing and inviting.   I really enjoyed Lock Yard.  Something special.
