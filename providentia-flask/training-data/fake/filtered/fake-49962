Just got back from eating 4 " rippers", fries and a root beer and we loved it. true, the place is not new, but it's clean and the service is friendly and FAST...My wife had 2 "rippers", fries and a root beer...the bill (with tax) was $17.60 for everything. We did choose to sit and be served. The parking lot is large and I found the restuarant easy to locate....Needless to say, next time we're in NJ we will go back for some "Rippers"
