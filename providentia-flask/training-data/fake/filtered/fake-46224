amazing slice of pizza, but only the tomato basil, which is far more interesting than it sounds.  the bottom is crispy, the top soft and chewy, and the flavor of the tomato and basil is utterly delicious.  my friend and also tried slices of their meat topped pizzas, including pepperoni and mushroom, which had tough crusts and simply tasted salty, hence the four, not five stars.  haven't tried the lasagna pizza but it does look good.  the place is literally a hole in the wall, so plan to take out or eat standing up.
