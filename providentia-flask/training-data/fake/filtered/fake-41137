Food is ordinary.  Broth is okay, but nothing special.  Noodles are store bought, definitely not fresh and it shows.  Restaurant is tiny and people tended to linger (wait staff wasn't assertive in turning tables) so expect to wait and wait (and wait).  This is strictly a neighborhood joint - not worth leaving your neighborhood for, unlike Ippudo, etc.  A disappointment not worthy of the Totto name.
