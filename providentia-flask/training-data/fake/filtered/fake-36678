I travel back and forth a lot from NYC to PHL for work and I was recommended PYT so I brought a co-worker out for dinner/drinks after work.  The Piazza is very modern and impressive, and the atmosphere Hipster/Brooklyn.  I looked at the website and thought it could be a fun evening.   When we got there we were seated quickly and the menu seemed very creative.  We ordered some drinks and appetizers.  Unfortunately the appetizers were better than the meal itself.  I ordered a burger and it was quite far from medium, it was very dry. My co-worker got a chicken sandwich which she said was very bland.  She had asked for avocado but it never made it on the sandwich (it was on our bill though). Our table had no napkins, silverware, and our server completely forgot our second round of drinks.  The service was spotty and slightly frustrating.
