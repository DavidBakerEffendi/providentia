I  have now been to Tink's twice and cannot rave enough about how good the food is!! i have eaten here for both brunch and dinner with my friends and I definitely plan to bring my boyfriend next time. Not only is the decor and atmosphere  relaxing and romantic with soft lighting, but the wait staff is always friendly, helpful and attentive. I have thus far tried the pretzel breaded chicken, Angus burgers, the grown up grilled cheese, the Marsala wings, the quacky tots, and lamb meatballs.. it honestly has something for everyone! There is also a great assortment of beers and drinks. My favorite was the cucumber ginger drink, it was a-m-a-z-i-n-g! The overall price is very fair for new york city and worth it due to the quality of the food and atmosphere! if you have not gone here yet, do yourself a favor and eat here, i highly recommend it!
