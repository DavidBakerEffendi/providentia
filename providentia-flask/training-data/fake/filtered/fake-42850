I used to go there on a regular basis, its very convenient to my office so I went when Â I needed a quick business lunch this place was great. the food was okay. Last time there the owners son said they didn't take american express credit cards so I now go to a local diner. I am not about to open another credit card because this business owner or his son is not intelligent enough to negotiate a better rate with american express. This occured over a year ago, I estimate they missed out on 12 visits by me with an average of 3 people per party but sometimes as many as 5 but never less that 2. The Park West diner suits us fine now.
