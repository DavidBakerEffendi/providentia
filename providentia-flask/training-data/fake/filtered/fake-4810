Being a fan of big franchise chains i thought about trying something which is new in the town so went to this pizza place recently and was surprised with their pizza's and customer service ... U'll find loads of rich flavours from a selection of many unique toppings like lamb , chicken ruby or just simple garlic ... And the service is really quick , great and friendly ... The environment is awesome ... Another great thing is that they deliver at ur doorsteps so what else do we want ... Damn that thin crust pizza makes me want to go there everyday ... And thats not all folks i haven't mentioned about their wings yet ... Wings made from 3 different sauces and i tried all of em .... Cant really describe those cuz im speechless about how great they tasted ... Just go , take ur family and friends with u and enjoy the great and unique taste which certainly beats everyone else in the town :)
