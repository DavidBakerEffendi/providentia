Have lived here in NYC for about a year and have been on the hunt for the best restaurants in NYC.... from street food to fine cuisine.....degustacion is on the top of my list.... from ambience (intimate ny dining experience where you sit in front of the chefs as they prepare your meal right in front of you, to service, to the food (fits into that molecular gastronomy movement...that mixes food in unique ways that confuse and delight...). Â Highly recommend the 5 course tasting menu...
