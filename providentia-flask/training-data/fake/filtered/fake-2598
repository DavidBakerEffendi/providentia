Uva is a charming Italian wine bar on the Upper East Side. Make sure to request a seat in the covered garden in the back when you make your reservation, they also have a patio up front. Uva is perfect for a date night or to catch up with a few friends for hours over wine and cheese- they have a huge selection of both. There are many great antipasto and vegetable dishes to share for a starter. We love the polenta stuffed with cheese. For entrees, they have many tantalizing pasta, pizza, and fish dishes, but I must say their eggplant melanzane is one of the best I have ever had. They also offer a great wine cellar area for private parties.
