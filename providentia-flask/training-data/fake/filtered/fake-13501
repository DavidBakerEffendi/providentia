Terrible, never coming back again.  I ordered the fish tacos, and my husband the Combo #2.  We both got refried beans and cornbread on the side.  The beans tasted like they sat out all day and the cornbread probably got shipped to the restaurant months ago and left out in a box.  Nothing was close to fresh or homemade, no spices even!  Could have just gotten fast food if I wanted to eat shit. The service as pretty poor also, most of the staff did not know anything about the menu.  I noticed a host picking food off the silverware as she rolled it... gross! Never coming back!
