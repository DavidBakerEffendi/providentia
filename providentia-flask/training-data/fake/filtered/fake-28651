Please do something about the neon green paint...this restaurant needs work, to say the least. I love to try turkish food as I have been to the country, and i would recommend this food, but only "to go". I simply could not enjoy my meal with the level of the bright gaudy lighting, and the blaring Shakira music coming from the one corner in the nearly empty restaurant.. the service is below professional too. I would imagine this to be a Turkish-trying-to-be-American mom-and pop style place of some sort and unfortunately, I don't mean that in a good way.
