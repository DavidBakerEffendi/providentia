After 25++ visits over the p[ast 3-4 years I have never writen to say how "specia" this resataurant is. The chicken with pharma, mozzerella and brocolli rabe is terific and one entre means lunch or even dinner the next day. The owner/Chef, Renato, is charming and is part of the prersonlity of the maybe 60 seat restaurant.His daughter though can be moody and unpleasant to co.workers and it somertimes spills over to customers. Try to have Peter or Jason as yuour waiter if possible. Tables are too close together unless the people next to you are interesting. Reservations 3-4 days in advance needed for weekends..
