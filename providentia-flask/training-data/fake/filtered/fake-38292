Best thing was the fries. We ordered a crab poboy it was dry.  Not enough sauce.  It was very overpriced.  We also had the gumbo it had a few scraps of food in broth.  It was the worst i have ever had.  We also tried to use a entertainment coupon for lunch and was not able to because it was brunch.  I have never had brunch at 2 pm on a Saturday. I would not recommend this place and i will never go back
