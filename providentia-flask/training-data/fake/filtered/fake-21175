If you could vote no stars I would, The food was not fresh tasting, seems as it was a few days old.  I should have sent it back, for me to write a review it has to be pretty bad, it seems that the kitchen does not care nor does the owner or manager of this place!  I will spend my money elsewhere where they care about the food.  I will not return and not recommend this place to anyone in fact i will tell people to say away if they mention it.  BTW I eat in the city 5 days a week.  this place is embarrassing.  WILL NOT RETURN.
