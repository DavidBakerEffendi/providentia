This place is no joke.  Worth every penny.  Shrimp and grits, gravy smothered chicken, biscuits, AND matzoball soup?! all of which I have tried, and each have blown my tastebuds to southern heaven.  I recently tried the turkey leg dinner.  Delicious.  The cocktails are dangerous too.  I've had most of them, my favorites are definitely the apple pie moonshine which tastes like apple pie and the jam jar.  Downside is they are almost always packed with a 30 minute wait.  A must try, if you're willing to get addicted.
