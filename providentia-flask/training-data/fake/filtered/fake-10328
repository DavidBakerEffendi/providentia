Went to South Philly to meet a WWII vet and decided to have an authentic Philly Cheesesteak while there.  This place made one of the best I've had yet.  The place has apparently been there forever and it doesn't have much in the way of amenities but you go there for the sandwich and you get the best. If you're in the area and don't stop and get a Philip's Cheesesteak you're missing out.
