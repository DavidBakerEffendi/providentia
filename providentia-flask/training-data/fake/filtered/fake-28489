I've been a frequent guest of Acacia's since the mid 1990's.  It is by far my most favorite places to dine.  Outstanding food, beautiful atmosphere and wonderful service.  Did I mention BYOB?  After dinner take a short drive to Princeton for a nice walk to finish off the evening.  GO!  You will not be disappointed!
