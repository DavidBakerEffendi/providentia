This is my second time here, and I must be honest; I came back just because the food is magnificent! However I was skeptical because my first experience was not so good due to the service. That was a few months ago, and I returned prepared... But Surprise! It seems like they've heard us and made massive changes about this subject. My wife and I ate so pleased; the food (as always) was wonderful, we drank a Margarita and a Mojito. Our server was very nice with us; she even recommended the best dishes and her manners almost made us feel like royalty. Now I have no more complains about this place and definitely recommend everyone to stop by and have a taste of a great Spanish food.
