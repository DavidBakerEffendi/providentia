My husband and I were looking for a new place to try so we discovered Luke's Lobster, thanks to a Yelp search in our area. Reading the reviews here first helped our decision making in advance and knew to order extra food because we were starving. We ordered the Noah's Ark combo, along with 2 small cups of soup (the New England clam chowder and the spicy crab bisque). Everything was fresh and flavorful. The rolls themselves are small but the amount of seafood is pretty filling. My husband found a stray piece lobster cartilage but fortunately, it was large enough to easily pick out. I would recommend going with the crab bisque if you're pairing it with something more substantial since the chowder is Â hearty. Would definitely go back and have, in fact, recommended it to a friend.
