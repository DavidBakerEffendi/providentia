I may need a drug-eluting coronary stent soon...after eating one of Pat's flavorless cheesesteaks....I went there as a "tourist" to try an "original" Philadelphia cheesesteak... not impressed ...the meat tasted JUST LIKE a White Castle BEEF burger.... (so yeah, if you like White Castle then you will like Pat's! )  ... heartburn for daaaaays. I chose the cheesesteak "wit" provolone, mushrooms, and onions.. ugh. The bread was a toughy italian bread~if you wear dentures do not try taking a bite!!~  The joint across the street was much better... you will know what I mean if you have been there. ;)
