DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT!!! I feel terrible for giving this place a bad review because the people were so friendly. But, I didn't go to this restaurant with my wife tonight to be smiled at. The 50% off happy hour cocktails were $7 and were the most disgusting I have ever tasted. I had the minty one that tasted like Cool Burst Tylenol Cough Syrup, and my wife chose one that was supposed to be the Ukrainian equivalent of a Bloody Mary. Awful. The bread that was brought before the main course Â was mediocre at best. Even more disappointing were the "entrees." Tiny portions and the food was definitely not fresh. The lettuce in our salads was spoiled. The Salmon on both of our dishes was edible, but not appetizing. Such a huge letdown! Overpriced food that's disgusting? NO THANKS!
