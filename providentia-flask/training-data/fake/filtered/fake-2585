The seating is a bit uncomfortable but you can live with that. Â We tasked to get a better table but there wasn't any available. At least they tell you NO in a very nice way which I did appreciate it. OK it's a French place and God I love the french. We started with that red mustard green salad with feta cheese and octopus. I loved the salad but the octopus wasn't what i expected. After that we had the venison meatballs and the Alsatian chicken! I was blown away. I enjoyed my overall experience! I will return!
