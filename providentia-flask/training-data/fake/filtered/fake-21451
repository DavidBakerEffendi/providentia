I went for brunch and ordered the Falafel in Pita Bread. The bread had just been made in the oven as well as the falafel in the fryer. It was very good but I wish they put more hummus in it. Prices are pretty good if you don't go crazy with extra toppings. We paid $14 for two simple falafel pitas and one large bottle of water. I would recommended if you're into vegetarian meals.
