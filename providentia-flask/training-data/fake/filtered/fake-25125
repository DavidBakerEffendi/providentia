We waited forty minutes for a meal that ultimately had me up, sick all night. In Philadelphia it's unacceptable to exercise such lack of service, such disregard for a reservation, such pompous behavior. There are plenty of fantastic Philadelphia restaurants, and it's a shame that Mr. Vetri has left such a poor impression upon what were excited, hip, eager diners. We couldn't wait for this night after praising Vetri for ages! We're embarrassed for you, Mr. Vetri. How disappointing! Out-of-towners: we promise the Philadelphia restaurant scene is more hospitable (and palpable) than this. Don't fear, Amis' front-of-house bravado is unsustainable here in Philadelphia, especially on such a wonderful restaurant block! The food is good, but unremarkable, and we'll continue to take our business elsewhere, Amis. Thanks for an overpriced, negative evening that kept me up hours into the night. What a shame.
