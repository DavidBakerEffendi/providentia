Although the food was quite good (though far too salty), I simply cannot recommend this place. From the outside, it looks like an abandoned store. No signage, dilapidated facade, utterly lacking in any kind of pride on the part of the owners. Inside the theme continues with dishes and coffee cups that are not merely chipped but with handles broken off leaving jagged stumps. Hey, maybe it's some kind of minimalist motif that I'm too un-hip to relate to. Whatever. I don't want to eat in a place that feels so unprofessional. Details matter, even in places where they're going for a relaxed hippie vibe. No matter how good the food is, it's only part of the story.
