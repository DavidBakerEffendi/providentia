I have only been here a few times, but everything I have tried has been excellent! It is probably my new favorite restaurant. The service has been good, the atmosphere is fun, and it is a great place to go with a group. On a Friday or Saturday night though, expect to wait awhile before you are seated. We waited about an hour this past Saturday, but we passed the time with some of their excellent Sangria and Margaritas over at the bar. It is well worth the wait.
