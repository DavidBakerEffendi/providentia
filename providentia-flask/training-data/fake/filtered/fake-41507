I decided to check out Fuji Mountain for the first time last night based on it's reviews and I wasn't disappointed The sushi combo I got consisted of very high quality fresh fish. The rolls were cut into smaller than usual bite size, which I like since it lets your palate experience the intricacies of allowing the flavors from all ingredients from the entire piece of sushi come together. Their spicy mayo did not overpower the fish and the white tuna roll was great. Next time I will get a larger platter of sushi.
