My husband and I just got married on December 26th and decided to hold our reception (17 people) at Laboratorio Kitchen with close friends and family.   We had a wonderful wedding day and Laboratorio made it exceptional. First of all, the restaurant took our large reservation without hesitation and accommodated us on the spot when we had two additional people show up.  Our head waiter was fantastic! Dealing with such a large group can be challenging to say the least and he was the picture of professionalism.  The wait staff made sure that our glasses were always full, their service was prompt and overall wonderful. The ambiance and décor is classy and chic. Now, let me get to the most important part - the food - absolutely amazing!! The chef prepares all meals with organic, local produce and you can taste the difference.  The PEI mussels were gorgeous, filet mignon cooked to perfection, and the lamb chops(!) everyone agreed that they were the best they've ever had.  The chef even came out to greet us during dinner and came to see us off as we left. Every single person came away from this experience fully and completely satisfied.  A HUGE thank you to Laboratorio Kitchen for making our special day perfect.
