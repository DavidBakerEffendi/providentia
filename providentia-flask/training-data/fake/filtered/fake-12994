Went there for the first time with my friend and his wife.  My friend doesn't care for cream sauces so asked if it was possible to have the raviolis with a different sauce.  Wouldn't seem like it would be a big deal because the two are cooked separately.  The waiter said no, which is fine, but when my friend asked the owner/manager her response with attitude was "if you want to mix and match sauces and pasta feel free to do that on your own at home."  Switching a sauce should be an easy thing and was quite surprised with the response so we left without ever eating.
