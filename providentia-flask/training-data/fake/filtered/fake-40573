Are u kidding???? Hugely overrated. Everyone speaks Spanish, they don't take credit cards (2014????). Pizza is ok, I mean it is pizza, how  wrong can u go?  I didn't think the ingredients were fresh and if u live midtown, it will cost u $15 each way by taxi. I am sorry but I don't really see what the big deal is all about.
