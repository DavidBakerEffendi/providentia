Went to Marigold for the first time last night with 4 close friends/colleagues.  The atmosphere was homey with yellow walls.  It was quite quiet and easy to carry on a conversation.  The food was lovely, with enough choices, especially appetizers, for our vegetarian friend.  Portions are small which has been said before - lots of room for amazing deserts and chese plate!  Five of us spent about $240 with tip.
