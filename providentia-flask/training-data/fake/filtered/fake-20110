Called for take out and was told it would be ready in 20-25 min. Waited 20 min, had at least a 5 min drive, then had to wait 30min there before getting our food! We were never told why it was delayed, or had anyone suggest we maybe grab a drink in the bar. We watched the wait staff gather our take out on the FLOOR in the kitchen! We asked to talk to the mgr. before leaving but he would not come out of the kitchen. And the food was not good. Tacos had obviously been sitting and were mush, chicken mole was WAY overcooked and tasteless, beans were tasteless, rice was ok. Go to Taco Bell, you will be happier!
