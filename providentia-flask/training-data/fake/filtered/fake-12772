Get yourself to this gem of a bar while it's still a relative secret!  The focus is on American whiskey but the overarching theme is all things comforting (without resorting to tired cliches... case in point: we've all seen our share of tin plated ceilings but have you seen a tin plated table top?)  With  7 years of food service experience under my belt, take my word for it: the booze selection, food, and service are all stellar.  Try the pickle bowl, replete with wonderful transformations to blackberries and peaches.   And if you're feeling under the weather, a  dram of smokey bourbon and a pipping bowl of beef enriched borscht will sustain you until the Spring arrives.
