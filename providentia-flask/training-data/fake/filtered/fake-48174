One of downtown's best kept secrets.  While first and foremost a no frills cocktail bar (met one of the more creative bartenders I've come across), the food was surprisingly delicious as well.  Start with the chickpeas at a minimum for a lite snack.  I also had a declicious dip sandwich the last time I was there. For brunch fans, their homemade Bloody Marys are worth the trip alone.
