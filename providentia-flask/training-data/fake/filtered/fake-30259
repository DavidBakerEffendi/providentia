BOOOOOOO!...I ordered a Reuben Panini with fries @ 12:15a on Friday the 13th, 2010, took it home and commenced to enjoy my Reuben (I was hungry!)...The meat was so chewy, I choked twice (I have a witness)....the Swiss cheese was missing (no Swiss, not a Reuben)...no cole slaw.... the Russian dressing was runny...and, the sauerkraut was low grade from the jar...I went back the next morning (with half of the Reuben in the original container - the half I ate was not presentable to return after the choking episodes) around 9:30 am to ask for another sandwich (I felt entitled), but I was told I had to see the manager, who was ringing on the register (I was clueless at this point)...I went to have a seat in Â the back of the diner to speak with the waitress about my complaint....she then went into the back and another waitress came out and told me I had to see the manager....As I waited for 15 minutes to see the manager, I watched Rizzoli and Isles on TV and ordered a seltzer water (drank the entire thing)...the waitress then asked me if I was waiting to see the manager...I said "Yes"...I was then instructed to go see him at the register...Remind you I have watched TV and drank a seltzer water....He was at the register the entire time...I walked up to voice my complaint....He told me he would give me a 10% discount (for what you ask?)...I wanted a properly made replacement Reuben Panini, not a discount....I asked him if he was serious....his point...I should have brought it back last night....I reminded him that it was after 1 am when the missing Reuben parts and the choking happened...He then told me he would give me $3.50 off...I said no, left the bag (diner bag) with the half of sandwich (name unknown with missing parts) and walked out...I am an African-American female, I wanted to go ballistic, yet, I left quietly (customers didn't deserve the piss-offness I was holding at that point)... I decided to write reviews on all review sites instead to inform you of this diners bad food, bad customer service from management, and missing sandwich parts (check your food)...Eat here with caution, especially after 12 am....Bon Appetite!
