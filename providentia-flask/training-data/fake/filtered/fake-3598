I'm kind of in love with this place. The space is sparse and elegant, very open and the food and drinks were perfect.  Yes, they are pricey, but I think it's worth it. The Hake was perfectly cooked and crusted, it was so buttery and flaky.  The only issue I had was in comparison to what my friend got, the fried chicken and waffles, my entree looked like an appetizer.  I had some serious food envy! Quick tip: go for an early dinner, place gets packed pretty quickly.
