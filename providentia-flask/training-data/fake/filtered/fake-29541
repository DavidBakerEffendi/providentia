am a fan of chicken.  I love all kinds and preparations but my favorite is fried chicken.  Southern Fried Chicken! I like white meat and it has to be prepared just right.  I don't want it too dry or too moist.  It has to be firm and flavorful.   Amy Ruth has something here.  The something she has is the best damn southern fried chicken I have ever experienced.  The batter is not too heavy, very flavorful with a good combination of spices,  The chicken is prepared just right, not dry, not too moist, not gamy just the best southern friend chicken EVER!
