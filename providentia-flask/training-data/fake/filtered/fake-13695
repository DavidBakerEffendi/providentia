Cuba is a great place for a night out with friends. Very cool atmosphere with excellent food. Request a table upstairs if possible, unless you like feeling like you're in the depths of someone's cellar (downstairs). I highly recommend the chorizo, and the vaca frita was excellent! The white sangria and the mojitos are quite nice too. Angel was wonderful - a very hospitable host. I will definitely go back!
