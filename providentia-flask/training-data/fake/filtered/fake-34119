Here's my update... Awesome.  Phenomenal.  Outstanding.  We had eaten here many times in 2012 and had great experiences.  I think that the holidays may have stressed out the staff (maybe me too).  We went back recently and the food and service were excellent.  The filet mignon was outstanding. perfectly cooked, the spinach and potato were fresh and delicious.  The paella was perfect, couldn't be better.  The staff was competent, discreet and very pleasant.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.
