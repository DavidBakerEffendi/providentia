If you are craving some fresh & creative food you have to try this place!!!! The food is absolutely delicious ( if your pallet is not ruined by greasy fried food & frozen meals from Applebee's)  The staff are very friendly. The space is fantastic!!!  I felt like a kid again running up the stairs to play my favorite pinball game and they don't just have a few they had over 12 and that's not including other old school arcade games. Great place to bring the kids , but I loved the late night crowd too!!! There was some hipsters in there but so what..... Pinball!!!!!!
