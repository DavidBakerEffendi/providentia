The service was great.  The food came quickly.  It looks appetizing and appealing, like it would look if I saw it on a commercial.  There were so many choices, I could come here 100 times and never eat the same burger twice.  It doesn't matter if you're a vegetarian or if you're on a diet or if you're a total meathead and wanna eat a 1lb burger, there's something for everyone.   My friends and I came here on Monday night. We were seated immediately.  Our drinks were brought out quickly.  Our server was insanely knowledgable about the menu. My friend asked a lot of questions.  The food came out promptly and you could tell the ingredients were fresh.  Our waitress refilled our drinks without asking.  She made recommendations and even got us samples of certain items to try.   I can't wait to grab a few more friends and bring them to The Counter so they can enjoy the experiences of creating their own custom built burger.  Mostly, I can't wait to build my own burger again!
