The food was horrible and the service was even worse.  I came with my company for lunch that was reserved for 12:45.  After being sat 20 min. late, we still did not receive our food until 2:40.  The waitress barely tried to remedy the situation -- not asking to refill drinks or replenish bread (which should have been on the house).  She even tried her very best to avoid eye contact and walked past us while her eyes skimmed the tops of our heads.   I wish I could give her name, but she failed to deliver that.  For a historical establishment, this place really was not a great choice.  Caution: do not eat here during lunch if you have to get back to work!
