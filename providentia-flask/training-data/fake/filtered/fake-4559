Did we have the same server Kai? Ours seemed high out of his mind.  I was a little jealous, seeing as the wine selection they had just wasn't doing it for me. I had come here a few times over the past year, it used to be much better.  They don't do pasta, they don't do much besides pizza.  Want good wine? Go to Vintage or Barbuzzo.  Want overpriced pizza and a rude staff? Go to Zavino.
