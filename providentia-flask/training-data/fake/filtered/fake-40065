I was looking forward to trying this place as I've heard nothing but raves for years. The place is basically a dump filled with the acrid smoke of burning olive oil from the oven. The wait was ridiculous-- nearly 2 hours and the pie was burned. Not well done, but BURNED black with a thick layer of charcoal on the entire bottom and crust. If I wasn't so famished from waiting, I'd have sent it back. That being said, the cheese and sauce topped with freshly cut basil was delicious, but the crust was inedible.
