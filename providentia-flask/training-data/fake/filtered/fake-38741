boo. sad to read so many bad experiences. fork has been one of my favorite old standbys for a long time. I have had many amazing meals there, and some standardly good. Service can be up and down.... BUT.... if you are ever interested in using their private room for an event I PROMISE you will not be disappointed. We threw our wedding rehearsal dinner there for 35 people on 2/8/08. The room was stunning, set with candles and perfect lighting, as well as gorgeous customized menus with our names on them. Great, i know it doesn't take a rocket scientist to run some menus through the printer with the bride and grooms name on it. The attention to detail did not end there, luckily. We were able to pick a three course menu (5 choices per course) that reflected our food likings and no one was disappointed. We have some major foodies in the family, along with some truly picky eaters and everyone was pleased. Highlights were  two first course items: 1) duck confit  with frisee salad and 2) roasted beet salad with tangerines, avacado and a passion fruit vinagrette and 3 amazing second course choices: 1) a vegetarian clay pot with sobas tofu and veggies 2) the hanger steak with yucca frites and chard, and lastly the salmon with fork kim chee and sushi rice. Ellen, the owner accomodated both servere milk allergies and my best friend's gluten free diet, all the way down to customizing a dessert for us. She also allowed us to pre select wines for pouring during dinner and did not try to upsell us on anything. She and the servers made us feel like family and seemed genuinely excited about our celebration. All that would be great, but wouldn't really matter if the food weren't spectacular. it was. Our guests are still raving about it. I will continue to celebrate milestones and regular sunday afternoons at fork.
