I can't believe the reviews here on Yelp! Maybe they have changed. I don't know. Being here once & discovered that food is distasteful but can easily be used as a "weight loss program."  One bite of their medu vada and your hunger will vanish! We were here last year during Oct/Nov. We were here for dinner. We ordered Medu Vada & chicken biryani. I wanted to order the usual (panner etc...) but first wanted to test out the Medu Vada.  Let me tell you - this was the worst medu vada I had ever eaten in my entire life! They had fried it in Fish Oil & it tasted YUCKY! I had one bite and that was it.  I had to excuse myself to visit the restroom to throw the piece that was in my mouth.  And on my way there I noticed piles & piles of dirty dishes stacked around the kitchen area. It really made me wonder whether we were given clean dishes. The sambar was watery and felt a bit stale. At one point it felt as if the sambar was leftover from someone else's plate. To be fair - it is quite possible that their non-veg items and kebab are pretty tasty but I can only speak for the items that we ordered.
