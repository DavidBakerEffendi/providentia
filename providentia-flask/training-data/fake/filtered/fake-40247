Simply put, the BEST pizza in the world! Better than any pizza I've had even in Rome, Sienna, Florence, and Pisa. Long lines, inconsistent hours, decor that leaves alot to be desired, and the EXPENSIVE cost...ALL true...but the pizza, EVERY LAST MORSEL, it simply heaven! The cost prohibits from going there regularly but it's a wonderful, monthly treat. While you're waiting on line (I've waited two hours, in the rain, just for a pie and it was worth it all), read every plaque on the wall and then eat the pizza for yourself... Enough said!
