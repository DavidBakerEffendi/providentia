The Goat Cheese Nevat is to die for! Duck and ribs are worth writing home about I usually order those and fill in the blanks with selections from whomever else is dining suggests or what is on the specials menu. The food is amazing I have never ordered anything from the menu I wouldn't want again. One negative would be the waitstaff is extremely helpful to the point where they hover. You have to cut them off with the water refills or you leave feeling like a bloated tick. In my experience their mixed drinks leave much to be desired, pass on the Jalapeno Mojito! They are pricey, take way too long to made & last time i checked all tasted similar. Don't waste your money, chose something from their wine list instead! Another factor to consider... the crowd is a bunch of baby boomers  or middle age-rs, who think the place is cool because of the decor and that their friends think its cool.  Unless you are wearing an outfit out of a J.Crew catalog you may feel out of place. Here's the good news... it is one of the few places in Hamden you could visit without risking getting a drink spilled on you by a fist-pumping Quinnipiac student who had had one too many! I prefer the AARP crowd to that any day. I know my mom really enjoyed it too!
