Book ahead if you can becasue it is tiny and always full. You can put your name down for a table and wait at the wine bar next door, the staff will call you when your table is ready. Fun to go with a group of 4 or 6. The cocktails are a nice twist on the margarita and deadly! The food is a nice change from the same old, same old mexican dishes. I never think of going here until the last minute and then I am too starving to wait for a table. Pehaps one day I'll be prepared!
