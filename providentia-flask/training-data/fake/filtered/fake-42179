I would have given Traif 5 stars if the staff wasn't so rude.  I had family in from out of town for a wedding and they refused to allow us to sit together.  I understand not having a table large enough to sit 8 people, however they would not even allow us to sit in tables NEAR each other.  They placed us on opposite sides of the room.  They would never get away with that if they were a Manhattan eatery.
