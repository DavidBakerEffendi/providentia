Just had a TERRIBLE experience!!! After eating a nice meal, my friend and I were asked if we wanted dessert. When we said no, we were immediately given a check (we did not ask for it). We then told our waiter that we wanted a glass of wine and were told that we would have to leave but could go next door to their bar. (The bar that they were "offering" us to go to was completely packed, of course, so this was an empty gesture.) I protested that had we asked for coffee it would have been served to us, so why not a glass of wine? Had I asked them not to clear our plates, which still had some food on them, and then ordered the wine, would they have refused us? I understand that many NY restaurants want to turn over tables and serve as many people as they can, but I have never seen it so blatantly and rudely enforced. Never in more than a decade of living in NY have I been refused a glass of wine after a meal! Â Mind you we had only been there 1 hour and 15 minutes and our check was already over $115 - it wasn't as if we had been lingering and ordering nothing. This is uncivil and crass!
