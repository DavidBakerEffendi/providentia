Dear S.P. I am sorry if your families night did not go as you planed. I remember clearly what happened, I was the person you spoke to. What you fail to mention is that, the person with the party of 5 guests, entered before you & he respectfully waited off to the side while you asked "how long will it be for 2 & a child. I asked you to give me a minute and I'd let you know. The gentleman was told that he would have to wait until his entire party arrives, in order to be seated. This is our policy. Please understand that my restaurant only seats 28 guests, therefore I must be very strategic when seating my dinning room. You are correct, I did have two, 2 tops by the window, but once again....being that my restaurant is limited in seating, it would not make sense for me to put those two tables together. I have certain tables designated for parties of 2,4,6 & most importantly tables of 3 & 5 guests. So.....when I said to you, it would be 20 minutes, is because that is when the table that best works for the running and operating of my dinning room would be available for you. Again.....it is a very small restaurant, seating must be done very strategically. Anyone that has worked in a restaurant should agree & understand what I am saying. It has nothing to do with the fact that you were only a party of three. We treat all our patrons equally. Just because a restaurant may have two empty tables next to each other, does not mean that they can easily put them together. Trust me ....there is reason behind the madness.Again.....anyone in the industry would agree. I now hope that you understand and invite you to give us another try. We are a small business and need all the support we can get, especially because you are our neighbors and we look forward to serving you for a very long time. All the best, Giovanni Tafuri
