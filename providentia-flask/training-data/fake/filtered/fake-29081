This place is so clean that I can eat off the table!  Literally, the tables are shinny!  Good 1st impression to whet my appetite.  The service is good, waitresses are all very friendly and helpful.  Foods are delicious with a great price.  I felt the MSG after my meal, if they would get rid of the MSG in the foods, that will be even more fabulous.
