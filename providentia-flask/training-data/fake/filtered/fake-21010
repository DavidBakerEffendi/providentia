We made reservations since we were attending a play.  I was glad we did as the kitchen was so very slow.  I do not know why we had to wait 20 minutes for an appetizer that requires no cooking.  Our server was not great either she would leave us sitting there just waiting.  So with the slow food and mediocre service, here is our food experience: our appetizer was the antipasti  which was actually really good.  It was a well balanced collection of pickled red peppers, grape tomatoes, traditional Italian cured meats such as salami.  It was all very well balanced and the portion was more than enough for two.  My friend had the pyramid pasta (stuffed with ricotta, lobster, & shrimp, asparagus, pine nuts, parmigiana brown butter). She said it was just good.  I had the Orecchiette (sweet italian sausage & meatballs, brocolli rabe, tomato-basil sauce).  The broccoli rabe was so tough it was more of a chewing exercise than food.  The meatballs were small, hard, and tasted like ground pork with no other spice. The sauce was very good though.  We did not get dessert as frankly it would have taken too long to get it.  Although it was not a bad experience despite the slow service it was just ok in my opinion.  I would go back for the antipasti but probably nothing else.
