Well, we stop at this place with a party of 5 people and were a bit concerned with the previous reviews. We each were first shocked with decor and ambiance at first ( it is like you are in a different world). Then, we were escorted to our table. We each order a different appetizer to try everything. Waw the Hummus is to die for and that med. platter what a great combination. Then, we had the Mediterranean salad very fresh and juicy. Then we had dinner my Talapia was special it was a great piece of fish and a lot of food. Later, for desert we tried that middle eastern dessert kinnafa and baklava "Homemade" Ohh my god this is my best dessert ever. Any way we all have agreed this place is not just good but great and authentic. I guess all these reviews are from kids about hookah well how can you taste food when you are puffing that dust and smoke. This is definitely my next stop for good food and great place nearby.
