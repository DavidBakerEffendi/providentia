I've lived in NYC for a year and have heard great things about the burger here.  The burger is bread, a huge piece of meat, and roquefort cheese. The two other people I went with also ordered the burger for the first time.  We all agreed that we would never order it again.  The cheese is entirely over-powering.  Do not order the burger, unless you love smelly cheese.
