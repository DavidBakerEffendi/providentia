We ate at Delicias last evening with our neighbors.  We live just a few blocks away and were excited to give it a try. When we arrived, the restaurant was full as they were expecting a large party of 10.  The owner/hostess couldn't have been more friendly and accommodating in getting us situated at a table after a brief wait.  Everything from the service to the meal itself was fantastic!  Each of us had a different entree, and each of us was more than satisfied with our choice - grilled chicken, shredded chicken, pork and chorizo.  Each entree was served with delicious arepas, and side dishes such as black beans, guacamole and plantains. What a great addition to the neighborhood.
