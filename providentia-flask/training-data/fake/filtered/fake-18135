I had been searching for an alternative in North Jersey to Veggie Heaven for a long time, and I was so excited to find out about Mundo Vegan via Gary Francione's Facebook post yesterday. I enjoy cooking vegan meals at home, but I'm no gourmet (yet!) So, it's refreshing to come to a beautiful restaurant, have an intelligent conversation with the owners Tracey and Fanny and the server, Hassan, dine al fresco on a charming sidewalk, eat a delicious, esthetically-pleasing dinner & dessert, and leave feeling satiated and happy. I think the price is absolutely fair, considering the high-quality ingredients, impeccable preparation, and creativity involved. My partner and I had reservations tonight for Candle Cafe West in NYC, and we cancelled so we could come back to Mundo Vegan tonight! I can't wait to try the lasagna that everyone's been raving about. We will definitely be regular customers here! If I could give them more than 5 stars I would!!!
