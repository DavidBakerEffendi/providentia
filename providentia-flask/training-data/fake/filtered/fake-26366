My boyfriend and I went on Saturday night.  The meal was absolutely horrible. The entire meal was incredibly salty!  The steak tartar had too much salt and was un-necessarily over seasoned.  My boyfriend ordered the escargot and could not even finish it due to the amount of salt.  We use to frequent often for drinks and my boyfriend would independently go for the escargot.  After this meal we will never return.  Its a shame.
