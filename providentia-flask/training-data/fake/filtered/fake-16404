My wife and I went last night after reading all the reviews and seeing the review on Channel 30.  Clean and new, the server behind the counter was VERY pleasant and cheerful.  Ordered NE clam chowder, a hot lobster roll, and a platter of fried shrimp.  Sides were fries, a house salad, and slaw.  Sat down and was served promptly.  The chowder was very good.  I could tell it wasn't just out of a can.  A bit overpriced at $6 for a fairly good sized cup.  The main dishes came shortly after, and the first thing I saw was the size of the lobster roll.  It was on a regular sized hot dog bun (small) and the lobster meat was left as it was pulled from the shell.  For the $19 this plate costs, I was disappointed in the potion to say the least.  The fried shrimp (10) were good.  The breading was tasty and not greasy.  Served with your choice of what appeared to be an aioli sauce or tarter sauce and fresh lemon.  The slaw was OK, not a lot of flavor.  Fries were hot and fresh, and ample serving to say the least.  Our "server" came to the table several times, and wanted to know if we wanted or needed anything.  She was very genuine and pleasant.  Overall, for my money, the place was OK, but nothing special as yet.  I will be going back to try the fish tacos I've read so much about.  Right now, it seems that J's Crab Shack is a better value for pretty much the same thing.  I'll let you know about my second visit when we go back.
