This is the greatest pizza I have tasted yet!!!! IT'S SO DELICIOUS. I keep coming back here with the intention to try the other pizzas they have but I just can't get enough of the artichoke pizza. It's definitely worth every penny. The slice is actually moderately big which compensates for the price. (it's not even expensive at all)!!! The pizza itself is so creamy and the cheese is fantastic! All I have to say is that sometimes, it does get a bit oily, but pizza will be pizza. This is a perfect place to go to if you're around the city and want something cheap and totally get your moneys worth. Just a heads up, if your pizza is fresh from the oven, please don't take a bite immediately, even if it's deliciousness is tempting. Pizza burns hurt like crazy!!
