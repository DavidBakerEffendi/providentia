I have been coming here since 1993.  Never a bad meal or drink.  Yes the wait is long, maybe they should consider increasing the size, buy land across in the jug handle for parking, maybe build a pedestrian walk over the jug handle. The possibilities are end less, a party room, etc. Then the wait might cut down but they would still have to maintain the same prices and quality.  Just a suggestion.
