We decided to try this place out for our anniversary even after reading mixed reviews. We got there around 6:30 on a Saturday night and I have to say there was really no wait like people where talking about with lines out the door, we were seated right away. The place reminded me of an old basement that badly need to be updated and the bathrooms really needed a good cleaning. That would not have mattered if the service and food was good..  We knew before we even got there that we wanted the stuffed artichokes.  We ordered  for dinner Stuffed Artichokes, Baked Clams. Chicken Scarpariello,  Shrimp Luciano and broiled Steak.  After we placed our order the waiter that had no personality and was rude came back and told us that they ran out of artichokes.  While trying to decide what we wanted instead, we were rushed and told that we couldn't have a minute to decide because he had to put the order in. The waiter brought us plates which had dried food stuck to them and we had to share knives because the waiter said they were short on utensils. The appetizers were fine but not amazing as per other reviews, then the steak came , which we ordered medium and it came not only rare.....but RAW!  We asked to cook it some more which annoyed him and he brought it back to us two minutes later and it was still raw.  We were all disgusted at that point so we did not eat it and told the waiter this. Again he seemed annoyed.  We eat out a lot and have never had this bad service.  Not only did we pay $68 for a steak that nobody ate, but we had to deal with a nasty attitude from the waiter and everyone left hungry.  We were not asked throughout our whole meal how everything was and we were never offered dessert or coffee either.  The check was thrown on the table and we paid and left a tip which wasn't deserved.  Needless to say , we will not be returning.
