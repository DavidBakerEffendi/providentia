Ear blasting noise, bad food, poor service. This place is so noisy with ear blasting music forget about talking. Food is bland, tasteless, greasy, overcooked, undercooked. Service is slow, rude. Question: with the place half full why do they keep people waiting over a half an hour for a seat? The decor is fake, phony.
