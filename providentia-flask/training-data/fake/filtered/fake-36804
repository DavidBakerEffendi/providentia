My husband and I visited the area for our anniversary and walked by the place the night before, thinking it would be a great local spot.  We arrived the next morning, not knowing we had to wait outside because there was no sign.The gentleman inside motioned us to wait outside, rather rudely. The weather was good, thank heavens because stepping inside, there was no place to stand and wait. We waited about 10 minutes after the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter versus a table. Great! You always get fast service at the counter, plus its usually very entertaining in a nostalgic way. So we thought.  We sat at a dirty counter for at least 5 minutes before it was cleaned off.  Our order was taken shortly after. There was alot of confusion behind the counter. Waitresses were eating on their break etc. Talking amungst themselves and generally not paying any attention to  the patrons..it was a shame because the food was actually pretty good.. I also think it was  over priced for the entire experience. It was breakfast.. our bill for 2 people was $25. Nothing special, just cakes, eggs, bacon and coffee. I gave them 3 stars because the food was good. They really need to work on customer service so customers will keep coming back.
