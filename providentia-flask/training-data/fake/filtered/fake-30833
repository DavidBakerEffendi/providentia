I have to agree with K.M.'s review -- music is too loud.  My friends and I were recently there and screaming at each other till we simply decided to head to another spot.  So can't go with friends, and I'm not that into going to bars by myself. If they turned down the music it would be great -- good drinks, greate food, cool atmosphere.
