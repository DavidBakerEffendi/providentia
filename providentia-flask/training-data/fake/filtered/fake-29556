We live in the neighborhood and have been eating there for a quite a while. We just tried to order today like we always - even if it takes time lately since Guy passed by - and we've been advised by the manager that we were not allowed anymore. The employee says that we "cursed" at the staff and we need to "behave" since it's a family business. I never cursed any employee or delivery man in my life, i work in the industry...i've never even heard something like that. I explained the manager it must be a mistake and the guy didn't even try to explain the facts, when it had happen, just decided to back his staff. When we explained this never happened with us, the employee asked if we still wanted to order... Obviously not. I don't understand this behavior, so anti-customer and disrespectful, especially since we've been supporting this place a long time. Very, very disappointed and not hungry anymore...
