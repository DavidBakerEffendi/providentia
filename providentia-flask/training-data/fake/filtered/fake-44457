Went here for drinks this past weekend.  Has a pretty extensive beer list if you're willing to put up with the price, crowds and volume level. At one point someone near me dropped a glass, and as I was wearing sneakers I helped accumulate the shards into a pile until someone came over with a broom.  Following my assistance an overly-aggressive bouncer promptly told me I had to leave. Overall if you're looking to grab a beer you can do much better elsewhere in the area.
