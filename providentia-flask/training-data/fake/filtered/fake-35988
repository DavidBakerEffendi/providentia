Ah Roberta's - the ultimate hipster restaurant that lives up to the buzz! The pizza here is amazing and crave-worthy, their other dishes are clever (though portions are quite small). I lived in a loft across the street from Roberta's with three close friends for a year, and it actually was this restaurant which convinced us that Bushwick represented the epitome of Brooklyn cool. I even saw Usher dining here - but when celebs and foodie tours start making stops you know it's lost some street cred. The ambience is post-apocalyptic chic, especially in the tiki bar outside.
