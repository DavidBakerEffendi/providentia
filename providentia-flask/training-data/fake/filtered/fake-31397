The review written by "Nancy P." on 12/26/14 is exactly what we experienced the same night at 6PM.. In my opinion there was NO good reason they were understaffed that evening based on the number of reservations made in advance. Money is not my issue, I gladly pay for VALUE rec'd, however, spending close to $400., sans tip for dinner for four left me wit a bitter taste, excuse the deserved pun.We had one round of drinks and after waiting a half hour the second round was "comped" with an apology about the "poor" service, "poor" is my word. They're known for charring their steaks but that night the charr turned out to be BURNED  for all of the meat dishes plus the very small Froie Gras was bunnt on the outside and "runny raw" inside, the Sea scallops fared no better. Prior to the main course, they dimmed the house lights REALLY low, I remarked in jest it was done to cover up the foods appearance, regretfully, maybe I was correct. In my opinion, I feel whoverer was manning the grill was NOT their regular person and was overwhelmed by the amount of orders resulting in burnt, nt charred meat. I cannot fault the four person wait staff which included 2 men who were pressed into service.I'm sure the kitchen was also understaffed. Upon departure, I was asked "how was dinner"  I did not reply nor was one needed. Many years ago, I was told "you're as good as your last job" !!!
