ZERO STARS. As a life-long Southern girl who has lived in the city for 8 years, I have been WAITING for the perfect crawfish boil locale to open up. This place is definitely not it. If you think that paying these prices PER POUND for boiled crawfish is even somewhat acceptable, you have lost your mind. I myself generally eat 3-5 pounds (because I know how to do it), so consider that and you're left with a pretty hefty bill. Get a life, you losers who own this place. Your boil isn't even tasty and my grandmother would be ashamed that you're selling this crap. Not to mention: the clientele that's lingering around outside is absolutely embarrassing. Do yourself a favor: save what you would spend on 2 dinners at THE BOIL and buy a roundtrip ticket to Nola. Go pick up 15 pounds of boiled crawfish and potatoes & corn at Zimmer's and save yourself the embarrassment of being one of these clowns waiting around for a table outside.
