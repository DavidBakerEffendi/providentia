Came here at the weekend with a couple people for what I thought was going to be an enjoyable evening but the management really let it down. Just so you know I am giving 3 stars for the food/service which I prob should give 4 but it was the manager(don't know his name but he was a big guy with short hair)who really ruined our evening. From the start when we were at the door his attitude seemed not to care about the guest at all the way he spoke to us was like we were just a number. The place was really busy and what I saw was no help being given to the strained servers and the interactions I saw showed me he treats the staff with just as much respect as he did us. Our server was great and we loved the food. Maybe I will call back and see who is managing before I return. Sorry, but what I saw was a disgrace.
