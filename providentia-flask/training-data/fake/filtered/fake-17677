While the restaurant was very busy, we were seated right away, and didn't find it too noisy at all.  The staff were courteous and attentive.  The food was excellent and there was a good selection beer and drinks.   We had chicken wings, salad and pizza.  The wings were crispy outside and very moist inside.  The pizza was thin crust but not burnt or undercooked.  It really was some of the best pizza I have had - a little chewy but not too much.  They are using many local ingredients, and it shows.  I guess they just opened last month, and if it took a little while to get things running smoothly, I would say they are doing a great job.  I would highly recommend trying the Vermont Tap House.
