This continues to be my favorite restaurant in New Haven (and I've been here for 6 years and have tried every single high-end restaurant in downtown). The chef always uses seasonal and fresh ingredients and is so creative. I lean towards their fish dishes but everything on their menu is good (and it changes too, depending on what's available). The restaurant is small, so it's not particularly good for parties of more than 8 people, but the food is so delicious!
