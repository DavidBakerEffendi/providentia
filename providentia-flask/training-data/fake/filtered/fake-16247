Really great food, service, and the prices for NYC are very reasonable (especially for lunch). If you have any friends that are picky eaters they have lots of simple but yummy food like steak sandwiches, ahi tuna salad, and AMAAAZING desserts (the chocolate peanut butter brownie sundae is unbelievable.
