This is how it went: I wanted indian food. I logged on to yelp and found some good reviews, a few raves, and a few scathing rants. It was hard to tell, so I went and ate at Shalimar of India. Â Then I wondered how this restaurant got 17 positive reviews. I know it's northern vermont, but I've had better indian food in Pittsburgh, PA and east nowhere Minnesota. I'm tired of people using our location as an excuse. You can cook good food anywhere, I do it every night in my own kitchen. The food here is bad, and seemed old. There's just no nice way to put it. Maybe the food we ate on Saturday night was left over from the previous week's Sunday brunch that everybody compliments so highly. We were seated immediately (not a surprise as the restaurant was empty), and the service was prompt but that didn't make up for the bland tandoori, the greasy curry or the mushy lentils. Even the naan wasn't comparable to what we've had elsewhere.
