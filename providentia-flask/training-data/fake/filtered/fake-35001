Rocky Hill Inn has become a staple for us...we're not quite regulars, but I think we're getting there.  The things I like about this place is that, for the most part, it's reliable.  A pub like atmosphere where you can sit comfortably at the bar and order from a decent beer menu...and, order dinner if you're so inclined.  The wait staff and bartenders are friendly so you get that neighborhood feel.  The menu could use a little change but is fairly diverse and the chef usually is pretty good with the evening specials.  The dining room in the back is nice if you feel like moving away from the pub atmosphere.     I've never been disappointed with the Rocky Hill Inn burger (RHI); although I thought the bun was too big last time.  The cheese board is a great way to start a dinner.
