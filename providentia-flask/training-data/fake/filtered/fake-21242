I found this place randomly and I loved it. It is a small but a nice restaurant. The food was delicious. I ordered red lentil soup and mixed plate which came with 4 different grilled meat. My favorite one was kofte (meatballs). But all were very delicious. Baklava is usually not my favorite desert because it is too sweet but I tried one because other deserts were out (may be because it was quite late). To my surprise, baklava was not that sweet and tasted very fresh. The owner. Murat, said it they make it daily. Awesome! I cannot wait to try other food at the menu! Oh, I also liked he B.Y.O.B. part. I may do it next time!
