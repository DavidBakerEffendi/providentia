If I were to say I go here at least once a week, it would not be a stretch at all (and I live and work in midtown.) Often the wait is a bit long, but it is beyond worth it for the amazing burrito that is to come! I can only speak for the chicken burrito, as I never get anything else, but it is by far the best burrito in Manhattan. I can't even eat at Chipotle after discovering this place. The people who work here are fun and cool, if not a little slow, but like I said before about the wait, they could curse at me and tell me I'm a horrible person, I would still give this five stars and go every week because the burritos are just that good. The other location on Carmine is just as good, perhaps even more so since it's a little bigger, but I probably go to the Union Square location more often, hence the review here.
