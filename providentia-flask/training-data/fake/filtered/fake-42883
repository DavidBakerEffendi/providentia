Sorry, but my somewhat shallow romance with this establishment is over. Since the new ownership there has been a marked decline in the quality and ambiance. Apparently this is now a sports bar that serves over-cooked everything as slowly as possible while under some hipster pretense of fusion slow food silliness ... executed poorly. The second star is only because the members of the staff are still rockstars that bring the only shred of character to this sad and burnt-out restaurant.
