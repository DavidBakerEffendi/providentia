We found the food at Ibiza Tapas to be excellent by the highest of standards. This nice restaurant provides a pleasant setting of a wonderful meal. Awesome atmosphere and wonderful service. My family all loved it. The manager was very polite and servicing with us. I am reading negative reviews about the service, but I assume that either we were lucky or this is a past error that has been fixed because our experience was wonderful. (New owners maybe?) We did not have a reservation, but the girl was extremely helpful very nice and showed us to a table, even when almost every table was full, she took the trouble to explain all the dishes in the menu This was hands down the best meal we had on the city and the chef's tasting menu was to die for. The portions were certainly sufficient and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I would return to this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone. Thank you very very much!
