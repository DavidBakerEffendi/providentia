Our #1 go-to restaurant-- we've been here COUNTLESS times, and have never been disappointed. My mother has ordered the meatloaf entree so often you'd think she'd be sick of it, but even 2+ years later she'll even (secretly) order it for take-out when hosting a dinner party. My father orders from all over the menu, and particularly favors whatever seafood special is listed that week on the chalkboard. He's always very pleased. I order from the specials menu as well, and it takes a lot of restraint to not finish the entire dish, even when my pants are about to bust. Recommended: The Endive Apple Gorgonzola salad (as another reviewer mentioned, the quality of the gorgonzola is outstanding), The Arugula, Pecans, Cranberries, Gorgonzola..... (the list of ingredients is too long to list, you get the point) The Meatloaf with Chipotle Sauce (comes with awesome mashed potatoes) Anything on the Specials Menu.. I especially enjoy whatever risotto dish they have going... they know their risotto. and their chocolate cake w/ peanut butter ice cream (or substitute the flavor if you like) is awwwweeeesssooommmmeeeee. I blow every diet I am on to eat this dessert.
