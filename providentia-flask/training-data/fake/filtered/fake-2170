We had a wonderful dinner on Christmas Eve at Il Pittore.  The food was beautifully prepared and presented.  Each course was terrific.  Our favorites among the dishes we had that night  were a monkfish wrapped in prosciutto, a porcini lasagne, and an absolutely over-the-top pear crisp.  The wines suggested by the staff were excellent and the service was - in a word - outstanding.  The staff was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable and - happily - not at all  "in your face".   We've eaten at  this location in most of its previous incarnations, but this those experiences just can't compare.  The place has been beautifully renovated and the  murals are smashing and add much to the ambience of the place.  We can't wait to go back.  Overall, a great addition to the Philadelphia restaurant scene.
