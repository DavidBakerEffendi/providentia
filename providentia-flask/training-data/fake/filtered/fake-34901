My husband and I thought we would give Freemans another try since our first visit was quite fun and enjoyable.  What a mistake.  We decided we would sit at the back bar where during our first visit the male bartender was friendly, efficient and welcoming.  Not the case the second time around. From the moment we sat down the female bartender greeted us with a frown which never left her face and set the tone for what was to be our abbreviated and perhaps last visit.  As we looked at the drink menu she threw several empty liquor bottles into a nearby garbage can with a loud crash.  When the drinks arrived, both signature cocktails, she couldn't get one of them to catch fire so she just threw the lemon peel in the drink and walked away. We had hoped to have several drinks and dinner, but by this time we were getting really uncomfortable.  She never came back to ask us if we wanted another cocktail and never asked if we wanted anything to eat.  What a disappointment. It ruined the evening for us and cost Freemans a hundred bucks + and two potential loyal, local customers.  Comments about "surly" service should be heeded.
