This review is long in coming.  We have been to Luca's numerous times and can not say we've ever been disappointed. Food and atmosphere are great. Good variety of food -- definitely something for everyone and the fresh bread is warm and to die for!! Luca's is not only one of our favorite restaurants it has become our 'go to' place to celebrate special occasions. A gem of a restaurant in the most unlikely place.  Don't let the strip mall deter you, it's like another world once you step inside.
