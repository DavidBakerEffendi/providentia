Went here for the first time today, and it was the perfect place to celebrate Mother's Day--I highly recommend the Hong Kong style shrimp, as well as the Beijing duck. Both were quite authentic, and well worth a try. The waiters were also pleasant and accommodating, and I noticed they recognized the regulars at the place, and greeted them as such. Definitely going to come back.
