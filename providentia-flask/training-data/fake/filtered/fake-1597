As we ordered at the counter we were met with a rude, condescending attitude, because of a slight, immediate change in my wife's order.  The woman at the register ruled her eyes, made faces, and sighed as she tried to calculate our bill on a calculator.  We were the only ones in line.  I was outside at a dirty table, when my wife came out and told me how it got worse.  She said that she continued to give her attitude after she did not tell her our drinks were up, then tried to be little her when she told her.  The woman over heard us, and started an argument as we waited for our food.  An unpleasant eating of our food through her huffing around slamming the door next to us, solidified our feeling that we would not go back.  Our previous experiences there were not as rude, but the staff is certainly not helpful.
