Though I haven't been an avid fan of Thai food, I do occasionally stop by for some chicken n rice (complimented with some good sauce). SriPraPhai decently offers me that satisfaction of having a good Thai food, when I do actually want to eat Thai food. I've seen 5 star reviews and 2/1 star reviews, and I think people are approaching it from two extremes. Its a good place to eat...not bad....not perfect. Its simply good.
