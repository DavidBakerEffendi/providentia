Several things here are excellent, a few are atrocious. Lets start off with the positive. First, use your eyes, and don't sit under a speaker. You will find the seating is very comfortable and the music is just right. It is my understanding the bartenders are the DJs and they make a great mix. They have definitely done their homework on Spotify. Â The lighting is soothing and the overall color scheme is cozy and warm. The staff is excellent. Cocktail waitresses are attentive and are up for genuine conversation, not just flirtatious banter. The bartenders are professional, experienced, well-versed, and most importantly, fast. Unfortunately, it's rare in Astoria to come across a bartender that knows how to make a drink properly, so I appreciate them when I see one. Now, the negatives mostly stem from the fact that the clientele is a few years younger. I am in my early 30's and understand I just may be too old for Astoria. What I do not understand is the mid-20's Astoria brand of hipster, nor the bro-tank kids. Their conversations always tend to be at a volume that must be overheard by surrounding patrons. I personally find that if I wanted to talk to them, I would pull up a chair. They shouldn't be a part of my tables' conversation from 8 feet away. I think the obnoxious young men are the genesis of the noise issue that was brought up on some other reviews, as opposed to the music. The other negative is there are a lot of dudes. Seriously, bring women if you want to talk to any because they are in short supply. Overall, go for a late nightcap with your friends Mon-Wed and you will have a great time.
