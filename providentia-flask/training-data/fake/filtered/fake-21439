This place had enticed me many a times, as I walked down the street, and yesterday I had the opportunity to visit the The Hummus & Pita Co. with friends. I was excited about trying a new place, especially since the menu was Mediterranean. Ordering was similar in style to Chipotle, yet somewhat confusing. The attendants were not helpful, and I felt rushed to order.  My friends had already ordered, and one of them had paid for my order, since she had told the cashier-girl to include the order on her bill. While my friends sat and readied themselves to enjoy their meal, I was still waiting, and I had asked twice if I could have my food. When it finally arrived, I was told that my food was not paid for, and so I mentioned to the very nervous young lady at the register that my friend had told her to charge the meal. Well, at that moment, out of the blue, a very pumped, bouncer looking individual starting telling me not to abuse the cashier. I told him I was doing no such thing and he just continuously berated me, until I decided that I was not comfortable eating in a place that I did not feel welcomed in. What pursued was this TROGLODYTE, asking me to leave, as my friends tried to convince him that I did not abuse anyone. If anything, it was I that was being abused by the much older NJ SITUATION wannabe. He then asked us all to leave in a displeasing and disrespectful manner, and would not even return my friends the money for the meal they could not enjoy. Luckily, the general manager helped us pack our food, and he was decent enough to apologize. Honestly, if this displeasing, individual, who proclaims himself to be the owner, is truly the owner, then he should learn to treat his customers with more respect and not be so arrogant and pompous. I must add that I am a teacher, and I teach 7th graders who behave more civilly than this man who behaved ungentlemanly. Shame on him! I will  never return to Hummus and Pita Co.
