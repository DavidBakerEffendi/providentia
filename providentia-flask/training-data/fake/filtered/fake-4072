I  was a huge fan of Bella's until this week!  I will probably return, but not any time soon.  My friend and I have monthly breakfasts at The Corner Restaurant in Milford, CT. The food is always terrific, but I was a little tired of the menu so I suggested my favorite breakfast haunt, Bella's!  The service is usually terrific--not this time.  The food has always been spectacular--not this time.  (I ordered Bella's Benedict.  Barely enough sauce to cover  the small piece of meat and dry eggs). The only thing that saved the meal were my grits (try them if you like grits). I would give 3 stars, but  this is my first sub-par experience.  2 meals, coffee,  15% tip (not 20% because of  poor service this time) was $38.
