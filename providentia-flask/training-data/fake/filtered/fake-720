LOVE this place!  The Texas Cobb is my fav but the BBQ and Brisket Sandwich are amazing!  Also, the $1.00 chips and salsa are a no brainer.  I can't drink margaritas but they have fantastic cocktails such as the Drunken Arnold Palmer.  I also have to shout out Becky.  She is the BEST waitress!  So polite, nice, and attentive.  Truly appreciate her great service :)  This is the best place in NoLibs.
