Came here again with friends last night, and was not disappointed.   The build your own is awesome. I can get whatever I want and the unlimited toppings can't be beat.  I do expect this to take a little bit longer than Smash or Zin, but the quality is better by far, so that is worth it.  Also get the fried pickles.  They are to die for.
