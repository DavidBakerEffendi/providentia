I have been twice to this place always for the tasty hanger steak, which is the best dish I've had in a long time! There is also this really pretty waitress there with tattoos and dark hair, that has served me both times, and I wish that I could take her to every restaurant with me to get service like she does in this place.  She's on top of every order, always has great energy, and always makes sure everyone is having a good time.  Love the BYOB and the atmosphere.... the place is small so for big groups, make reservations.
