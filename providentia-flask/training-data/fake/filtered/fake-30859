i love this bar.  enjoy it best on weekdays when it is not as crowded.  love love love the bartenders and staff.  they are terrific and friendly.  as a queer girl i felt welcome and at home.  this is my new favorite spot.  anyone who doesn't like the staff can kiss my grits and head out to another bar, good riddance.
