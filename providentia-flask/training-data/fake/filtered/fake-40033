I was excited to try this place out since I live not too far away and it's always listed as one of the best in New York. After a few tries, I managed to drop in at an odd hour when it was actually possible to get to the counter. After being ignored by the waitress for about 15 min for no apparent reason (there was no line, just a bunch of people at the tables waiting for the whole pies the owner was making), I got my $5 plain slice. It was easily one of the worst pizzas I've ever had in my life. There was some faint fresh basil and garlic flavor, but they were completely overwhelmed by salt and grease. The slice was dry (even though it could not have been more than 1/2 hr old considering their traffic), barely a trace of tomato sauce, dripping with oil, and so unbearably salty, it reminded me more of cheap potato chips than pizza. Those tasteless $1 slices you see in fast pizza joints all over the city (probably premade and frozen since they seem to do any cooking), which you end up getting at 3 am when nothing else is open in some neighborhoods, are actually less disgusting than this "gourmet" stuff. Completely disappointing! I have no idea what people are raving about, there is tons of good pizza in NYC, this place is just hype.
