Excellent noodle restaurant in the heart of Chinatown! To cool down during Summer, try the cold shaved pig ears. They have a great crunch to them and are well marinated. Then heat up with a bowl of noodles. I doubt you need any more food than that but the stir fried noodles and boiled dumplings are equally great fillers.
