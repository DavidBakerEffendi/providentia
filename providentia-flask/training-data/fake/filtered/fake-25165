I would say avoid this place.  I met my girlfriend one night here for dinner last week.  She got there before I did...and was standing in front of the place when I got there.  I think that she had enough sense to know what we would be in for with this restaurant.  Anyway, we decided to go inside because the specials sounded interesting.  This place is tiny.  There basically 6-8 people crowded into one corner, with the other side basically empty with a reserved sign on the 'table' (which is not really a table, it is just a piece of wood next to the window.  When the guy sitting inside there said to me 'It's all good'...I knew it wasn't going to be.  So we ordered the two specials, the lamb shank and  black sea bass, which were both very tiny, inadequate, and not particularly tasty.  The sea bass which my girlfriend ordered was wrapped up in a piece of paper and was basically tasteless.  The excuse for lamb shank was very small and not too flavorful.  We were basically through with the meal in 10 minutes and on our way home, where we cooked some tasty pasta. I would say it you are looking for a couple of snacks, and place to hang out, bring some beer or wine, and get cozy with a friend in some close-up quarters, this is place to go...but otherwise, this is not a restaurant..it's just some weird hangout.  Kind of surprising also because when we got there they were cooking up a storm in the back, but nothing seemed to really come out.  The burgers that people next to us ordered looked pretty good, with nice fresh chopped meat, but nothing out of the ordinary of standard diner fare.
