For style..C.. For food...D-...For music...D-. Nice for a date if you want to spend more than you have to. Food wasnt anything like Cuban food. If you look at the menu you can see clear it is not. If you go to Bongos in FL you will see the difference. They play old old Salsa but not the good stuff. Will i go back unlikely. This is not a Cuban place. They should change their name.. The was no Alma here!!!!!
