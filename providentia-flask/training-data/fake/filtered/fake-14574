After hearing great things about the Plan B in West Hartford, my wife and I decided to try Plan B in Milford.  We won't be going back.   We went late on a Saturday afternoon, around 2 PM, and there was a solid 30 min wait.  So instead of waiting, we went to the bar.  The bartenders asked us what we wanted to drink, gave it to us along with menus, then ignored us for about 20 mins.  We finally ordered food, starting with nachos, and I had the ultimate cheeseburger, my wife opted for the mushroom burger.  The nachos were ok.  Not great, but not horrible.  Certainly not what we were expecting as they are served over potato chips.  I wouldn't recommend these.   On to the burgers.  Both burgers were dry, unseasoned, and fell apart when we bit into them.  Very, very bland, almost to the point of being inedible.  The rolls were large and overpowering.  Once the meat fell apart, it looked like dog food on our plates.  My "Ultimate Cheeseburger" wasn't very cheesy, and my wife's burger, despite ordering it no-pink, was still alive and kicking.  Both burgers were very greasy too.   The fries were great though.  Not greasy and well seasoned.  If only the burgers were as good....sigh. After the meal, it took our combined effort to get our check, the bartenders were paying no attention to us at all.   Bottom line, hit up Five Guys or Red Robin for much more enjoyable meal and better service.
