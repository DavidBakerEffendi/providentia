i'm a pizza freak and this place is definitely a top ten pizza in NYC kind of place. There has been a bit of an explosion of real pizza here in the last decade. Prior to that it would have been top 5. I had pizza in Naples back in the 70's when I was a kid and this comes very close. It's the real thing. You pay a premium but it's worth it. Go check it out!
