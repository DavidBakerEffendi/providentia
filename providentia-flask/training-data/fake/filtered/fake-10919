Just tried it for the first time this past Sunday.  I took a date there and hoped for a nice experience. Well,  I would recommend that you spend your money elsewhere.    No atmosphere to speak of, unless you like a super brightly lit room, and even though I told the staff that we were first-timers, they did not make any effort to give us a good dining experience.   The food was pretty awful and the waitress acted like we were invisible. We were plainning to order coffee & perhaps dessert, but we waited so long for our waitress to come by after our meal was finished that we just gave up and began to put our coats on.  We hoped that the waitress would notice and give us our check, but no such luck - she was so engrosssed in her conversation.  As we sat there with our coats on waiting, another of the staff took it upon herself to finally yell across the restaurant. "Hey, they want their check!!"   The waitress shoved the check at me, like I was her biggest burden in life - suprising for someone working for tips.   In this economy, with people dining out less, you would think a restaurant would try to make their customers feel valued. Well, I won't be spending any more of my money at this place and I recommend you spend yours elsewhere too.  This place should be out of business in no time.
