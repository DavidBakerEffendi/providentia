Food was pretty good and our family enjoyed a nice brunch but when we left the taste of Portugal our car was broken into and so was the Lexus next to ours. We thought our car was safe because there was an attendant on duty who just happen to take a break for about 20 minutes. Which just happens to be just enough time to smash a window and grab bags out of the back. The owner upon hearing of the break in was not to helpful in calling the police. He instead tried to call his friend who is a Newark detective. All in all the food was good but not worth the risk of losing a window or valuables. The car next to us had the same fate as well.
