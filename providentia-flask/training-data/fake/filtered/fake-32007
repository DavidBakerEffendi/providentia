Unbelievable. I've been following Daniel Delaney for a while and was impressed that he Â created BrisketLabs - pop up events to test his brisket recipes. He succeeded: he came up with the best tasting brisket and pork ribs I've ever had in my life. It was melting in my mouth, with the right smokiness that you can only find in Texas. Heavenly. I had an amazing cole slaw side, I don't know what spices he put in there, but it was absolutely delicious. Besides that, the interior is simple, elegant, and relaxed, and Dan is the most charming host you can imagine. And the band added the right atmosphere. The whole restaurant was a great experience, cozy, delicious, fun. I will become a regular.
