BEST TACOS OF MY LIFE! I got the veggie and chicken. I smothered my veggie with guac and tomatillo sauce and a splash of lime juice! . the corn toritlla was perfectly cooked and veggies were extremely fresh. the chicken was tender and perfectly seasoned. my friend ordered the carnitas and finished them so quickly! she also order guac which we shared. it is evident that they use fresh ingredients and put love and care into their food. i will definitely return to this place time and time again. it is a gem. i am excited to return and try out new special and perhaps even order an enchilada. wooohooooo
