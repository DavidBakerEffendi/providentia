I ate there with some friends on a Sunday night.  The food was quite awful.  I had the free range chicken.  It had no taste to it whatsoever.  I've had better tasting chicken at Applebee's!  It took nearly ten minutes to get the attention of ANY server just to get my husband's undercooked steak taken back.  It was supposed to be medium, not rare!  Sure they took it off the bill, but that did not make up for the lousy service.  Oh, and per a previous review, the handle in the women's bathroom is still broken...four months later!
