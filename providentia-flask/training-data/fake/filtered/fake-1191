Enjoyed a delightful meal in their outdoor space.  Goat cheese salad, fried chicken and lobster rolls were all excellent.  French fries and potato salad were perfectly prepared.  Desert of chocolate mousse cake was a great finisher. Drinks were strong.  Wait staff was all smiles and helpful.  I highly recommend this restaurant.
