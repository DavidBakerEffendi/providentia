Every foodie has a touchstone dish(es) by which they judge a restaurant.  In Chinese restaurants, I judge them by their pork dumping.  It is the opening dish that sets the tone for the meal.  That is how I was introduced to T.S. Ma when they opened in Upper Montclair.  They had the best pork dumplings, fried or steamed, in town.  Bar none.  The shell was thin and there was ample flavorful filling.   However, lately the quality of the dumping has declined dramatically.  Now they are simply a dough ball with miniscule amounts of filling.  They are not worth the carbs.  So much so I will no longer order them for it makes my entire meal disappointing.  Moreover, it causes me to inspect every dish that we order for quality and freshness.  Something that I thought I would have never needed to do at T.S. Ma.   My other benchmark dishes are still intact.  Thus, there is only one strike against you.
