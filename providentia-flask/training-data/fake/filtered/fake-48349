Came hoping for the definitive Philly cheesesteak, but left disappointed. The meat was bland, bread was chewy, and my sandwich was $10 - which was too much to pay considering quality of the sandwich and the hassle it took navigating narrow streets to get there! Â Really, the only positive thing I can say about it is: the service was quick! Honestly, I have had far superior Philly cheesesteaks from cheap chain restaurants.
