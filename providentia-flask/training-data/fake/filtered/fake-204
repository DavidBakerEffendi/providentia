I was borned and raised in NE Philly. I took my husband to Philly for the first time to "enjoy" a real Philly Cheesesteak.  We chose Geno's and we were beyond disappointed, the meat was tough, had no flavor, mushrooms were canned, cold and slapped on top of his sandwich.  The customer service was beyond rude, the sandwich was just tossed out the window at us.  Their staff definitely needs to go some obedience classes.  We won't waste our $20 for 2 sandwiches which he could have cooked better at home.  The hype they showed on the Food Network's show with Mike Simon had to be made up, it was nothing like they showed.
