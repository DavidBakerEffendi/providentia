I just ordered from EST EST EST for the first/last time ever!  I wanted a Med Bacon Pizza, I swear it was a small, but that's beside the point.  It had a burnt smell horrible taste and worst after taste.  It had gritty little bacon bits on it that hurt my teeth. It was overly salty, I don't understand how it could be so salty with burnt bacon bits but whatever.  It was a bit greasy, that really wasn't bothersome, that's what you get when you eat pizza.  I had it delivered to my office, I had to go out to the car to pay for it, and driver wouldn't even meet me in the lobby. I have a belly ach, feel like I have to vomit and will never order from them again!
