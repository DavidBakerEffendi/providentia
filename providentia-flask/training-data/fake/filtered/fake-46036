this place is all about the octopus appetizer  and that's it!!! nothing else is worth trying, don't go waste your money here, just order the octopus to go and bon appetite. we had the scallops, the hanger steak  and the special  prawn pasta, all bland, nothing special, definitely not a place I would try again.
