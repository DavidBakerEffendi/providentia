Been here a few times but wasn't happy the last couple of times. So decided I would give it another shot. What a mistake... Got there at 12:45 pm lunch time. The credit card machine was not working. The "ropa Vieja" was not ready to be served to guest so I got the lechon which was raw and had no flavor and to top it off my soda was flat!!! Most likely the last time I come here. Very disappointed.
