From the beautiful interior to the attentive staff, topped off by exceptional food and you have a great restaurant. Try the Brussel Sprouts and Atayef & Veal Bacon which are our favorites each time we go. The wait staff is very good with recommendations. I suggest going with the small plates so you can experience a variety of great Mediterranean food. Excellent wines as well. I highly recommend ilili!
