MR is the HOTT spot ! i eat there everyday ... breakfast luch and dinner , the food is great , the place is comfortable and the guys behind the counter are the friendliest ~  they embrace me like i am one of the Family ,   YOU can get a slice anywhere , but you dont get  that feeling of walking in your own kitchen, mamarosa is my kitchen with friends always happy to greet me.. i love it ~ MAMA ROSAS IS LIFE !
