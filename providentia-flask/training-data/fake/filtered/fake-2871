We live in North Jersey so we are used to rude attitudes but wow I have never been so angry at such horrible treatment!  Today we walked in with a party of 11 (it was a Sunday lunch and there weren't many people there) and the birthday girl was supposed to be surprised.  They told us that we could not be seated because our whole party had not arrived but we tried to explain that it was a surprise and the birthday girl did not know we were coming, she had the nerve to tell me "Please do not give me an attitude!"  In all honesty I was talking to her very calmly and just trying to explain the situation.  The manager was insanely rude for rest of the time we waited and we finally decided that we would no longer be insulted.  Our party of eleven (who have been going there for years despite the rude staff) no longer had a desire to ever eat there again.  We ended up going to Rumba Cubana in North Bergen (FYI...5 stars!)  The food was so much more authentic, the waiter was bombarded with 11 people shooting requests and handled it with grace and a smile and the music wasn't blasting so loud that you have to shout to talk to the person next to you (like many know from Cuban Pete's).  Overall they lost all 11 of us because they have just been going down hill with the treatment of customers and places like that don't deserve our time and money.  With an economy like this they should be so thankful that people are walking into their restaurant.  The good people deserve our business.  For all those that gave it 4 or 5 stars you are very lucky you caught them on a descent night.
