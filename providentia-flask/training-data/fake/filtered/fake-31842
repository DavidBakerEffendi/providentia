I used to LOVE Calle Ocho and was a regular customer for years up until recently (2008 or so when they occupied previous location just few minutes away from current one). I always used to recommend this restaurant to all my friends, and used to do reservations ahead of time for almost all of my weekends...regardless summer or winter, my friends used to joke that I had a table there that was mine:-). Unfortunately the quality of the restaurant in the past year (brunch times - my favorites) went down: the main guy at the front desk is filthy-looking, not friendly at all, general crowd has changed (it was a great brunch fancy spot:-)), food is so-so, music is very tasteless: really who wants to listen to super loud regatton all brunch long, you can't even hear yourself when you talk to someone next to you at the table. Anyways, I have cancelled all my future reservations, with sadness of course, because at heart and in memories I LOVE this place. I hope the managers will revamp that fancy classiness about this great restaurant.
