Best breakfast in Philadelphia. As a lifelong resident of the city, I've been to many a diner, breakfast spot, etc, and I've yet to encounter a breakfast as fresh, hearty, and delicious as the Dutch eating place. Orange juice is fresh squeezed and chocolate milk is the best I've ever had...ever. If you go, I suggest the massive (and fire than filling) pancake platter or the delicious, fresh from the farm bacon.
