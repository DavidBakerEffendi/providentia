The steak is not as good as you can expect for this price range. The service was OK until I got a check. We were party of two, but 18% tip was automatically added to the bill. When I politely asked owner why it is automatically included (I always pay at least 15-18%, but it is my choice, I do not like that somebody decided it for me until it stated in menu), owner become very rude and started yelling Â on me.
