My husband and I went here on a Friday night and were able to get a table very quickly since we were only a party of two, but it seemed like some larger groups were waiting longer. To start we had coconut shrimp, which was awesome, tasted fresh and was not greasy or oily. I had the chicken massaman, my favorite. My husband got the fried rice with pineapple chicken. We both got medium spicy, but mine wasn't too hot, which was good for me. His was definitely hotter, but still delicious. I would go back to try some of the other things as other people's plates looked very good as well.
