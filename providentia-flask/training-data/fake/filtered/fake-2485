I would give 5 stars for the food, however 1 for delivery.....The pizza is the best that I have found in Center City.  I keep trying other pizza because the delivery is such a nightmare but I keep on going back because I love the food....I live 2 blocks away in the back of a brownstone and explain this to them everytime but they can never get it right...I even had a security guard from the nearby hospital call me and say that my order was there...What?   Maybe they should take the time to listen over the phone to your directions...I keep on ordering though for it is the best I have found
