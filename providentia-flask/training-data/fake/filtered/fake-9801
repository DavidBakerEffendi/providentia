The food is okay and that is about all this bar has going for them... Their beer list is lackluster... only 6 taps (sam adams seasonal, guiness, shock top, yeungling, coors light, bud light.)... the beers were also very pricey (even domestics were $5-$6) The staff was very rude. The bartenders ignored me until I finally made a waving motion to show I needed help (it wasn't even that busy either)... There was also a terrible smell coming from the kitchen when I went to the bathroom (which was not very clean as well)... I would only recommend this place to my worst enemies
