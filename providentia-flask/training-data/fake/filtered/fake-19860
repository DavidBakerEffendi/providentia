Possibly the closest you're going to get to New Orleans in NYC. This little treasure has the best ambiance and it actually feels like you're in nola. The food is DELICIOUS Â and cooked to perfection. Things I tried: Crawfish Bordin Balls- Yum Pork Bordin Balls- Yummmmm Abita Shrimp- :-D :-D :-D Chicken Po boy- Enormous and very tasty (craving it as I'm typing) Mac and Cheese- Better than kraft, Best Mac & cheese I've had to date Note: You have not had the full experience until you check out the bathrooms. They are adorable.
