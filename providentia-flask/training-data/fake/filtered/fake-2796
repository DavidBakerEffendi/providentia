Save your money for someplace that values your business. Long wait, unorganized and extremely rude staff. We were finally seated after a two hour wait only to be seated at a table for 9 -- we were a party of 11. Staff walked passed us and made no effort to right their wrong. Finally a very aggressive "manager" came over and said with no apologies "you need to get up and wait on line again." She offered no resolution and just said we needed to go back to the waiting area (where we'd been for 2 hours). Both the manager and the owner are the most incompetent business personnel i have ever encountered! They are rude, and have very POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS. Luckily Bloomfield Ave has an array of restaurants to choose from. We gave up on Cuban Pete's and went across the street to the Thai restaurant Spice II. The food was EXCELLENT, the staff was very friendly, excellent service, and they were able to accommodate our party of 11 within ten minutes.
