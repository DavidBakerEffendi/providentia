Bravo! Well done guys! Some may say I am hard to impress but I know a good business when I see one. I have noticed this place for a few months now and I have been wanting to eat here to see how it is. As soon as you walk in you see a counter, with bagels behind the workers. It is a bit reminicant of a bagel store. As soon as you sit you are greeting by a lovely young lady. Very respectable people here. The food is second to none, the presentation of the food is beautiful and I think this is where they win. Many places these days just plop food down in front of you anddo not care about presentation. When I eat something, I feel better when it is brought to me in a beautiful way. Keep it up guys, don't ever slack on presentation cause this is where you win. Also I am a neat freak and would love to point out how clean it is here. Food was great, service was great and I only paid 9.95 for lunch :)
