My husband and I stopped in the other weekend and were very surprised with this place. They had so many different types of beer, which he loved, I on the other hand don't drink beer so I didn't get as excited as he did. I had also heard that they had the best pulled pork sandwich around so of course we had to try it. It was good I must say. I also like the feeling that I'm in a friends yard just hanging out and relaxing. This is definitely a place where we have to come back with our group of friends and brag, look what we found!
