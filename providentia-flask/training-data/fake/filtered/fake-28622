Was there for lunch..they moved recently to the Pennington Shopping center. The menu is great they still have chopped anti pasta salad. I ordered the Talapia Francaise let me say I have had Talapia a lot but never made so delicious...huge portion of fresh thick fish with a crisp delicate coating and a lemon butter sauce. It was served piping hot with a side of pencil points, another winner...They had a huge party in their Sapphire room, so I thought I was going to have to wait a long time for my entree...this was not the case..my food came in no time. The bread was also very good crusty Italian bread which they serve with seasoned olive oil...this completed an excellent meal. Thank you Diamonds you made my day!!! We already have a Sat. Night reservation.
