Stayed here with my husband and our dog. Absolutely loved it! We stayed in the Norwich room, which was adorable and modern. Our dog loved lounging on the ottomans by the big windows. Dinner was exquisite! We ended up dining there both nights as we didn't want to go anywhere else. This is a local gem and I highly recommend either dinner or a weekend getaway to the Parker House Inn!
