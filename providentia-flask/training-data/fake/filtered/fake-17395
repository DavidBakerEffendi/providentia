Day or night, this new fave has yet to fail me. From the great beer selection and genuine owners to the solid menu, every experience has been delicious and consistent. A go-to spot like this has been long overdue and welcomed with open arms to the neighborhood. I highly reco the scallops, tartes flambees and the apple crumble for dessert.
