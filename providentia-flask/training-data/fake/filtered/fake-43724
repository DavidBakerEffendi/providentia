Used to be one of my favorite restaurants that I would return to year after year for big occasions, but I went there for a birthday dinner recently and discovered that it must be under new management or something to explain a step decline in food and service. We were seated in a back room (the main reason one goes to Alta is to enjoy the open central room, which has charm) that required literally squeezing behind kitchen staff working at a counter along a wall and into a mundane room facing streetlamps with no window treatment to stop the glare. For the last 35 minutes of our meal, an annoying gentlemen hovered around us constantly checking to see if we were done yet; we felt on the clock, and sure enough, after ordering many courses and spending an exorbitant amount of money, he utlimately approached us and "offered" us drinks at the bar so he could have the table. Apparently spending a lot and eating a lot wasn't good enough to allow us to enjoy our meal at a normal pace. This is the rudest thing a restaurant can do to its customers, and I thought Alta as better than than-but alas, it Â has become just another lousy business that pushes people out of their seats in order to fill them asap. Ironically, we had just asked for the check when he approached us, and there was an empty table next to us-so the urgency was hard to understand. We ate quickly, and there was little time spent just talking and enjoying each others company, in other words, it was not as if we had finished our meal and were sitting around sipping wine for an hour. Needless to say, he sullied what should have been a relaxing birthday dinner. I definitely do not recommend this place any more. It has clearly changed, and for the worse.
