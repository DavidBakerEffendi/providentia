We went for Sunday brunch and waited over 30 minutes with a reservation. It was way too crowded. The food was decent. My friend asked for his steak medium and was given it rare. He also asked for some toasts and had to wait a while before they came. I ordered the French toast which was delicious. The waiter, however, threw my food away even though I remembered asking for it to go. Overall I think this place has one of the best French toast ever. A lot of other dishes that I have tried are just average. Don't go for Sunday brunch since it is way too crowded and thus the quality of service suffers tremendously.
