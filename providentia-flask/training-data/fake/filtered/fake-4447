Sahara Grill resembles a luncheonette, but the food is very fresh and good. The prices are very reasonable. It is located just off Broad St., so it's a good place to go for something quick and uncomplicated if you are going to a show or hanging out at the nearby bookstore.  Various types of Middle Eastern food. The baklava is small but excellent. Get two! I've eaten here about ten times. It is a very reliable place and open from 11 to 10 daily. For what it is, it's a great little place. It is almost impossible to spend over $40. A group of six sitting next to us split their bill and it costs them $10 each :)  The owner was very courteous and is a nice man. This is a good place to go even if you aren't into ethnic food. It's not heavy duty. Try it.
