I've been going to the Scuffer for years for half price burger night, best deal in town .  Not really sure how they make money doing it but , whatever works.  Anyways, I came here on a rainy Saturday night and was surprised by how busy they were.  My wife and I sat at the bar while waiting for a table.  The bartender did a decent job but he looked really busy.  He was quick to get us a round of drinks and I can appreciate that. Once we got our table the server  was fast and efficient.  I wanted to eat something other than a burger, so I went for the ribeye.  Great choice!  Cooked medium rare and the sauce was fantastic.  The sides were nothing to go nuts over but they did the trick.  My wife was happy with her salmon as well. When in Burlington for a nice night out that won't break the bank, I'll be at The Scuffer
