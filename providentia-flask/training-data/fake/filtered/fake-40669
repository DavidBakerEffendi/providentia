A real let down!!  You are definitely paying for the name.  Saw Lombardie's Pizza on one of the local food shows and couldn't wait to try it out during our first visit to NYC.  To begin with, a plain large pizza, with  8 slices runs $20.50.  It's 3 bucks a topping on top of that. We ordered a garden salad ($7.50) that came from a bag; it had 2 cherry tomatoes, onions and a sprinkle of sliced mushrooms.... very disappointing. On top of that, they don't accept credit cards; very inconvenient for us, as we don't travel with much cash. So how'd they earn their stars?  1-seated us quickly. 2- not a long wait for our food, and it was hot. 3-fresh veggies on our pizza.  Overall, an okay experience, but I've had better tasting pizza for less.
