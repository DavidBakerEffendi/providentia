Today was the last straw. I actually signed up to Yelp just to warn others about this dump. It used to be very good. Excellent actually. I can live with the Open-Pit BBQ sauce. And everything used to be great. But it has steadily gone down hill ever since the Finkel's took it over. The days of a great waitress's is gone. Replaced with teen girls who are more concerned about their smart phones than actually helping the customer. The last straw was actually the fried shrimp I ordered. I ate 3 when I decided they just didn't taste right. My wife ordered a burger well done. It had to be sent back because it was basically raw. That took 10 mins before I had to actually get up and find or waitress hidden on her phone. The burger came back and it was heated in the microwave. The bun was to hot to touch and all soggy. We got aggrivated after another 5 mins and had to get the waitress again. We asked for our bill. After 10 mins we finally received it with an attitude. We paid and left. The $10 meal we had at Wendy's was better. Like I said this place used to be great. I have been going there forever and never had a bad meal. But since John and his wife took over it is terrible. Seems they are more worried about saving money than actually offering a good product. (Maybe they need the money to pay their son's lawyer and bail bondsman). If you want ribs that taste like the Rib House used to be then go here and order this bbq sauce. Buy your own ribs and cook them yourself. openpit.com BTW I am writing this while I sit on the toilet from the bad shrimp I ate.
