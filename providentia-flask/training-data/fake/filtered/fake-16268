Two friends and I went here for lunch yesterday and had lovely, friendly service. One friend recently overhauled her diet completely and the waitress was very accommodating in terms of leaving items off her Cobb salad. She also was very knowledgeable about exactly how things were cooked and any hidden ingredients that might be in them. I have eaten here several times for lunch and have always had wonderful, cheerful service. No attitude!!!
