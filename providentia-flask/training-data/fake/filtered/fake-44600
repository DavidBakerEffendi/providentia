The warm inviting room and solicitous service belies the sloppily cooking. Creamed Cauliflower Soup paired with Sea Urchin on Brioche Croutons seems a nice idea - both ingredients should play to each other's funkiness.  Unfortunately, the cauliflower lost its character during the cooking process, so the soup ended up being a silky dull puree.  The Charcuterie was forgettable and uninspired - the pork terrine was too cold and lacked porkiness; the liver pate was a mousse than a pate; the rabbit ballotine had too many pistachio nuts.  The least appetizing dish was the Coniglio Con Olive.  For a rustic dish, the rabbit lacked character, tenderness and flavor. Granted this dish falls under the Cucina Povers menu, but that's no excuse for not oily mess that pooled in the polenta.  This was the third time dining here.  Tonight's experience corresponds to the previous two.
