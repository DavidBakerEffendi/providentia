The Falafel sandwich with the works was delish! Only $6.95 for a hearty, tasty meal. Absolutely excellent. The mint ginger lemonade was also very good. Refreshing and not too sweet. Definitely go here for a quick meal or casual dinner/lunch outside in a park. There is no true indoor seating and it's cash only.
