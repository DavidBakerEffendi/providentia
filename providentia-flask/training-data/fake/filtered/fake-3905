i don't have a single negative thing to say about this charming sandwich place. it's fantastic for lunch...and i've had quite a few that i've enjoyed. I love the rybread (yummy crabcakes) i've also had a delicious turkey one...and i'm pretty sure great roast beef...excellent chips and drinks, fast speedy super nice and personable customer service. this place makes me really happy. perfect for lunch.
