I have been there on several occasions! The staff is wonderful and friendly, my waitress took time out to explain the menu! Now to the food it was absolutely delicious very tasty! The owner came and greeted me and my family and took time out to get to know us! Â My waitresses names were named Stephanie and I believe Wendy they were so sweet! Can't wait to go back and have the ribs!
