I have heard so much about the burgers here and have been wanting to try one for quite some time. What a disappointment! The burger was overcooked, dry and tasteless and the fries were soggy and just not good. It seemed as if they had both been pre-cooked and sitting in the kitchen waiting to be served. I wouldn't have minded that it was all so over-priced if it had been excellent like I had expected.
