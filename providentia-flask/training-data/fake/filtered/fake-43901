We visited this excellent little restaurant 3 nights ago. We have lived in Philadelphia almost 3 months now and this was by far the best meal we have had yet. My steak was cooked to perfection and my wife's Burger was delicious. This is the first review I have ever written and was well worth signing up..thank you so much and we will b back soon!
