I'm never in the Park Slope area, but found myself taking a shortcut to get to where I had to go.  I was hungry and decided to pull over after Bonnie's caught my eye.  No complaints with this burger.  Nice size patty, tasty, cooked the way I ordered it, and a nice fresh roll.  Fries were also above average.  If you're looking for atmosphere go elsewhere, but if your looking for a good burger stop here.
