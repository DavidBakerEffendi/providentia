Been here a few times.  Great local Italian eatery.   The chicken marsala is my goto dish.   I gave it 3 stars because service can be very rude over the phone and they make you wait forever if you don't have a reservation. Overall pricy as well.   But good time if you have extra money to spend and you make a reservation early.
