I recently revisited this establishment for the first time in years. The first time back since it used to be Cokies. I wasn't expecting to like it but those damn cheese balls were addictive and the 4 dollar drink special (a can of black label and a shot of evans) was a pretty good deal. A good place to drink after practicing at Passout Records.
