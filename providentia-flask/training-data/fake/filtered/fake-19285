I LOVE FUN BUFFET my roomates and I frequented this lovely cheap establishment almost 3 times a week this past spring/summer as we hated cooking and cleanin in our kitchen. The coconut shrimp and salt and pepper shrimp are the only thing i get but when i decide to venture out of my norm I enjoy everthing i try. The green beans with mushrooms, the crab legs, the lo mein, the dumplings! yummy.. I think i need to take a trip here soon. Only bad thing about this place is the service. those asian refugees are evil. It pisses us off because we are there more than they are sometimes, we def. contribute to some monthly bill they pay and they never say thank you or are nice and pleasant, except for one exception the one guy that is usually at the register he's so nice and lets us sit wherever we want and hes always smilin... but whatever. just ignore the service and enjoy your food!
