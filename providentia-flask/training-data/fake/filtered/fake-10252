Came here for dinner one night with family including my cousins from Italy while giving them an NYC tour. We loved all of our food. Their specialty cocktails were creative and equally as good. Service was great and when they found out what we were there for, they brought us out complimentary oysters with a delicious dipping sauce that complimented the oysters very well. When they found out we couldn't take the tour of the Empire State Building due to a long wait, they escorted us to the rooftop with an amazing view of the building. Â It was so close, you felt like you could touch it! Overall, amazing experience and I will definitely be returning on my next trip to Manhattan. Thanks Parker & Quinn for an amazing night!
