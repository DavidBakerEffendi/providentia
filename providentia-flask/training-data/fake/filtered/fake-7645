Had this misfortune to make my first visit on a Saturday night. Food was good but service was just too slow. Real disconnect in the kitchen. I hardly ever complain but it was the manager's reaction to my comments about the service that upset me. He told me "sorry but really just chill out and people wait hours for a table on a Saturday, just chill out".  I would have chilled out if someone would have come by to fill my wine glass or if I didn't have to ask 3 different people (including the manager) for a piece of Pita bread to go along with the appetizers.  I was not hostile when I spoke to him and even said the food was good.  Very poor management/customer service skills. Plenty of other good restaurants nearby.  Don't waste your time.
