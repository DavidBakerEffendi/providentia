All the stars are earned by the beer and the brisket. Went midweek and mid-afternoon. No line and plenty of tables.  Recognize you will be eating off small metal trays with cardboard containers so this is never going to be fine dining - it's bbq. The Brisket is really good.  One of the few places in the city to get brisket like this.  The beer selection is also really good.  Stone Levitation on tap, among others plus a good bottle selection.  Go get some brisket and a craft beer and you will be happy with how you spent $16. The ribs are not good enough - not tender enough or flavorful enough to get any praise.   The sausage while tasty was very fatty and grisly (we didn't finish it).  The Pulled Pork, like the ribs, was not tender enough or flavorful enough.  Big pieces but nothing there.  Small selection of sides - beans were good but not standout, and the sweet potato casserole was almost too sweet but still tasty.  Get small sides - that is all you will need of those.
