My husband and I had dinner at Trattoria Rosa Bianca this evening. I had the risotto giardinaire . It was delicious. The risotto was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. My husband had the angiolotti with porchetta and rapieni in brodo. It had a depth of flavor that comes with using the porchetta drippings in the broth....really wonderful. The house salad was crisp, fresh and flavorful with hearty red tomatoes. The service was attentive. Â We will definitely return .
