Really Really Good! I drove with my kids from Manhattan to Brooklyn just for the pizza,, We made a day out of it... we got there at 2PM last saturday and got our pizza right before they went on a break around 4:15 The place was packed! but it was worth it... just seeing how he makes the pies was fun and then when we actually got ours the feast began. Go try it!
