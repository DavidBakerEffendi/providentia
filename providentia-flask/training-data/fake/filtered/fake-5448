This place is hands down the worst bar in Astoria.  I hate to sound brash, but more or less this entire place is just a pseudo-Williamsburg style lounge filled with sensitive hipsters and overtly flamboyant homosexuals.  They give you grief if your intention is to go there to get tipsy or if you try and hurry a female taking 30 minutes in the bathroom.  Do yourself a favor and stay away from this pretentious establishment, unless of course, you too are a pretentious wanna-be iPhone Sheeple with a mustache-tattooed finger who never drinks Bud Light and enjoys talking about purses with other men, then it's the place for you!
