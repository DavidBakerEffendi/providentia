This place really is a hidden gem.  From the looks of the place you would probably be discouraged to eat there.  It's in this old crappy strip mall next to a dirty Pathmark and K-Mart and the inside of the place is nothing to write home about but the pizza and food is amazing!  I've had all different types of pizza and sandwiches from there and have never been disappointed.  Their large pies are huge and in the same style as a traditional New York slice.  The crust is amazing and cooked to perfection with just the right amount of crispiness and they never skimp on the toppings.  They also make amazing garlic knots and cheesesteaks.  If I had to find something to complain about it is only that their menu is pretty limited and they don't deliver, otherwise perfect.  Highly recommend you go here, especially for take out.
