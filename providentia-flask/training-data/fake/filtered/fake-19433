The food at Freddy & Tony's is just plain awesome.  They give you big portions for a reasonable price.  Everything on the menu I've been able to try so far had been wonderful.  It is  hands down on of my favorite spots in Philadelphia.   The staff are very kind and sweet if you are polite.  Be respectful because they deserve it.
