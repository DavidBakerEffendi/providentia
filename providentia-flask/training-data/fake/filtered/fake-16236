Saturday night my friends and I stopped by "CAFETERIA" and we couldn't believe how snooty they were at the door, it felt more like a club scene rather than a restaurant, just as my friends and I were about to leave we noticed a manager that I had known for some time who was always amazing to my friends and I in the past.  When he saw us he immediately came running to personally escort us to a FABULOUS  table in a private room that I had never even known about!  My friends and I felt like celebrities, what a great end to the perfect night.  The food was great and I have gotten kudos from my friends for days. Thank you CAFETERIA for bringing back Jonathan, my favorite manager in New York City!!!
