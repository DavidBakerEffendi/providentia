I love modern pizza the pizza is the best it is so light, and tasty.  the service is great and people are friendly.  they make you feel like family.  the bomb is the bomb, you cant eat it too often. it is great.  There are times i would go to frank pepe's but it is out of the way and the waitress are abnoxious.  On that I will go with fModern.
