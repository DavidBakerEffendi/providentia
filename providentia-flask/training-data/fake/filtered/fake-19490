I went into the Standard Tap a few weeks ago during the 2nd Street Festival.  The bar was not particularly crowded.  There were some people sitting at the bar and a few standing.  I stood at the bar to order a drink, holding money in my hand.  Several minutes passed as I watched the bartenders serve other patrons that had just walked in and then the bartenders convened in the corner talking to each other.  Feeling ignored I held up my hand to get the bartender's attention.  One of the bartenders approached me and said "Don't wave money at me, I'm not a whore."  Naturally I walked out of the bar, never to return.  I guess I wasn't attractive or hip enough to get served.
