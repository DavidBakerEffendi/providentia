I can't stomach soy sauce, so I didn't come here for the hibachi. I don't drink, so I can't comment on the alcohol. I came during lunch so maybe it's different around dinnertime. My co-workers came here for a good-bye lunch, so my friend/co-worker wanted to come back. We both opted for the bento lunch, she with the chicken teriyaki & I with the shrimp teriyaki. The amount of food was impressive & soooo delicious. I love tempura so I'm happy they gave me a nice amount, not 2 pieces like some restaurants. Perhaps it was because there were few other patrons at 1pm, but the two waiters were very nice & very attentive without hovering. (It's also a plus that one wascute! ^^)
