Quality control sucks. Just bought an over cooked hamburger that did not contain the correct additional ingredients. Called to let them know but left hanging on the phone for eight minutes when I hung up. on During my previous visit the person handling the money with gloves then handled the food. Too many mistakes to be a reliable quality food joint.
