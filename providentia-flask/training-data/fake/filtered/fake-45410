I held my son's Christening brunch at SoCo and it was an amazing experience from the time we arrived to the moment we left. Everything was very organized and the staff was VERY accommodating to a group of 15ppl and 4 kids. Our meals all arrived on time and our waiter was always around to provide additional service. Like the service, the decor is AMAZING and very trendy not very typical for Brooklyn. Â I will without a doubt return here for a fun adult night.....
