This was by far the worst restaurant, this place has the worst customer service and the manager needs to get fired. Last night I went for my sister's birthday we made reservations for 7pm and didn't get our food until 9pm first of all and second of all my sisters dish was the last one to come out. When she asked the manager to take it off the check due to arriving so late the manager refused. This place has ants and nats flying around . The only good thing was out waitress for the night was Chrissy she was very sympathetic and apologetic. Before I forget some our friends didn't receive their food and the chief claims that he made it and wanted to still charge them for it no bueno
