As a foodie, I love this place. In addition to the burgers with their special sauce, they constantly change up the weekend specials with interesting creations. They've featured 'pork jowl' sandwiches, smoked blue fish sandwiches, not-your-average ham salad sandwiches and not only that, but the toppings they pair them with are cool as well; many of them homemade creations (i.e., their own bacon). Note: If you are watching what you eat, you will have a hard time finding something here. Plus, I think they're BYOB, which is always nice.
