My friend and I decided to give this place a try because it is a well known soul food restaurant.  We arrived around 8pm and they were not crowed. I ordered bbq ribs with a side of fries and corn and my friend just got some wings since he was not that hungry.  After placing our orders, I went to the restroom to wash my hands and when I returned, our food was on the table.  I literally just took two minutes.   I looked at my friend and said 'how is it possible for our orders to be ready in such little time? I knew something was not right because my ribs looked like they have been sitting for some time.  The ribs did not look fresh.  The bbq sauce was gooey and the ribs tasted awful. I couldnt take another bite.   Okay at least the fries must be good I thought.  Wrong! The fries tasted awful as well.  Ended up eating some of my friends wings which were alright.  Worst I have ever had!
