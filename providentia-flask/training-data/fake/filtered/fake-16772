So, I was skeptic to come here based on the reviews about service I read (my biggest pet peeve is crap service!) but nevertheless, I had to try these spicy rubbed wings I've heard so much about. Although I came in with the attitude that I was about to get the crap service that i loathe and have read about on here, I was pleasantly suprised. My server's name was Marielle and she was very kind and knowledgeable (good beer recommendations to go with the spicy wings). Not only was she nice to look at, she was super attentive to our table even though I could tell that she had quite a few other tables. The food was excellent. The wings were everything I heard about and more, washed down with cold beer. My friend got the Guac burger and he said it was awesome as did his girlfriend. The salads were huge and fairly priced (a lot of meat and good quality veggies!). Sorry to say it, but my experience at Devil's Alley was a good one, folks. You must have gone on an off day for service? I will indefinitely go here again, request the adorable server I had, drink beer and eat wings.
