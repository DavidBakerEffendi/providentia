I grew up in Montreal, which also has a large number of Italian eateries and people.  Stores like this gives me no regret being a reborn New Yorker.  Lombardi's pizza is, by far, the best I've ever had and I have to come back at least 100 more times before my days are over! The service is very fast, and the prices are not over-exagerrated, unlike many other top-rated restaurants in NY.  Great selection of toppings and the cheese is superb! If you are in the mood for the authentic/traditional Italian pizzeria, with mouthwatering taste, leaving you dying for more, then this place is for you. I guarantee that you will say "hmmmmmm" after each bite. If you're into "quantity over quality", don't really pay attention to details, and want to stuff your face for cheap, then you're better off sticking to Domino's. however, you would be missing something heavenly.  The place has been around since 1905 and I can see why!
