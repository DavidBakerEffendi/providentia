They put eggs on my vegan sandwich. And because it was filled with egg, they didn't put much else on it so after waiting 20 minutes for it and walking back to work (another 15 minutes), i have two pieces of bread for lunch. For most, its not an option to 'go back and get another or ask them to fix it', we have fixed lunch hour breaks so there's not much to do but realize you wasted around $10.00 on nothing. I understand it gets busy, but invest in a second person to confirm the order and to hand out the food while one person takes the order and payment. It'll streamline the process and hopefully you'll have less disgruntled customers. Since I still taste remnants of egg on my sandwich (after removing them carefully), I will not be coming back.
