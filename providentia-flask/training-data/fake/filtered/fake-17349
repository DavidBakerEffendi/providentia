I eat here on a consistent basis and I have to say it is some solid sushi. The owner (Kelvin) Â has completely changed the whole establishment and put a lot of effort in the renovation. Kelvin is one of the nicest guys around and will go as far as honoring a misunderstanding. I tend to order here (and many people from the local Verizon) about 3-5 times a week and we are never disappointed. The ginger sauce on their salad is home made and pretty much unrivaled. Rolls are incredibly fresh as is the fish used. The size of the rolls is pretty decent and the specialty rolls are inspired. Def try the miso soup.
