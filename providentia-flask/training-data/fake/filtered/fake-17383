Best place in town for pizza and the Italian food is better than I expected, especially for a pizza place. The Pasta Primavera and Eggplant Rollatini are my two favorite dishes, and the strawberry vinaigrette dressing on their salads is delicious. The Vodka slices and buffalo chicken are my favorite slices. Always enjoy and the employees are great
