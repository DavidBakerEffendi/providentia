This place is a must go if you want a burger near this area & reading terminal is not open. I should admit that philly cheese steak at reading terminal is a must go when it is open. However, if you are late like 7pm - 2AM, this is a second best option even with friendly budget. I had 1 single burger with every veggie, 1 regular fries, and 1 junior cup custard. I did not know and did not ask for it, but they gave me a promotional free junior cup custard.(I did not choose any toping.) The whole meal was $7.50. With a price of regular McDonald's value meal, I got a much nicer burger & fries. I love their nice and thin bun with low carb, and their fries are so yummy (haha potato has lots of carb to compensate low carb bun). I visited there at 12am, and the cashier or manager was super friendly. You can expect to have a personal communication there. Will visit again!
