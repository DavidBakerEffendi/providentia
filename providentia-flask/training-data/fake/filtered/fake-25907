One best places in the Iron Bound, the service is excellent and the food is top notch.  The prices are a little high, but you get what you pay for.  The portions are very big, and the salad and fresh bread is excellent. The shrimp in garlic sauce is very good, as well as their steak. Gets pretty bush during weekends and even for a late lunch.
