Chicken Bella Bucca.  Need I say anymore? This is a special place to my husband and I.  The food is delish and the service is good.  I prefer the Phill, Italian mama/aunt taking your order.  The server explained what was in the Chicken Bella Bucca and told me that if I got it and didn't like it, she would eat it for me, as it is one of her favorites.  Now, I'm a red gravy kind of girl - and lots of it, but this sauce was A-MAZ-ING!  Home made pasta, good gravy - haven't tried their meatballs, but after reading what everyone else wrote, I'm inclined to order that next time.  Dante & Luigi's used to be my favorite, and I still enjoy their wide-ribbon / crab pasta dish, but VDR is now my new favorite.  I think part of it is the people who work there.  It does feel like a family home, and I like that.  I don't need that fancy crapola on the walls or expensive looking furniture.  It's home. I love South Philly.  I really do.  It's a drive from Lancaster to Philly for us, but it is so well worth it.  The people, the atmosphere, the food, the gravy, the bread, Isgro's, Di Bruno, Villa de Roma, Talluto's - and Anthony's coffe house.  Plus, people down here know how to spell our last name.   This Irish-girl, married to an Italian boy is in heaven whenever we get to South Philly.  Life is Good.
