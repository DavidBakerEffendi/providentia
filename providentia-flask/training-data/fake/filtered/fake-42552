After placing a reservation, my friend and I went to the Moshulu on a recent weekend evening.  I loved the atmosphere as soon as I walked in the door. When it was time to be seated, the hostess was leading my friend and I to a back room, at which time I asked to be seated in the more forward section where I saw a number of empty tables for two. When I was told about balancing seating for the waitpersons, I said ok and proceeded to the back even though I was not happy with the seating.  Within minutes, two White men were seated in the area I requested.  Then another White couple and another.  Meanwhile I, a Black woman and my friend, a White man, began to notice the disproportionate numbers of Black people along with another integrated couple that were also seated in this back area, which was looking more and more like the non-White area. I became more and more angry, but it wasn't until another Black group were seated that my friend said, "You are right!" The food was good, but I could not enjoy it. And, while I went up front and said something to the hostess, I truly regret that I did not ask to speak to the manager or just leave.  Another lesson learned.
