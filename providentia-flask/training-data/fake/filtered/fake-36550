Called for take out and was told 15 minutes, came within 20 minutes and waited another 45 minutes. The staff was so cold with their apology. Â My food was horrible, the ribs tasted pre-cooked, take sweet out of sweet potatoes because they tasted like water with marshmallows, cannot come up with words to describe the collard greens and the banana pudding if you wanna call it that was cookies with baby food!
