If you like dive bars you'll like Dingo's. I do like dive bars, so it works out well. It's generally a rock/metal/goth/whatever place, so don't come in dressed like it's date night or you might end up complaining like some of the other reviewers. Everything's kind of old and kind of crappy, but it's not very expensive to have a few drinks. It's cool that they keep the pool table in the back room away from the bar. There's enough space so peopl aren't tripping over each other and hitting each other with sticks.
