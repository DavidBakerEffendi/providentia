A great date place!  The thing to get here is the flammy.  Super duper thin crust 'pizza' with your choice of toppings.  We got the jardin with caramelized onions, tomatoes and shrooms with emmental cheese.  You pick it up like pizza but the flavors are not italian, there is no pizza sauce or mozz cheese.  I could easily eat one myself, but we wanted desert so we split the jardin along with a green salad so we could also indulge in the banana split flammy.  the green salad was just ok, the house dressing is delicious but the salad itself was just chopped lettuce with a couple tomato wedges..  What I also like about this place is they offer wine by the 1/4l and 1/2l carafe.   Overall, La tarte Flambee is a fun tasty place to go.  They take reservations and I would recommend making one unless you are coming on the early side.
