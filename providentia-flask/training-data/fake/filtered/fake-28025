Does anybody know a REAL Spanish restaurant in Philadelphia?  Went to Amada last night (Thursday); won't be back.  It is not elegant Spanish dining and not as much fun as your local venta or tapa bar (I lived in S. Spain for many years).  This place looks like it is a hang-out for young urbans who have never experienced Spanish culture.  Only had to wait a couple of minutes for a table.  Noise level was like being in a speeding subway train; no way to have a conversation and it was hard to hear the waiter.  The print on the menu is too small and faint to read comfortably in the dim lighting conditions.  Decor is Modern-Minimal, not much atmosphere. Odd linear bench seating; you feel crammed in like a lunch counter.  We were late customers and felt like the waiter was rushing a little and learned that the cuisina closed at 11:00; not very Spanish.  No way of knowing portion size, making it hard to order.  The portions were small and pricey.  Bar service was quick and excellent - I ordered a NOT dry martini and it was perfect.  Wine selection was good but no big names in the sherry list (eg., no San Patricio).   The food is very good but totally non-authentic European Spanish.  The churizo could have passed for thin sliced Genoa salami.  Recommend the garlic shrimp, artichokes, and the beef brochettas.  Best was the pimientas fritas, although I would have preferred the Spanish (not New World (hot)) version - just long pimientas fried in olive oil and garlic, then given a little sea salt.   Valet parking was quick and efficient.
