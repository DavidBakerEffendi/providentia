I walked in here with my friend yesterday for lunch.  I was really overwhelmed when I walked in by all of the lunch crowd in such a tiny space.  We both ordered the cuban sandwich and finally sat down...it was the best cuban sandwhich I have ever had.  I was worried it would be greasy/heavy as some reviewers have said...but I think it was perfect.  I want to go back and try everything on the menu! Definitely a lunch must if you work mid town. And don't even get me started on the cafe con leche.
