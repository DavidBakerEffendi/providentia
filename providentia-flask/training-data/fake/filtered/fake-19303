1) $9 VERY SMALL glass of shitty Syrah 2) Devil Eggs- $3 for 3. Not all that expensive in the grand scheme of things, but they were pretty mediocre. I've had better deviled eggs at work potlucks and family bbqs. 3) Veggie Burger (of the black bean variety). This was not well cooked and not well formed. There was nothing in it to hold it together. It was essentially a scoop of mushy black bean pudding on a roll. For $9, I think it would be an OK value if it didn't taste like shit. You can add cheddar for $3, which I think is outrageous.  Come on, Garces...  Vegetarians have taste buds too.  A scoop of refried black beans on a roll does not make a veggie burger. 4) Tator Tots. $3 for a small bowl. Not a terrible value, but they were bland and greasy.  You can yuppify Americana supermarket comfort food all you want, but that doesn't make it good. With all this being said, my server was polite and friendly, and the food came out quickly.  The actual space is quite lovely, and I had zero wait for a table for 2 at 5:20 PM on a Friday.
