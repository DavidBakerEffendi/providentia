Macaron Heaven. Simply the best anywhere, every time. The only reason this Laduree has less than 5 stars is that I wish they had more of a selection of the other amazing pastries like the ones they serve in France. Good news for all Laduree fans: They are opening a full tea house downtown next year. Tre magnifique!
