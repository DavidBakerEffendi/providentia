The atmosphere and service was incredible. Â The food was delicious but not as good as I hoped. I started with lobster soup which was good but not great. The lamb chops were delicious but slightly underdone for my taste. However the glaze was thoroughly satisfying and made up for it. Dessert which was a dense chocolate ganache was just ok. Once again the servers were very attentive and made my party feel welcome and well cared for. It was expensive. Would I go back? Probably but mainly to try the other items on the menu.
