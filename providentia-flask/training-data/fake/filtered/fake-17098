Incredible place! A beautiful, warm, atmosphere. My first evening in New York, and have to say I had one of the best dinners! We got here a little early but they still seated us. The waiter Arben was wonderful. He made our night! Everything we ordered for dinner was first rate! The flavors were so intense, complex and superb! The service was top notch! Great suggestion on the wine. I would highly recommend this place!
