Had a great visit with 4 of us family members for an anniversary. Really enjoyed the atmosphere and the staff was very friendly. Have to say we all felt the food was excellent. We had apps of Ahi Tuna and Curry tenderloin tips, both were very tasty. 2 of us had to have the Shepard's pie and ate every drop and one other great mention was the Horseradish encrusted beef. Truly enjoyed our meals. Great selection of beers on tap. Looking forward to going back!!
