Been here many times. I love the beer. The selection is always very interesting. I love the buffalo wings and weve been in for brunch many times. The benedicts are hit or miss, but the biscuits n gravy are killer! Â  The bald guy in the kitchen does always look pissee though. Maybe someone needs to tell him that the kitchen is open and he can be seen.
