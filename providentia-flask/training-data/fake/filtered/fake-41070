This is the absolute, best pizza I have ever had in my life!  It was unbelievably delicious!  My husband and I took a trip to NY last year and was told by my sister to go here.  We weren't disappointed. We were seated in the back, by the back/side door.  It was a hot lovely day in October, and they had the big window open.  We came for lunch, and had the back area to ourselves at first.  A nice breeze coming in through the window, an ice cold beer, and a fabulous slice of heaven!  I'll take two please, maybe more!   The view outside was nothing short of feeling like we were in the middle of Italy!  Even the UPS driver we saw making a delivery was talking in Italian to the local guys outside.   Can't wait to go back to NY, if anything, for Lombardi's pizza!  Hey, we need you guys in Seattle too!  You bring the pizza, I'll bring you business! :)
