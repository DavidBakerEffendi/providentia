Stopped by this quaint, clean, and updated eatery.  I was suprised how good the food tasted.  I felt like someone personally cooked my beef brisket platter just for me.  I really loved the personal touch of my homemade biscuit.  My brisket was smoked to perfection, and I had to ask the owner if they had a smoker in there establishment. If you are looking for a home cooked meal that is of great quality and little price. Visit the nosh borough!
