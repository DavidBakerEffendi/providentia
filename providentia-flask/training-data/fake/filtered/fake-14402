I approve. I had beef tacos and the beef was succulent, tender and juicy. YUMMY!! Not to mention, the tacos al pastor were similarly amazing, and they were served with pieces of grilled pineapple like you can find on the streets of Mexico. If you want authentic Mexican food, come here. It's reasonably priced and overwhelmingly real.
