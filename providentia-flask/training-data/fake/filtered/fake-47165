When I have gone to a restaurant and I have had a poor experience I try to go at least one more time to give the place a second chance.  The first time I went here my friend and I got seated quickly which was nice since it was busy but  after sitting at the table for 30min. and only given bread we left. We attempted to flag someone down but no one noticed.       My second time there was a little better but the three things that make this second experiences bad would be for starters I had not been there in 4 years and nothing had really changed. From an appearance level the place still looked the same and since it had a name change they just slapped a sticker over the front sign and on the menu, which showed  me that the menu did not really change. The same rickety tables and chair were there as well as the bread container that was brought to the table and the way the bread tasted I would not be surprised if it was the same bread from 4 years ago.        Secondly, my friend and I ordered Mediterranean Platter as an appetizers. I have had plenty of Mediterranean food in the past and let me tell you, this was disgusting, it tasted like someone duped an ash tray in the food.  When I got my lamb kabobs, they tasted off. I felt so discussed I just wanted to leave. The sever although was very nice and very apologetic for my food but he did not do anything to try and remedy the situation.         Lastly, to top it all off the following day I just did not feel right to put it lightly. Then the day after that I really really got sick. Bad enough I had to call out of work for two days and go to the doctors. Sadly it took me a couple weeks to feel right again. To sum it all up, I would not risk giving this place a third chance not even to try the hookah.
