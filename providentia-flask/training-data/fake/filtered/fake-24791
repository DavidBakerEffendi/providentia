I went here for a casual dinner with two friends. We went in at 7, were seated right away. Very attentive service from the owner and our waiter. OH the food...the food. I would eat here every day if I could. I had the spinach salad, which was nice and fresh, the ravioli with butter and sage, excellent and a good portion, and for dessert...simply the BEST Panna Cotta I have ever had. No hint of chewy exterior, just perfect custard. Also the coffee is strong and not too bitter. Portions were good, we all cleaned our plates and left perfectly full. Prices are outstanding, no pasta is over $12 True, the wait can be long. A hint? Get there before 7pm and you will have no problems. It can be a bit noisy at times, but we had no difficulties hearing each other. Cute interior and candle light make this a good cheap date spot. I can't wait to go again!!
