New addition for my dine-out-destination reservoir. It quite small for restaurant, but overall for food wise, this place is a good place to dine-out. Â Me and my GF don't know what to order and we decided to choose from fellow yelper suggestion. Their home-made meatball is MUST, it so tasty, tender and yet yummy. Then, we tried their "Beef LOK-LAK" its a bit too strong for me when dip in sour sauce, but we ate it without the sauce. we heard their mussels is popular, but we'll try it for later visit. Overall it was a great dine-out and We will come back.
