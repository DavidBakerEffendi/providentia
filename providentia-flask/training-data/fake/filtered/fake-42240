My husband loves all things pig (I do not) and has been yearning to try Traif - we went last night and it was phenominal.  Just an all around great meal.  The stand-out dish is the calamari - with the brocoli rabe a close second. The ribs and sliders were super - the only dish that didn't hold up was the corncake and shrimp (the hot and cold in one bite bothered me) but it didn't really matter because it was good - and the full meal was something that does williamsburg proud.  Traif has a lot of tough competition and it is at the front of the pack - oh and the rude little pig cocktail, replete bacon rimmed glasses - is superb! It was too muggy for the garden, but it was gorgeous.  Run, don't walk.
