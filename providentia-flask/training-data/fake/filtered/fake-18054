Be prepared to wait at least an hour. The food may be Â worth the wait, but it is something to consider before coming. Come to think of it, it may be a good idea to come famished after all. The burger is not to be matched. It is worth every penny. I am a purist and go with your standard cheddar cheese burger. I went with a medium rare burger. The pickled beets are unreal. I could go with 2 or more servings. I loved the duck fat potatoes, but I am a lush to say the least.
