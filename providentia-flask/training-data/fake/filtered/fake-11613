We ordered some sandwiches, salads, and pasta to our office for lunch on short notice, and the staff was very friendly and came through!  When we did get the food, it was amazing: the ingredients were all extremely fresh, taste was great, and the most importantly extremely filling.  Would recommend this to anyone looking for a great meal!
