I drove from Wisconsin and I am very very satisfied with TT Skewer. The skewers are so tender and juicy that i can feel the lamb/beef melting in my mouth. Moreover, the lamb/beef is magically preprocessed so that the skewers are very tasty even deep inside the lamb/beef chops. Also, this place is ideal for meat lovers like me coz I can enjoy varieties of skewers with unbelievably low price. Another highlight in TT Skewer is hot pot bowl. I found tons of things that I can put in my hot pot. My favorite includes cabbage, fish ball, tofu and seaweed knots. In sum, I wish I could move to Philadelphia and come here whenever I want. One thing for sure, I'll be back!
