My cousins told me they LOVE Burrito box so I was excited to try it, but boy was I disappointed! My boyfriend and I ordered 3 different types of soft tacos. Â The spinach one was ok, the chilli con carne was greasy but had some flavor and the bbq chicken was FLAT out disgusting. DO NOT ORDER the bbq chicken. The tacos had lettuce that was soggy and fell apart. The guacamole was just ok. The chips were stale. I see many people like this place, so maybe they had a bad day...but I will never go back there. Really cheap, crappy, flavorless mexican food. The service was the only good thing...fast!
