I love this place! I probably go to Caseus about 3 times a month and I have had some great dining experiences.  My go-to foods? Definitely the mac and cheese, the mussels, poutine, and the duck egg salad. I always get a cheese board, which delights me each time. It is so funny to read the reviews about their dining area, because I love sitting upstairs at the high tables, even with 2 others.  It is small, but nice.  I was with a large party and they set us up in the cheese shop.  We had a blast.  They did our menu family style, which we loved. I love Caseus because I can wear my jeans, my sweatshirt, or my business suit from work.  I know I will get fresh, high-quality food every time.  Most of the time the service is great and the servers are fun and into food (my last visit, i had a guy named tim who was amazing) Caseus is my favorite place in New Haven.
