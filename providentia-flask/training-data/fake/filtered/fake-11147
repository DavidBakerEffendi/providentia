Horrible experience. High prices with terrible customer service. I am willing to pay more for better products but if something doesn't work and I have had it less than a week I expect to be able to return it, unfortunately, this was not the case. I do not appreciate being told that the malfunction is my own fault when I have had a product less than a week and never actually used it! Be careful what you purchase! I will not be going back to Eataly and do not recommend it to anyone. The same products and good food can be found elsewhere at a lesser cost.
