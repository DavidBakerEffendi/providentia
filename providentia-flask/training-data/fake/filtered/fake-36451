We are Spanish, so we have an idea of what a tapa is.  Normally, one orders tapas as one wishes and wines and beers as the different tastes arrive.  The waiter told us this was impossible. The waiter told us that we have to make the entire order at once because the kitchen will not accept later orders.  He was totally unfamiliar with Spanish cuisine and had an indifferent attitude rather than one that was friendly and service-oriented.  He did not know the Spanish wines at all.  Other wait-persons also seemed unhappy and responded in an uninformed way to our questions.  The main ingredient in all of the food was grease.  The Spanish use plenty of olive oil, but in a judicious way.  They use very little salt and provide nuanced flavoring with spices and especially garlic and Spanish paprika.  Such was not the case at Casa Mono where subtlety does not seem to be familiar.  The patatas bravas were particularly poor, mushy and oily with almost no "brava".  The sepia was the only dish that was well-prepared.  But, the prices are also disproportionate to the low quality, very expensive, typically $10-18 with a recommendation that they give of a minimum of 4 platitos.  This was a very disappointing experience.  My guess is that those who are impressed are totally unfamiliar with good and creative Spanish tapas (and also quality service).  Finally, the tables are crunched together so that as the waiters try to get around you and the adjacent tables, they must constantly excuse themselves and press against the backs of the chairs.  No wonder they are so grumpy.  The interior of the restaurant is closer to "hole in the wall" than to comfortable and aesthetically pleasing.  As New Yorkers with homes in Madrid and Barcelona, we were very disappointed with the cuisine, service, atmosphere and prices.  What a disaster with third class food and first class prices.
