If you are looking for a good burger go elsewhere..this place is not worth the money or hassle. First, got seated and then ignored for twenty minutes. Received no silverware, napkins, and when we put in our order for drinks those did not come until another twenty mins. They ran out of certain food..she gave me the wrong drink..and then to top it off the wrong bill...we were also charged twice because of her giving us the wrong bill which was a move of pure stupidity. When I called back..the manager SARAH basically said 'oh this happens a lot..but sorry I can't release your wrongfully billed money to you' , so my wife and I had to sick our bank on them. NO LIBS is a terrible place for comfortable dining w/o hassle...DO NOT GO TO PYT!!!!!
