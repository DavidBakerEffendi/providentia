Even though they were closing shortly after we arrived the service was friendly and efficient which I always appreciate.   There is something about their hummus that is to die for; plenty of roasted garlic and perfectly nutty and smooth chickpeas purreed into creamy perfection. The atmosphere felt very warm and cozy, which made me feel at home. There was a recipe box next to our table with old cut out newspaper recipes.   Charming and delicious.
