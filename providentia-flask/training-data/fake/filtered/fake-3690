I agree. I thought it was a cute place, especially the outside patio-but the entire experience is just so disappointing. The food is average italian & is WAY over-priced. It's also always a line (I don't know why) & it's incredibly noisy inside-I could barely talk to my family. The staff was not very quick or friendly as well. Although I want to like this place, I simply can't because I am paying way too much money for an experience that's not worth it.
