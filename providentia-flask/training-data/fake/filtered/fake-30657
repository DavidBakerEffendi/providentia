A graceful balance of ease and elegance, The Pickled Heron serves delicious and satisfying locally-sourced food in a lovely atmosphere.  Everything I had was fantastic, but you know what surprised me the most?  The spinach salad with flatbread, which was superbly fresh and flavorful.  The handmade bread and butter were also exceptional.  I left full, happy, and eager to return again!
