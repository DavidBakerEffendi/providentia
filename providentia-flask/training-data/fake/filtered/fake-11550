TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE SUMS IT UP! My guest and I walk in, it is a Wednesday at 5:45 and from the kitchen is loud spanish music playing. I ask our server about the music and she says it is "for the workers". That should have been the red flag to walk out. Are there hispanics cooking my Thai food? Stupid us stayed and placed our order. Shared dumplings for an app, they were ok, nothing great nothing bad. She had Pad Thai........chicken was DRY, no peanuts, no tofu and red onions in it?!?!?!? I don't even know if it was Pad Thai. I had a Spicy Chicken off the special border. It should have been renamed Bland Chicken and the special was UNspecial. When we asked the waitress about the issues with the Pad Thai she said "all places make it different". Whatever! DO NOT GO HERE!
