The Moshulu is a wonderful place to dine.  I went with my husband and another couple. Well, the four of us spent our drive home talking about how great the food was.  It was amazing, we ordered different meals for dinner and dessert.  We will all go back.  We had a terrific experience, both service and food were outstanding!
