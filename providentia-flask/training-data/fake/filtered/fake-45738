Seriously....not the worst place to get something to eat I guess but definitely not worth my $8.00 for a turkey sandwich. Dunkin Donuts fills the void in my stomach for $3.29 (chicken salad on bagel). I guess its the executives types around here that make 100k+ that dont mind paying through the nose for average food. Sorry Piccolo, I wont be back.
