First off, because my theory is that half the guys on here are just looking for decent date spots, this is an excellent first date spot. It's very small, it's not loud, and it's relatively classy at a very decent price; if you're like me and worry more about first-date logistics than the date itself, this is perfect. Plus, not that this is news, but girls love sushi. And you can get a big plate and share it with her, and it's a whole thing, and there are plenty of bars around so it's a solid jump-off point. Duh. Moving on. Only four stars because the sushi is good, not great - agree with other reviews saying the simpler, cheaper rolls are better than the specialty selection. Service is excellent, and ignore earlier reviews mentioning BYOB - you can get beer and wine there now. Looking forward to going back!
