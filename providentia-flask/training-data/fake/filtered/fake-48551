Amazing food and BYOB!!! You cant beat that! Its a small family owned restaurant Â and the staff is just soo nice. They have an entire vegetarian menu with soo many options! I've gone multiple times and the food is just as amazing, never had a experience there. Just a warning though, the hot is really really hot...the medium is still hot. I recommend this place to everyone.
