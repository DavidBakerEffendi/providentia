Claire's is always a faithful stop for fabulous vegan food.  I like the vibe, but I never go during peak hours as it's chaotic when it's crowded.  I've never tried their desserts, but all the mexican options, the smoothies, the pancakes, and the soups are so good - right down to the giant fluffy rolls that come right out of the oven.  It's not cheap, but when has organic vegetarian/vegan food ever been easy on the wallet - even in the grocery store?  Worth it.   I'm surprised to see so many bad reviews.  Perhaps people aren't used to the way vegan food tastes?
