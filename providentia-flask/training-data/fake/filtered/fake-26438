I went to park with my husband for Sunday brunch. We had made a reservation, and were seated right away at a table on the sidewalk. It's such a nice location, right across the street from Rittenhouse Square. The food was excellent - I got scrambled eggs with toast and potatoes, and we split the frites. The frites are SO GOOD. I would mostly recommend for pairs, since the tables on the sidewalk are all for two.
