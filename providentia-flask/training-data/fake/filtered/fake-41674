I love this place! Every Mon-Friday they have a lunch special from 12PM-3PM, any two rolls for $5 ! I am more of a plain sushi person, so I can't give a review on all of there sushi. But their Chicken tempura, sushi tempura, vegetable, california and spicy tuna rolls have always been on point and always satisfy my cravings! It is a smaller restaurant, so its more for smaller groups. The service is VERY fast, you will probably only wait ten minutes at the most for your food. The customer service is great. The workers are a family (Husband, Wife and Son) and although they are a bit quiet, they are very friendly. I go in quite often for their lunch specials and ever since the first time I told them what I do and don't like, they remember, and I am always satisfied. Great place to get great sushi at a great price!
