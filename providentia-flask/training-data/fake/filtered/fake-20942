jI love the pork sandwich here!  It's got incredible flavor with the sweet (the pork), the salty (the sauce) and the sour (pickled veggies).  And the price is very reasonable!  The sandwich is bigger than most plain sandwiches that you get at a regular deli but there is just so much more involved with these vietnamese sandwiches and it costs less.  I would definitely recommend this place for banh mi sandwiches.
