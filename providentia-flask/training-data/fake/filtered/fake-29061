Take your money elsewhere. The sandwich is tiny for banh mi standards and at a whopping $6.75-7.00, it's definitely pricey. They are stingy with the ingredients and the bread overpowers the rest of the flavors. Check out Banh Mi Saigon, Nicky's, or Paris Sandwich.... who all have much cheaper, bigger (about twice the size), and tastier sandwiches. There's absolutely nothing special about this place and the only reason it might stay open is its strategic location. DEFINITELY not worth it.
