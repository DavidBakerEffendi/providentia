Oh Dar how I love thee...let me count the ways 1) For your tabouli so fresh and so tastey 2) For your bread so light and so flakey 3) For you hummus that will never be wasted 4) For the hot manager who sadly is taken I can't get enough of all that you have, I'll come back for more as much as I can! I'm obviously not a poet but damn the food is so good I couldn't help myself. This is the first review I've ever written. Great addition to the neighborhood!
