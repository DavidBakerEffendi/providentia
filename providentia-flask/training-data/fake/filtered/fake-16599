Let me start by saying I am Italian so I know an authentic italian meal when I taste one,  this place is remarkable, I got their bus card from the fresh pasta place next door and after reading countless great reviews I went to have dinner with with my BF, he is french (and very picky)....and even he thought  IT WAS AMAZING!!!!!!!!! FOOD, SERVICE, ATMOSPHERE, I felt like we were not even in New York. Whomever reads this has to stop by for a bite, you will not regret it.  FANTASTIC. After being in New york for ten years it was so nice to sit down to a meal with people that actually served you as though you were family. WOW.
