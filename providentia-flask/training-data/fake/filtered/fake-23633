Very good food.  The herring appetizer was delicious.  So were the cheeseburgers, deviled eggs (tiny portion, though), calf's liver.  Also, who charges $7 for a Pork Slap?  I mean, really.  It's like $7 for a six pack. On to the bad stuff... Cramped seating.  Very impolite waitresses.  The worst part was that you have to order ALLLLLL the food at once, so don't even think of having someone meet you part way through.  Had a birthday party with four people.  The table next to us opened up, so two friends who were waiting outside came to join us for dinner/drinks.  However, even though they could sit, they could not order food.  So, the Spotted Pig lost out on a potential $200 added to our bill. In addition, the waitresses were very unaccomodating and nasty.  If I am going to drop a bunch of money on dinner/drinks for a few people, I am going to do it somewhere I can hope to be treated with a modicum of respect.  I rather go to a ludicrous place like Masa. Service - shite. Food - great. Vibe - bourgeois bohemian bullcrap. Overall - not worth it.
