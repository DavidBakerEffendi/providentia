Had super expectations as the restaurant was highly rated. Took family for a celebratory dinner after a trip abroad. We were over charged and had to question the waiter. To add insult to injury, my son, my wife and I all came down with diarrhea sometime after midnight, necessitating a run to the pharmacy for Immodium AD and pepto-bismol. I mean I just came from a trip from Africa and despite eating street food, I never caught anything. One day back in the US,  diarrhea galore. Oh the irony.. one of the meats might have gone bad, as we all ate meat except my daughtet, who refused to eat the meat and she was fine. Totally disappointed..  check your meats before serving your customers... first time visitor. ..never going back...
