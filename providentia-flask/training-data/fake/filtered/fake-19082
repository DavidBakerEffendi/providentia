We hired All La Cart to cater my wedding shower and it was great! The owners are lovely people and they ran a great food truck. The food was tasty and everyone at the party thought it was a great and unique way to make a party extra fun! If you like typical cook-out food, and are looking for a unique way to cater a party, you've found the right people! Thanks again for making my shower so fun!
