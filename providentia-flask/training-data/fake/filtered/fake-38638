The Town Diner replaces several other restaurants that were in this location.  I went with little expectation but was greatly surprised.  Not only was the meal (early birds 'til 5:30 pm) quite economical, but the food was very high quality.  I especially enjoyed their pasta sauce which was as good as any I have ever tasted at restaurants that charge 5 times the price. OK, maybe my sister's pasta sauce is better, but not by much.  One of the desert options (included with early bird) was a fresh fruit cup that was delicious and bountiful.
