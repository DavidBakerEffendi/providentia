Raymond's is my favorite restaurant in Montclair. It's great for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but my fave is definitely brunch! The french toast is TO DIE FOR!  So is the eggs benedict.  We always get these two dishes and share them.  Seriously - GOOD FOOD! I love Raymond's and it will always be our "go to" place. All of our out of town friends request a visit to Raymond's.  The decor is beautiful, the people are nice, and the food is superb. You can't get better than that.
