a great view will only get you so far. we were willing to wait, and wait we did. we ordered a combo which consists of some lobster, crab legs and jonah crabs. as a starter we got raw oysters. we were warned that there would be a wait by the waiter, which was fine. we could not eat half of the oysters because they looked like mush and not like oysters. i have never let an oyster go to waste but we were just scared to eat them. we didnt want to complain so we just left them and went on with our meal. when our main course we were told, as they put the plate in front of us that they had replaced our jonah crabs with some small little crappy crabs that actually looked inedible. no one asked us if we were ok with the replacement, no one gave us a chance to change our order, or give our input, they just brought us whatever they felt like replacing it with. the replacement was just really poor quality and it was not what we had askes for, so it was really disappointing. poor service , poor food, just not worth it.
