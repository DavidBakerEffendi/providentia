I've spent more time at the bar then I have in the back and each time I try a new cocktail. They have some talented mixoligists. The crowd at the bar is always interesting. Some nights better looking then others but the conversation is never dull. And for a trendy NYC bar, the crowd is quite chatty. As for the the food, I've only had the black label burger. It is so good. So good that I can't seem to order anything else. It's definitely not cheap. But the burger is worth the splurge.
