For a Connecticut deli, it is the best around. I have had sandwiches at Carnegie Deli, Katz Deli (NYC), as well as the other "Deli's" in Connecticut, e.g.. Reins and Reuben's. Overall this is the Rolls Royce of New York style deli restaurants anywhere in Connecticut. I have been going there since they opened in 1998 and the quality of the food is consistently great. The wait staff is friendly and efficient. They know my order as simply my "usual." The usual order for me is a matzoh ball soup where the ball is slightly firm yet not tough. The broth is well balanced with carrot and celery as the aromatics. The Corned Beef and Pastrami "Sky High" is aptly named. This sandwich can practically feed a third world country! Well not quite, however some may find this sandwich difficult to finish in one sitting since it is so overstuffed. Overall if you cannot make it to NYC, this is the place to go for lunch or a light dinner if you would like to nosh on NY style deli food.
