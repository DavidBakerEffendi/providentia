I consider myself a Ramen Connoisseur and I have to say that to me this is some of the best Ramen Soup out there.  The broth is so rich and full of flavor, the Pork is so tender and delectable and their noodles are perfectly firm...Their Gyoza is homemade and absolutely delicious and their Radish Salad with Sesame Dressing is so refreshing and tasty.  Although I have not tried every single Ramen house in this City, so far they outshine all the ones I have tried.  Minca is a MUST TRY...It is my go-to and I think you will not be disappointed with not only the food, but the hospitality as well.  The only complaints I have is 1) they don't deliver (very sad about that), and 2) their restaurant is a little too small, but truthfully...I really don't care...I will sit on a rock if I had to in order to eat a bowl of this stuff!  Hope you enjoy!
