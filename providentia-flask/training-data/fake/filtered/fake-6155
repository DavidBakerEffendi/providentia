I really wanted this place to be fantastic as their GF (gluten free) menu is extensive, but alas, it was not a great experience.  The decor is dated, and the technology is not there (old cash registers), but I happen to love that kind of nostalgia.  What was sorely lacking was the service and, according to my husband, good food. To start, the server waited about 10 minutes to take our order and never asked what we wanted to drink.  We were there 40 minutes, and she didn't refill our coffees nor ask how our food was.   My son and I each had a Belgian waffle; mine was GF.  I wouldn't say they were out of this world, but they were tasty and priced well.  My husband ordered the Cozy omelet.  I have to say, I'm typically a glass-is-half-full kind of person, but there was nothing appealing about this omelet.  It looked strangely green and was very flat.  The home fries must have been made from old potatoes since they were crumbly and dry.   My husband flagged the server down and asked for scrambled eggs; she looked perplexed did not verbally respond; she simply took the plate away and brought what he asked for.  He was satisfied with the scrambled eggs, and the potatoes seemed to be fresher. If the food and service were good (not stellar), I would definitely be giving this place a higher rating.  After today, though, we will not be going back, and it gets a low rating.  The two stars are for the extensive GF menu and the overall good tasting Belgian waffles.
