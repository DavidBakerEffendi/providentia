I had only ever ordered delivery and I had enjoyed the food. It is almost identical, even in presentation, to Cascabel on the UES. So I'm saying the food is good. Not the BEST tacos, but good tacos. Just physically went for the first time. NEVER AGAIN!! I think they must have put my order in wrong or something, but when I thought they were discussing remedying it I guess they weren't. All my friends they got their food AND FINISHED IT. When I asked the server what was up he was SO RUDE my head is still spinning!! So I had to speak with the cashier who then tried to be nice and fix everything, but it still took almost another twenty minutes before I got my correct food!!! I was going to ask for my money back as it was coming out. Took it to go because I HAD TO GET OUT OF THERE! Now the food was still delicious, which is the only reason this review is getting two stars. The service was so bad I just don't want to give them any business ever again!
