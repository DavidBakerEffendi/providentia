This place used to be good, but now it is becoming more and more pretentious (Really? in this economy?).  The hosts are condescending (com'on it is just Cafeteria, ain't all that!) and unreasonable. I walked in asked for party of 3, but 1 was not there yet. I asked if they could sit the 2 of us first to start first. The host told me it is gonna take 15 min.  I stood outside saw them seated 2 parties of 2 who came after me, so I went to ask the host.  The 3 of them told me, if they let the 2 of us start first, the 3rd would not be allowed to join us later. Rude!
