The food is delicious but the service is a bit suspect and unpredictable. I live only a block away and have been there several times already for dinner--it is a relaxed, seat yourself kind of spot. I had, up until a few nights ago, had decent service considering it's more a bar than restaurant (self-seating). But there was a stiffy waitress who waited for a while before serving my friend and I--the bartender was the first to approach the table when he saw we hadn't been helped. She was pushy, rude, and masked it with a valley girl smile. Her initial approach was as if she thought my friend and I were pre-gentrified Crown Heights residents, OG locals and we did NOT feel welcomed. At one point after payment (and a great tip despite actions and attitude of this chick, who I can only describe as a too broke for Manhattan but I like pretending this is it, neo Prospect/Crown Heights snob), she asked my friend and I to move because people were waiting to sit. There was no line. There was no wait. There were tables in the back. Hope you don't have to deal with this kind of service on your visit so you can enjoy some great food and an otherwise chill BK experience.
