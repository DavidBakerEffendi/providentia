The best Chinese food between Montreal and NYC's Chinatown, regardless of the idiot from Columbus. All food is prepared fresh for your table, that's why it all doesn't show up at once. Â A tasting menu is available at lunch, I think it's $15/diner, little bites of anything the chef thinks to put out, I have never been disappointed, and I LIKE good food.
