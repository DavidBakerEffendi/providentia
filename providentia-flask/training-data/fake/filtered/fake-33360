It isn't news to anyone who knows me that I am Audrey's biggest fan. For the past 6 years this restaurant is my own personal go to for a BYOB as well as go to recommendation. My reasons: the menu is easy but elevated enough for an experienced palate, the staff is quick on their feet both literally as well as with regard to their knowledge of the ingredients, the service is impeccable, the food consistently delicious and the urban vibe is both upbeat and casual.
