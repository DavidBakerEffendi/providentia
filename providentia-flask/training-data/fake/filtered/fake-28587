One of my go to spot when in the neighborhood. Whether for happy hour oysters (1$ with a choice of three kinds) or dinner. My favs: the char grilled octopus, the duck entree and the tart tatin. Very complete menu with a wide range of choices. the waitstaff is nice and the atmosphere cosy. Kind of place i end up going every week at least once. Comforting spot. Free wifi. Try the cocktails, very original list. Love the "Petit cochon" (bacon infused old fashion)
