This place has gone downhill, particularly in its service. My friend and I walked in here a few weeks ago, only to be greeted by an unpleasantly snarky cashier. Instead of the usual, "Hi, how are you today?" he starts firing off inappropriate questions at us: "Are you guys best friends? Do you hate each other? Do you love each other?" Very weird. Not what I need when I'm hungry. When we sit down, the same guy slams the pizza stand on our table with a loud clang, and throws the paper plates and napkins in a messy pile. The pizza was decent, but this experience gave me a bad taste in my mouth. From my experience there are some things about which Pizza Brain is consistent and inconsistent. Inconsistent: sometimes the pizza is great, sometimes it has a strange rubbery texture and is below mediocre. Consistent: the service always has a chip on its shoulder and is in some way rude. I won't be going here again. I think the fame of this place has gone to the head of its staff. Pizzeria Beddia is where it's at for pizza in Fishtown. Pizza is always excellent and so is the service.
