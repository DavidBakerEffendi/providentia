Let me start by saying that i don't usually write reviews but this time i feel like i have to, it was 4 of us and as soon as we steeped in the Hostess was giving us an attitude, why i don't know. I am not sure whether the hostess is the owner or an employee, but for some reason she was upset at us as soon as we walked in, with an attitude and as a result she forced us to seat by the kitchen even though she had 2 or 3 tables available. Pretty much she ruined the experience, we all walked out saying NO WAY going back there. Our check was $300 so its not like we were siting for a couple of drinks. The waitress was actually very nice but the hostess was really weird and impolite.
