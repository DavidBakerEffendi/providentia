Dinner was more than a meal, it was an event. Robatayaki chefs literally climb all over the place to prepare the food. Sitting at the chef's counter is definitely the way to go. Make a reservation! My friend and I made careful choices so we didn't end up spending a fortune. We spent about $35 each (including tax/tip) and were stuffed by the time we left. Squid robatayaki was one of the specials. (They should definitely add this to the regular menu!) It was so fresh and full. Another favorite was the Japanese yam and nori seaweed robatayaki. The texture wasn't what I was expecting, but it was a pleasant surprise. Everything we ordered was delicious, but these were just some favorite items. I'm giving four stars rather than five solely because the high-energy atmosphere around the chef's counter, though extremely entertaining and special, made it difficult for me and my friend to have a conversation. That said, next time I return I'll still opt to sit at the counter.
