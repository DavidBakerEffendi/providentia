I love this place.   Best buffalo chicken empanadas ever.   In fact those are so good I almost never even try other things but the other day I went and they had ran out of empanadas (we order a lot of them like 5 for me and usually 3 or 4 for each other person)  and I tried a buffalo chicken sandwich which was amazing as well now I have to decide what to get when I go back because I love both those things.   He's also very customer friendly and you can tell takes pride in his food we're not just another dollar sign.
