I can not say enough about Scannicchio's, it is by far my favorite BYOB. My husband and I have been to this restaurant at least 40 times and we have never had anything we didn't like. The staff is so accommodating especially if you have certain food restrictions or are constantly dieting like myself. I have sent numerous friends and coworkers to Schannicchio's and everyone has always raved about their food. I can not recommend the fillet with crab meat and the dream tartufo more.
