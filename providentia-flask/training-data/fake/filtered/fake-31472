I was expecting much better, based on everyone's rave reviews.  My friend and I both ordered the Bibimbap in stone bowls and were both seriously underwhelmed.  The rice never got crispy, the vegetables were plain, and the sauce was nothing special. Honestly, I could have made this at home.  While it's not the best I've ever had, I think the Bibimbap at Ichiban in Hartford is MUCH better.   Also there was very loud music coming out of a little ipod boombox in the corner that made it difficult to hear.   Meh.
