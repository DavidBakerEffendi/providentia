Awful pizza and entries! Stay away! I can't understand how this place is still in business when they're are so many better pizza/italian places nearby in Wayne, Their sauce was just terrible, sour tasting and the pizza was greasy. I've even given them multiple chances thinking maybe I caught them on a off night but no, it's consistently terrible food. Go somewhere else - you'll be glad you did!
