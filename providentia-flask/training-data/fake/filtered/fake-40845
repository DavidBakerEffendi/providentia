I will always be thankful my heel broke in front of Lombardi's pizza, otherwise, I'd never have found this gem. The pizza here is delicious, thin like proper Italian pizza should be, and always always always fresh from the oven! We had the pizza with the works (Lombardi's version of a supreme pizza), and I stunned myself with the amount of slices I was willing to gob down. Not a lot of pizza places I have been to serve a cold Magners behind the bar, and Lombardi's does! So, in my book, they get brownie points for that one! Other than that, they boast a full bar. Friends, amazing pizza, and a few brewskies.... where's the flaw in that?
