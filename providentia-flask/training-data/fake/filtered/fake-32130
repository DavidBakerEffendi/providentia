Came in with my girlfriend at 4:15PM on a TUESDAY(and there is no Devils game tonight so there are no excuses) and was told "sorry, the entire restaurant has been booked for a party and we can't let you in"...  However the restaurant has about 25 people in it at this time, and its capacity is well over 150...  meanwhile another reviewer states this place doesn't actually take reservation... I see a pattern here. Turning away a customer because you have the "entire" restaurant booked during HAPPY HOUR on a dead Tuesday?  That is just brainless.... will never go back here.  Dino BBQ greeted us with a smile, had just as good of beer selection, and had better food than every reviewer here states.  Go there instead.
