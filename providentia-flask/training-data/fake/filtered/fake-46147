I am Japanese who are living in New York for 23 years and had been lived a couple blocks from Ippudo even before they open. My collage friend(she used to live in NYC for 10 years) came from Japan for her work at Javits Center She wanted Ramen for right dinner so we went to Ippudo without reservation. The reception said we will wait an hour. so we wait at bar. She should tell us that reservation by phone will take advance.so we can call her at door.She book people who just call her outside before us, We never get any sheet after we wait 2 hours at door. I never had such bad experience at any other restaurant in New York. I was so shocked that I had such a worst experience at Japanese restaurant which owned by Japanese company. We were not regret...if we had dinner at Ippodo Japanese people thought that we were so stupid because average price of Ramen in Japan is under $5 not $14! We don't eat Ramen as dinner, we eat Ramen for lunch or night time snack (after drink) Ramen is like Hamburger or Pizza for Japanese people. We saw the menu everything over priced!  we were fine if it was a sushi bar which hiring real sushi master from Japan but not for Ramen.   So we walked away! Now we can say how American people are so stupid to spend money for nothing! now I know the reason why my Japanese friends never be there even we had a friend who used to work there. BTW, even people in Hakata, Japan said Ippudo in Japan is the place for tourist.
