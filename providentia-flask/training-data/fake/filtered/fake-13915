Great place for authentic punjabi food.  Tastes like Grandma cooked it ! Highly recommend their Gobhi paranthas, Dhaba chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala and desserts.  Much better place than overrated Oaktree road restaurants in Edison.  Have been a regular visitor for the past year, and do not understand folks who are criticizing the food taste.  If you want south indian, go to some other place. If you love North Indian, Punjabi style Home cooked taste, look no further.
