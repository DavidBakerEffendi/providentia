FunniBonz offers a Simple, comfortable and inviting atmosphere. The Owners were gracious and very welcoming, but it's all about the food. Food is delicious and comes out fast, the whole place smells incredible and gets you excited from the moment you open the door. My husband (a chef) and I tried pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese, biscuits, cole slaw, and baked beans.  The cole slaw and baked beans were good, but the meats, biscuits and mac and cheese were some of the best I have ever had.  All of the sauces we tried were awesome. Oh and save room for the desert the triple chocolate layer cake was to die for, and served with fresh whipped cream!!! We will be back.... frequently... highly reccommend.
