We come here all the time, the food is delicious and the service is amazing. Our favorite server, Jen Borcsik takes care of us like no other. Our drinks are always filled and her recommendations are spot on. I usually order one of the seafood specials and I've never been disappointed. My husband usually orders off the menu and is a fan of the chicken parm and many pasta dishes. My 2 young boys love to come here and they are always treated special - but it's also a great date night outing. If you're looking for a nice atmosphere and great food, Centro Grille is the place to go!
