I really want to like the farm but.... The saff has always been awesome, the space is swell,  the beer selection is great, I guess my hang up is the food, and that's what it really as all about. Most of the meals I have had were good and a few times excellent. So what's the problem? Well for starters I seem to pick the winners. The people I go with seem to pick food that was disapointing (like every time). I can think of a lot of places I'd rather go for that much money band not get a 50/50 meal. Personally I think the food is slightly over priced and small portions. Now brunch, you can't go wrong. I'd give their brunch menu a much higher rating.     I hope it they get it together but over the years I've gone it hasn't happened.
