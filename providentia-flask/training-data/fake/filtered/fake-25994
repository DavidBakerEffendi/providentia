So I basically have been going to the Great Wazu since they opened back in the 80's.  I was one of their first patrons and for that honor I received a wooden nickel which I think was for a free drink or something.  I don't exactly remember what it was for because I do not have it anymore - I returned it to the owner.  He was very appreciative to have one back in his possession and was surprised that they were still out there.  This is still my favorite sandwich shop & has now become a favorite of my 3 daughters as well, it should be they have been going there for sandwiches as long as they can remember!!  Keep up the good work!!
