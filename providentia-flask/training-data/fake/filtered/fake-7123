It used to be a nice place a few years ago when they actually had someone managing it and controlling the parties on weekends.   Trying living next door to them.  You would be pissed too.  There is no order.  When they have sweet sixteens and other LOUD events going on all night (till 4am sometimes) we have to deal with windows shaking, loud repetitive music, loud DJ's screaming in spanish all because they are not properly sound proofed and also have a broken window in the back.   Doesn't matter if they fixed it, they allow their patrons to leave the back door open for everyone to hear that garbage.   Then to top it off, we have their drunk patrons running down the streets afterwards urinating in my driveway and throwing bottles everywhere. I've witnessed this.  I actually caught a man relieving himself on my property saying "he wasn't doing anything"  as he was zipping up his fly and my gate was wet.   Also, we have to endure cab cars honking all hours of the night coming to pick up these drunks.   Then.....when the weekend is over.............just when you think you'll get some quiet on a sunday night........ Gottscheer Hall has an illegal dump truck coming at 2 am to pick up garbage and shake the whole neighborhood with it's noise for 20 minutes. This is ridiculous.  I've been witnessing all this and documenting for the past 2 years and I plan on taking legal action when I have enough evidence.   Doesn't matter how many times or how many people call to complain, they are rude on the phone and just don't do anything about it.  Don't have proper security either.  I don't think a security guard is supposed to be sitting in the hall playing candy crush on his cell phone. The food has gotten pretty bad over the last 2 years as well.   Can't wait to move upstate one day and get away from this.
