THIS PLACE GAVE ME & 3 FRIENDS FOOD POISONING!!!                                            the good times      To be fair, I did  have like two enjoyable experiences at the queens kickshaw the first few weeks of June. It was raining and I had ordered a latte (made perfectly & with really pretty foam art by a VERY hot guy named zach i think?) the only flaw in the day was the owner cutting him off & perpetually talking about what we were going to talk about every time we began to talk (the owner seems to like to hear himself talk !! to say the least!!) He then started cutting ME off when i engaged in conversation with him----not so willingly----  and so i stopped talking and prayed he would do the same.)         My second visit I sat in front of the grill station & the girl cooking gave me a mini bowl of pumpkin seeds to snack on while waiting for my sandwich. she was awesome..she had me & my friends ccraackin up!  she was so freaking awesome!  and the blue cheese sandwich was incredible*****..crispy, perfect meltiness, even better than i thought it was gunna be.....even the salad was really good for just a plain old mesculun mix. i was in love with kickshaw those 2 days...and like many, recommended it to my friends. HOWEVER!! from what i experienced the past few weeks (mid july------ beginning of aug), this place has steadily become worse and worse with each one of my visits..and as much as **I want to love this place,***  I can't risk eating here anymore!!!! (p.s. I made a yelp account just to write this review..thats how i feel.)                             V    THE BAD, VERY BAD TIMES  V       First of all------- every time I go in there at night they're out of something that i want to eat (the goat cheese, olives, stuffing, pickles..the list goes on...) LITERALLY EVERY TIME!!!! not only that but whenever i get a beer on tap  "the keg just kicked" ive even had crappy luck ordering bottled stuff in there! ).      secondly, it doesnt matter WHAT time i go in..the owner is always there (im starting to think hes a freaking alien) & even if he isnt talking to me (or over me rather) hes talking to someone really loud about something pretentious or hipsterish.. *its annoying*. Third and most importantly, the cook thats always there at night GAVE ME FOOD POISONING!!!! i went in there with my roomie and 3 friends and we all got SICK! thing is we didnt share anything cus there werent any of the app we wanted ..olives .. we all got diffrent stuff.. which means he didnt wash his nasty  hands..he also wasnt wearing gloves ( how can u let someone work for you with an overgrown beard and greasy looking also too overgrown hair..and then it was funny cus he was wearing a hat but his hair was long so theres no point..hair is still gonna get in the food!! DUH!! but i guess *****if you cant even wash your hands**** OR PUT GLOVES ON IF YOURE NOIT GUNNA WASH UM youre not gunna bother gettin ur hair cut!!!) OH YAH when i past by to use the bathroom i saw him cutting our death-sammiches with no gloves on & they looked like HELL!!!! my cheddar was burnt and caving in and so was the black bean hummus one!..the soup was s0 watery & ive had their soup before and it was good but this time it was really awful. my roomie had the one with all the onions on it and it was so greasy! and not even toasted! and the cole slaw didnt have anything on it!! it was just lettuce and some stupid seeds but only on the top! anyways i hope they get their act back together but i wont ever find out for sure bcus im never eating or drinking there again!!!!!!!!
