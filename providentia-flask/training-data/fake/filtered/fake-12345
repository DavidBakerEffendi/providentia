I would first like to commend the owners on their brilliant business with good food good service which is hard to find! I love everything about this restaurant! And regards to the negative comment on Maggie's part, try to find the combination of good food good people and cleanliness! I don't even think you've been there honestly because its ny far the best good I've tasted outside ofy lichen and my moms kitchen. Mayn't you just used to eating out the Chinese places that you would know what a real restaurant taste or is. Don't come up in there trying ruin a great business! Thanks Ol Boy and keep up the superb outstanding work!
