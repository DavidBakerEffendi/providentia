This place just open last week, I love Xiao Long Bao, so I give it a try and it is delicious. The skin is thin and juicy inside. And don't break at all !! I have tried many places and they are all below my expectation. Fried dumplings are supper good and so as the XO sauce fried rice and many other dishes. Love this place !!!
