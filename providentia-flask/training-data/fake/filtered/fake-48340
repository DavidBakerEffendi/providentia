I was indecisive as to post my review to Pat's or Geno's,   but since we did encounter Pat's first, Pat's will have to deal with this review, but please read in its entirety, because Geno's  didn't  score big either.  Enjoying a Philly cheese steak was to be one of the highlights for my husband during our vacation, so of course we had to try Pat's and Geno's, which we decided to eat at both locations on the same day.  That was a smart decision, because after experiencing Pat's, I would have refused to spend money on transportation to go back and even try Geno's.   With all the notoriety, you would think between the two locations; one could make a Philly cheese steak that we could boast about when we returned home!   Pat's sandwich (grilled onions and provolone) was not heated at all, the roll was extremely hard, and the meat had so much fat that after 2 bites, I couldn't handle the experience any longer.   Even my husband gave up trying to eat it.  However, I decided not to waste all my money, so I proceeded to feed the roll to the 100 pigeons that surrounded us while we tried to eat.   Still adventurous or dumb we proceeded across the street to Geno's.  The best part of the meal was there were less pigeons!  However, the Philly cheese steak (grilled onions and cheese whiz) was nothing to praise either.  The meat and roll were easier to chew/digest than Pat's, but the overall flavor was lacking!  Basically, more money down the drain.   I also didn't understand at both locations, why they rush you to order the sandwich and then direct you to another window to wait in line to order fries/drinks while the sandwich gets colder!   My advice to anyone wanting to try a cheesesteak at either location is to bring your own homemade Steak-Um sandwich and pay the $8 for the roll to feed the pigeons!
