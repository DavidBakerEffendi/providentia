Quite possibly one of the worst places I've ever been. I'm not one to bash restaurants, but this is deserved. I've had numerous bad experiences. 1. I ordered a salad, once I started eating I realized the lettuce was brown and had gone bad. 2. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar, I received a sandwich with slightly melted shredded cheddar cheese. 3. Ordered a turkey sandwich with cheddar. Again was surprised to have shredded cheese explode all over the place when I tried to eat my sandwich, it was also drenched in mayo to the point of no return, and the turkey was beyond questionable. A waste of $7. 4. Ordered 2 eggs scrambled... received fake eggs, the kind that is poured out of a milk carton and sits on warming trays all day. 5. Lastly, ordered chicken noodle soup, shame that there was no actual soup. The cup was full of veggies and noodles, but no broth.
