We have been excited ever since we first saw the renovations start. The work they've done on the interior were great, and the place has a nice homey feel. The infusions are delicious, whether you BYO booze to put in them or not. The service was friendly, though perhaps needs a bit more practice. First we saw our food taken to another table and tried to call out when it was being taken back to the kitchen but weren't heard (or ignored). After we were finished with dessert a server came out with two plates of dinner (not ours! we were well passed full). It's a new business though and I'm sure they can work that out. The food was delicious. The fried pickles were much lighter than expected and have more of a tempura like battering than I'm used to. They were delicious, just unexpected. The steak and scallop entrees were both delicious (though I think a little less pork belly on the scallops would be a good idea- that's just personal taste though). All the portions are quiet big, we wouldn't have minded a slightly smaller (slightly cheaper) entree. And the banana bread in a mason jar was as adorable as it was tasty. One thing I will say, and this is less a complaint than a suggestion to help the owners because we really want them to stay: for a restaurant that bills itself on locally sourced ingredients they could talk up a bit more where their ingredients come from. Notes next to dishes, an explanation on the back of the menu, servers trained to give a spiel about farm-to-table-ness, etc. Farm to table is great as a concept, but without a discussion of sourcing can feel like an empty phrase. Definitely plan on going again and hope to work our way through the menu.
