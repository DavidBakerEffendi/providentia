Talk about a rose growing through concrete! I'm not usually a fan of bk southern restaurants but Soco might be my new spot. Upon stepping into this trendy-esque scenery i was greeted with warm music and a smile. I was taken aback at first by more than an hr wait but after meeting the "mixologist" i didnt mind waiting. The food menu although small was tasty and the desserts and drinks were delicious. I want to give this place 5 stars but the wait wont allow me to. I would recommend all to make reservations to beat the friday night rush!!! decor =4, food=4, music=5, wait=3 and vibe=5!!!!!
