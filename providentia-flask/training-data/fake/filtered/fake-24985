Been going here for about a year. Â Overall, better dumplings than Dumpling House a few blocks up the street, and less crowded. Thinner skin, more filling, better flavor. The only problem I had was, once or twice, there was some serious gristle or something in the pork & chive. I know - gross - but being honest here. Barring that, this has become my default cheap dumpling place.
