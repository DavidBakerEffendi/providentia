Best pancakes I've ever had.  Whenever I'm in NY, I go out of my way to make it here for their blueberry pancakes with maple butter.  I don't quite understand why they're so damn good - somehow, their pancakes are fluffier than everyone else's, and the maple butter has a really tasty creamy flavor.  Definitely worth a stop if you're in the area.
