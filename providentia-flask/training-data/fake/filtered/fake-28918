Total turnaround from years prior. The most recent chef and sous chef have made the food something to dream about. Everything made from scratch. The last meal my husband and I had there did not disappoint. Ravioli app, oxtail gnocchi, gaspacho, and philly's # 1 lobster roll! Everthing was fresh and the portions are not small! And that was all for lunch! I stopped in last sat @ 12:30 and the place was packed.... The only complaint is that I wish there was more room for me to stretch out after eating so much...
