My kind of chinese food..I was never dissapointed at this place...If you ae not in to "real" schezuan chinese food ..go somewhere else...food can be very spicy..I'm from south asia and I can eat raw hot peppers...no problem...but this place has food I find it hard to handle..But the taste is amazing...
