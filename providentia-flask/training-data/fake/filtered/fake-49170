The worst management on the planet! The place is well designed but workers and managers are worst i've ever seen. Bartenders are so slow and rude. They keep chit chatting with Â their friends and don't pay attention to customers. Sometimes I've seen customers leave without any drinks because bartenders didn't approach them more than 10 minutes. Sometimes bar is half full and they don't let you sit in the bar. I asked why, they say it is not available. I tried food one time, it was fish, and it had no taste. Kind of just boiled fish. I didn't try the sushi, so no comment about it. As i said it has very nice environment but the managers and workers are one of the worst you would ever see. I write this review after 5-6 times been there. (So it's just not 1 time bad experience)
