Excellent! Delicious food! Small place, very clean, friendly people, fantastic food and  great prices. The empanadas and alcapurrias were filled with meat no air pockets. I also had the steak with rice and beans, and a side order of chicken soup. The food reminded me of abuela's cooking.  It was scrumptious!  Can't wait to go back. Highly recommended!
