Felt extremely unwelcomed as a white person. Upon arrival I was not greeted at all and instead had to ask where to sit and for menus. Only to find out there was only a buffet and it would appear that the food had been sitting out for sometime. Eventually I guess what you could call a waiter came to our table and gave us a stack of plastic cups and a pitcher of tap water, what a joke, no wonder it was completely empty, and will remain that way.
