THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE EVER!!!  Rude owner/manager.  They had a large party (sports team and parents) from out of the area who took priority over everyone else in the restaurant.  The group was extremely loud.  We could barely carry on a conversation without raising our voices to each other.  Our meals took 1 1/2 hours to be served.  The waiter, however, was excellent - apologizing for the delay and trying to help make a bad experience better.  After waiting so long for the food, our group's consensus about the meals was that they certainly were NOT worth the wait.  While we were eating, some of the individuals from the large party finished their meals and began pitching quarters into their glasses, standing a few feet from their table.  That caused them to get even louder.  They were allowed to carry on like this without anyone saying anything to them.  When the volume got unbearable, we asked the waiter to get us the manager.  When the woman came to the table, she said she was also the owner, and told us she could get us a quieter table outside!  She said she would not ask them to quiet down as they were paying customers (and what were we??? we were a party of 7 - their party was larger, so I guess $$ was her priority)  We were courteous with our complaint, and certainly did not deserve the offer to be sat outside.  We were offered free deserts due to the 1 1/2 wait for our meals; however, they were stale!  The waiter was the only good thing about this experience.  We will NEVER go back to Zinna's!!!  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
