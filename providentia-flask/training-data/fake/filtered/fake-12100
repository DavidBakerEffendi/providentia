my husband and i only recently moved here from the west coast so we haven't been to many restaurants, but we bookmarked a few that we just knew we had to try. unfortunately, some of them (ie: Amada) disappointed us, but Osteria exceeded our expectations! some of the standouts for us this evening were the Lombarda pizza, the robiola francobolli with royal trumpet mushrooms and thyme (UH-Mazing), spaghetti with olive oil poached calamari, taggiasca olives and parsley, and the pasta special of the night (forgot the name of the pasta but it looked like candy wrappers with figs and cheese). every dish, including the wine, was spot on. it's been a while since we went to a restaurant where everything was perfect and delicious. cannot wait to take my friends here when they visit!
