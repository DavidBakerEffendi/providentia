Shahnawaz is the nearest Pakistani Halal restaurant to where I live. And this branch location in North Brunswick is certainly a lot better than their other older restaurant in Edison NJ. The Ambiance is good, the sitting arrangement is a lot better.The buffet is good as well, their food overall is just okay, nothing too impressive. A few items that are noteworthy, their lamb chops, Chicken Tikka masala, and chicken/ beef bihari kabab are very good. Their chicken biryani or Chicken korma and karhayee isn't praiseworthy. Although, i've found their russmalaayee to be spoiled twice (not in a row). This place is easy to find, the location is very convenient, close to pretty much every highway (rt 1, Rt 130, 4 miles from Exit 8A and Exit 9 on the NJ Turnpike). For someone not looking for something too special this should be a good fit.
