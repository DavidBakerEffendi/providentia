Ok so first let me start off by saying that I was a little annoyed by the fact that a ten minute wait in the wine bar turned into a one hour wait as our hostess did not remember that she placed us there.  Besides this fact, the food was amazing and the staff (besides the blonde woman working in the wine bar) were extremely friendly.  The food was delicious and came extremely fast.  Prices were not high like I expected as  it was 19 dollars for chicken parm and 23 for Pork scallopini (one of the specials) and our appetizer was only 7 dollars.  The place is loud but manages to remain comfortable.  I would definitely recommend making a reservation and would be glad to dine there many more times.
