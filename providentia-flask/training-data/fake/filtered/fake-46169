Came here one Saturday night around 4:30AM, and there was still a line forming down the block. They have their operation down to a science though, and within a couple minutes of ordering the combo platter (chicken and lamb over rice, a few pieces of pita, and some lettuce aka "salad" on the side), I had my food. For $6 you get a lot of food and everything is fresh and hot off the grill, tender lamb and chicken, and you can control how much white sauce or red sauce you want because they just give you your own little containers of it. Caution: use the red sauce sparingly, it is very, very spicy - can't live with it, can't live without it! I have to say though, I stopped short of the full 5 stars because if I had the choice between 53rd St Halal and Adel's Halal in the Financial District, it'd be close. Adel's might not have the viral following, but it is easily just as delicious (or more?) and often boasts a line down the block even in the pouring rain. Of course, going all the way down to FiDi for halal is not so convenient.
