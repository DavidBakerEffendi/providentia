Totto Ramen was pretty delicious. I am new to the city and have been craving good ramen. I don't particularly want to travel too far since I walk almost everywhere and it was getting a bit late. Totto is about 10 blocks away from me so it's close in walking distance. They are open to midnight which is great as well. When I got there, I saw a huge line of people waiting (sometimes a good sign) so I rushed down the steps to add my name to the wait list. Although my bf and I waited almost 40 mins for a table to open, and ended up having to sit next another couple at one of the tables for 4 (a bit awkward) it still was ok. I got the Miso Ramen and my bf got the Spicy Ramen. Both were great, personally I enjoyed the Miso better, the broth was a bit thicker and had a better flavor for my taste buds. This is a place I would definitely recommend, just as long as you don't mind the wait, which is worth it!
