This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia.  Their menu features many tasty delights that will suit every taste.  Feeling exotic? Try the Jungle Chicken.  Feeling cautious?  Try the Chicken and Broccoli.  Feeling adventurous?  Try the Chicken Mint Kebab.  And their coconut rice is a little piece of heaven!
