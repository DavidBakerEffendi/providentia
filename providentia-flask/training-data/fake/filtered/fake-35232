My friends and I go to high school in the area and saw it when it first opened up during our freshman year. Gaia immediately warmed up to us as her first customers. As a true Italian woman she can seem a bit snappy at first, but she is kind and good natured. Her food is also fantastic! The lasagne is homey and tasty as well as the paninis and espresso. Her incredibly amazing true Italian cooking has kept me coming for four years as it is now my senior year. I will continue coming for the amazing, fresh Italian food.
