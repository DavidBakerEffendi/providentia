I am absolutely appauled by the treatment I received over the phone from Westville Chelsea. After I received my food from the delivery guy (who I tipped $60) I opened the bag to realize that grilled chicken from one of the salads is missing. Since I was ordering a decent amount of food I called and asked them to just bring the missing chicken, not expecting it to be a big deal. The hostess was beyond rude and argued that I never ordered the chicken. She finally agreed to have them deliver it. 5 minutes later I get a call expecting it to be my food, and instead it is the hostess again telling me that they would need to charge me for the chicken. After a $60 dollar tip were they seriously going to nickle and dime me for grilled chicken. You bet your bottom dollar they were. Any place that does not acknowledge that they made an error and continues to argue the point is a retaurant I will never dine at again. Food great; but the service killed this one for me. I have never been treated so poorly and after years of working in the restaurant business I am thoroughly disgusted by their lack of understanding, of the statement, the customer is always right. This will be my last time ever ordering from Westville and I highly advise people to steer clear of this evidently classless and rude establishment.
