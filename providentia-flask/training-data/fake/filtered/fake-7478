Really enjoy going here for a late-night supper and a few drinks on a Sunday night. Very cozy, hip without being pretentious atmosphere. The service is impeccable. I love the steak frites...they always prepare my meat exactly as requested and the fries are the perfect compliment. Cocktails are mixed so nicely here too. It's one of my favorite places to frequent since moving to NYC. I am hoping to try their brunch which has been getting excellent reviews.
