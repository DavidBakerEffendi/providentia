This place is a real gem in a city that is known for its restaurants.   I say gem because most people might flock to other well known places, pay top dollar, and be less than satisfied (I eat out a lot and have hit virtually every restaurant in West Hartford and have left several well known ones not that impressed).  I likle Rizzuto's because the food is always delicious and reasonably priced and the service is outstanding.  The wait staff is always warm and really hustle.  The manager takes the time to sincerely ask how things are and then listens.   You can tell she is genuine.   I love the open atmosphere of the place too.  And it is in a great location where it is lovely to look out and see sky and center.  Highly recommend!!
