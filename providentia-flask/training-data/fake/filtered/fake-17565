I don't often write reviews but had a reservation at Jane yesterday at 9:30pm...we got there and the hostess said "your table will be available momentarily". We waited and waited, 15 minutes later I asked again and she told me: "Oh, they still haven't gottn up from their table". Waited another 15 minutes and decided to leave, at that point the hostess said: "Can't control how fast people get up from the table, if you wait for another few minutes, i'm sure they should". I suppose that there is a reason for making reservations and Jane restaurant in my case yesterday obviously didn't think so. I live cross the street actually, last time I went the food wasn't great but decided to give it another shot...big mistake!
