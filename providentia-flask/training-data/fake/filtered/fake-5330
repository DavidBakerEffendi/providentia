Yup they nailed it alright! Best burger I've had on the East Coast. Probably the best burger I've had ever. I think it's absolutely justifies the hype. Every bit of it. I had the truffle burger and wanted to come back the next day for another. The wait times are a bit long. Come early, avoid weekends at all costs and come hungry. It will not disappoint.
