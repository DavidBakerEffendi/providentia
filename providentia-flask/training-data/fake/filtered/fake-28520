A great place to meet up with friends or a great place to take your girl for dinner and drinks.  The food is perfect for the atmosphere and the music isn't too loud, which is great when you're trying to hold a conversation.  The Flying Pig is a block down, and although they get more hype, I think this place is the best bar in the neighborhood. And if you're not sure what food goes with your drink, I recommend you listen to the bartenders, because they know what they're talking about.
