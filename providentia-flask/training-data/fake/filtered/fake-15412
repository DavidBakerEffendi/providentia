went to delorenzos last night.  first of all there was an hour wait.  so we decided to go next door and eat some sushi at yummy sushi while we wait.  sushi was delicious!!!  delorenzos called my cell phone to let me know our table was ready. we ordered a large clam pie. waited another hour for the pie to come out.  the pie was absolutely GROSS!!!!!  dried out crust, totally tasteless, not a spice on the pie we ate not even half the pie and left the rest there.  don't bother going its overated and it sucks.   want good pie go up north jersey to santillos in elizabeth nj for the best real brick oven pizza.  not this crap that delorenzos serves.
