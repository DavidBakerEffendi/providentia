My boyfriend has taken me here only once but I must say Â it was some of the best pizza I've ever had. The atmosphere is so romantic and charming. This truly is the gem of bed-stuy. We also had a great experience meeting the sweet little cats that brushed against our feet as we ate. I can't wait to visit this wonderful oasis in Brooklyn again! -M & J
