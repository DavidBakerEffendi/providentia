Great dining experience. The owner was very friendly and accommodating. There is a beautiful garden in the back, but you might need a reservation to get into the garden. The food is delicious, served in large, filling portions. The khachapuri (bread with cheese and egg) and khinkali (lamb dumplings) were delicious. Everything was served hot and right out of the oven.
