The real deal for all New Englanders lost in this strange world of Brooklyn.  It was legit. The Raw Bar was rawsome!  The Lobster Roll was clawsome!  They even do fresh potato chips, my personal fav.  My co-worker loved his Hamburger too.  I washed it all down with a draft beer, and then went back for a cocktail.  I loved the counter service. So casual.  We were in and out of there fast and full.
