I would give this place 5 stars and call it a hidden gem but it's neither (its very popular and they lose a star for service). The service is probably one of the worst.  The food takes very long, they seem understaffed and for such a small place you would think the opposite. What saves them is the food!  The wait is definitely worth it.  I always have the Pollo a la plancha and some viagara empanadas.  To kill your hunger from waiting order the platain chips and guac because it is simply amazing...  Their Sangria isn't too shabby either... They are 24-hours which is a plus if your a night owl.  If you dine out alot there isn't too many great options after the club/lounge at 4am.  It's very casual so coming dressed here you will feel out of place.
