After the ridiculous wait to get a table, an even more ridiculous wait for a simple pizza, and easily the rudest service I've ever experienced, I looked forward to at least having an outstanding pie.  It was o.k. pizza, at best, however, and this place is living on the fumes of its past glory.  Seriously, this isn't even close to being the best pizza in New Haven County.  If my product were this mediocre, I'd stop treating the customers like they were roaches.
