You have to understand something about Mezcal - it's not fine dining.  All too often people write scathing reviews about laid-back joints where the reviewer says they loved the atmosphere but didn't like the service.  Let's get something straight - in a laid back atmosphere, don't be surprised the service wasn't incredible.  That's the point.  If you want somewhere to go with friends, relax and sit back and enjoy, you want Mezcal.  If you want somewhere to act outside of your league, you want somewhere else. That said, Mezcal is incredible.  From the portions, to the personalities, it's a gorgeous spot.  This joint has charm, it's family owned and operated.  This is a strong-suit to many restaurants, and should be something more people consider.  When a joint is owned by a family, it means their stuff has to be good because their livelihoods are on the line.   Mezcal is remarkable.  I won't tell you I had a dish and it was divine or I had a drink and it was da bomb.  No,  I will tell you that places like Mezcal are rare and worth it.  The portions are generous, the drinks are stiff and the service is friendly and welcoming.  This is the kind of place that doesn't exist in today's America.   You should go to Mezcal once because you will go again and again.    If you're the kind of person that wants to eat at a Mexican joint, don't complain about service.
