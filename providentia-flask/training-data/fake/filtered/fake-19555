The food is GREAT, real authentic Taiwanese food. I love their noodles, especially wide noodle. Beef noodle soup (clear broth), noodle with ground pork 7 beans paste sauce, and Chinese style fried chicken noodle/rice are good. They also have pan fried beef bun & pan fried pork dumpling which is hardly to eat in any other restaurants in NJ. I usually order some small dishes, such as seaweed, shredded bean curd, sliced port ears, ....etc to come with my main courses. I also love their deserts, sweet red bean congee & Bubble tea, which I highly recommend. From my experience, I went to the restaurant two-three times per week, and I can easily get a place to sit during weekday lunch hours, but in the weekend, I have to wait. The good thing is that I can make the reservation for the party over 6 people. Overall, it is a nice restaurant with great food at decent price.
