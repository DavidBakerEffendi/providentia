I absolutely loved this place. I went out to eat for my friends birthday party. Making a reservation COULDNT be easier.  The woman was so nice and allowed us to have a party of 8 at 915 at night.  I had the tofu and avocado maki which was like 5 dollars, and a side of noodles with pesto sauce.  For dessert, she brought out fried ice cream with candles in the top.  We had green tea ice cream and vanilla. The green tea was delcious! I was so happy that my meal totaled about 15 dollars!  I absolutely recommend this place.
