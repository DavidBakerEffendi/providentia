RUDE waiter, told us the "kitchen was closed" and could NOT have dessert.  BTW--he never even ASKED US if we wanted any, just thought is was good customer service to tell us we couldn't have it even if we wanted it first.  Couldn't have coffee either.  Keep in mind, we got there 1/2 hour before the sign on the door said they closed.  Overpriced, mediocre food at best, rude wait staff...my second time there was my LAST.  LEARN HOW TO APPRECIATE YOUR CUSTOMERS AND MAYBE YOU WON'T HAVE TO DO GROUPON.
