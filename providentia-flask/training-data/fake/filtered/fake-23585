I threw up in my mouth just thinking about this place.  I love traveling to New York, I live in Chicago so I like to bounce over there from time to time to see friends. I enjoy walking around the Village and Manhattan/Chelsea area.  My friend was boasting about this place telling me "ohhhh please we have to go there it's so awesome."  I am unsure what planet he lives on for liking this place... but to each their own.  Anyway I wanted a snack before dinner.  So I ordered some apps.  I barely even ate my food because it really did not taste well.  What I mean by this is undercooked fish and some kind of bread mixed with something that tasted like cat shit.   We were sitting at the bar so I was hoping the dumbass bartender would have said "How is everything?..." i.e. taking note that I CLEARLY was not eating my food.  Anyway he did not.  This is my fault I should have probably said something but I did not want to embarrass my friends etc.  I am very polite so I would have been nice but still I just did not want to be "that girl."  Anyway needless to say next time I am in NY I will not be hanging here. There's far too many other pubs and great places to go in this area and everyone and their mother knows that.
