After reading all the reviews I figured I had to try this place, As a jaded New Yorker I went there with reservations, But I was very impressed, the place is a dump with a lot of class, The counter is so small I would advise anyone to take the food out as I did, the dumplings were out of this world (5 X 1.00) so were the Peking duck pancakes, after I ate I went back and bought a bag of 50 frozen dumplings for $9.00 It doesn't get better or cheaper then this even in New York
