We came on a Saturday night - good job we booked as the place was heaving! Really nice ambience inside although it was quite loud so talking was a tad difficult (at the same time it did add to the atmosphere). It was restaurant week so we all had the set price menu with a choice of 3 starters, mains, desserts. The starter of bitter green salad was really disappointing - literally just a handful of leaves with hardly any dressing or 'bits'. It redeemed itself with the main course (chicken) and dessert (yummy chocolate caramel tart) though. Â The sides were massive too - more than enough for 3 people to share. All in all a really nice meal and great atmosphere - would be tempted to try off the set menu next time to see if the food would be any better (but not sure if my purse strings will allow!)
