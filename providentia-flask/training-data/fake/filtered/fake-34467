My family and I are frequent diners at the Country Girl Diner. We LOVE this place. The staff and owner, Kate, are always friendly and inviting, treating locals and out-of-staters with equal hospitality. The atmosphere is a classic diner experience and the food is just amazing. The pancakes are some of, if not, the best I have ever had and they always have some delicious variation like blueberry or strawberry or chocolate chip (great for the kids). My favorite is the V.A.S.T, it is a very filling breakfast served with real VT maple syrup and the coffee is always delicious. My wife loves their waffles and french toast. I highly recommend this place to anyone that I talk to, even though I would love to keep it our little secret, this place deserves as much business as possible. If you have the chance I highly recommend you go.
