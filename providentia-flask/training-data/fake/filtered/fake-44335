I used to eat here pretty often when I lived downtown, I had lunch here today for the first time in years.  It was exactly as I remembered it... Very cheap and very authentic Chinatown.  Formica tables, waiters that are so rude and negligent you think it has to be an act, nothing on the menu for vegetarians.  I had a bowl of plain congee, I can believe it's the best in town.  The waiters are the worst though, I couldn't get a glass of cold water and had to drink the complementary hot tea to wash down the congee.
