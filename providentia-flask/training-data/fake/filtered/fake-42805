I've been going to Nyonya for years now and obviously I like their food but to be honest with you getting a little bored with the menu I wish they would come up with some new dishes or have specials with different recipes. But I will continue go there since it's quick, tasty and cheap!! Oh, one last thing, they should start accepting credit cards!!
