I really don't care how good their food is. The experience we had last night was enough to make me want to call the police.   The service was abrupt. We were told the kitchen was closing as soon as our food was delivered, and we were hustled for more dishes. The waitress tried to remove plates while we were still eating from them. The men behind the sushi bar continually gestured towards me and  my companion  and visibly smirked at each other all through our meal. It was incredibly uncomfortable, and to top it off, one of them asked if I was my date's parent ( we are the same age group) when we were leaving. I don't pay these kind of prices to be insulted and used as comic relief by the staff. What an awful evening.  I can't understand how any restaurant can justify this kind of obnoxiously rude behavior by their staff. I'd rather eat dirt than return to this dump.
