The sandwiches are creative and taste amazing.   Sadly they seem to get smaller every time I go, and $9 is a lot to ask for in burlington for such small portions.  I'm always still hungry.   the waits are sometimes just unbearable.  calling in an order must be a joke to them, because you could call in 10 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour ahead.. it doesn't matter because that sandwich will be made sometime in the hour and a half after you walk in the door and remind the staff that you still exist.   Ha, and don't say they're busy.
