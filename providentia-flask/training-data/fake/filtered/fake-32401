I don't know why, in all the years I've lived here, it's taken me so long to try this place. While I LOVE deep dish, sometimes a great NY crust is great. The crust here is awesome, and I judge pizza by the crust. Can't be too thin, too soggy, too hard, and definitely has to have flavor. Oh, this pizza hits all my thin crust qualifications. And I'm not a huge toppings person, but their meatball is really yummy. Plus I can hit Crumbs and get a coffee as well for dessert. Ah, a perfect Sunday date!
