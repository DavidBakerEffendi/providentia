I don't understand why people are giving this restaurant such a high rating. The service is terrible upon entering the establishment; the hostess will finish her conversation before acknowledging you. My friend and our were waiting for about 5 minutes and I waved a waiter down, she proceeded to give me a very unwelcome attitude. We didn't have a designated waiter and every other server had an attitude, that's the only thing Isabella's should be known for- attitude, consistent throughout the entire staff. I don't even care if the food is good, which it's not its decent, the service is so bad it makes the food unpleasant. FYI Isabella's... This isn't soho.
