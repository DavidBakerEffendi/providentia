Ate here recently.  Walked in to a narrow, noisy two story room with bar on left--taken back and to the right to a larger, quieter (but still noisy) room with its own bar.  Had a Czech beer that was outstanding, potato pancakes and brussel sprouts salad, equally outstanding.  Desserts were delicious.  Service was brusque, server not particularly attentive or friendly.   Most disappointing dish was Sauerbraten.  Meat was served with a ton of fat on the edge (hidden by the gravy, which was just ok).  Red cabbage was prepared with cloves, not overly sweet, potato dumpling was great. I tried my daughter's Bratwurst--it was spectacular! So all in all a good experience--I'd recommend a Wurst platter or Schnitzel rather than Sauerbraten.  Otherwise, great food.
