Speaking as a full-blooded Punjabi woman, this food is very authentic and most importantly, very delicious. Their lunch buffet is an incredible value, with a great selection of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, and it is served everyday. Among all the Indian restaurants in Princeton, this is the best food and also the best value (they may also have the absolute best prices). Whenever I get homesick and crave my mother's food back in Mumbai, I get my butt to Tandoori Bite. Great service as well.
