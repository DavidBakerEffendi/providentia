My tummy was happy, my wallet, not quite so happy. The food was tasty, my party ordered a variety of tapas and some of the highlights were the chorizo and the cheese and meat platter. Possibly the best sangria I've ever had, in my limited experience with sangria. I do think it was somewhat overpriced for the experience, but hey it was a friend's birthday and we were celebrating.
