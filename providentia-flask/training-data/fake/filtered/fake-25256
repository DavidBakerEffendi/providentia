What a refreshing new addition to this neighborhood!  Sharkey's Cafe is an adorable sandwich shop, serving sandwiches, baked goods, EXCELLENT teas by Harney & Sons and coffee by Brooklyn Roasting Coffee. Portions are large and everything is very reasonably priced. The owner, Jennifer, is lovely and bakes all of the treats herself on premises -- try the Nutella Banana muffin, it is to die for!!  I ate one and brought 2 home with me they are so good -- moist and not too sweet.   All sandwiches are made with delicious Balthazar bread, and are assembled while you wait.  I had the "Simply Cucumber" -- Brie, cucumber, salt & pepper on a baguette. I normally wouldn't go for soemthing like that but it was really divine -- it was the perfect sandwich for a summer afternoon.  My friend ordered the Pope Francis - prosciutto, fresh mozerella, arugula and balsamic on a baguette - also very tasty.  Then for dessert we shared the "Monkey Biz" - peanut butter, banana and honey on a baguette.  I was tempted by the Nutella Baguette (because Nutella!) but so few places in the city offer a peanut butter banana sandwich, we had to try it.  Just like everything else it was so good! Sharkey's Cafe also offers catering -- she can do anything from small office meetings to wedding cakes.  I saw them putting together a plate of mini ham and cheese croissants that looked beautiful.   There are a handful of seats in the shop, we got lucky and got a table, so we could chat a little bit with Jennifer.  There's a park across the street you can always eat at if you don't get a seat. If you are in Chinatown and looking for something fresh & light, or on jury duty and don't want another chinese food lunch, definitely seek out Sharkey's Cafe, you will really enjoy it.
