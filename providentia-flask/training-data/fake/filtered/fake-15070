Waited for an hour and they kept on gg the tables with other ppl who came after us. Totally not a baby or kid friendly place. And the worst thing is the staff is very rude. Won't recommend at all.iving g Pretty horrible service - went to Risotteria thinking that the food is good and there are so many positive reviews. The waiting was 30-40 mins, and we waited. I asked after 40 mins, how we doing on the time and she checked the list and told me ohh still 20-30 mins. I saw the list and realized that they gave tables to others who came after us. She kept on giving the table to others, as if she just didn't want to give a table for 4 to us. I told her and she is like bcos you are 4 ppl , you will have to wait or i can do a take out . Whatt??? seriously after 1 hour of wait she had gutts to say that take out ?? I was polite and was like its ok give us a table of 2 and we will squeeze in. Thinking the food will be atleast good. We ordered risotos and the good came in quickly. The risoto was pretty ok, not at all worth waiting for so long. The waitress was like sorry we did not get the seat earlier, without really meaning even a litle bit of sorry. To sum it up, this place is very over rated. The food is very ordinary , and has no ambience , bad service and pricey. I would have not cared about the ambiance or being pricey if the food and service was good. But both horrible. Stay away from this place. NOT RECOMMENDED AT ALL. There are better places in NYC and in the village for sure.
