We enjoyed a nice meal on Friday night. The introductory pricing is great! Noisy atmosphere, but good service and tasty food. Lot's of menu options. Lobster ravioli with basil cream sauce was delicious. Filet mignon tender and perfectly cooked with fresh, flavorful sides. Could use some more wine options. Owner and staff present and concerned. Nice to have a new place to go. Try it!
