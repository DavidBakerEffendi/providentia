Sofia's is my fav place in NYC.... It is so warm and inviting with impeccable service.  The ambiance is so romantic with there brick walls, dark wood floors, and vintage candle lighting. I especially love the wine cellar feel with real homemade Italian food. It's a great place for either a date for a quaint feel or a gathering with some friends. You will especially love the variety of  wine choices makes it more unique! What can I say.. Great food, great wine, excellent service and great ambiance! Best wine bar i've ever been in Manhattan!! :-)
