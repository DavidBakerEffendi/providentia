Just had dinner there with my wife, they were busy, the hostess set us along the windows. Our waitress Wendy was very attentive, and knowledgable. Got our food in a nice timely manner, the manager Leslie, check a few times to see how was our experience. We started with manitaria saganaki, portobello mushrooms with melted cheese in a tomato sauce, excellent. For our main course, I had a daily special, Chilean seabass, saut√©ed with a lemon garlic sauce, with tomato and capers, my wife had lamb chops. For desserts, we shared a gallactoburico (that's sounds like that) Will highly recommended
