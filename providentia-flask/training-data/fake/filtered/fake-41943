The food is amazing and as authentic as Mexican food can get in Philly! The guacamole is fresh and you get to make it yourself by filling out a guacamole card. We shared the flatbread to start and it was delicious and topped with a generous portion of mushrooms and artichokes. For entrees I had the camarones which were absolutely amazing and a lil spicy which I love. My girlfriend had the chicken tacos and she said they were amazing as well. The margaritas were fresh and delicious with no hint of sour mix which was a pleasant surprise. I highly recommend this place for anyone who enjoys good food.
