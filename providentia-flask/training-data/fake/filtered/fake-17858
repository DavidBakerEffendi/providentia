Me and my friend ate there last night and the service was amazing and the food was okay. I ordered a salmon plate and my friend ordered one of the bucket of crabs. There wasn't a lot of meat at all inside those legs and for that price. Then we asked if they had military discount, said yes and got the manager. She snatched our I.Ds and staring at it for awhile then asked what branch it was. All the while she was being extremely rude and snarky. Then she said we don't do dependents only active, and we exclaimed saying sorry that our husbands are over seas fighting for your country. Her name was Kelly and that was beyond disrespectful. Would never go back just due to her.
