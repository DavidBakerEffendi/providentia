Hands down the best greek restaurant in Central NJ.  The service was impeccible, from our very patient waitress, Jasmine, to the owner Tassos, our every need and question was handled.  We went with a group of four and we all ordered something different. I ordered the Lamb Shank with Orzo in a pot...it was unbelievable!  Tender, falling off the bone, and sooo tasty.  The best Ive ever had.  Their sangria, was also outstanding, not too sweet.  The ambiance of the retaurant is so authentic, blue and white, very Mediterranian.  Loved it and would highly recommend to anyone.  Even if you think you don't like greek food, or have never had greek food, I guarantee  you will find something on the menu that you will love!
