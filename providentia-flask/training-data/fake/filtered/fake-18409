Meh. We ate here on a Sunday night. Our server was the best. Very attentive, gave great recommendations, brought requests promptly. The food was just OK. I had the Royal Palm Dates and the Grilled Bronzino. The bacon around the dates was overdone and there wasn't quite enough blue cheese on top. The Bronzino tasted "fishier" than what I expected. I'm not a fan of capers, so I thought there were way too many on mine, but that is personal preference. The chickpeas under the fish were good. The people I ate with got the Marlin Tacos and the Chicken Combo. They said both were good. Good Â but too little seasoning on the chicken. They were surprised with the cheese on the rice with that dish. And the tacos had good flavor but they were expecting them to be more amazing and more seasoning. Maybe a little more marlin too. As far as the facility, it was clean, dimly lit, and the music was loud for a Sunday night. Luckily we were able to walk in and get a table. But on other weekend nights it is recommended that you get a reservation.
