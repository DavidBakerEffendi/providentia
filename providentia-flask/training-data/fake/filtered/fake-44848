We have been to dinner twice, brunch once and lunch once. The dinners and brunch were good. When the place is empty the service is excellent. However, when it gets busy things can get a bit frazzled. I am hoping that there is not a high turnover among the wait staff. . The service breaks seem to stem mostly from the kitchen. I think that there are some communication problems between the kitchen and the waitrons. For lunch we ate outside. I think that there does need to be better service at the outside tables. This area was not really staffed by anyone. Just a suggestion..... Gold Standard might want to consider putting out a bench for those waiting for the trolley. This would help decompress the tables and demarcate the eating area and the sidewalk/trolley stop area.
