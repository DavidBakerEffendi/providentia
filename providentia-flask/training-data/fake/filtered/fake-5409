I love this place! I love the atmosphere. Inside is quite artsy which is nice something much nicer than your everyday chain restaurants. The food is out of this world.. I always have an enjoyable dining experience when I go to Cafe Matisse. Their desserts are also something to brag about, very tasty and just the right amount after a delicious dinner. I have not had the chance sit in their outdoor garden, but I plan to this spring/summer Delicious!
