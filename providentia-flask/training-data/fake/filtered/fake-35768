Girls weekend in NYC Columbus Day Weekend found us at the Bleecker Kitchen on 643 Broadway our last day. Thanks to the Yelp recommendation, we ventured to Bleeckers and the place was packed!! It was a Sunday at 11:30 and even though the host knew he had many more reservations, he found a place for us, service was fantastic and food even better!! Thanks for making our last dining experience the best we had all weekend. The Fredonia Girls
