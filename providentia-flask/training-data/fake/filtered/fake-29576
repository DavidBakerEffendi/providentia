I am giving a two star because I am suffering in the bathroom. There is a thunder storm in my stomach. I spent $50.00 to feel miserable. I think the fried chicken made me sick. Looks like they use some sort of cheappy or dirty oil. The chicken sucks. the banana pie was good and earn the two star ratings. My family was disappointed. My son love fried chicken and the first bite he made on it, he toss it out. I was like WHAT? right there was a bad sign. I think this place was on the food channel and people gone crazy to eat there. BYE pie-n thighs-n-food poisoning. Importantly, you guy are too expensive. KFC is much tasty and cheaper.
