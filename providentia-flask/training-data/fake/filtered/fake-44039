I love this place! I have been going to the EV location for a while (special trips and all...) and was so happy when they opened in my neighborhood. The food is delicious and the staff is friendly and laid back. My favorites are the mulata, the watercress salad with papaya dressing and the coconut milkshake. As far as the no booze situation, yeah, it would be nice to have a beer with my meal but it is not that big of a deal because the food is so great!
