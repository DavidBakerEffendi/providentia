We had a family dinner at Agricola one recent Friday night, with five in our party. The decor and staff's attire hit you over the head with the "farm to table" theme, as the place had a lot of rustic elements and the staff were all in plaid shirts. OK, we get it. Â Prices were on the high side overall. What was really appalling was the scallop dinner. Menu descriptions were flowery and pretentious, but it did say the meal contained scallops and corn, and a sauce. Cool- two of us ordered the meal. For $27 each dinner, this is what we got: 3 scallops, a sprinkling of 5-10 kernels of corn (no kidding!), a little sauce, and French-fried onions as garnish. We could not believe they had the nerve to serve 3 scallops and little else for $27!!! It would have been appropriate as a $12 appetizer! Other meals were of appropriate portions, though my husband's medium-well steak came out rare or medium-rare. We would not go there again. Too much gimmick, too little of what counts.
