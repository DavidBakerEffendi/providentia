The dining experience here is absolutely what you would expect from a world class 5 star restaurant.  The apple scent upon entry is delicious.  The restaurant is beautiful with nice domed. Food and atmosphere are amazing. Unique experience. Overall a great experience. We were seated in the lower floor so it was very quiet and the room wasn't filled at any point when we were there. We were definitely the largest party.
