Great food, service and drinks! I tried the salt & pepper calamari and my friend had the sliders, all was very good. Place has a dark and intimate vibe, live music and a small dance floor...which is perfect for when you've had one too many drinks, an easy thing to do here. Definitely would go there again and recommend it. The only thing was the location, not too familiar with the area but there seemed to be a ton of dark bars etc. Wouldn't walk around there alone at night if you're a girl but I guess you can say that about a few areas in NYC.
