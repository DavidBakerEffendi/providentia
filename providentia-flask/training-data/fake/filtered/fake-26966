Went to Guild and Co. for the first time (and probably the last) this weekend. We were seated and service was prompt and very cordial. We ordered drinks, and placed our dinner order. Soon the bread and salads arrived. Both were very good, and contrary to what we had previously heard, we adequate in size. My wife and I ordered the Ribeye for two and we were both looking forward to dinner. Once we had our meals delivered our excitement soon tuned to disappointment as we were handed the toughest piece of meat I have ever had anywhere. This cut of meat at $42.00 each, would make shoe leather enticing. In hindsight we probably should have sent it back, but since we were eating with a group, we did not want to ruin the entire evening as the rest of out table, who would have had to wait for us. Bottom line, if you want to purchase a $10.00 steak go anywhere, it will probably be a better cut of meat. If you want to spend $42.00 for a $10.00 cut of meat then head on over the Guild and Co.
