Mediocre food served in a setting with little ambiance. The waitress was inattentive never checked on us. The issue arose when we tried to use a coupon and was told we could not use it on a lunch special menu. She said "You should have asked me for a different menu" - first time visitor so how are we to know?! She was very rude and got the manager whose rudeness was in another stratosphere. They begrudgingly agreed to honor the coupon but when I gave her cash, she charged us the full amount after snatching the money out of my hand. Talk about juvenile behavior that included hollering after us as we left the restaurant. Â Don't waste your money or your time!
