After four trips here, I've concluded that this is the best Chinese restaurant for vegetarians in the Princeton area. The ingredients are consistently fresh, and there is a decent selection on the menu. The wait staff will also make veg versions of things on request (such as hot and sour soup for two, which is highly recommended). The place looks a little shabby, but don't let that put you off. It's pretty inexpensive, and the food will not disappoint.
