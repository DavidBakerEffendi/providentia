The Curry comes as a separate sauceon top of a pile of sticky rice.  I had the Chicken  Curry Plate and it was just ok.  It came with some breaded/ fried chicken cutlets, rice and the curry sauce.  In my opinion the curry sauce needs further work. The staff  is really very friendly, so I have to give Go! Go! Curry!
