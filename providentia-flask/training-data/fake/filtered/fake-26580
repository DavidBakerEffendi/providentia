The company I work for orders here a few times a month and I decided to order along with them. I ordered a Chicken Caprice Panini (grilled chicken, plum tomatoes, fresh mozz, arugula and tomato sauce). The picture on the website of the other chicken panini they make looked pretty good, so i thought the panini I ordered would be great. Well it was gross. It was grilled chicken that was orange for some reason (no it wasn't sauce on it), the tomatoes were old (whitish looking) round tomatoes, no sauce, tiny bit of mozz and the "arugula" looked more like regular lettuce and there was even a few pieces that were rotten (whitish brown). So my co-worker ended up calling (I didn't want her to) and demanded we get another sandwich because we paid $8 (tax &tip..even though they made us go down to the car and get it). They guy was arguing with her and said that they only use fresh ingredients and that the cook doesn't make mistakes. After she told him our company orders from there a lot he ended up bringing us a new sandwich, additonal sandwich and a slice of dessert. The new sandwiches were better but I would never order from there again.
