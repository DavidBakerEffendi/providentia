We finally tried the new place in town.  Food was good but took too long.  We waited 45 minutes for ravioli, an appetizer and shrimp dish on a Sunday at 5:30 pm.  Then when it finally came out, the wait staff was all over us to clean up our dishes, so the 15 minutes we were eating, they must have come by 5 times to clean up our dishes.  Big turn off.
