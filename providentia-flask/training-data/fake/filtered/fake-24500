You will wait an extremely long time for good food. I did, in fact, say "good food." It's not incredible, and it's far from disappointing. You tell the hostess how many people in your party, then she gives you a number and you wait until your number is called. In my case, we were told 45 minutes for the wait. 1 hour and 35 minutes later we were finally seated. The soup dumplings were good, but no better than others I've had. We got a stir fried noodle and seafood dish that was extremely good. I have no problem waiting a long time for food - it just didn't quite live up to the expectation.
