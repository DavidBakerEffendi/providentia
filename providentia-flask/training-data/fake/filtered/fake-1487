I've always thought of this as a great place however, they changed their bar menu and it is not as good or as satisfying as what they had before. Their hummus was sub par and the selection does not due for someone with an appetite. I got there after lunch and before dinner so the bar menu was all that was available which used to be okay but no longer is. I had the salmon sliders but they were just okay, nothing to write home about. Our waitress was great though. If I go back, I would not go in their in between hours if I am hungry. I debated between 3 and 2 stars but I figure their Lunch and Dinner menus are probably still really good.
