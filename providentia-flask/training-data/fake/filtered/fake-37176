Have to say the pizza is really good. Simple- flour, tomato sauce, mozz, and grated cheese with some small cherry tomatoes. Nice to have a "different" pizza thats shaped like an oval b/c its wood fired! Pretty cool. Now if only they could be more consistent with pricing- I feel like one time i paid 19, then i hear 14, then 16. You should have set prices! Pretty good though.
