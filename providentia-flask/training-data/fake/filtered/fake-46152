Terrible for big parties. You have your entire group together because they don't let you add on to an open table. They claim it's their older order system that doesn't allow it. So we had to split a birthday party because 2 people were late. The hostesses were not accomedating at all. The food and service is excellent in all fairness but pads on this place unless your group is ready to go.
