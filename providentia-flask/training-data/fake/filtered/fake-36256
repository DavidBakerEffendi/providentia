My husband and had our post-elopement brunch at Isabella's last month.The restaurant has been a favorite of ours, every since I took him there for a birthday brunch a year ago. We've since been back many times, with Olivier hailing it the "best eggs benedict in New York" (and he's tried quite a few!). On our special day, the waitstaff and general manager, Kim, made it a point to make us feel royal, even sending champagne over and wishing us well in our marriage. What a classy place! Just as superb as the cuisine is the attentiveness and friendliness the waiters. We've always been treated with respect and kindness, no matter how busy or full Isabella's is. Sadly, this is a rarity in restaurants these days. We will honor the tradition set-forth by making it a point to have our anniversary brunch or dinner at Isabella's. And, of course, we'll be popping in a many Sundays in between.
