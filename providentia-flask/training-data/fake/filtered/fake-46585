This place is absolutely gorgeous- the garden is perfect for a warm evening date. The food was incredible (we had the clam and gnocchi appetizer, morel and cherry salad, crispy duck breast, and atlantic bass). Good cocktails too. What a perfect dining experience for a fairly reasonable price. I'll be going back for my next special occasion/ fancy date night.
