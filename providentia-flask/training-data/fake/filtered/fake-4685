If you want to taste the best ROAST BEEF SANDWICH ever made then you have to come to NICK'S ROAST BEEF in South Philly on the corner of 20th & Jackson Sts. Slow roasted & simmering BEEF like GRANDMA used to make. It is tender, juicy, delicious, and OUTRAGEOUSLY GREAT! Just give me a Roast Beef Combo/(Roast Beef/Provolone) Xtra WET (Dipped in Au Jus) with Insane Gravy Fries (Soaked in Au Jus) with a side of Broccoli RABE and BAMMMM! An Explosion of juices in your mouth. My family and I have been going for more than 20 years and its like HOME SWEET HOME. Trust me when I tell you, when you eat the first one you will not leave without another one to go or eat it right there. They also have a ROAST PORK COMBO AND ROAST HAM COMBO that are also EQUALLY DELICIOUS.
