Lombardi's is the place to go for a very fresh pie (no by-the-slice options to my knowledge).  It's a little on the expensive side with a regular cheese pie of decent size running you about $19-21.  Their delivery range is great; they will go all the way down to FDR & Grand st. based on my experience and with the large amount of orders they are receiving, offer a fair delivery time of about 30-45min.   It's a great place to bring some out-of-towners or go yourself if you are sightseeing.  Keep in mind the price is a little on the higher end but you're paying for quality and ambiance/nostalgia.   Their pie: Is extremely fresh, always. A little bit on the thin side. Expect a "splotches" style pie, with intermittent generous amounts of fresh mozzarella and a great sauce underneath.   If you are dining in, be prepared to wait... especially on weekends, lunch-time, and nights.   Lombardi's is my favorite place to go for the type of pie they offer -- light, a little on the sweet side, and with fresh mozzarella.
