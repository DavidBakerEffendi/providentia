This is one of the worst restaurant from hospitality point. Having heard of good things about this place, my wife decided to celebrate my birthday here. There was no waiting and we were given a table and menu. Â One waiter showed up and brought water for us and we waited for about 30 mins and no one came for taking an order. We also saw an old lady complaining that she was waiting on the table, every one else on her table got food except her and finally when she got it, it was not the right one. Both my kids became impatient and so We decided to walk out and never go to the wayne restaurant. Horrible experience in all
