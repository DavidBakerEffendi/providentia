This is a great spot.While waiting for a colleague out front, David brought me ginger tea, was very accommodating. Â Their falafel sandwich (actually more like a wrap) may be the best I've ever had. I think the secret is slivers of pickeled turnip in the fallafel wrap. The humus appetizer was fantastic and a large portion. If u like falafel, must try Amalias
