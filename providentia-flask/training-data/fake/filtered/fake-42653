I went here all the time growing up, and it wasn't until I left Lawrence that I realized I had it so good at home. Every single bagel, spread and sandwich I've had at Maidenhead is top-notch. I've been to plenty of great bagel places from New York, Boston, wherever, but nothing tops Maidenhead in my mind.
