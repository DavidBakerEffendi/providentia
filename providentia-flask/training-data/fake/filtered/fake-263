I was on a roadtrip and wanted to see what the hype was about with genos Â so we redirected our route and went there. What a waste of time, it was "customer appreciation day" like anyone wants to listen to that clown suckin up to joey vento and playing oldies music. The food was crappy and scrappy. There was almost no meat and the cheese was hardly melted. Ive had better at subway. He should really change the name of the place to genos world famous best philly breadwich because thats all there was too it. Dont waste your time at that dump and go to quiznos.
