I have eaten here 3 times in the past 2 weeks. The first time was for Brunch and I had the Chestnut pancakes and a Bloody Mary which were really good - found out later the pancakes were also gluten-free, bonus! Dinner was just as good both times, if not better. For my two dinner visits I had the following and I easily recommend either: -octopus appetizer -duck appetizer -rabbit rigatoni -pappardelle bolognese. The cocktail I had was called Victrola. Let's just say i'll be back for a fourth time very soon.
