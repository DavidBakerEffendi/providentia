I had bfast on 11/17/15 at 8:30 am.  The atmosphere is wonderful with the hanging baskets, delicious aromas and old-world Italia ambience.  Staff is  friendly and patient.  The breakfast platter was fresh and delicious,  the cappucino was to die for.  It is wonderful that First n Last has kept the timeless paesano atmosphere of Hartford's southend. A great place to go to bring back memories of the "old" days of Hartford. Every Bulkeley High School attendee will love it, as will all others who want a relaxing breakfast with huge picture windows overlooking Maple Ave:-)  NB Parking in the front lot can look crowded, but there is plenty more parking in the back of the building.
