What a nice homey restaurant.  Our family went to celebrate a birthday.  My sister has talked about this place for a long time.  We came for breakfast and was surprised at the line to get in.  But once inside we understood.  The cozy atmosphere was truly enjoyable. There were people of all ages and it felt right.  The food was delicious.  My favorite part of the meal was the rich hot chocolate. Perfect for the cold weather. When I come back to visit, I'll come again.  Well worth the wait in line :)
