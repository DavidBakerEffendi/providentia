Best place ever!  Don't expect white glove service or fancy decor.  DO expect the best baked clams ever.  Follow with linguini (always cooked perfectly) with shrimp Luciano and finish with Veal Don Peppe (pounded veal chop, fried with chopped onions and tomatoes).  One of the best meals on the planet!  The Broccoli Rabe and chopped salad get honorable mention.
