hands down my favorite new restaurant in brooklyn. the vibe is amazing, real mediterranean comfort food in a relaxed unpretentious setting. it had a local feel to it from day one and i'm happy to see it becoming a real fixture in the neighborhood. i've been going since they opened so i had a chance to enjoy the space last summer when they open the big front windows. they also have a kick ass back patio in the warmer months, it has very european feel to it. perfect for late summer nights. might be the best place ever for a first date, but also works for large groups, or going solo and sitting at the bar. that's always a good place to meet people anyway. attentive staff. great music choices always seem to be playing when i'm there. amazing wine choices. great cocktails. good lighting. stand out dishes for me: the brussels sprouts, flakey bread and the rabbit. yum.
