Porteno is hands-down the best decision you can make any day of the week. The wait staff are beyond excellent--they treat you like family. The owners make sure you have the most exquisitely unique and delightfully memorable experience each and every time you go. And the food, oh the food! We have been to Porteno more than a dozen times and have never been disappointed. Whatever you get, whatever looks good to you, you will enjoy. I assure you! It may be slightly off the beaten path, but head on over, walk the Highline, and then treat yourself to the best dining New York has to offer!
