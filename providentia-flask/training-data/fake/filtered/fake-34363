This place is amazing! The food is wonderful and fresh, and the atmosphere can't be beat. We live in the neighborhood and are always on the lookout for a new place to eat, and we were happy to see Ethiopian food had moved in. So....of course we went in - and it was just the nicest experience. We had the vegetarian platter for 2...tons of deliciousness! The shiro was our favorite of all the dips, and we added the fitfit appetizer, which was delicious as well. The breads were soft and light, and everything was just great. Nicely seasoned, interesting flavors. The creme caramel was to die for at the end -- a delightful surprise! Besides the delectable food, this is just a lovely place to dine. Plus, the staff and owner are very sweet -- really exceptionally nice people! -- and they made us feel very welcome and special. We love Injera!
