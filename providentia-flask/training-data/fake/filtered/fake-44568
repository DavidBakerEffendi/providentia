We had planned to have lunch at the restaurant today, but we had a straggler that was going to be late getting to the table. He would have been happy to get something to go, but the restaurant still wouldn't let us sit down - they made us sit at the bar until he showed up. We found this attitude to be course and aloof and chose not to stay. We instead went less than a block away and had a great lunch at the Tribeca Grill - really good food and friendly to business diners. I will not be returning to Locanda Verde, unfortunate we didn't get to try them. Cheers  -  Ron
