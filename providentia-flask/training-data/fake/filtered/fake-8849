Okay to start i was so woo hoo about this lil hidden treasure. The Falafel's are on point most of the time. Last month id experienced an unpleasantness with the staff(ponytail dude). They were closing and i guess instead of making a pleasnt falafel like usual i got hacked leftovers drowned in seasame oil sauce. There was atleast a cup off sauce pouring out the bottom. Five min would of made dinner pleasant. Spent the night with my good 'ol porcelin buddy.All i in all 2 of 5 stars
