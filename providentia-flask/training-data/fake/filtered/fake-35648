I've been going to Penny Cluse since it opened around a decade ago. (My sis and I love to go together.) Every single meal I've ever had there has been absolutely wonderful. I have tried most of the menu and have multiple favorites. It's hard to choose from all of my favs, but what a pleasant task! The space is cool; it is sunny and showcases amazing art. The food is really, really tasty. The waitstaff is great, and always around to warm up your coffee/see how everything is. Sometimes the food is pretty rich, but it really depends on what you order. (I've had many an awesome, lean, and healthy meal there; I've also had quite a few superb carb/fat bombs. Mmm.) A freshly squeezed and poured cypress or mimosa with a friend at Penny Cluse is such a good way to start a day off from work, too. Going to Penny Cluse is a ritual for me; a special, yummy, friendly experience.
