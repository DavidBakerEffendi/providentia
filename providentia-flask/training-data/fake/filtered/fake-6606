Great prices, delicious dough that was cooked well and still hot on delivery. We ordered a pile of pizzas and salad for a work lunch this week. The variety of pizzas were all delicious and the side salad came with some extra fixings and crumbled cheese! The "loaded" pizza had thick cut fresh mushrooms (I hate when restaurants used canned ones) and the onions were semi-caramelized so they were mild, but not too sweet. Delicious and thoughtful! We used to order from somewhere else, but for the price and, more importantly, the taste, I'd absolutely call Reno's!
