I was visiting from Miami,Florida and wanted to eat a good Philly cheese steak. I asked everyone I saw walking by where the best Philly cheese steak was. Most people said "Jims Steak's".So When I went there was a line to the exit. But most people said the line goes fast. It was true we were at the front door in less than ten minutes. when I got the cheese steak I went up stairs and ate the whole thing in 7 minutes! It was that good. After when I left I was thinking that that was so Delicious. So I went back and got another one.
