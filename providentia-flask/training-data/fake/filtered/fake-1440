SO RUDE!!! They say people in NYC are rude, but I've never felt that way, until I walked into Café Sabarsky. My friend and I ordered full breakfast, followed by their famous apple strudel. After we finished our food and drinks we kept sitting at the table, talking and catching up. We were served the bill without asking for it, which in itself is a common NYC custom, so I had no problem with it., but the waiter came back 4 times (!!!)  asking if we are ready to pay. We were sitting in the Cafe not more than 25 minutes when the Manager came up and told us that house rules were that you are not allowed to sit more than 20 minutes if you're not ordering more food... It was getting very unpleasant, and our conversation was interrupted too many times, so we payed and left. There was a small line at the door of people waiting for tables, but why kick out paying customers in favor of others? I didn't come for the food (its not that great) - I came to enjoy the atmosphere and have conversation. How rude to kick out paying customers! What comes to mind: Café Sabarsky is inside a German/Austrian museum and the manager's attitude did feel like he was inspired by the Nazi era. We will never set our foot in there again.
