Best calzone ever! And the pasta is delicious too. Humongous portions! Very nice young owner from a little town near Napoli. Legit Italian food. He told us, "You just need 1 calzone to share, I make them big!" And he meant it! They're closed on Sundays though, keep that in mind. Also, Google doesn't list the correct address. It's at 1257 Main St East Hartford.
