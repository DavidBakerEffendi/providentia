We went to to this place for a Saturday brunch. Even though the place markets itself as french restaurant the food was not french at all. The croque monsieur was just a very thick bread with mustard and a little bit tasteless cheese on top. The merguez and eggs were swimming on butter. Overall it was a bad experience for us.
