We had dinner at L'Artusi for our anniversary and had a wonderful evening. Our waiter was attentive, and the food was fabulous! Â The roasted mushrooms were our favorite dish of the evening, although the torte with salted caramel ice cream was a close second. We come to NYC every year for our anniversary and always pick new restaurants, but L'Artusi made such an impression we are doing a repeat performance next year! Sit upstairs if you want a more quiet atmosphere, as we did.
