We've been to this place many, many times - about 45 tmes a year since opening. Let me say the service we get from Tricia the waitress is phenomenal the other wait staff is also good. The specials offered aren't so special and are overpriced and not so good. Stick with the menu. Overall, food is good to delicious. Same with dessert - cannolis and gelato are delicious other desserts are ok. Sal, the owner is attentive.We really like this place but we have to keep it real.
