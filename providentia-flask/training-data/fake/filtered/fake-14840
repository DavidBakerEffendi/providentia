Lovely setting in downtown Newark. Comfortable, relaxed and gracious venue. An extensive menu with good food realistically priced and enthusiastic wait staff. I had a gluten free burger which was very good and NJ (our very pleasant and helpful waiter) checked with the chef to ensure my dietary needs were met.
