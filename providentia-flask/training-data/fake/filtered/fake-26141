I went to Ting Wongs for the first time today. I had the young Chow fried rice, it was as good as I have heard! The wonton soup was not what I expected, lots of greens and they were wonton balls... again it was very good! The only thing negative I have to say is... hot tea in a water glass?? Peculiar at best!! I highly recommend this authentic Chinese restaurant! I work in the city and I will be back again and again!!
