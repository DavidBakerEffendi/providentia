I used to like this restaurant, but my last few experiences have been disappointing. We waited over 45 minutes for a seat (ok that can be typical in any restaurant during dinner hour). But after we were seated, we waited 20 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence. When the food came, my husband's chicken was very dry. My steak was supposed to be cooked medium and it was RAW. Purple inside. I had to send it back 3 times just to get it close to medium. At that point it was so dried out from me cutting into it to see if it was cooked properly, I couldn't eat the whole thing. I'll go to Longhorn across the street next time.
