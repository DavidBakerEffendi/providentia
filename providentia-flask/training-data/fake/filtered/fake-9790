Not what I expected..........all I have to say is wow. I drive from ft dix area which is about 45 minutes. Well worthy the drive. The only bad part is the long drive home with the take out, I want to pull over on the side of the and eat without my wife. The people there are very friendly and will help you order the right food. A+++++ will be back soon
