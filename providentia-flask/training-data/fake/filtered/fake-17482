Do not go without a reservation. Hostesses claimed there was a two-hour wait on a weeknight, even when the sprawling, underground space seemed devoid of customers.  I've been here before and it's a good sake bar but I saw it as more of a place to have drinks and maybe a snack, not really a destination worthy of making a reservation.  For that sort of planning, there may be better choices.
