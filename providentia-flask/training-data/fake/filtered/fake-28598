I adore this place. It's cozy and sexy but also fine to bring kids (though best early, before it gets crowded). And of course it's all about the pizza. Good lordamighty, are the pies ever amazing. Sometimes I wonder if it might be nice to have a little salad or antipasto available too and then I think, nah, I love the simplicity of the pizza/calzone -only menu. I always leave this place with a great feeling. The owner's a sweetie, too.
