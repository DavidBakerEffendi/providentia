My wife and I try to eat here whenever we get the chance.  The food is fantastic and the service is top notch.  Just like the old school Italian restaurants the owner walks around and greets just about every table.  After only a few times in there he greeted us remembering that we didnt have our kids with us the last time.   Two dishes which I can highly recommend are thesSalmon and the veal amalfi.   Just remembering that my wife booked a small lunch time party for a friend and the service was great.
