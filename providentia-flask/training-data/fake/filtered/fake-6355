Spasso Italian Grille really is as good as it gets.  Pure Perfection!  I have eaten there on many occasions when I am visiting Old City.  The food is authentic Italian.  Always hot and fresh.   It has never been less than fabulous.  They even kindly prepared a dish that was not part of their regular menu for a family member of mine.  Ooh, and the bread and marinated vegetables are divine. Classy hostess and fine waiters.  The atmosphere is unpretentious.  I love the exposed brick and murals.  And...because it is important to me...the restrooms are always clean.
