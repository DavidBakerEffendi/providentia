Excellent French bistro.  The cheese plate was delicious, and dessert was fantastic -- both the profiteroles and the creme brulee were among the best I've ever had.  It can be difficult to get a table outside on the square, but the interior is like a page out of Paris.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable and checked in on us regularly.
