I have lived in Nutley for 15 yrs and have never been in there, tonight I decided to try it and the pizza was good but the place is filthy! the blinds have so much dust on it and the guy mixing the cheese without gloves, the floor is filthy in the work area underneath the table behind the counter, looks like it has never been cleaned, totally disgusting will never go back.
