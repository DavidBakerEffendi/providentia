Bibou is the kind of BYOB that I love about Philly. I had heard good things about it from friends, but the meal I had way exceeded expectations. First, we showed up with a party of 7, large for the intimate space that is Bibou. The hostess/owner/chef's wife was incredibly gracious about taking our champagne and putting it on ice. We sat down to a cold corn chowder amuse bouche. It was incredible. It came with a smoked salmon that was to die for. Every bite was corn, smoky goodness. We were there on a Sunday, which is $45 3 course price fixe, so we didn't have the entire menu to choose from, but the items I wanted were luckily still on the menu. I started with the foie gras, which was served with a spiced bread and a veal demi glace. Each bite was a little bit of unctuous heaven. Oh wait! I cannot continue until I mention the bread. The bread they put on the table is made in house and served with incredibly sexy imported french butter. Divine. I had the quail for main course, which was delish, but my brother had the bone marrow which was the star of the evening. The marrow was removed from the bone and mixed with sauteed mushrooms, breadcrumbs, and some other magical ingredients, placed back in the bone and then baked. It. Was. Amazing. I'm conflicted about writing such rave reviews about this place, because I want to go back, but don't want to have to battle for a reservation. This place is a gem in Philly and I hope the quality never changes.
