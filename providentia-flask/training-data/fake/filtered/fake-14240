TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I will NEVER eat here again and no one else should either.  They DO rip you off, but my gripe runs far deeper than cost.  It's about PRINCIPLE.  I told one of the owners (gift of gab), that the cake for dessert I had purchased had a long hair inside it, he simply said "oh, well thanks for tellin' us, see ya", and proceeded to HANG UP ON ME!!!!!! Mind you, I spend a lot of money here, and this is completely inexcusable and horrid customer service. I was about to place an order too, just wanted to give them a heads up as i know they don't make the cakes there themselves, or at least that's what I was told...... RUDE, UNPROFESSIONAL PEOPLE.
