If I would write this review 9 months ago it would probably have another star added but I've had some inconsistances that could've been easily prevented. I'm obsessed with their salad pizza. Normally this pizza is baked with the red sauce and then after a mixture of chopped lettuce, carrots, feta, olives and tomatoes is placed on top and served with their homemade dressing. I've ordered so many times for the past 9 months, they actually know my name. But at times when I have ordered o would get my pizza without the dressing or like yesterday got my pizza completely different. It was a cheese pizza with the salad on top and it changed the whole dynamic of flavor. Its frustrating. A couple times the workers would be confused as to what a salad pizza was. I dunno if they were trained incorrectly or they forget the recipe but there should be no excuse. Luckily when I complain they offer a free pizza. Other than that they have calzones that are said to be "small" but are as huge as your face. Their homemade sauce on their pizzas are ridiculously delicious. Their chicken fingers which are appetizers can easily be an entree. Bottom line is their delicious but make sure you talk to someone who isn't questioningthe order.
