Stopped in for drinks during their 4-7pm happy hour which is an awesome deal: $5 Mojitos, Margaritas, and Sangrias. They were on the smaller side but very tasty. Plus they had a long list of tequilas. Great service too from our bartender who let me sample two types of tequila (very awesome) and our server who was a very friendly redhead girl. I'll definitely be back for dinner very soon!
