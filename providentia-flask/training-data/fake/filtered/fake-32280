Brunch started off with the kind of fresh baked bread that you scarf up even though you know it will fill you up. The apple pancakes were delicious as was the savory cheddar burger and rosemary fries. My only regret is I didn't have the mushroom soup! Coffee and water was kept filled to the brim by our attentive server. The place is small but the seating is comfortable and it's great people watching. Looking forward to going back.
