The beer selection was very good. Had a Cisco Baggywrinkle dry hopped with citra on cask and the server brought over a sample of the non-cask version without me asking. Food was pretty good (I had short ribs). Only issue was I wanted another beer toward the end of the meal and the server did not come by for a while. Peanut butter cheesecake for dessert was not my thing. My last beer pour was a bit below the rim, but not absurdly low, would be nice to see it poured to the very top. They also used proper glassware!
