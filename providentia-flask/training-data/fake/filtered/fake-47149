We've been wanting to try this cozy byob and certainly were not disappointed. Although the lobster tempura was more deep fried then tempura it was sweet and moist and the fruit salsa it sat on was fresh and a perfect balance. Scallops and tuna were wonderful and if you enjoy Oreos then you can't go wrong with one dipped in funnel cake batter and deep fried served ala mode. Our waiter Matt was very informative about preparation and ingredients of the dishes and was extremely attentive! Our water was refilled countless times! Cheers to another great byob to enjoy our cellar collections!
