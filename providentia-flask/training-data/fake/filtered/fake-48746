I made reservations for 7pm on a Friday night. When I got there I was told that I could wait for a table in the dining room or get a seat in the bar area. I was kind of annoyed that reservations didn't mean near instant seating, and both of us were hungry, so we decided to just sit in the bar area. Bad idea. The noise level was absolutely ridiculous. The two of us could barely hold a conversation over people screaming in between gulps of their colorful martinis. This wasn't a young crowd either. Mostly middle-aged couples and a few get-togethers. My fault, I know. I guess I just wasn't expecting that kind of atmosphere for a place that claims to offer elegant riverside dining. The clientele was interesting. A lot appeared to be regulars, and a lot were very, very hammered. And loud. And doing very drunk and loud things like putting their dinner napkins on their heads and yelling. Lots of middle-aged women taking a girlfriend out and discussing mid-life crises. Food was pricey but generally ok. My steak was quite rare, however. Wait staff was very courteous. In summary, The Yardley Inn: A Neighborhood Bar for the Nouveau Riche. You can always buy nice things, but you can never buy class. A good place to take refuge when you find out your kid didn't get into Penn State Main or need an escape from the monotony of McMansion life.
