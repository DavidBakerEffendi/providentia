Had brunch here this weekend. The eggs NOLA and spinach/kale omelet Â were both something to write home about (I didn't eat both, but rather shared each with a friend). The atmosphere was precious, loved the outside seating in the back. The service was right on par with the food. I had a huge blister and was given a band-aid by the server, who also provided friendly conversation. Will definitely go back soon!
