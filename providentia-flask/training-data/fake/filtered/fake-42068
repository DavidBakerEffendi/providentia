This review is for the Luzzo's in Gansevoort Market. Pizza is great, however, they jacked up the prices without even telling customers. This used to be great pizza at a good price. They offered 1 margarita slice (which was actually 2 small slices, because the slices here are smaller than any normal pizza place) for $4. If you think about it, $4 for a slice of pizza is a bit extra, but since it's a slightly larger portion (the 2 little slices combined) and quality pie, it was worth it. Though the other day I went in and ordered a slice and I noticed they gave me 1 small slice, so I asked for another. I get to the counter to pay and it's $10... $10 for 2 small slices of pizza, that equal the size of 1 slice of pizza anywhere else... $5 for an irregularly small slice of pizza? Are you kidding?? Used to go here all the time for lunch. Will never go back.
