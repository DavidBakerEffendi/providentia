We recently stayed at the Hartness House as part of a wedding party.  The room was quite overpriced for providing no better quality than the motor lodge down the road.  The room had a very unpleasant odor and there was unrepaired water damage to the ceiling leaving a lengthy and rather unsightly crack.  The toilet was old and stained. The WiFi that was supposed to be available was out of range in our room, and when I asked front desk about it the following morning was informed that WiFi was not available in that part of the Inn.  While I expected the decor to be in an older style, I did not expect it to look like the leftovers from my grandmother's basement.  Overall, very disappointing and I wouldn't stay there again. I will note that the food was very good, and that was the high point of our visit.
