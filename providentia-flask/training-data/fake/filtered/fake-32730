Vesta has a rotating menu and you can always be sure that the food will be great! They source a lot of their food locally (Brooklyn Grange Farm in Astoria and upstate wines) and they are always friendly. Highlights (of late): the poached eggs for brunch are divine and their pizzas are always good (crispy crusts and the toppings are not held in lashings of cheese). We often come away feeling good after eating here. And, when we lived close by, would often order pizzas to go. The worst thing about moving from Astoria: no Vesta!
