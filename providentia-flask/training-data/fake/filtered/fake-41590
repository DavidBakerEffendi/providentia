Where to start, Got to the restaurant 20 mins before my reservation. Place was jammed, while waiting to be seated, some woman walking (more like running) out vomits all over my shoes and just keeps walking like nothing happened. We got sat down at around 8:30 that's a 50 mins wait for part of 4. By this time the bar started transforming to a club, so the music started getting louder and louder . The server was rude knew nothing about the wine list, we were looking for a nice Spanish wine and he's forcing french wine on us. Anyway, we order a whole bunch of tapas (like 15) and asked the server to spread them out because the table wasn't that big. GUESS WHAT!! All 15 at once, the food that was suppose to be hot was COLD.the soup was WATER DOWN and MICROWAVED.We were really disappointed. Overall experience rated 0 Food rating .5 Â disguised by the vomiting and no one apologies. And this coming from a big fan of tapas Restaurants. .NEVER AGAIN
