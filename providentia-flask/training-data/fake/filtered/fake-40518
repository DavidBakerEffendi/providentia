The Paris Inn is amazing. My fiance and I had our engagement party here this past weekend. Everyone there was so kind and helpful. They attended to all of our guests with such great respect! Everyone from the owner to the bartender made us feel like we were family! The food was amazing! Our guest couldn't stop talking about it. We couldn't have asked for a better place to have such an important event. We honestly can not thank them enough for making such a special night go so perfect! We look forward to going back to the Paris Inn soon!
