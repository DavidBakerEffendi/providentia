simply delicious... the best Napolitan Pizza Â I have ever had outside Naples.... though u might wait a little bit to be seated on weekends, is worth it. try th truffle pate' pie or the arugola, they are to die for. great wine selection by the glass. the waiters apparently all italians were very warm and friendly. we had a goat cheese salad and a platter of cold cuts as well as a tiramisu. everything was authentic. give it a try, u won't regret it
