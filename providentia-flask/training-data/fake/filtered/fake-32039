You know me I am always in the mood for sushi, so when I heard about this restaurant from my home girls I had to try it out. The cost is reasonable for the quality of the food and it seemed like the food that I had was fresh. I was greatly impressed with the all you could eat sushi buffet and truly pigged out.             I give the place 5 stars because I enjoyed it and I recommend it to all sushi lovers in the essex county area.
