I have worked in the restaurant/hospitality industry for over 10 years, and am a frequent customer of Woodrow's. I have had nothing but great experiences at this bar. The food is always good, paint night is so much fun and the staff has always been genuinely hospitable to me and every other patron I have encountered. The waitstaff and owners know all their regulars' names and make a sincere effort to make sure all their guests are taken care of and have a good time. This is a great spot to watch a game, hang with coworkers or throw a private party (the downstairs room is amazing!). If you are grateful for the amazing, eclectic restaurant industry NYC has, and respectful of the hard working people that keep it running, you will love Woodrows too!
