Its a great place that has clearly ironed out what must have been some earlier kinks along the learning curve. It was busy today but the service was efficient, and a sample was graciously offered to someone who inquired about an item. Hand assembled delicious and fresh food is naturally going to have some prep time. If you want a really fast pre-made not very good sandwich you might as well go elsewhere. If you want thoughtful and delicious food made by people that show that they care about what they are doing, then eat here.
