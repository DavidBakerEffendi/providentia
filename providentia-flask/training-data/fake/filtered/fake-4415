Best brunch I've had in a very long time...the Bluebird is back!! We had brunch at the Bluebird yesterday, and it was excellent. The food was amazing--we had crispy corned beef hash, and the farmhouse poached eggs with house cured ham and hash browns. There were four of us, and everyone was thrilled with their food. We also had a great bottle of wine, french-pressed coffee, and a yummy fried egg and grilled Red Hen toast for our son. Everything was excellent--including the service (which I often find completely lacking in this town) and the ambiance, and even the music (good & not too, too loud). Oh, and the prices were excellent. All entrees were less than $13. I can't wait to go back for brunch and dinner too.
