I know that the other review thought very highly of this place.  I gave it one star only because the garden was fantastic.  To give it more would imply that the food was any good but it was not.  The people were nice and the service was okay.  But the garden is a great place to sneak away; like a secret getaway.  Just stay away from the food (our babaganush was frozen; there was ice in it ).
