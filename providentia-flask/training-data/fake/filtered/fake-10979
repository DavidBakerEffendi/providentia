I was looking forward to this place, but was sorely disappointed. I never take the time to write reviews, but this was so awful I had to. Food was decent, but service was atrocious. I'd only recommend for people that want expensive fast food as you have slightly less than an hour to complete your meal. As a daughter of a restaurant owner and chef, as well as having managed restaurants, I don't think they are worthy of repeat business or anything but poor word of mouth marketing. Very offended to have dropped so much money to not have time to eat everything we ordered. Restaurants in Chinatown have more tact. I recommend many restaurants and lounges and this will not be one of them.
