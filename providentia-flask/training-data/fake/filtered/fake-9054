the food was mediocre, service was horrible. there was about 4 different groups waiting, clearly there was enough room outside but the server asked us to go outside and wait in the 10 degree cold. Not only that he only asked my group and on other group, while he let the others stay in the warmth. After 20 minutes, we got our seat. The server was quick to take the order but did not return for 30 minutes. We order pancakes and an omelet, normally 10 minutes max. The other tables around us left and new groups came in and got their food before we were able to get an answer for any server. Again the service was horrible, rude and biased. Clearly taking care of certain types of customers. The food was bland and normal, not worth the price I had to pay
