Great, Great food. Found this place looking for ceviche. Got so much more than that. Some of the most delicious ceviche. Also, had the lamb tacos and steak tacos. The tostadas are great as well. I've both eaten in and ordered take out. Only one problem the few times I've been here and that was missing a couple of sauces once when I ordered takeout. After mentioning it once, the nice woman at the counter doubled up on them the next time and Â it never happened again so no big deal. I will def continue to eat here for many years to come.
