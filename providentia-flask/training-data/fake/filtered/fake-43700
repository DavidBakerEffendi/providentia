We love this place since the day it opened in our neighborhood! If you think this place is great, imagine what it was like when it was brand new. The place was perfect perfect perfect it every sense from food, to service, to napkins, to cups, etc. Attention to details has gone down considerably since but it is still very good. Best time to go for dinner is Wen - Sat before 7pm (before the dinner rush) and for brunch on the weekends before 10am or after 1pm.
