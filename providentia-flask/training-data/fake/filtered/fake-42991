It's a very good place to eat, but today I got so mad going there... i went to eat with my family and the guy in charge of the meat is a very, but very nasty, stupid and ignorant, I just ask a question about one of the meat and he answered me like if I was stupid and I got so pissed, that we end up leaving the place without eating...I hope the owner pay attention to this, because employee like that, he will be facing the problem that people will not go there to eat anymore, like us.
