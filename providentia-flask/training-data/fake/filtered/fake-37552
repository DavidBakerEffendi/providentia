So i actually really like the food here but i had such a bad experience when trying to order over the phone on a friday lunchtime that I'm just going to say "don't buy from these jerks." Apparently it was busy, so when i called to place my order the guy said we're really busy (he was really rude) and then hung up. So, i called back and asked him not to hang up, and he just said "i told you we're really busy" laughed (apparently this was really funny to him) and then hung up again. So basically, if you are successful, and busy, you get to be really rude to your customers? I don't think so. Not in this town. As i say, jerks.
