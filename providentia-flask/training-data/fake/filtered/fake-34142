This is a place you go to have a long drawn out dinner with good friends, talk for a couple hours, and enjoy a delicious meal.  A cute little find in a city with mostly pizza places!  I was so happy to discover it and have been back more than half a dozen times.  Anyone who thinks the meals are less than fabulous has no appreciate for good food.  My boyfriend rarely enjoys the rushed-out-the-door restaurants in the US but loved this place.  The lava cake is my absolute favorite dessert (and I've tasted a few lava cakes!)  One needs to go in with the expectation that this will not be a quick dinner and then just enjoy the atmosphere and company.   The owners have worked hard to build their restaurant up and take great pride in it.  They love to serve!
