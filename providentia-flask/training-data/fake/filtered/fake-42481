Lulu's is the epitome of what is good about New Haven and why we don't want to move, even as property taxes are driving us to the poor house. The coffee is excellent--a strong, potent cup. There is a variety of pastries; we've tried several and enjoyed them all. And the atmosphere makes it--lots of local folks, discussing local issues, the news, life in general. The intimate size and the lack of computers, cell phones, etc, make this possible. My only complaint is that I wish it had longer hours--would be great to stop by after work.
