Ordered from Khmer kitchen now 2 times and have dined 3 times. We were so disappointed in our service to take Khmer Kitchen food to other people. Spoke with Tony first and he was too busy to take a complaint so I was transferred to RICK. Rick  was supposed to be the GM and handle such suggestions. He listened to our suggestions and compared his service to a Chinese takeout. For 30.00 takeout I expected utensils, napkins, condiments, plates if asked and every other aspect of dining in. If you want to charge entrée prices and give Chinese takeout service dont expect return visits. The food has potential for a long term run, but the difference between real restaurants and flashes of greatness lies with management. Poor choice of handling loyal patrons, their loss. Good Luck Rick!
