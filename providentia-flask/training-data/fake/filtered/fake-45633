Went to Black Bear with friends for lunch on a busy Friday and all I can say is YEA! The wait staff was superb. The turkey burger wrap I ordered was perfect! Parking was easy, well this time it was. I ordered the pint of Guinness to drink and it was delicious. I would recommend coming at lunch time the crowd is more professionals on there lunch hour. At night time its a younger crowd. Add Black Bear to your Hartford lunch spots you'll be glad you did.
