Absolutely love this place! Have been coming here for years and have never been let down. The sushi is excellent and the staff is extremely nice. I have tried just about everything on the menu and can't say I have found a bad item. They have a great lunch special and fair prices overall. If you find yourself in Nutley it is definitely worth a shot.
