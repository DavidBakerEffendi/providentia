I have visited this restaurant at least 6 times in the last 3 years.  Nothing really prompted me to write a review before; however, the last time I was there I witnessed the owner drop the "F" bomb on a customer and told him to leave.  I seriously didn't think anything about it until yesterday - because my partner and  I were craving pizza,; and we ended up there. When we entered the dining room, my partner was scoping the very small dining room for seats.  I watched the owner turn and raise his eyebrows, and then he turned away.  My partner asked if we could be seated and seriously I saw the look of disdain on his face.  When we sat down, I told my partner that I would be okay with leaving but he convinced me to "let it go!"  Seven minutes later, no one came over except the girl that sets up the tables.  So we decided to leave.  As we were walking out, the owner sarcastically says, "Yeah, thanks for coming in!"  Neither one of us said anything, then he said it louder - which prompted me to say, "Yeah, thanks!"  He says it again, and raises his hand, points to the door and waives his hand.  Basically, telling us to get out!   Honestly, I know this place has it's niche and has it's fans, but if this is how a owner behaves - why be a public figure in the restaurant business?  He is vulgar and rude.  We won't be returning - ever!
