Wow, I almost hate to write this as I dont want it to get any harder to get a table but they truly treat you like family here and remember all the regulars.  Best to go with a group and do the dinner package which they serve unlimited wine, a bunch of appetizers, then pastas, then meats and then desserts.  You dont pick the items, the just bring it out to you and it is a good deal at around $60 per head.  This way you get to try a whole bunch of stuff family style!
