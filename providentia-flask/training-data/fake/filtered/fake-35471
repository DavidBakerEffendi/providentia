I really can't believe that I've been to the same place as those of you who give Brickyard glowing reviews.  I've been there twice since they opened a little over a year ago.  The first time was shortly after they opened.  I sat at the bar and ordered a vodka martini - which was served to me in a plastic Miller Lite cup by the bartender, who said, "Yeah, sorry, I'm out of glasses."  Seriously?  And it's not like I got a discount or anything on it. The second time was last week, when a friend and I stopped in on a weekday at about 6pm.  We again sat at the bar and waited.  And waited.  And waited some more.  There was no contact from the bartender whatsoever - no nod, no eye contact, and definitely not any "Hey guys, I'll be with you in a second."  We were just ignored for more than 10 minutes, at which point my friend (who also happens to be a bartender) said, "This is ridiculous - let's just go somewhere else."   In short, you can all keep this overpriced "gastropub."  I'll gladly go spend my money somewhere else.
