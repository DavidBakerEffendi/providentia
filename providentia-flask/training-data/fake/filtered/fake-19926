A great Austrian flavour in Manhattan. Cozy and friendly athmosphere, you would not imagine how that little kitchen could surprise you. The staff is very attentive and ready to advise on your choices even on weekend nights when the place is really packed! They go out of their way to make sure you are happy and have everything you need. Food quality is impeccable as is the service. Wide choice of excellent European wines and beers, also great cocktails. Worth a visit whenever you are in town. If you have to wait for a table go have a nice cocktail half a block up on C at The Third Man and they will call you when your table is ready.
