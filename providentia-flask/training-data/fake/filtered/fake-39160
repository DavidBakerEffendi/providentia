Wow, is all i can say, I have been here multiple times. Yesterday was one my most recent  visits. This place was jumping, very busy! The selection of toppings and specialty burgers is unsurpassed in Philly.  The meat quality is excellent. My new favorite is the Prime burger, hormone free and grass fed. Sometimes I get it with a potato crisp, cage free egg and their unbelievable braised bacon, sometimes as a Turbo, pickled Jalapenos, smoked cheddar and chipotle ketchup. Great staff, even under the duress of  a line out of the door. Just keep doing what your doing. BEST BURGER JOINT IN PHILLY
