In my search for decent Mexican food in CT, this was absolutely the worst place I've been to. The people giving this place decent reviews have obviously never had good Mexican food. The Food: Terrible, overpriced garbage. My girlfriend ordered a $10 dollar margarita that had barely any tequila in it. My tacos al carbone were disgusting, tasting mostly like bad salsa. I'd just gotten back from Minneapolis a few days prior, where I could get amazing, authentic tacos for $2 a piece, so the fact I had to pay $16 for these 3 disappointing things was really maddening. The Service: Almost as bad as the food. Took 7 minutes for the waitress to come back with our drinks...which would have been bad if it was busy, but the fact that we were literally the only people there made it unforgivable. We found this place because we had a Groupon, and I'm not surprised that we were the only people in there. I wouldn't go back even if it were free.
