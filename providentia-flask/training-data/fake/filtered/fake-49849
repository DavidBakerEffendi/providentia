They offer a pretty good yelp deal ($30 for $50 worth of food) When calling in the hostess had no idea what my boyfriend and I were talking about. She made us feel like it was the craziest question to ask if we can use our yelp voucher on delivery orders. Â We don't even think she knew what yelp was. She took it upon herself to say that they could not except the voucher because they needed to see the email. So we decided to order it as take out instead to show her the voucher in person. Taking are food order over the phone seemed annoying to her. It took 20 minutes for the manger to come assist my boyfriend. I'm sure it was because the place was packed. They are pretty popular in this area. The manger did take care of the problem tho & my boyfriend loved the food. A little spicy for me but still awesome. Might dine in next time instead of attempting delivery. Might save some time.
