Just went to to Cask Republic again the other night for a couple drinks, and it was wonderful as always. Cask has great decor, a wide variety of craft beer, and on top of that a wonderful staff. Even when I go there at night with a group of friends they are always accommodating but this maybe due to their large space. Cask has to be my favorite spot right now in New Haven and if you haven't been there yet you must go!
