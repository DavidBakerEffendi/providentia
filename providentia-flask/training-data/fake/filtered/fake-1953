We where tourists from Oslo, and had stumbled over Brooklyn Crab at Google Maps. Called early friday afternoon to check if they had free tables. Alredy during the phonecall, the staff sounded extremely friendly. 1 hour later we entered the restaurant and was met by exactly the same friendlines. My wife, daughter and I where guided to a great table with great view. First I asked for the most lokal beer, and of course they served beer from a brewery 50 meters down the road. Great Sixpoint Pale Ale. Everything great so far. Next, ordering food: This is Brooklyn Crab, so crab is the obvious choise. Me and wife ordered the Brooklyn Crab Royale for two. A selection of different crabs and a lobster. You can choose between normal or spicy. We choosed the spicy variant. Both me and my wife are borned and raised in seafoodlands, so we are capable to spot a god crab or lobster. The Brooklyn Crab did not disappoint us at all. Crabs and lobster was great. Someone complains about the prices. I dont think 105 usd is a bad price for crabs and lobster for two. In Oslo we probably had to double the amount. Anyway, great place with great food. Next time I visit New York I'll visit Brooklyn Crab again :-)
