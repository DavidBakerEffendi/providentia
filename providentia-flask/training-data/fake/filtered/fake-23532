If you can deal with hour long lines, long waits for someone to tkae your order and long waits for getting your order, rude waiters, rude cashiers, and all the abuse that comes with all of that.  by all means, give it a go.  The Pizza is good, but certainly  not worth all of the hype.  Personally there is no reason to go through all of that nonsense when Frank Pepe's is just down the block, and their pizza and service is SUPERIOR to Sally's.    There are also several other less heard of joints that are better in NEW HAVEN. People just need to get off of this line and go explore. Why does Sally's give the paying customer such a hard time.   No Pizza is worth this much abuse.  Sorry.   You can keep the lines and the attitude, you're not missing much here.  NEVER AGAIN.
