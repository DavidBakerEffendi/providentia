Most pathetic customer service ever .....asked them to split one pound box in to two half pound sweet box.....they said they can't do it.... I was like what?????....then asked the manager and manager also said the same.. had to argue to final get it done for the sweets that I purchased from the same store ... as well as at the cash counter they were charging me for the stuff that I never ordered...Most pathetic experience ever...
