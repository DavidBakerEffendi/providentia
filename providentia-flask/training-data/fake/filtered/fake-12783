I have been waiting for a place like this. There are a lot of similar places that have opened up recently in the neighborhood, but Wheelhouse has the perfect balance of natural light, beer selection, atmosphere, food, and price. Their specialty seems to be grilled cheese. I had the spicy Buffalo sandwich. It comes with a side salad. At $9, it's not cheap, but it's not breaking the bank, and it's high quality. I loved it. The beer is the same: good stuff, not CHEAP, but not expensive ($6/pint). I'm really hoping they have a Happy Hour during the week past 6pm. The atmosphere is probably the best part: you've got your standard Edison bulbs and vintage wood/brick feel. But I dig that, and it's done well. They're making great use of the space. I will be back. And if it turns out they have a good happy hour, i will be back a lot.
