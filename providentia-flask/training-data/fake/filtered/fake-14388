Great neighborhood restaurant. We've eaten there a few times since moving to the area and the food is consistently great. Â The servers are always so kind and efficient. Prices are reasonable and the portion sizes are perfect. The restaurant appears clean on the inside and carryout times are quick. Highly recommend this restaurant, its one of the best in the area!
