Took over 45 minutes to get food. They forgot my son's grilled cheese which can take 5 mins to cook. They didn't bill us for grilled cheese but bill was still over 35$ for 2 people. Highly not recommended unless you have nothing else to do that night. They charge for every little thing. Since they are still new, no one new what we ordered and a manager asked us how things are then realized we didn't even order yet so took our order instead of our long lost waiter which we saw once to take our order. I definitely will never go back unless this place paid me to eat there.
