My boyfriend and I just tried this place, what we had: App: Lamb sausage: 7/10 Fried calamari: 9/10 - near perfect! Entre: Dumplings: 7/10 - not very dynamic flavor, but it was good. Long fussili: 6/10 - this dish was just OK, too acidic, a little boring, I didn't finish mine. Dessert: Creme brule: 8/10 Service: 10/10 - the service was a tad slow, but they were packed so its understandable. The staff was friendly and our server was very attentive. Overall, maybe except for the friend calamari, there were no WOW dishes. The ingredients seemed to be good quality, maybe we ordered not the best things on the menu? I don't know, we're likely to maybe give it another shot and try some other items, but if we strike out again we're likely not going to go anymore. Not because it was a bad experience, it was good-OK, but to eat out, with the wide selection we have in Astoria, we want things to be DELICIOUS :)
