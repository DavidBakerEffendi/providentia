I wanted to love this restaurant. They only offer two entrees a night, but they always sound very good, so I was looking forward to my dinner. Well, it wasn't a total disaster, the service was personable and efficient, and the view is wonderful. The happy hour appetizer of deviled egg on toast was nice, I think. But, it was hard to taste it after several spoonfulls of the tremendously salty short rib ragu. I was excited about the short rib ragu. I lived in Italy for a while and missed rustic Italian cooking. It looked and smelled great, full of white beans and beautiful carrots, and the meat was delicious and tender. The only problem was the incredibly salty broth. When the waitress came out to see how I was doing, I decided that the salt was enough of a problem that I should mention it. She looked a little flumoxed and asked if I wanted pepper. Huh?? Well, I guess salt does go with pepper. I probably should have asked for bread to soak up some of the salt, but didn't think of it until after she left. They didn't offer any compensation for the ruined short ribs, but maybe I should have expected that given that I ate it down to the last bite. I was hungry that night, otherwise I might have sent it back and just stuck to the happy hour snacks. Maybe I'll try it again when I'm not so hungry.
