I have never been so appalled. The racialism I experienced was disgusting At a table with my friends, 3 Black gentlemen came up to us to converse, They seemed harmless! A White woman,late 40's, came to our table and asked us are we ok ,she tried to act like she was saving us, she asked if they were a bother, we told her no, she went on Another white lady,late 50's, came to the men and demanded they leave because they were harassing us, it hateful, ignorant, and racist. It ruined my night
