As a Brooklyn resident, I'm very accustomed to quality food at our local restaurants and typically laugh at restaurants outside of the NYC environs.  I was in NJ for a business meeting last week and given traffic, elected to have dinner west of the Hudson.  Positive media reviews led me to Terre a Terre and I was really surprised by the experience.  Excellent, fresh food in a charming, clean setting, with friendly service.  I had the lump crab croquettes and the scallops -- both delicious (I'm a sucker for anything that includes truffle oil).  With Fall now upon us, it will be interesting to see what the chef will put together for an Autumnal menu.
