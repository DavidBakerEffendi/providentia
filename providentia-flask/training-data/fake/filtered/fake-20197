New York, New York it's a wonderful town.  Finding  Cafe Katja was a great experience.  The Austrian menu warms the heart and stomach on a cold winter evening.  My family and I have tried everything on the menu.  Cured meats, cheeses, Goulash, sausages, various small beer manufacturers add up to a "only in New York" experience.  The owner, is warm, knowledgeable, and most gracious in this small cozy restaurant.  go and enjoy!!!
