The place is adorable and the coffee is excellent. BUT the sandwiches are ridiculous. It's awful to charge 8 bucks for a ham and brie sandwich and only have one tiny piece of ham and one tiny piece of brie - they should either charge less or make a better sandwich. I won't ever eat there again - but, I'll go back for coffee.
