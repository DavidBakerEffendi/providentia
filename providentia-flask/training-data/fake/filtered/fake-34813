Had dinner tonight at the Green Rock Tavern.  The menu has a variety of food cooked to order. The Sirloin Burger was great, served hot and juicy. Will melt in your mouth. The fries are as good as you can get!  The staff is amazing and the owner stops by to chat and make sure everything is perfect. There is a great selection of beer and the bartenders are quick and always ready to serve. The crowd is friendly and you can be sure to catch the game or listen to some great music. You will feel at home. I would recommend this place to anybody, anytime! Looking forward to pierogi week!
