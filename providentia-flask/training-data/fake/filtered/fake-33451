I come here for lunch every once in a while and although the food is good (just good, nothing to write home about), the service keeps getting worse and worse. The blonde girl who works the back bar during lunch is miserable and rude and we've waited over a half hour for sandwiches at lunch three now. I understand everyone has a bad day and I know working the lunch shift sucks, but COME ON! Put a smile on your face and suck it up, or get a new job! I keep giving them another chance but we def won't go back! Many other options in center city for a quick lunch!!
