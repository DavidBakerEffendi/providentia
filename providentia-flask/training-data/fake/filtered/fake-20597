It's rare that one finds one's self in the position to review a restaurant at which one hasn't actually dined.  And yet, there are the times when a restaurant adopts a policy so offensive that one doesn't actually ever wish to dine at that establishment. I've had many hamburgers at ridiculous price points.  I've paid crazy amounts for cocktails, scenery, famous chefs, etc..  Point being, I'm a New York foodie who wants to give you my money in exchange for a great dining experience. But. Customer service is equally as important.  Today I called Minetta Tavern's reservation line to reserve a table for my design firm's holiday dinner on Wednesday, December 1st.  I didn't mention it was a company dinner--after all, it's only five people.  We're a small group, it didn't seem necessary. The group wanted to dine at 7pm.  I requested a table for five at 7pm, 28 days in advance.  (Their reservation policy limits advance reservations to 30 days in advance.)   I was told that parties of 5 and over were only allowed to reserve tables at 5:30, 6:00, or 9:00pm. EXCUSE ME????? This policy is not mentioned anywhere on the website.  In my years dining in New York restaurants, it is also the first time I've encountered such a policy.  I've put up with the ridiculous labyrinth of phone calls and confirmations many upscale restaurants.  I will continue to put up with other small annoyances that are just par for the course in a city where demand exceeds supply. This policy, however, exceeds my tolerance. Should I have mentioned the corporate card?  The fact that I'm even wondering this tells me that, regardless of how great their gourmet burger is, my money is better spent at any other place.  I will never dine at Minetta Tavern if I can avoid it.  And in a city of great restaurants, that shouldn't be hard.
