This is A-OK pizza. I have lived in this area since 1977 and Dom has always been around. I see a lot of hipsters coming here now paying five bucks a slice. Ha ha the joke is on you. Those who grew up in the neighborhood call it a dirty slice. It's a quick eat when you come off the the train. Back to the dirty slice thing. It has to do with Dom's oven. We use to have a better pizza spot on J and 13 called Jerry's. Dom and Jerry were rivals then Jerry sold out for the quick dollar he would have got later on. So now we have DiFara's and the way too funny lines outside going to the 99 cent store. Jerry Jerry.
