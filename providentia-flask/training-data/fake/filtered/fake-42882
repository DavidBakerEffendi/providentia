When I heard Life Cafe was closing I was devastated. That is until I heard that the restaurant would only be temporarily closed as it goes through renovations and would shortly be re-opened. Now that it has been reopened I can safely say Im extremely disappointed. Â  While I must say the new layout and over all atmosphere is a little more laid back and more aesthetically pleasing I cant help but be turned off by the obvious act of gentrification that is happening in my neighborhood. The last thing we need in this area is another stuck up, fancy-schmancy, over priced restaurant/bar. Those are a dime a dozen out here in "East Williamsburg" I also feel a little disgruntled by the homophobic and sexist remarks I over heard among the staff/management. The rosemary fries were good and the sides were reasonably tastey but I noticed the mexican aspect of the restaurant is nearly gone which not only adds to my previous statement about gentrification but also leaves my taste-buds extremely let down. If you insist on checking 983 out I hope your pockets are deep, your taste buds are dull, and that you tip your server well (because they cant get paid nearly enough for the shit Ive seen them having to go through both at Life (some of the staff transfered over) and at 983)
