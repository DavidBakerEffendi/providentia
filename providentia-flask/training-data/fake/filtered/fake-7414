One of our favorite restaurants ever! The front of house staff and waiting staff are attentive and respectful. Kouider and Robert and so kind and treat us with such charm, gratitude, and always a smile on their face. Gorgeous French cheeses, the raw bar is encroyable, Beautiful moules frites! The bread and butter! Ambiance second to none, a real Parisian experience in the heart of Soho. Go for Sunday Brunch, an aperitif, and oysters and champagne. You cannot go wrong. Enjoy!
