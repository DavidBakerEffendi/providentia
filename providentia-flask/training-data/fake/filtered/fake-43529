Food may be good but the most arrogant owner and staff I have ever encountered. Owner feels that because is popular he can treat customers like crap. The worst, go to Chinatown for better food and you can get better service from a street cart. Too many really good restaurants in Old City like Fork or Amada which have great atmosphere and food to waste time or money here.
