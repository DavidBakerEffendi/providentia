Halfway through dinner, the bartender/owner BLASTS Jimmy Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile" through the stereo speakers, followed by Nirvana, seguing loudly into Andrea Bocelli, then some too-loud stream-of-consciousness nonsense, then more ear-splitting Heavy Mental music, while inappropriately shouting commands to his wait-staff in this very tiny restaurant.  We, and most of the customers ask him politely to lower the music volume.  He doesn't.  At meal's end, he asks if we we're ok.  "Good food & service, but the music is way too loud" said I, a Rock/Pop & Classical musician for 40 years!  "No one at the tables on either side of us enjoyed the meal with this overbearing volume.  Don't you care about your customers?"  "Of course", he says.  We plead, "Then please turn the music down".  "That I won't do! If you don't like the music's volume, don't return!" Bottom line; if you like being treated very badly, and paying alot of $, this place is for you. Otherwise, go ANYWHERE else.
