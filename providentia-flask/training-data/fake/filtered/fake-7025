The pizza is excellent, even if it is overpriced, but the reason I give a middling review is bc of their "no reservations/call ahead policy." No reservations for parties less than 6 is annoying, but if you're going to have a call ahead policy, please abide by it. I called ahead and was told by the hostess that we'd have a 30 minute wait from the time of the call. We got there 15 minutes later and were told the wait was now over an hour. We left and went somewhere else.
