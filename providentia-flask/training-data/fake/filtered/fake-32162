One word for everything from food to service and staff ...AMAZING. Jose the owner is incredible . They make lemonade from scratch that will beat any lemonade u buy at any boardwalk in NJ . The food is fresh and made from scratch. Food really has that homemade taste that you cant find anywhere else in the area. Makes chipotle look absolutely silly !!! If you dont pay a visit here your just missing out ! Keep up the great work ! Already thinking about what im getting next...
