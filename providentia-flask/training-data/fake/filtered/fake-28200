My fiance and I ordered from Mac Attack for the first time tonight and we had high expectations from walking past their storefront so often before they opened. We ordered the White Truffle Mac, Southwestern Mac, and Mac & Cheese spring rolls for delivery. We thought the food was great and the portion size was good for the price. The food was delivered faster than expected as well. We'll definitely return.
