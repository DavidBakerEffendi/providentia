Have been visting this diner on and off over the years...it seems to be hit or miss. Some times the food is good and the service is great and other times it's the opposite. Stopped in today for breakfast and it was an off day. I ordered a fried egg sandwich and the sandwhich I got was more hard roll than anything else. How hard is it to make a fried egg sandwich? Our waitress seemed like she wanted to be anywhere else and she hardly spoke to us aside from taking out order. The food is okay as is the service...a bit pricy for what you end up getting.
