Rocky Hill Inn is hands down worthy of a  5 star rating. As the event planner for the "Princeton Social Club" this place is top of the list for many events i plan. My group has only given 5 star reviews on my web-site after any dinner we have planned or event. This old Inn has been remodeled to the finest degree byt the owners. Chef Evan makes every meal something to savor. I love going even with a small group outside of my social club. He offers weekly changes to the menu that i always look forward to trying. My favorite part of the Inn is the beautiful more formal part of the Inn to dine. The white tables cloths by the fireside and the many family heirlooms makes this place somthing you do not want to miss. We were treated with a lovely opera singer that evening for a birthday event i  planned with a group of 15 guest. I am from the south and miss the southern hospitality of many places i use to go to back home. One step into Rocky Hill and i  feel back at home for a moment in time. I choose this place over any place in Princeton. The Tavern area is more casual and the formal area a time to enjoy dressing up and spending the evening with someone special or a group for a private event...
