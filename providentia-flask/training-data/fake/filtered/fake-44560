My husband and I (and sometimes my children as well) frequent this restaurant about once a week.  We love the food here and the service as well.  On the weekends, Daniel waits on us, and knows our orders and preferences by memory.  Everything we have ordered here has always been excellent.  We regularly get the tom yum soop, the chicken lettuce wraps, the red curry, the basil fried rice, and we have had a number of their other dishes as well.  We love the ambience, the service and the food.  Outstanding!!!
