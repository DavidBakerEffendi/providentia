We lucked out with an ex-coworker of mine here, so maybe we got some special treatment. Regardless, our experience here was pretty terrific. We enjoyed one of the octopus pies which was delectable (though a tad salty, actually many of the dishes were), and another favorite was the plin, melted in our mouths). Dessert put the meal over the top, with the hazelnut budino blowing our minds. Worth a trip north of Spring Garden!
