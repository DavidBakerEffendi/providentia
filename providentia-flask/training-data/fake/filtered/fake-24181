Last month, my wife and I split a sandwich at Hershel's Deli. As far as Philadelphia delis go.... it doesn't get any better than this! My wife and I have heard all the buzz from their many reviews on 610wip, unbreaded.com, and phillymag, but we had to check it out for ourselves. As you walk up to the deli in the famous Reading Terminal Market, you are thrown back with beautiful slabs of meat that are hand carved by expert sandwich makers. Â I went with the pastrami/corned beef combo rueben and boy did my life change! I haven't had a sandwich this good since I made the pilgrimage to Katz's deli in NY a couple years ago. WATCH out Katz's, Hershel's may have the best corned beef and pastrami I've ever tasted. The meat is so juicy and tender that it makes you wonder how they even do it. So while I ate my sandwich the friendly owner, Steve, explained the whole process. He told me they MAKE THEIR OWN MEATS ON SITE! (Can't get more homemade than that). Along with the huge tasty sandwiches, they also have great side salads and i HAD to get an order of Latkes because they MAKE THEM TO ORDER and it brought be back to my child hood. Since my first visit to Hershel's, I've been back three times and will be back as soon as possible. It's about time, someone perfected the Jewish-style deli in Philly! Herhsel's is a can't miss! A+++++!! P.S. They serve the best breakfast on Sundays!!!!
