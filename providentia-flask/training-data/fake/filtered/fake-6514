Holy cow! One of the best meals I've ever had in New York. Between myself and my friend we had the grilled octopus appetizer, the ravioli in brown butter and sage, and the skirt steak. There were so many little goodies hidden under the entr√©es, I couldn't even tell you what they were but they were all amazing - some little mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, etc. the ambience was perfect. We asked for a quiet private table and they put us smack in the middle of the room but agreed to move us to the remote corner when we pointed it out (the restaurant was almost empty as it was late lunch time). Dinging them one star because they would not serve a Bloody Mary. The waitress said they only serve them on weekends because that's when it is pre-mixed. We asked if they could simply make a Bloody Mary, but she said they couldn't because they "had no tomato juice." In any case, kudos to the chef.
