Not sure why others have given this restaurant poor reviews.  My ethnicity is not Asian, but I speak Chinese and have done business extensively in the Far East.  Royal Palace is the best Chinese restaurant I have visited in the USA.  The menu (actually several menus with different regional Chinese dishes) is extensive, the food is perfectly prepared, the service is quick and courteous, and the atmosphere is casual but clean and attractive. My wife were visiting from Seattle.  We had the Special Seafood soup, snow pea leaves sauteed with whole garlic, steamed Chilean Sea Bass, and Yang Chou fried rice.  More than enough food, delicate flavors perfectly blended, and everything cooked just the right amount. We highly recommend this place.
