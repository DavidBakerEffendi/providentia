Is this the same place I just went to last summer?!  To say I was DISAPPOINTED, would be an understatement.  Pickled oysters still had dirt in them, lobster and grits were unflavorful and the grits did not have any cheese in them.  A simple Caesar's salad was bland.  For desert, one scoop of chocolate ice cream over a hard piece of chocolate brownie ($8).  By the time me and my other five family members left this establishment, $273.15 later, disappointed was a nice way of describing our meal.  The outside patio area needs to be fumigated of all the flies and other bugs that we ducked and dived from while we ate.  I try my best to support local businesses in Brooklyn, but I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN!!!!  Restaurants have to learn how to retain customers or they will end up like "Night of the Cookers", that was once located on Dekalb Ave.
