Came in for a drink and a bite to eat. Bar was dirty and the bartender never cleaned it. Margarita tastes like sour candy. The "extreme hot wings" were cold and barely spicy. Finished what I chose to eat without one person asking if I enjoyed it. Maybe they knew I was going to tell them just how disappointed I was for my after work stop. Will NEVER come here again.
