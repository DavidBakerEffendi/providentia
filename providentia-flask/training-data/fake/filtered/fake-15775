ordered octopus appetizer had to send it back, couldn't tell if it was sour or just marinated way too long. replaced with calamari half was good, other half like rubber but i hate to send food back so we just dealt. for dinners fish was not the freshest, completely edible but could have been fresher, saute was bland and maybe staff could have recommended somehting fresher? mousaka was generous portion o.k. but not what you would expect from a such a nice looking greek restaurant. a little dry. do not get greek coffee unless you like a big glob or instant coffe on the the bottom of you cup. really for $100 dinner i would expect much better, never again.
