Had a lovely dinner tonight as a first pick during Philly Restaurant Week. The service was perfect. There were managers visible and active circulating around the dining area. Twice during our visit they stopped at our table to welcome us and to ask about our meal and dining experience. There was a brief wait for our reserved time. We were directed to the bare to wait where we were greeted with seasoned popcorn and offers of drinks. I had their signature bubbling berries martini. It was a real treat! The Food Our server was friendly and knowledgeable. We ordered the Filet and Salmon. The temperature of my medium steak was perfect, at the recommendation of our server I changed my choice from medium-rare to medium. He explained in detail the process they use to determine their steak temperatures followed by a promise to replace his suggestion with my first choice if it was not right for me. My dining partners salmon looked so good that I wanted to put my fork in his plate for a taste. The lobster bisque was creamy with large chunks of lobster. We both had carrot cake which was a little too sweet for my taste but was delicious. There were tiny layers of cake with cream cheese icing between each layer . I would eat here every week if I could ! It would be a great place for a Valentine's Day dinner. (hint, hint) One big TIP involves the parking. I would recommend using the Valet service offered right in front of the restaurant for $18.00 . (Sunday evening price ) We parked in the closest lot we saw to the tune of $29.00 for just under 2 hours of parking time.
