It took me a few weeks to try it out after moving in the neighborhood. From outside, it did not look that great. And it seemed like a very dark space. However, one day, craving sushi, I decided to go in. Not only was the food delicious, but the waiter was really friendly and, totally unrelated, had a great style! Loved the shrimp katafi. Since that first time... I've probably tried most of everything. It's all really good.
