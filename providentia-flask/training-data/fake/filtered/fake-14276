We finally got to go after hearing so many great things about it. We arrived at 7 and sat at the bar and had two delicious and stiff drinks while we waited for our table. I had the mango margarita and my husband had the mambo mojito. We started out with three tapas choices: the crabcakes, the chicken stuffed plantain and the Pork crustini.   Everything was delicious Except that our crustini was soggy and the plantain was not quite ripe enough. Our entrees were the duck and the skirt steak. The Cubano salad that came with my beef was way too overdressed and the mint was really overpowering.  The steak was a bit too rare for my liking and had it been cooked more,  I might have enjoyed it.   The best part was the side of plantains, they were perfect. My husband's duck was just okay but the fettuccine it was served over was cooked perfectly. Dessert was coconut flan and banana cheesecake. And both were extremely sweet but very yummy. All in all,  it was a good experience. The service was excellent,  and we'd definitely go back for just the tapas and drinks again.
