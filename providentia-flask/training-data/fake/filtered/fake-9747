Let me start off by saying I only go here as a last resort. I've only been here a few times, none of which we busy so I figured I'd get quality service. I thought wrong. You seat yourself, which is fine of course, but the staff behind the counter will aimlessly look at you while you wait for a menu or at least a drink order. I've had a waitress look at me sit down, so instead of dropping a menu and taking a drink order, she goes behind the counter to chat with the cook, cleans off two tables that weren't a priority, and eventually stumbles my way. It's not that the staff is rude in terms of attitude, but if the place is not busy there should be no excuse to have your customers wait 10 minutes for a menu. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the food is faily priced and actually decent. Like said, it's a last resort kinda place. Do yourself a favor and go to Kens across the street!
