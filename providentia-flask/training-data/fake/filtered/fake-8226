I alwayssss go to Sally's or Modern pizza but was lazy to pick it up tonight so i settled for local delivery. I called sorrentos and got a tomato and basil pizza delivered, IT WAS RAW!!! the dough was not cooked all the way, I actually want to puke just thinking about it. it was my first and last order there.
