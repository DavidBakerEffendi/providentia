I was in Brooklyn last weekend visiting family and we decided to try the relatively new Dekalb's Restaurant in Brooklyn, New York.  What a treat!  The menu is filled with dishes that are creative, economical, healthy, and most importantly delicious.  The wait staff was fabulous, especially Jamie, our waitress.  She was not just pleasant; she understood what was in each dish and gave us great advice about what to order to fill all of our different needs.  (We were a group of carnivores and  vegetarians. There were great choices for everyone. ) There was live music on Saturday night- and the way the restaurant is set up, we could hear the music, but it never got in the way of our conversation. We first went there for dinner, and wound up going back for brunch the next morning.  We never do that when in New York, but we had so much fun and the menu was so innovative, we could not help ourselves.
