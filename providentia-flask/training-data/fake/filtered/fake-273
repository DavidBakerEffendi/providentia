With all the buzz around having to try a Philly Cheese steak with a side by comparison of Pat's and Geno's I really had much higher expectations.   To be honest I've had better cheese steaks not in Philly so the only big difference which people who live in this area seem to really love is the wit wiz option which is basically that nacho cheese whiz filling which you can get at places like 7-Eleven on your nachos or by melting that Velveeta cheese.  Prepare to put on the calories though. The one thing I really enjoyed about this place over Geno's was their meat, it was more tender and flavorful than Geno's but they could use some better bread.  I think if they took the bread from over at Geno's then they'd put Geno's out of business over time with their quality. I wouldn't return here in the future, I've had my side by side comparison and satisfied my earning to see what the buzz was/is all about so my experience is complete. Everything here is ala carte as well, you gotta buy your cheese steak apart from your fries.  It's all cash too so at the end of the day for a combo meal you're paying more than $20 for fast food which is ridiculous. While sitting here to eat we met some elderly couple from New Jersey that have been coming there for over 50 years, they used to live in Philadelphia a while back but every trip they make to Philly always includes stopping at this place.  This makes me believe this place is like going home to having a home cooked meal, you know the one thing your mom or family member makes which beats everything else.  So in this case Pat's was like eating a home cooked meal by mom for them.
