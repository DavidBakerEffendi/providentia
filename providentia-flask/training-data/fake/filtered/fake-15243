This is a place I fell in love with AT FIRST...I love their food, but I like spicey mayo instead of eel sauce.  So I figured IF I ordered two sets of rolls I could get one spicey mayo and NOT have to pay 54 cents.  That's nine dollars for about 2 ounces of rice, some bits of fish and veggies...but I was happy and the food was good and after a lil cajoling I got the spicey mayo.  However once it's the nineth time I've been in your store spending $10 and you can't give me a freaking 54 cents mayo...BUT if I order on grub hub I get it gratis...you have now insulted me. I will not be back.
