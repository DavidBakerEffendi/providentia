I had the worst meal I've had in recent memory here last night.  I was with a big group, so I sampled a lot of things and the majority of them were pretty uninspiring: Good:   -calamari (loved the fried slices of lemon-- delicious) -frites Meh: -goat cheese profiteroles (this idea is dated and the goatcheese is overwhelming) -ricotta fritters -fried zucchini -steak Unforgiveable: -steak tartar: I love steak tartar, but this version was completely underseasoned and unpleasantly stringy. -mussels: dry and gross; pencil erasers. -red snapper: this was probably the most disgusting.  It came on a bed of polenta and sauteed mushrooms and greens.  It tasted like a punishment. The servers were OK except for this one guy who needed some help with volume control, and I also didn't like how they kept upselling us at every turn.  They definitely took advantage of the fact that we were a large group and brought out things we didn't ask for. I would have been pretty pissed if I had been paying. In conclusion, I would never go back here on my own dime and I might even pass on someone else's.
