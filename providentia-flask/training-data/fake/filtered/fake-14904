5/5/14 I had my daughter's bridal shower here this past weekend. All I can say is that everything was terrific! Our guests continually raved how delicious the food was. Lisa, who was in charge of overseeing our party, was wonderful. She and the other staff were very professional, provided us with excellent service, and were always eager to take care of my family and friends. I also had an opportunity to have dinner there on numerous occasions and can't say enough about Michael. The food and service is always consistently top notch! I would highly recommend Michael's Riverside for either a night out with family or a large gathering!
