We had the repast for my father here on Saturday 08/02/2014.  The staff did an excellent job, were friendly, helpful and very polite.   We have eaten here before always with very good results.  Also have been to many repasts here for family/friends always with wonderful service and food. We had chicken, pasta , sausage & peppers, eggplant, salad and another dish but I can't remember what it was?? Have read all the reviews and can only say we were VERY satisfied and I am extremely picky!!!
