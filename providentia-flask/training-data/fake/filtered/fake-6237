Diana-Lodi I can say this place earned 5 stars!!  Food was great and the service exceptional. The atmosphere's awesome.  BYOB, which is great.  Loved it!! Reservations were made for me by my son that's in the Navy, so it meant a whole lot. It's his first year away for Mother's Day.  Ignacio(Manager) made it a more memorable evening. He was very attentive. Thank you for a wonderful evening Mambo!!!
