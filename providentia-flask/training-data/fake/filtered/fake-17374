So From the reviews I saw on this site I had to pay a visit. It was what I expected (from all of the positive reviews). I had the french toast. It was just the best, seasoned great, I didn't even use my maple syrup that came with it. The fruit was very fresh. My mother has a panino (panchetta egg and cheese) she enjoyed her food as much as I enjoyed mine. The food also was enough to fill me up and was very inexpensive. I enjoyed it this may be my new favorite place to dine. (I didn't check my grammar so don't judge me lol)
