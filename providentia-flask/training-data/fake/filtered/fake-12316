Went here with 2 buddies. Took forever to get the food which was eggs. Â My eggs were not even fully cooked. Never brought out our toast. Forgot some items we ordered. First time they brought my food out order wasnt even correct. It was gross and the only reason I gave it two stars is bc the workers are super friendly and social, about the only thing going for them bc I sure am not going back
