I had brunch at Chef's Corner several weeks ago and ordered French Toast with Pure Vermont Maple syrup.  Clearly, the syrup was not  pure maple but more like Log Cabin.  When I complained,  I was told that others had complained as well.  A couple of weeks prior to that, I had ordered soup & sandwich and had to send it back three times before the order was correct.  I have enjoyed eating there for years but something is amiss.
