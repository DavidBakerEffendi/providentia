My daughter and I did not enjoy a satisfying dinner. We inquired about the soup of the day and the waitress honestly shared "It's so-so. It's been sitting around for four days and it's watery." Our salads were limp and warm. The server stated "The cooks are dripping wet and it's over 100 degrees in the kitchen." The veggies that accompanied the hummus were also limp. The chicken in the salad was fried and did not complement the description on the menu. The server was lovely and kind, but the food was a grand disappointment.
