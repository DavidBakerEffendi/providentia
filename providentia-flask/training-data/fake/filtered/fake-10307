Yum! The gyros and sambosas are the best I've ever had, and the sauces make them even better. The lamb shank is so tender and flavorful. I love the borani banjan (eggplant), and I've never had rice like that before. The baklava is made with pistachios instead of walnuts and is soft and moist with honey. Â I can't wait to try everything else on the menu! The owner is a very hard-working woman and as sweet and friendly as could be. Tashakor (thank you)!
