You're not a real Philly native if you think Pat's or Geno's is the best. That just makes you a follower because Pat's and Geno's are good but not nearly as good as Dalessandro's. The staff is very friendly. Their cheesesteaks are amazing. They load it with steak which makes it so much better. If you're new in Philly or looking for a new cheesesteak place, Dalessandro's will not disappoint you.
