Although wonderful and decorative atmosphere immediately makes Parivaar attractive, your senses will be overtaken by the entrees available for the Indian food lover and newcomer alike. Boasting a wide range of spicy and sweet Indian dishes, the convenience of the affordable lunch buffet is only matched by the variety provided on the tasteful dinner menu. The service is friendly and quick, but also very relaxed. Parivaar's atmosphere is very casual, and the diner can set the tone as he or she so pleases. All of the friends that I have introduced to Parivaar have thoroughly enjoyed the dining experience, and many have gone back there to eat, even without me! It goes without saying that I highly recommend Parivaar. It's a wonderful place; appropriate for a dignified dinner date, as well as a brief and casual lunch.
