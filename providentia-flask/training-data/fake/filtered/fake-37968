I am always on the hunt for bars that have a great micro brew selection, and Cask Republic is my new go to for good beer! They have a ton of taps, and great menu to match. Our bartender, John, was knowledgeable about all the beers on tap - a tough feat knowing how often they change and how many there are! Also - he was able to provide accurate samples and suggestions based on our current favorite beers. I'd recommend this place to any beer lover, or one looking to try new things!
