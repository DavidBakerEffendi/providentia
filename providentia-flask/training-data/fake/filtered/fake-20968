Cheap, affordable, good food on-the-go? I'm in! I'm not the biggest fan over the dumplings because I can usually get it elsewhere for the same price but the sesame pancakes here a hit for me. Many get it with the peking duck which i thought was great if you don't mind the fat. But the plain sesame pancakes for 75cents does it too. It is the perfect snack and super affordable. Not a good place for hangouts though. It is crowded, loud and not exactly the cleanest. Take out if you can.
