Visiting NY in 2010 and needed a good start to the day.  Great find! Well I'm going back again this Sept. 11 and remembered what a good breakfast I'd had.  Small, very small, but the wait was short and the food was quick and excellent.  Many regulars ordered to go and everyone seemed to Love Johny. You can add me and my girl to that list.
