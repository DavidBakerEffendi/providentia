I had a 50% off deal from Scoutmob for this place and went for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.   First, the service was really slow.  It took a while for our server to take our order, and then even longer to get our food.  Other tables who arrived after us got their food before us.  It also took sooo long for us to get our change back after paying that we finally had to walk over to our server (who was chatting at the bar with the bartender) and ask him to bring it back to our table.  Not sure if that was a misunderstanding because when we paid, we said we'd need change (which should have been obvious, we tipped on the full price, not the discounted price and if he would have kept the change - it would have been a HUGE tip).   Secondly, this place had a B rating, which made me a bit skeptical. I noticed that every dish and cup brought out to us had something stuck on, smudge marks, or was a bit grimy along the edges.  Combined with their B rating, it was very worrisome to me. Thirdly, the food was simply meh.  I had the crabcake benedict and fresh orange juice. As I said, streaks/grime on the edges of the plate, but the quality of ingredients/cooking just wasn't that great.  Our food had also cooled off by the time we got it and was only luke warm. Would not return to this place unless I had another 50% off deal, was in the neighborhood, and was just getting drinks.
