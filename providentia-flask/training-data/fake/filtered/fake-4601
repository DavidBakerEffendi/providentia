This was my first time to go to Salinas. The ambiance is ok. The dining room is very small and some of the tables for 4, notably the round ones in the middle row, are really too small for 4, but the dining is fabulous and the waiter we had was marvelous. He was very helpful. Timing of food coming out was ok. Wine was good. All food we tried was average.
