I had a groupon and wanted to treat the co-workers so I went the day before and ordered 2 pounds of wings for pick up at 12pm. No problem.  I walked the 3 blocks from my office and got there at 11:55am. They told me they had a lot of orders for chicken but it should only take 10 minutes.  After 15 minutes I asked again for the clueless young lady to check on the order and was told they were just putting it on. They only had one cook and he was also the manager. I reiterated that I had ordered and paid for the food the day before and couldn't understand why the order wasn't ready. IAfter 30 minutes I finally got 2 lbs of small boneless wings that you could not tell were supposed to be 3 differnet flavors and lukewarm soggy fries. The onion rings were okay.     I will not go back and think the place should pick up its tent and roll away.
