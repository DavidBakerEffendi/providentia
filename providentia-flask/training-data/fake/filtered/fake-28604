I walked in here to get their oyster special. I gave the bartender my AMEX ordered 1/2 a dozen oysters and then a Heinken draft. The bartender served it but then left. Â The beer was pretty stale - no head, definitely the end of the keg. Then he left and a woman served me my AMEX card back with oysters charged to the bill. I said I don't understand why you are serving a bill without having served any food. She said you dont have to tip me in a very snotty voice. The oysters came. I out Tabasco on them and starting eating them. Them turned out to be not very fresh. Later I started getting stomach cramps and threw up. Bad beer, bad service and bad food. Do not go. A fish place with stale leftover seafood is awful.
