Been going for years. It's always busy for a reason. Â Prepare to wait on the weekends. The staff is fun and service only suffers when the place is packed and overfilling with customers. They're great though. The food is great. They do the best gyro I've ever had. The whole fish is prepared really well. Greek salad and Moussaka are very tasty. I'd trust that most meals are fantastic.
