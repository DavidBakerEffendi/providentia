Beware of the guy at the register, HE WILL OVERCHARGE YOU.  The guy at the counter adds up the total in his head and then rings it up on the register.  When you ask for a receipt it just has the total amount on it with the description (itemization) being 1 item and the total next to it.  I WAS OVERCHARGED 3 DOLLARS AND CHANGE FOR MY ORDER, not cool.
