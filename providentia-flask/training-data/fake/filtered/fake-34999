I'm still scratching my head and wondering if this restaurant will make it. The potential is there but for what we found positive we found more that was negative. The positive is the food is good and prepared with care, the decor is fresh and modern but that's about it. We concluded the food is very overpriced for "seasonal" foods that we understand are grown by the chef on his farm, portions are small (for every course) and combination of ingredients repeat too often across the very very limited menu. Bar prices are outrageous for standard sized drinks (a glass of wine and martini came to $30) and the dining area - seating is configured odd making it difficult for servers and patrons to move through the area. The bar is small and while standing waiting for our table the server working the bar area tables bumped into us more times and to the point were it became annoying. If you do not mind over paying for a meal that leaves you still feeling hungry when you leave and a menu that is very limited then you may favor this restaurant. For us there are too many other restaurants in the area that offer more.
