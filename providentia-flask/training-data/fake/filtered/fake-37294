Was in Philly this past weekend for the Black Keys concert and came here for brunch. I had the Oh My Omelet with goat cheese and sauteed mushrooms. It was eh okay, not great, but i;m a sucker for anything with goat cheese and its pretty hard to mess up a omelet. I think $10 for an omelet that only gives you two choices if highly over priced. My boyfriend had the waffles and liked them but thought they were a little on the burnt side. He liked how they had a strong banana tastes. Service was a little on the slow side and our server was a little inattentive but it wasn't terrible. If i lived here I probably wouldn't make it a habit of coming.
