This is by far the worst experience I have ever had in a restaurant. This is my second visit to Archie Moores and I should not have given them a second chance. Being the day before super bowl and 3pm on a Saturday- they were quite busy. After sitting at the table for nearly ten minutes without acknowledgement I retrieved my own menus. Our server came over a few minutes later and got our drink order. Our drinks were served promptly and without speaking to us she walked away. After another ten minutes she returned to take our food order and as she began to, walked away from us to speak to the table behind her. I didn't notice if they had called her over or not but did not appreciate the interruption. We then sat waiting for our food with an empty beverage for close to fifteen minutes. She never made eye contact with us but did look at my empty glass THREE times. Our food was delivered without side items we had requested and again- without speaking to us she left the table. My boyfriend pushed his food away from him immediately. The plate of wings had a puddle of sauce everywhere, some of the wings were stuck together and more bone was showing then there was meat. Unappetizing to the fullest degree. When she finally returned with our drinks from the bar my boyfriend asked if she could please remove the wings from our bill because they were inedible. She replied; Sure, it's the day before super bowl. She did not ask or offer him another food item or ever return to check on my food. I believe a table visit from a manager would have appeased my frustrations however it seemed like the guests, other tables included- were a total burden. Last time I checked the guests in those seats are what keep your doors open. I will never return to this establishment or recommend it.
