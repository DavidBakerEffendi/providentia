The best little bagel shop I've found in Philly! Their front tables, inside tables, and back patio tables, make it possible to cater to whatever type of eating setting you are looking for. The staff is always very welcoming and friendly. Not to mention how delicious their food is! I also definitely recommend their mint iced tea as a lovely morning or afternoon pick me up! I will be going back for quite some time.
