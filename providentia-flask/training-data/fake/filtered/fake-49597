Nice ambiance but terrible food- not sure what they were thinking when putting that menu together...completely discombobulated. Food has no seasoning at all and if you ask for salt it will come in a gelatin pill capsule, if that is an attempt to be trendy or modern, they missed it terribly...it's just plain weird and by the time you get that thing open your food may just be cold!!! The bottom of the pizzas were burnt and the top soggy... Im guessing they have a flair for burnt food since the chicken was well over toasted and not "juicy and happy" as they described- Fries were ok.... Service mediocre at best- Won't be seeing me there again!
