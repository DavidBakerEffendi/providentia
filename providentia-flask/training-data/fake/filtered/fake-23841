OMG! Worst place that I have ever been in my life. Once I went there first of all the food was not good at all. Second it is extremely expensive and is not worth it. I order a juice an I told the waitress to change it because it had a weird flavor. And the owner came to me and she told me that she was not going to change anything for me. That if I like it it is fine if not she was not going to the anything. When I was leaving her husband told us that we should not be in America because we weren't born here. So racist and totally disrespectful. I would never go back to that place
