After reading all of the negative reviews, I really wasn't interested in trying Geno's. But my husband had some distant memory about it being good--so we tried it. HUMONGOUS DISAPPOINTMENT. I wasted $38 in cash for food that tasted like seasoned-less meat wrapped in a cardboard  box. Calling the food 'sub-par' is generous, at best! And if overt racism and ignorance offends your sense of moral decency, it'd be best to stay away.  No one at Geno's was particularly rude. But standing in line there reading a 'I Want My Country Back' sign with a demand that you 'order in English' really brought home to me what this establishment represents. I'd already paid for the cheesesteaks by this time. But I'm still kicking myself for handing over my hard-earned money to such ignorance. Spend your money at places that don't literally throw their racism in your face, and that ALSO serves good food. DON'T GO!!!
