I got a norovirus from this place - think of what food poisoning is like, and then think of something way worse. That's a norovirus. It's the kind of thing you get when a server or a cook doesn't wash their hands after going to the bathroom.  had a dish (popover - not even that good) that no one else in my group had, and I was the only one that got sick.  I was so dehydrated after all the throwing up and, er, other stuff, that I ended up in the hospital. Sure, they're fancy place and the waitress was sweet and attentive, but I've never been so sick in my life. And now I have a $396.66 emergency room bill left over after insurance that I can't afford to pay. Never coming back here.
