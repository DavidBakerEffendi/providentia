Wow, what a sweet little surprise this place was.  I went with a friend on a whim and we scored a great spot in the garage patio.  Laid back, friendly service and a small but decent menu.  My friend ordered the fried chicken and I ordered the Catfish.  I just didn't want to be upset about bad fried chicken.  While we waited, we watched everyone suck down their food without taking a breath. My plate came with cornbread (fantastic), slaw (simple, subtle, delicious), and I chose mac n' cheese which did not disappoint like most restaurants. I ended up sucking it down like everyone else. The chicken was like real broasted chicken is supposed to taste like.  Uber-juicy, with just the right crisp on the skin.  Catfish was incredibly juicy as well, they could've served a little more tartar sauce with it. I asked for butter and honey for my cornbread and it was some sort of homemade, out of this world butter. Onto desserts - they were out of the Tarheel Pie so we both settled on the Apple with Cheddar.  My first experience with cheddar and again, it was really really good.  Great crust, tons of perfectly cooked apples.  How could this be?  A near perfect meal for $40, including beer and dessert?  Definitely going back.
