I order from Nino's a LOT.  I mean A LOT.  I teach at a school & we have a lot of pizza parties & I love their wings.  Tonight's experience was disgraceful.  I ordered my pizza at 5:25...as of 7:30 we have no pizza, just a bunch of cranky children asking where's the pizza.  I think I'm done with them for a while.  Their response? We're short staffed.  I would have loved to have known that when I ordered.  I could have picked up the pizza or gone to Pizza Hut!
