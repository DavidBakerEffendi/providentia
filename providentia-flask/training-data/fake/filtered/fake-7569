Had a chicken,mozzarella,brocolirabe paninni. The br was so fresh and peppery,worked great together. The bread itself was very high quality. Enough choices for paninni's, not enough choices for everything else. Oh the spring salad with dressing on the plate was pretty and tasty, but inexpensive enough to make it a real side to the paninni,not just three leaves,if you please. Was there at 6:30,lucky for a cancellation.Warm inviting, but wish it were a bit bigger. Nothing really but good to say. Happy to come back.This neighborhood could use many more places like this.
