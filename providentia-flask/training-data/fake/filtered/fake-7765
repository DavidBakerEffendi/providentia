Mamoun's has been a favorite of mine for as long as I can remember! The food is great and to say that it is affordable would be an understatement. You can also BYOB, as they do not sell alcohol. I'd recommend trying the mango iced tea if you don't want to bring a drink of your own. The atmosphere is casual and cozy, making date night easy to accomplish on the fly and on a budget.
