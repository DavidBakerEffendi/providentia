Went for the first time today with a couple friends. Started with fried pickles & peppers appetizer, followed by the Baja Burger. Everything was truly delicious, and that's not just my hangover from the previous day talking. Michelle the bartender has more knowledge about beer than I do (which is both a good thing and a frustrating thing) and the service was quick, informed, and attentive. I'll be back soon.
