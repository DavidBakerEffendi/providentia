Stowe's is probably West Haven's best kept secret! I've lived here all my life and when it comes to fresh seafood, it doesn't get any better than Stowe's!!! Yes, it's a tiny little hole in the wall, but the location is great for casual summertime, beach-side dining and the food is SUPERB. I have had just about every item on their menu and EVERYTHING is good! During the holidays, we order our fresh fish for Christmas Eve dinner from them every year and it's always a hit. The portions are very generous and the service is prompt and friendly. Casual eat in or take out and there is also plenty of outdoor seating. The only downfall is they close fairly early compared to other similar places, like 6 or 7pm depending on the season.
