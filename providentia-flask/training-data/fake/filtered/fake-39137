So disappointed.  This used to be my favorite Philly burger joint.  Last night (Monday) I stopped in with friend on way to Phillies' game.  Ordered the Prime burger.  The bun was stale (dry and hard).  When I complained, they offered a refund (which I declined because that wasn't my point).  They didn't offer me a fresh bun.  We were the only customers at the time.  I surmised that they decided not to incur the expense of buying fresh bread for slow days in summer.  This would never happen at Shake Shack.  Regrettably, I'm done with 500 degrees.
