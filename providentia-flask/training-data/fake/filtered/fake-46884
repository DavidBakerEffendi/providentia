Depending on the day, the hour and possibly the minute will decide whether or not you havve a good experience at this Bertucci's.  Undercover Boss needds to tape an episode and have David Lloyd come work here.  The last four visits, the pizza has been wrong.  On this occasion, 2 out of three ingrediants were incorrect.  No apology frm the waitress, in fact we were treated to a surly attitude.  We received better service from waitresses that were not assigned to our table.  In the end, the manager always comes over to point out that the pizza has been credited and rebilled, becauseas everyone knows, Customer Service is not what Bertucci's provides.  Oh, and as for one of the other reviews where the gentleman said he stopped back for the rolls . . . Our's were delivered iced cold.
