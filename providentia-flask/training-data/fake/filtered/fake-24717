Everything about this restaurant was superb--decor, ambiance, service, and food!  The sushi was very fresh and beautifully prepared.  There were other items on the menu, but we stuck with appetizers and sushi dishes.  BYOB, but they do sell some local (NJ) wines as well.  We will defnitely be back!
