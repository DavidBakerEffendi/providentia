my earliest memory of pepe's is when i was 7 or 8. my dad used to eat here all the time when he was in college, and so when our family came out here for vacation, it was the first stop before we went to my aunt's house. sausage and mushroom pie. being from the west coast, there is just no authentic, historical, priceless pizza like this. i eat pepes on a regular basis. white clam pies, pepperoni pies, vegetable pies, tomato pie, pepe's can do no wrong. i would not dream of ever cheating on pepe's. this is the place to go for the best pizza in the world, and id bet my white clam pie on it.
