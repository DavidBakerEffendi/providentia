We went to North End Grill for dinner on a Saturday evening. The service was very friendly and when we asked for suggestions, they really knew their stuff. We started with the bucatini, bacon and heirloom tomato appetizer. The pasta was cook perfectly--true al dente. The bacon was smokey and the tomatoes ripe and flavorful. Â For entrees, I had the nova scotia halibut and my boyfriend had the beef tenderloin. Both were also cooked to the desired level of doneness and were delicious. Lastly, for dessert we had the Huckleberry panna cotta; it was also very delicious. There's also a great selection of scotch and wines--although some options are a bit pricey. Great restaurant; will come back again!
