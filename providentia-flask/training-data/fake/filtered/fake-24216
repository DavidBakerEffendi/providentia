So. . . I paid a visit with some friends to Vonda's on Saturday, 12/15/12.  We were 28 strong!!  We ate like Kings and Queens!  The food was DIVINE!! Everything was in order. . .DIVINE ORDER.  The service. . impeccable.  The establishment. . .impeccably clean.  The food seasoned to PERFECTION and served in a reasonable amount of time WITH a smile.  We had oxtails, chicken, fish, collards & cabbage, mac & cheez, rice & beans, fresh string beans, sweet potatoes, cornbread, sweet tea, ginger lemonade. . .and red velvet cake that I personally inhaled **and I hardly ever eat cake**.  This was a real treat for me!  Vonda PUT HER FOOT IN IT!!  Yes ma'am, Yes sir. .  I will certainly go back again. . . REAL SOON, and I live a good 90 miles away, close to Wilmington, DE.   As for your Mr. C.L (food critic) and your wifey, have a little patience as the world does not revolve around you.  And just in case you have to "WAIT" the next time at another restaurant, please let me know ahead of time so that I can order one of Minnie's special pies for you.  I'm sure you'll give it 5 STARS!  smooches. . .Luvvie
