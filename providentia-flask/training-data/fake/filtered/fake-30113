The food prepared at Ilili is delicious. I grew up eating Syrian food, and it takes a lot of talent to get it right. Some dishes here are fusion, some are true-to-style authentic. Mujaddara is a dish that's easy to mess up and turn into a goopy mess, so I was happy that the mujaddara here was as good as though it was prepared at home. Many of the dishes at Ilili are Lebanese, like Daoud Basha, for example, and Mouhamara and Chankleesh are Syrian by origin. Good thing it's called "Mediterranean." Â I deducted one star for price--- turns out that for quality Levantine food you have to shell out a lot of cash.
