When i went the ist time, the service was not that bad and restroom is nice and very clean. When i went the second time, they screwed my order and took so long to bring m order. The 3rd time, this when i did not went right. I was there @630 AND HAD MY FINAL FOOD @ 803 pm. I just order 4 dishes. The manager try to explain that it was super busy. But i told him the person in front of me with same seafood arrived 715 and have all there order and been eating. Just a bad service.He try to reason it was language issue. I dont buy it. This is America and there is rules and manners and cortesy atleast ti serve who comes ist not because its your own nationality and race. Not fair and not right. Further, the excuse he claim that its busy because so many people eating that amount to fire and occupancy. Hope the owner realize he can't accomodate all more than what the building allows and that makes the service better too and realizing who comes ist must be serve . I was just dissapointed
