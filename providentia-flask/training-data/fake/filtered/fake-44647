This is the ultimate new place to enjoy Indian cuisine. All meals are very tasteful and enjoyable. The best part is the chutney's they give you to enjoy with your dosas. If you do not prefer eating dosas you can also enjoy the traditional saks. Even though this place if meant to enjoy dosas, the saks are still very good. They are much much better than rasoi. It cost a lot less and you get good quality, where as with rasoi, it is more expensive but you get sub par quality. I would highly recommend this place to enjoy dosas or just your typical Indians saks.
