My first visit to Green Eggs Cafe was for a Communion party and everything was great.  We loved the food, service and decor.  We decided to return Mother's Day weekend.  Knowing how crowded the place would be, we decided to go on Saturday morning and arrived around 9am.  There were 8 people in our party and we expected to wait.  We only waited around 5 minutes and were seated.  My husband and I were very anxious for my family to taste this food we talked about for two weeks!  And then the let down.  After we ordered, the hostess came over to remind us not to linger after our meal.  She basically told us that it was Mother's Day weekend and they were going to be very busy and need the table.  I can understand if we finished eating and were sitting around lesiurely sipping coffee.  However, our food didn't even arrive and she was worried about how long we were going to stay.  Not to mention there is a card on the table basically asking you to move on after you have eaten.  We had no intention on sitting around for an hour after the meal.  We know that is not the place for that.  It was so rude and no one that works there cares.  They know they have a line out the door waiting to take your seat.  Lucky for them, someone can always have my seat as I would never go back and have told anyone who will listen to me.
