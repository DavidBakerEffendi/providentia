Not much I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. I have lived in Brooklyn all my life and I am pleased to see the positive change in terms of people, great food and nice spots to chill with friends and family.  DAR 525 without a doubt is one of my favorite spots.  Thank you DAR 525 for coming into our neighborhood and setting up a nice place with a wonderful ambiance and for serving us wonderful meals at a reasonable price.
