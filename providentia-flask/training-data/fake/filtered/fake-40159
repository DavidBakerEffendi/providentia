I have never been to the pizzeria but hope to travel from Boston by train to taste some excellent pizza.  What?  How do you know it is good if you did not try it.  Because from the Yahoo article that I read, the ingredients are the ones that my Aunt and other family members used in their "pies".  Dominico DeMarco has really delicious pizza and I cannot wait to try some.  Hope Dom or one of his children will contact me. Recently, sent a letter but my email address is: fitzm63@gmail.com
