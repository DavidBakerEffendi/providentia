I visited there on Sunday 6/1/2014 and ordered a burger with bacon five minutes after I ordered my food was brought out to me.  I started eating the burger and by the third bite I realized the burger was still raw and cold in the center.  I could not eat it and it all went to the garbage when the waitress asked how everything was I told her and they didn't offer to make me a new one or even apologize.  I only suggest you eat there if you want to get sick!!!
