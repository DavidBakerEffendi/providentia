On the whole, the food is somewhat bland and uninspired. I've been here a number of times and eaten off the burger menu and the 'upscale' menu. Even for Burlington, it's overpriced for the quality, taste, and quantity received. The brunch is OK at best, too. Definitely not enough to satiate a medium sized man. The dining room is also very loud. The best part of Farmhouse is the bar. During the summer, the back patio is great for a evening brew as is the basement 'tavern' during the Fall and Winter. The beer selection is outstanding and as a beer-geek, the 20ish taps offer me something different every time I come. TL;DR. Bar-Awesome. Dining-so-so. Service-good.
