I stopped in for a smoothie around 8:30am, mid week and there were only a couple other customers there as well. The service was super friendly, willing to make recommendations and wait patiently as I (first time customer) decided what to order. My smoothie was delicious- went for the Almond Buttercup. I have to say the prices are definitely high- I paid almost $10 for a 16oz smoothie + tip.However, this was a special treat for me-not something I will purchase daily. If you're into healthy foods, organic, raw, probiotics, etc etc, this is definitely a fun place to visit to try something new- maybe inspire some at-home smoothie makers. Other reviews knocked the staff for being slow and rude- I did not experience either. I was greeted walking through the door and treated very well. I will definitely go back next time I want to treat myself and give my blender the day off.
