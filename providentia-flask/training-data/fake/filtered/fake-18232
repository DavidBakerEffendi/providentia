Place is beautiful-however, the food was not.  I chose a grilled octopus appetizer which was okay-nothing to write home about.  For dinner I had the soft-shell crab special which I was excited to try.  The crabs were not well cleaned and when I cut into them they oozed the infamous yellow mustard which made the dish unappetizing, along with my boyfriend's appetite.  For the price of this dish, the crabs should have been thoroughly cleaned by the chef.  The other dish we tried was a chicken in pastry-we were not impressed. The on tap Brooklyn beer was crisp and delicious, as was my glass of red.  All-in-all, way too pricey for the "just okay" food which should have been much more impressive, tasty and minus the "mustard."
