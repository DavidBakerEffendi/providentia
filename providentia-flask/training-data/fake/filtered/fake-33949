...had the world's worst experience at Sally's Pizza in New Haven last night! A big "SHAME ON YOU" to the employees and owner for their rudeness and disgusting customer service... So glad I had the opportunity to them them to fly a kite before spending my $$ there. Hope your roach and rat infested place goes out of business soon. CHEERS!!
