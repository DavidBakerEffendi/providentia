I come almost everyday. When Carla the waitress here, it's always awesome. But some of the other members of the staff decided to close the kitchen at 10:15.. I thought it was open until 11? See a few months ago, I was able to come in at 10:55 and order something to go usually, to not be a dick. So now I only come In when Carla is working. Love the food, but the waitstaff attitude sucks... Very few exceptions. And the whole, "our kitchen closes at 10pm" that's total bullshit. Or is it? If you guys are open until 11, be open until 11, if not, then let me know in advance on your site or here on Yelp. But don't make me come all the way over here
