I'm really excited about our new neighborhood bistro. We've had dinner there twice since it opened, and it's great.  Best ratatouille I've ever had, excellent hanger steak, delicious linguine vongole, fine salmon.  It reminds me of Bar Pitti, one of the comfortable best, and makes you realize how rare casual French restaurants there are here. They're waiting for a BYOB license and when that arrives, it'll be perfect.
