My husband and I were looking for a casual place to eat before going to see a movie Â sunday and walked into this place. We are always looking for healthy options as my husband is getting ready to run a marathon. The manager at the front- a delightful young woman- started chatting with us and told us that all of the food was organic. We ordered the spread symposium which came with whole wheat pita bread, tuna stix, chicken stix, and farmers blue cheese with organic veggies. The tuna was seared to perfection and the salad was delicious. My husband said that he will be back for lunch now too. Great food and friendly service.
