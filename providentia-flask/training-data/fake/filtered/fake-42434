Been going to Jefferson for years and yes the service is a bit slow and one of the waitresses will forget something you will need (fork, butter, cream, jelly..etc). My favorite dish is the catfish, eggs and grit with a waffle. Yes i'm greedy! Here is a trick I have learned. Before you go to Jeffersons call in your order so that you are not waiting when you arrive. It so funny when I sit down and my food comes within minutes while people who have been waiting start to grapple.
