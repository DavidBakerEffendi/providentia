My husband and i came here a few years ago and when planning our trip to NYC, we had to put this on our list of Must-Do. We walked down the day before Hurricane Irene was suppose to hit NYC. We were surprised there was no line! I think the evacuations and weather scared them off... But that meant we got a table right away. We had a small original with sausage and pepperoni. It was delicious! Just remember- no slices, no credit cards, no fountain drinks, no frills- just REALLY good pizza!
