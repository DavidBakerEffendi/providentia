Been coming here pretty regularly as it's a pretty perfect spot for job-hunting, and keep planning to write a review. Had just decided NOT to write one because of the spottiness of their music selection (my friend in LA and have been exchanging emails with the subject: oh, this coffee shop's music...) -- didn't want to say anything negative in this review because they deserve the best. But this morning, outta nowhere, they play three winners in a row (Wilco, Manu Chao, and Chet Baker)! The Mad Men theme song that came on the other day has been officially stricken from the record, as has that entire day of 'indie hits of 2004.' Major, eclectic strides have been made. No no, but for serious though: gorgeous and airy space (any reviewers mention the huge garden thing hanging off the wall yet??) and really attentive, sweet counter-staff. Someone here has figured out both the perfect A/C setting (not as easy as it sounds) and just the right number of Febreeze puffs to make the HUGE bathroom smell pleasantly flowery. The espresso and tea drinks (hot and cold alike) are fantastic - huge selection of unsweetened iced teas - and all the food coming out looks divine (shhh, I snagged a piece of toast abandoned by a tablemate. crusty & chewy). Have had my eye on one of those flatbreads, maybe when I emerge from unemployment I'll treat myself. Is that Yves Montand's version of "Somewhere Across the Sea" I hear? Or Charles Trenet's? Either way, it's the first time I'm hearing French music and NOT wishing I were in a Parisian cafe -- couldn't be happier than I am here at Milk + Honey. (lightning fast wi-fi and people bring in their cute little kids. nice neighborhood spot)
