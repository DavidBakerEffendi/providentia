this place has one of the finest sweets I have had in US.. it's a small place but they have a good variety in sweets.. my personal favorites are milk cake, ladoo and rasgullas.. they have one of the best samosa so don't ever miss it if you are visiting this place. the staff here is quite friendly. to all those working for quality sweets, keep it up guys !! :)
