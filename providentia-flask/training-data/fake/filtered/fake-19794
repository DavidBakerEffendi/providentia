I went to Guru Palace for dinner and I was pretty happy with the atmosphere, service and food. When you first walk in, you get a fun trendy atmosphere, while still preserving the Indian roots of the restaurant. The servers were also really friendly and they seemed genuinely interested in your enjoyment of the food and atmosphere. I would highly suggest coming here for any occasion!
