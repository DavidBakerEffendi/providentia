Last weekend, I went here with a lot of people for a friend's birthday. I paid a cover of $25 for this party. However, it was merely impossible to get to the bar since it was overcrowded and not a big place at all. There was really no where to sit either. Drinks were pretty bland. Didn't have any food. The place was just nothing special at all. I had a good time and some of the bartenders were nice, but if you're looking for a fun time with a dance floor, loud music, and good drinks, this is not really the place to be in my opinion.
