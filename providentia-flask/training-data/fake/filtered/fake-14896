Bill & Harry's is inexpensive but quality cuisine.  The beef is lean, never gristly.  Daily lunch specials are very cheap.  Contemporary decor and large windows keep it bright unlike most Chinese restaurants.  It's quiet in the evenings but crazy busy at lunch as employees at local companies (like me) like to eat here.  Still, you'll be served quickly at lunchtime.  Try the scallion pancakes if you like them thin and crispy.  Friends love the General Tso Chicken.
