I came into the restaurant on Wednesday last week with a few of my friends for a birthday dinner.  It was a little crowded when I came in but the hostess took my name and told me a table would be available in less than 10 minutes.  It wasn't even 5 and he came back over to seat my party.  He was very engaging and made my group feel taken care of.  We enjoyed the empanadas, pomegranate salad, arepas and fish taco's to start which was all absolutely delicious.  Our meal was wrapping up and someone in our party went to order a few desserts to celebrate the birthday.  We ordered the flan, bread pudding and the tres leches cake.  One thing that absolutely stood out was the tres leches cake from Yuca Bar.  This cake tasted authentic, fresh, DELICIOUS and AMAZING!  As we were ready to go, the hostess overheard we were there for a birthday and he came over and asked if we enjoyed our time there.  When we looked at the bill at the end, we realized he had comp'ed one of the desserts for our birthday girl.  I'm totally coming back for the amazing desserts and the wonderful personalized service.  Ask for Carlos when you go next time.  This guy makes everyone feel like they're part of the family.  Thanks Carlos!
