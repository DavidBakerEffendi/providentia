Great Italian fare without all the fuss. Went on a Friday around 7ish. my guess is if you get there before 7pm ish ,the Â wait should be under 20mins. After that , 30-45mins is the norm for parties of 2-3. There is a nice garden waiting area - on the day that we went, they were not serving food in waiting area. On the day we went, crowd was mix of locals and Manhattanites If you order drinks from the bar, make sure you settle your tab before going to the table. If you are alone, the bar seems like a really great place to eat. The main dining area tables are quite close together so if you are looking for a private place to discuss highly classified info, this ain't it. However, there is no loud overhead music and the place is generally not that loud which makes it possible to have a conversation with your dining partner(s) and actually hear yourselves. May sure you ask for the bread if you don't get it before your app. The bread is scruptious ! You can even ask for more and they will happily oblige. Highly recommend the Bruschetta, we thoroughly enjoyed the eggplant and mushroom. Fennel salad had too much going on but still quite good. Highly recommend meatballs. Our pasta dish with brown butter sauce and sausage was tasty but not out of this world. They have a nice selection of italian wines by the glass. Thankfully for me, they offer non oakey, non buttery reds and whites in the rustic, traditional style. Priced around less than $20/glass. Also, they serve water without ice which is fantastic rather than forcing you to swallow ice cold H2O. The service was attentive yet there was a rather long delay between appetizers and entree. Overall, the dining experience was pleasant, the food good and we would definitely return again.
