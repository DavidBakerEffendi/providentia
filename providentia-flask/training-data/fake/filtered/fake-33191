Best falafel i've had in the city. There is flavor, spiciness and the ingredients are fresh. It might not be as cheap as Mamouns, but the quality is far far better. Mint lemonade is excellent too. Tiny space, not enough room for too many people, small bar at the window to sit and eat. They do take cash and credit cards (above $10).
