Buyer beware. Our disappointing and confusing experience at this place in a nutshell: First, the hostess looked lost and irritated that she actually had to speak to customers. Then, our server did not know the menu, told us that half the things we ordered "weren't available," and took half an hour to bring us our appetizers. If we weren't entertained with our own conversation, we would have left. Then, the food. It was bland to put it nicely. Diner food is better. Last, to top it off, while we were still waiting for our credit card to be returned from having paid the bill, a stocky bouncer approached our table and demanded menacingly, "Ya'll leaving or what?" My 45 year old conservative aunt and uncle were made to feel uncomfortable by the belligerence of this place and complete lack of customer service. I think this place caters to a very young crowd who just wants a place to go for the night to hook up and drink. This is not a real restaurant, and do not bother coming here if you are anywhere north of 25. You will be treated poorly by lazy bubbleheads who text as they work, and angry bouncers who push you to give up your seat for younger customers. We spoke to the manager of this place, who was sweating bullets and looked nervous before we even explained the problems we had with our service. He would not address our concerns, but seemed intimidated by his own staff. This place is a bad Twilight Zone episode. As of this date, there is no option on the Shannon Rose website for customer comments, by the way. I wonder why.
