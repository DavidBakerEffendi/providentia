We just had our first dining experience at Tiny Tai and -- sorry to report -- it failed to meet our expectations. (We had heard good things about it from a UVM student we know.) I will let others address the issue of waiting-time-for-a-table, noise, service, and BYOB policy. We were more interested in experiencing the authentic Thai food, and we left sadly disappointed. Things started badly and went downhill from there. The Laap-Gai appetizer had some interesting flavors (mint, cilantro) but the chicken, lettuce, and onions were so drenched in vinegar that we left half the dish on the plate. For entrees we had two stir frys with rice, one stir fry with noodles, and one curry with rice -- and we requested that all four dishes be served with tofu. In any Thai restaurant the tofu should be lightly browned on the outside and moist and flavorful on the inside. I am here to report that the tofu in all of our dishes had been baked or fried hours before. Consequently it was dry and shriveled up, and as tough as a three-dollar steak. I found myself chewing the tofu 10 or 12 times before swallowing. My wife wanted to leave then-and-there, and my kids said, "Dad, we can't eat this!" Aside from the tofu, the Pad Thai was dry, un-inventive and well below average. The Gratiem and Pad Prik Pao were drenched in a reddish sauce that overwhelmed both dishes, and not in a good way; the sauce tasted like it was straight out of a can. A very big can. The curry was just so-so. We arrived expecting to enjoy some carefully prepared dishes that exuded subtlety and authenticity. Instead, when I walked out, I kept thinking I had just experienced "Thailand Day" in a high school cafeteria. We all left feeling slightly ill, although I can honestly report that no one in our group got sick.
