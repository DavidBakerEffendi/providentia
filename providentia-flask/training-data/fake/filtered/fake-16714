My partner and I attended Miss Rachel's Saturday night family-style dinner.  It. Was. Amazing. The food was outstanding; we were totally blown away by the complexity of flavours and the beautiful plating.  I want to talk about all the food, but I'll spare you.  Highlights included the lentil-tempeh slider (with eggplant bacon, amazing pickles and other delicious stuff) and the delicata and butternut squash bisque (so good I dropped my spoon). Sitting at the same table with a bunch of random folks was a ton of fun!  We ended up staying for, like, an hour or two after dinner chatting with one couple, our wonderful waitress Sally and Miss Rachel herself. The atmosphere was fantastic.  Cute jawns on the walls, candles hither and thither.  I'm not good at describing these elements, but they were lovely. Eat here.  You will not regret it.  Srsly.
