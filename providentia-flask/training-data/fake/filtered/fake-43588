Can't comment on the food because we did not stay long enough to give it a try. We arrived at the Witherspoon Grill on a summer Sunday at about 6pm with less than a third of the restaurant full. The hostess and manager were friendly and accomodating, and provided a lovely booth table. However, once seated five minutes passed. Then ten. My date used the restroom. Then I did. By the twenty minute mark, we decided enough was enough. If a fine dining establishment can't get it together to take a drink order within twenty minutes, they are definitely not worth the $30 entree price they are charging. No one even noticed that we left, and that's truly a shame. We hoofed over to Nassau Inn and enjoyed a steak there instead.
