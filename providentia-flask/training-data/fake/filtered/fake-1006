My friends and I discovered Jahan Kebab grill in the beer mart in Oxford Valley before they opened this site in Morrisville.  We were hooked on the food there, so for them to move 3 blocks away from my house is heaven!   The food is all halal, prepared fresh by Abdul, one helluva friendly guy whose family runs both locations.  The restaurant is a very pleasant atmosphere, colorful and inviting.  But the best part by far is the food! Most dishes are between $5-15. The menu is diverse, with kebabs, middle eastern/Afghani dishes, gyros (and some American dishes for the less adventurous).  The Afghan food is outstanding!  The lamb curry will make you cry it's so good.  Served with aromatic long-grain rice and fresh-baked naan, it's the most delicious dish on the menu in my opinion.  A close second is the shank of lamb, which just falls-off-the-bone tender and so tasty.  I've had bites of the chicken dishes my friends have ordered and they're excellent as well.  The gyros are good and nice size serving, and the kebabs are tender and full of flavor. They also serve breakfast.  There are some of the usuals... pancakes, french toast, eggs and potatoes.  The food is halal, so no pork products, but the turkey bacon was really good... not the typical pressed turkey alternative you get at most diners.  I tried the Persian eggs... poached eggs with sauteed peppers and onions and kebab meat.   Excellent!   This place offers a terrific alternative to pizza and burgers in this town, by far my favorite restaurant in the boro.  DEFINITELY worth a try!
