Having went to college in the New Haven area I have always been a fan of the restaurant scene, however when I went back to visit recently I wanted to try something new and different. After hearing about Oak Haven and taking a peek at the menu, I knew I needed to try this place. With friends in tow, we started off with some drinks, had a few laughs and ordered some delicious food. While the steak I had was amazing, I was jealous of the fish that my friends had ordered. The aroma of the meals was enough to spark my curiosity about dessert, which you should not pass up. Everything is fresh, the atmosphere is fantastic and you can certainly tell that the those who run this place put a lot of heart into it. I am a big fan and can't wait to go back!
