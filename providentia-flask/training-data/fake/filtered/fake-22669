I love this place!  Just moved into the neighborhood and found this cute place right around the corner from me that is good- cheap - friendly staff and they even have a backyard. I've had breakfast- and been back for lunch and both were great.  The croissant egg sandwich is a plus and their brie Panini is definitely a gold star.  I'll be back!
