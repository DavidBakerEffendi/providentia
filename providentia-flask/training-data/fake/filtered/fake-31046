First, shout out to our server, Lucy!  She was attentive and sweet!  This was our first time at this Prime 16.  Huge fans of the NH Prime, we peeked in to see a larger version of the NH space.  The bar was brimming on this Friday around 4 pm.  A few of the booths were filled in the restaurant and after experiencing the same winning food here, we expect that more will come.   Only thing missing was the young Yale crowd.  Our faves, the Lamb and Honey Truffle burgers!  The draft beer list is bar none! This burger joint will give Five Guys and Wayback a run for their money!
