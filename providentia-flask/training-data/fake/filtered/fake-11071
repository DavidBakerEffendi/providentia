Last week my husband & I had the pleasure of dining in the Gramercy Tavern. Our custom tailored course menu was exactly what we were looking for at an unbelievable price. Not only was each item we enjoyed cooked to absolute perfection, but our server provided us with the most attentive service we have received in New York City in a very long time. By far, the pork chop was the most delicious I have ever had before in my life. My husband opted for the sizzling lobster, which smelled and tasted of aromas as divine as its presentation. The chef selected wines that were paired with each of our courses, far surpassed any expectation of a "by the glass" wine. If you are looking for an intimate experience, great food & friendly service this Gramercy Tavern find is undoubtedly the place to be!!
