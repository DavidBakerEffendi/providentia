Had planned a rehearsal dinner for 64 people at Amada.  When 70+ people arrived the staff  didn't hesitate to set up additional table and chairs and make us all feel welcomed. The staff was phenomenal, attentive and we were repeatedly reminded that if we needed anything they were available. Of course, the food and drink were as awesome as ever. Thank you for a spectacular party.
