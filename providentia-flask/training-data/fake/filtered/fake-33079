Best bagels in Jersey! Seriously, you can count on cleanliness, speed, taste and freshness. One things I love about it the shop is there enormous selection of bagels. Bagels like the waffle bagel or the apple cinnamon crunch bagel though they also have the originals as well. Their wraps and panini's are made fresh and delicious as well. A great breakfast/lunch choice!
