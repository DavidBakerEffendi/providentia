I wasn't going to write a review but in light of the current owners comments maybe he needs a wake up call. Ate here once and never again. Service was mediocre at best, food was so-so. Prices were to high and well, it just wasn't that good. Lots of other options in the area that offer better food, better service and affordable prices.
