The food was delicious! The service was fast, attentive, and they had great suggestions. The appetizers were phenomenal. We got the tasting plate which was a little small for six but perfect for four. my friend also ordered the chicken soup which was filled with chicken, rice, and vegetables. It was very flavorful!!! I had the entire fish of the day and it was cooked a little to wet for ,my liking but i like my fish on the dry side. my boyfriend and friend wanted a chicken dish that ended up being sold out, so the suggestion they received was delicious!!! We had tres leche and flan with our cafe con leche and i was not disappointed!!!! We were the last table seated for the night and they had run out of a few items, but were able to make suggestions of something that was similar that we would like and it was right on the money. As I stated above we were the last table seated, but they never rushed us or made us feel uncomfortable about being there so late (though we still felt bad). Â They were quick to answer questions and very helpful! Would love to go back!!!!!
