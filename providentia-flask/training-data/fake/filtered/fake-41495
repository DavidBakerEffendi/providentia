First of all, let me dispel any notion from yelpers saying my review isn't legitimate. I'm purely a secret yelper (one who reads the reviews without posting any of her own). I live by yelp reviews and it influences my food life more than I want to admit. I had to create an account and write a review because I was so impressed with the deal I got on groupon and just the entire experience at Fuji Mountain. I paid 17.50 for $35worth of food FYI if anyone's wondering. Okay so half price, not bad - my husband and I typically don't go into the city, but we wanted to try something different. Exterior: definitely one where you would never take a second glance, but the interior, once you enter is very 'Japanese'-esque and holds an intimate feel. I was seated in the first floor dining area, but next time I hope to go upstairs. The waitress was also wearing a kimono that added to this experience. I ordered the house salad that came with a fresh ginger dressing with lettuce carrots and cucumber. It was really refreshing and the spicy seafood miso soup, which was a nice twist to the original miso soup. The miso had great flavor and was one of my favorite parts of the meal. We ordered the sashimi delight to share as well as udon noodles and the seabass. The udon noodles were nice and chewy and the seabass was full of flavor. Now onto the sashimi, it was super fresh and believe it or not but its hard to find fresh sushi these days. We were really full and satisfied after our meal. We wanted to get the fried tempura ice cream after watching our neighbors eating it, but we were too stuffed to order anything else. Okay - so we definitely spent more than we originally were planning on (groupon), but the freshness, value and taste definitely lived up to the experience.
