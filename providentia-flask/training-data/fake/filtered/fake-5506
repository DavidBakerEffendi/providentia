I had heard so many good things about this place, i even have a friend that used to work there and told me to go check it out, so I decided to go for dinner one day, the waitress was so nice and personable at first and the atmosphere was great, however halfway through our dinner her attitude changed completely, we thought something happened so tried to be even nicer but she seemed so annoyed at us for ordering more wine so we thought maybe she just wanted to leave since it was around closing time, but we weren't even finished with our meal yet and there were other tables in the restaurant. We were very uncomfortable and didn't even feel like finishing at this point so we just paid and left. I thought the food was ok, for me dining is about the whole experience and that was ruined so it is hard to say anything good, but i will say that the pizza was delicious. I might go back again for brunch since everyone in here is recommending it, but i don't think i will return for dinner anytime soon.
