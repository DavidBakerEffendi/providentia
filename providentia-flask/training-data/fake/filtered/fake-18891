I know this place gets great reviews from everyday patrons.  Let me tell you - I had a slice of their artichoke pizza on the very first week they opened.  2 bucks.  While I waited for my slice, they offered me bread and a beverage.  The slice was 1/8 of the entire pie. These days, there are virtually NO artichokes on their famed pizzas...the slices are now 1/10 of the pie and 2 dollars more.  So you're gonna pay $4 for a slice of pizza that is just dough, cheese and cream. Oh - and they will not admit that they use cream in their "topping/sauce" for the artichoke pizza. Has anyone called the health department on them?  They're supposed to list the calories!  I'm sure once they do, they won't be doing as well.  And for $4 a slice, PA-LEASE - I'd rather go to Ray's. They also keep some rude guy at the counter, taking orders - and holding up the line so as to keep up the "long line" outdoors.  Meanwhile, there are pizza slices ready to go!!  If they had a clue, they would make their customers happy, give them their slices and get MORE business through the door! Amateurs!! THis place is a joke.  I can throw some salt and cream on some dough and bake it and call it an artichoke pizza. Where's the artichoke?!!?
