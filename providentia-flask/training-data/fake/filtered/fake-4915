I've only eaten here once even though I live on the same block, and maybe I should try it again because the food I had  was not nearly as good as I expected it to be. ( I have a friend who comes to town just to eat here, and the reviews are glowing so I expected to be blown away.) First of all the bread was not fresh totally stale and tasted like cheap grocery store bread, which to me is a bad way to start a meal. I ordered the pasta with capers and anchovies and that's all I had. It was so dense and greasy I couldn't eat much of it. The capers and anchovie sauce was salty and tangy and I actually loved that part of it, but all in all the experience  was just ok. Maybe it was an off night but I was underwhelmed.
