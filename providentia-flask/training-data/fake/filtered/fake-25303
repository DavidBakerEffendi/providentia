Girlfriend and I ate here when we visited the Island. Short walk from the ferry. Place is a bit grungy. Loud bar area - even when we sat in the dining room at the end. The waitress was nice but sooooo slow. Slow at bringing us our drinks, slow at bringing our food, rarely checked on us. Finally we told her we needed to go because we had to catch the ferry. What did she do? Stood and talked to a group of people for over 5 minutes (yes, I timed it!) she was supposed to take my card and bring check, and bring out boxes. Instead of the obvious multi tasking by grabbing the boxes while the card machine was working she stood there and talked to more people... Finally we stood up and walked toward the exit waiting to get my card back, at this point we didnt care about the leftovers because this process took her over 20 minutes. Nearly missed the ferry, literally ran the entire way... If you have all the time in the world this place should be fine - I had pasta, wasn't impressed at all. My girlfriend had a superior burger though, Jack Daniels if I recall. I had a bite and instantly knew I made the wrong decision!
