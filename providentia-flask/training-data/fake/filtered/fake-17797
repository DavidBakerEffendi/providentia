Stopped by Surfish the other day - first of all, instead of bread, they bring out these dry plantains and corn with salsa that is delicious - I destroyed it in approximately 60 seconds.   There are five or six different types of ceviche, and a pretty  decent selection of entrees that includes not just fish, but pork and beef as well.  The bar is kind of small, and I tend to enjoy  sitting directly  at the bar, but the restaurant is charming, and the staff is friendly and nice.
