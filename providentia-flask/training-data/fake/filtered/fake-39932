Today I went to this place, Kitchen 79 for dine in, I fall in love with this place!! The restaurant look really really cozy, new, clean, modern, silvery, and black-white. So the interior really good. Service from them very nice there is the lady who took care of me today and she talk to very nice, she can be another friend of you, a great friend!!! Food at this place is amazing!! I have never try any Thai food like this in the area before!! I felt , it's real Thai food! I had the Pad Kra Paw Ka Moo with Moo Satay today both of them are amazing. I Would recommend this place for you, if you want to try something good and new for you!!
