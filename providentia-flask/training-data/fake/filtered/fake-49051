The first time I went here was a Friday night. I went with 3 others for hibachi and there was no wait at all! There was a fully stocked bar, which added to the ambiance of the restaurant and the place overall was exquisite. The hibachi came with miso soup and salad, both of which were tasty. Â When the chef came out to start to cook, he was amazing. He was entertaining the entire time and he kept making everyone laugh. Not only was the entertainment good, but the food was delicious. The entire night was a success, definitely coming back here again!!
