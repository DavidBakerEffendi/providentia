They may be rude but the food is so good. It is best to avoid the barbecue items late at night. It is better to catch it during the day. Cheap + good food + open till late at night. Can't ask for me and makes me a regular to Noodle town after partying. The egg noodles, roast pork on rice, roast duck on rice, beef in egg sauce-- all these are very good. Try the noodle soups as well. My favorite: Salt baked shrimp. Those salt baked shrimps with the hot sauce on side are the best stuff you can have after one too many drinks! One can try the salt baked combo as well. The portions are just right and the food is just so tasty you want to go back over and over.
