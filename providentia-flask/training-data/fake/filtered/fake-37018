I recently spent a long weekend in the city visiting friends and I since I had a day to myself, I wanted to do something new to learn more about the city and it's culinary delights. I read about the pizza tour online and immediately signed up. Scott and JoAnn were great tour guides and instructors.  I learned many incredible things I never knew and enjoyed the pizza so much that when I met my friends later in the evening for dinner and shared the details, they were insanely jealous and decided they had to take the pizza tour themselves (despite living in NYC all their lives!).  Scott and JoAnn are genuinely friendly people and I encourage any and all who have the opportunity to join them on their next visit to town!
