if you are looking for authentic Â middle eastern food look no further. Every thing is done by hand and the bread is backed in front of you. Since I was born in the middle east I know what I'm talking about. I could not tell the difference between my moms cooking and theirs. I love the fact that they have a huge sit down area as well as to go. The music is the best. If your only experience is from the habibi at the street cart get ready for the real thing. Don't let the line that snakes out side the place detour you during lunch hour the line moves fast. While waiting pick up free WiFi.
