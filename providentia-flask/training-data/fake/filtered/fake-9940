We found this restaurant thanks to a LivingSocial voucher, so we didn't have a typical experience that other diners might have.  We had a very set menu to choose from, but everything we had was delicious. We enjoyed the atmosphere and had an amazing waiter who took great care of us.  The food was delicious - so much so that we can't wait to go back despite the 40 minute drive. I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.
