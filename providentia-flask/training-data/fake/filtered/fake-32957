If you are going for atmosphere then yeah its a nice place but that only lasts so long, now lets talk about the food....can i say microwave...I tried almost every tapas on the menu last night and I can honestly say what a poor example of Spanish food. Man in a place where the competition is so high...Ferry Street in Newark...They could of at least cook the food on the spot.  I have tried mostly every restaurant and dive in Newark and this was IMO the worst restaurant in the Ironbound.  I sat right by the kitchen and did not hear cooking or see smoke.  I saw at least 7 men in the kitchen and not one had sweat on their brow. The Sangria was ok...the Tortilla was atrocious...Actually every item i ate tasted more like the sauce covering  up the fact that it was not cooked fresh. The pulpo (octopus) tasted like it was cooked days before. The squid was stringy and smothered in a overpowering red sauce. The cod fish friiters..omg can i say bought  in a frozen section of a Supermarket. Not fresh at all. The peppers stuffed with crab meat right from the can....The dessert was not, i mean not, homemade.  I don't like it when restauranteurs think patrons are stupid...some of us can taste the difference.  The only plus was the cured meat and cheese platter...they didn't have to pretend to cook that.  The service on the other hand was good, but way to quick.  Which attests to the fact that the food was not cooked fresh.  I can't say enough how disappointed I am with this place.  Obviously we will not be going back.
