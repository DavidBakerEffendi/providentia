This is THE real deal burger place in the world. Literally. It invented the hamburger. It is in the Library Of Congress saying so. Texas inventing the hamburger? How long has Texas been around? Do the math. The burgers here are awesome. Cooked in a way that none other do. Old school place with history. No condiments allowed...awesome. If you get caught sneaking some in, you're kicked out. Ha! Awesome. Psst, across the street is great New Haven pizza at Bar. Get it all in.
