I went on a first date here for dinner this past Saturday night and it definitely earned it's place as "No. 2 best new restaurant of 2014 in the United States" by Bon Appétit magazine.   We did the "Leave it to Us" menu, asking specifically that they include the Green Tea Garganelli and the Angry Crab Spaghetti and they did not disappoint. One side-note though... make sure you tell them several times if you have any serious allergies.  My date had an allergy to nuts and, despite telling the waiter about this at the beginning of the meal, he kept delivering things with nuts in it without warning her.  When dessert came, it was one of their house-made ice creams piled high with nuts.  When we reminded him of the nut issue, he apologized... and took the dessert away.  It would have been a nice gesture on the part of a restaurant of that distinction to have at least have come back with a replacement dish of ice cream, without the nuts.  But apparently, that wasn't part of the "Leave it to Us" menu.   Other than that, a top-notch restaurant.
