Everything here is delicious, HOWEVER, the board of health needs to pay a visit.  I observed one person handling the money and register then go over to handle a bagel without gloves or washing hands.  Another was slicing deli meat with her bare hands (and acrylic nails with visible dirt) placing the meat on a bare scale (without paper) mixing with a variety of meats.  Then with the same dirty towel she used to clean the surfaces, wiped the knife she was about to use to clean it.  All their clothes were visible dirty.  They pick the lettuce, tomatoes, onions, tuna salad, etc with their fingers and place on sandwiches.  It turns my stomach to think of eating here.
