Went here for dinner last night. The Maitre d' was a complete sour puss, no welcome, no smile and it almost put me off staying but I am really glad we did. We sat at the bar and got amazing service by Joro the bartender. A great Cava (not the house one, it was really yeasty, much more like champagne), fabulous Rioja and good food. I did find the food a little salty but in general the flavors were delicious. We got scallops with cherries and parsnip which I loved, artichokes, the crack ham (b/c it's so good it's like crack), pulpo, patatas bravas. All good.
