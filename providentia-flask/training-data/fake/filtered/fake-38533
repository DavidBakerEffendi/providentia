I bought food from this restaurant regularly. The quality has been coming down since 2007. Saturday night this week we decided to dine in. Service was horrible. They are racists and only prefer group of people more than 4 or people with BYOB. Family people don't get fair treatment. Because I was not satisfied with the service I left $1.00 tip. I am not sure the lady that spoke to us is the manager or owner. After we left this lady comes running out and asks us what is wrong, instead of asking was the service bad, how could we improve. She started saying what kind of service do you expect? She says SHIT after hearing my response that I was not happy because you guys didn't attend as needed and ignored us all the time. Even food quality was not good. Guess what, she will not even get me take out food anymore. We use to spend like $30 every time twice a month take out. That is like $720/year. I will never dine again or take out in any of their restaurants...They are heading in the same direction as Paneng which went down the toilet. I never seen they employing any Americans, seems like something is fishy.
