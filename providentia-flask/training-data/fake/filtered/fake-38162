This place makes great coffee (enjoy the iced matcha as well). Loooong beer list. The food is really good. The employees are polite, attentive, but relaxed. The decor and vibe of the place is super welcoming. The neighborhood really needed a good coffee place and we hit the jackpot. Five stars. In response to other reviews- On "expense"- they source their ingredients at a higher quality than most restaurants. Yes, you're paying more than five dollars for a sandwich. If you want to stuff yourself to bursting with anything resembling food for under six bucks, there's a McDonald's right around the corner. On "hipster-ism"- no one can define that term. Sure, most people eating/working here are under 35, but there's a wide range of backgrounds of the young people going here. I guess they all share a enjoyment of wood furnishing, great coffee, and good service.
