Beware !  My wife and I recently went to the Amish Market in Princeton. We loved the people who worked there and the quality of food was excellent. We went to the fresh vegetables and bought 5 lbs of red potatoes, 2 lbs of carrots and 1 pound of fresh strings bean which came to over $21. My wife questioned the price and the cute little Amish girl smiled and repeated the price. We were rushed out by an impatient woman behind us who apparently had to have 5 tomatoes as soon as possible and felt the need to reach over my wife's shoulder while she questioned the price. They apparently don't like to give receipts to customers unless they ask. Why ?   I recommend buying products that are exclusively theirs and passing on the products which can be bought anywhere else. Beware !
