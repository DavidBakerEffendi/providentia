Ok, I'm originally from NM.  When they were in their little hole in the wall is have given them a 3.  Now they're all about cheap, dry food...I can definitely make better food at home.  My kids school had a fund raiser and I just gave them $20 so I wouldn't have to endure the cheap, dry food and shotty service!  Go elsewhere!
