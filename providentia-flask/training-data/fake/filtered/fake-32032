If you want a place that serves food that isn't too spicy or over seasoned, this is the best place to dine.  In addition, I had my birthday party here just two weeks ago and the staff and owner Gio was awesome!  They went out of their way to insure my party would be a success.  Even more so, Gio worked with me on my small budget and still managed to give an excellent menu.  Gio and Christina had went above and beyond to help me out on my party event.  They kept me motivated with positive thinking at the times I felt overwhelmed.  In the end, my party was fabulous and all my guest can't stop talking about the food served.  Don't let this small restaurant fool you.  It may be small but the food and service out wins some of the big restaurants patron.
