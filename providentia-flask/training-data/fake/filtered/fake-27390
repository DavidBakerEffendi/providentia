Went to Spumoni's last year ... The Pizza is not Sicilian ... it's pure American. Pizza in Sicily (Piazza Armerina is where I come from) is entirily different. I tried to spot an Italian in the kitchen but I only saw Latino people working there. The pizza was str8 up junk food ... totally overrated. New York is the greatest city in the world but claiming that this is the best pizza they serve in the city ...madoooona. I invite everybody to check Mamma Roma pizza in europe -- al taglio ... fresh, natural, real italian adn you will realise that spumoni is pure blasphemy
