Great food and generous portions. If you go at lunchtime, the line is long but do not be discouraged. It moves pretty quickly. Get a platter and you will have more than enough food. The falafel is really good. Try the spanish eggplant, it is amazing. Delivery is very quick too, but there is a $10 minimum.
