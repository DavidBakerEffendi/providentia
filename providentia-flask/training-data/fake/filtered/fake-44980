Pier I is a perfect place to go for a relaxing drink morning noon and night. It is expensive for what it is but much better than the overcrowded Boat Basin. I love their burgers and their fries and top notch, shoestring and perfectly seasoned. In the morning they have baked goods and great coffee if you are taking a walk down the Hudson. I would go for a pitcher of beer (Blue Moon is always my favorite in the summer) and some fries around 6 and stay with a group to watch the sunset. If you want to have an outdoor drink and not have to deal with the 1-2 hour wait of Boat Basin this is the perfect place!
