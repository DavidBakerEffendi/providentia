I used to go to Anthony's years ago under past management and the Buffalo wings were fabulous.  I had business south of Hightstown this past Thursday, September 4, 2014 and decided to have Anthony's wings for the first time in about 20 years.  What a shock..... new management that made wings the size of hummingbird wings....... I got the 7 piece and the seven wings combined may have had the weight of one wing from a reputable place. The buffalo sauce was all oil, probably soy oil and tobasco.  I will never go back again and I recommend you don't either!  These guys are crooks!!!!!!!!
