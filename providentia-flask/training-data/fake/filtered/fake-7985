Fantastic place.  Great food and service.  The atmosphere is just what I would want in a cafe - laid back, inviting and warm.  Staff is very friendly.  I tried their strawberry waffle which was fantastic. I also had their Vegan cupcake was one of the best I had - as was the cappuccino. They make everything in-house, and every thing tastes fresh and good! I would definitely go there again when I am in Philly next time.
