We went to this place to have drinks and appetizers and the old fart bartender had a lousy attitude.  Did not understand what her problem was.  She was a mute did not say a word just knotted her head.  So we had just one drink and decided to get out of that place.  The stupid bartender just threw the bill in front of us, and gave us the change without saying a word.  She was very nasty and very ignorant.  There was not music playing, just a few loud people.  Don't waist your time and money.  We are never going to this place again even though we live just a few blocks from that place.  Terrazza Restaurant and Bard stinks, I will be sure to tell all our friends and neighbors about it.
