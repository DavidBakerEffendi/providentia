Just got back from dinner here, had the lamb chops and they were perfect.  The combination of crusty sear and pistachio sauce was amazing.  The mezze platter was a tasty combination of all the favorites and each was delicious.  Great service staff, decent prices, and delightful ambiance.  If this is not a destination place now, it is going to be!
