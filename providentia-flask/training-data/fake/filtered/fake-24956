Awesome local steakhouse with great food and great service. We have been coming here since we moved to Little Falls 4 years ago.   Dining in the bar area is always a good experience. Bartenders are fun, friendly and attentive.  I highly recommend for anyone looking for consistent delicious and fresh food without having to drive to the city for good steak.  The creamed spinach and mac and cheese are YUMMY!  The owner also stops by and makes you feel like a special customer every time!  If you haven't been there, it's a must try.
