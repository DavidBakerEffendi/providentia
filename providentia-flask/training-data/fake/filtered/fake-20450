Locanda Verde translates to 'Green Inn'. This is *not* my favourite place for brunch, but it's okay. I had a latte, poached eggs on a bed of sausage hash with toast and a side of bacon (very healthy...not!). This place is a bit on the pricey side, but the venue is very nice and the service is swift and courteous. I have only ever eaten here at brunch so I can't comment on it, but everything looks good quality - the coffee beans are Illy.
