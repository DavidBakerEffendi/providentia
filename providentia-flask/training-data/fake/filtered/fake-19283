The food is okay. its a Â good place if your starving. the customer service is HORRIBLE. ive been here a few times with my family. They say its all you can eat, but is it really? by my second plate the waitress already gives us the bill without us asking for it. ever since that last time i never went back there. the food isn't worth the nagging waitresses that obviously want you OUT.
