Okay the customer service is great and the place looks really cool from the inside. The decor is very hipsterish (not a word but that can kinda explain what is looks like) which I like so why not 5 stars well....it's definitely not a place I want to go to at night especially when it looks uber creepy on the outside and while you're walking from the train station to Roberta's. NOW...the Pizza is great I went there with my nieces and nephew. We order the Margherita, El Supermo and The Bee Sting. We did order some gelato but I wasn't that much of a fan of it over all my experience was great.
