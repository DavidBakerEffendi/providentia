After recently hearing about the opening of a fresh seafood restaurant in Red Hook, my wife and I (two Brooklyn natives) decided to give it a try. Unfortunately we were told by the two unfriendly hostesses that it would be a 45 minute to an hour wait when there were plenty of open empty tables both upstairs and downstairs. It was 100 degrees out, like many Brooklyn natives and unlike many of the hipster migrants that frequent this establishment, I refused to wait in the heat when there were so many open tables available. It is a shame that many of the new restaurants that are popping up in Brooklyn are being dominated and frequented by droves of hipsters. In the words of the great Jeffrey Lebowski "the revolution is over. Condolences. The bums lost. My advice is to do what your parents did; get a job, sir. The bums will always lose."
