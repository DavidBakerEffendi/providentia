I went to this place for the first time and I have to agree with most of the reviews on here. The food here is great, my favorite thing two things that I tried would have to be the bread that goes with the hummus and the lamb kabab. I personally had the beef kabab and to be honest I did not love it but maybe it's due to the fact that I am not a big beef fan. It does get crowded but contrary to other reviews I would say they have great service. We got our food right away and other people seemed to get their food fair quickly. I have never had their rice before and I found it quite good. I highly recommend kabab paradise for anyone looking for a quick healthy middle eastern delight
