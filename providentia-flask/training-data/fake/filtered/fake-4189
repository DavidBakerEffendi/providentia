East West is awsome! Cool retro diner with great thai food. The staff has always been great with us and even often remembers customers names, This place is also on my 5 star list. Try the drunken noodle or pad thai dish. They are awsome! Also like the chicken curry puff. This place keeps getting better. Way to go east west!
