Went to dinner here and I loved it.  The place looks great, the dj they had on Saturday night was awesome.  After I finished my food, dessert, and cocktails...I still didn't want to leave the music was so good.  I had the special that night, the flank steak and it was delicious.  My friend had the oxtail pasta special and she left that plate clean!  Definitely worth checking out.
