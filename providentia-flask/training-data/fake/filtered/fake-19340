One of my fav rittenhouse places. A great deal for the quality of food you get. Most of the prices are comparable to Marathon Grill. A nice date restaurant with some charm. The gazpacho w/ pineapple sorbet is one of their specialties and its awesome. Service is always great and they take credit cards.
