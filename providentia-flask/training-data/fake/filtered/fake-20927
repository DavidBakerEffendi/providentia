Overhyped!!  After hearing all the hype about this vietnamese sandwich place from magazines and online, I was looking forward to checking out this place.  Today, I ordered a #1 Banh Mi Saigon and took it over to the park to enjoy it.  I was deeply disappointed, the pork meat was dry and oily.  I was barely able to finish even half the sandwich, ended up throwing out the other half.  Maybe this is the best place in NYC (I dont know), but I have definitely had way better vietnamese sandwich.  I'm Vietnamese and this place is no where close to what people are hyping it up to be.  If anyone has had Lee Sandwiches out in California, SaIgon Banh Mi Bakery is nowhere close to that kind of quality.
