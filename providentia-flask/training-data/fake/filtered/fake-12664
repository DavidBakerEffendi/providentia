This was one of the worst dining experiences we've ever had.   Went in for a special occasion (anniversary).     Cute little place, just our style (steak and wine?   DUDE!).   Had the seared fois, which gets them one star - it was divine. Trouble came with the main course.  Ordered a steak (which turned out to be ordinary, no more).   At almost $30 (in a town where main courses hover around $20), there were NO SUBSTITUTES for the garlic mashed potatoes.   "Huh", I asked?   I hate mashed potatoes but love baked, fried, rice, all the usual starches.   Waitress suggested I could get some linguini, since that was their nightly meatless dish.  I said "great!".  20 minutes later (in a tiny restaurant with less than 10 patrons) she came back and said that the owner said there would be a $10 upcharge for pasta.  When I demanded to speak to the owner she was, I'm sorry, a rude bitch that basically accused me of trying to steal from her.   I explained slowly that if I had to eat sauce-less noodles that would still be preferable to mashed potatoes.  So that's what I got - bare pasta.  I put butter on from the bread tray. Wine list is extensive but pricey, so I made do with one glass.   I can't enjoy wine knowing I'm paying $60 for a bottle I can buy for $25. Nothing could drag me back there except new owners who understand customer service.
