Let me tell you something about this place. It's awful! They are trying to be an upscale Peruvian restaurant but they are not. Please! These people need to get real. They look like a trashy bar from the outside, once you go in they are trying to hard to look upscale but they are not. Food is way too expensive for how it tastes and the service is horrible! However, I did see a lady manager and she was annoying the shit out of her waitresses so maybe that is why. I can not blame them. Will never go again and do no recommend you to go either.
