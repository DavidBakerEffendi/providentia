Okay, can't say enough for the food. The arrogant young waiter we had, a handsome very slim lad, couldn't put a damper on our meal, even though he dropped the drinks he was carrying all over my friend's legs and didn't have the courtesy to apologize. He then came over to our table and did the same thing. The food here is excellent. One thing, they should check this new young waiter on this saturday night - March 30th, and teach him some manners. He tries to tell you what you want. We were being nice, but others in our party were quite upset. The Food again was the best. Desserts, at 6 bucks for 1/2 cup portions, seemed to be filler for padding the bill as well as the alcohol. Leave the heavy drinkers at home, have the desserts somewhere else. Come here for the seafood.
