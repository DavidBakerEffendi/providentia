I waited over two hours for a simple delivery order.  After failing to deliver my food the manager told me that I could "either order my f---ing food or get f---ing lost." Having lived in Philly for five years I can honestly say this is the worst service I have ever encountered.  Will never order from here again. I would advise anyone to avoid this place like the plague
