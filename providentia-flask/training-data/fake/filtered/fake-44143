awesome little drive in! the seafood was cooked right in front of me. i ordered the sandbar combo,and within minutes I had this huge plate of fried fish (shrimp,scallop,filet,and clamstrips) w/fries and slaw,so big that i thought for sure I would not be able to finish it, and I was right. I had to bring some home for later! But Â the best thing was the prices! the combo was only $19.95 and they also have lunch platters starting at $8.95. not much view but LOTS of TASTE! Will go again and also recommend highly
