This is one of my favorite places in Manhattan because who would not love a delicious well portioned meal for CHEAP and I mean price.  I come here all the time with friends and end up spending $40 max on a three course meal and wine which also includes my tip. The host always remembers your name so if you bring friends here who haven't been it makes you look like a celeb, in an entertaining way. My favorite meals are the ravioli and gnocchi, to die for!!!!!!!! Oh but one time we got the calamari dish, not appetizer, and it wasn't something I expected them to serve.  So that might be the only thing there that I do not favor. Have fun dinning!!
