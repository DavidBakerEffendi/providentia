A group of friends and I went to Casa Piquin for lunch. The food was definitely worth the 25 minute ride (with traffic due to a car on fire). Overall the restaurant had a very authentic Mexican feel to it and the food was top notch. I've been to a couple Mexican restaurants in the area and this was the best tasting food by far. I had the Huraches which was a really good and I highly recommend it. I would absolutely go back to Casa Piquin.
