I recently went here with my boyfriend - and it was so great, we will definitely be going back again.   *The atmosphere is very relaxing, and the restaurant is tastefully decorated. * We had the pork dumplings - which were the best I've ever had.  They actually came in the wooden steam basket - and were so deliciously sticky that they really held on to the chopsticks. * We also had the Ramen.  My boyfriend had the spiced meat, and I had the vegetarian.  Both were delicious and filling.  The eggs were cooked perfectly. *Even though we didn't have the room in our stomachs, we decided to share a fried ice cream.  We went with the red bean, which was huge, and delicious. *The service was very prompt, accurate, and friendly.   Please, ignore the neon sign outside and step in - you will be very pleasantly surprised.
