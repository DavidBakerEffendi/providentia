If you want more than pretty signage on the bathroom doors, this place is not for you! The smoked fish is little more than aspic with mayo-laced frisee and 2 lost pieces of smoked specimen of some vague sort. The veal is an unidentifiable rubbery mass submerged in cream and uncooked mushrooms. The vegetable omelette consists of several slivers of peppers and tomatoes in a sponge-like consistency of blended egg mixture.  Should you ask for cheese in it, you will find 2-3 brave threads melted in the composition.  Our waiter put his personal blessing on the omelette by serving it with his bare hand over half the serving. One star for the French music!
