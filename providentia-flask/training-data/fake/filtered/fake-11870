One of the best family style dining restaurants in New York. Not as good as their 2nd Avenue location that closed because of the MTA nonsense but it is still top notch. Their chicken parm and pasta are excellent, service is wonderful, and the atmosphere in here allows for a great time with your dining party. The serving sizes are huge and are usually good for 3 people. If everyone in your table chips in, it's a great value. Don't forget to complement your food with their collection of wine.
