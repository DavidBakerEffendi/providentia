The food was amazing.  We had the octopus app and it was delicious, the soft bread is great.  For dinner I had the fried cow aka amazing skirt steak!  It was incredible.  My friend had the beef tenderloin and it was delicious. I love black cherry and saw they had a black cherry caipirihana and it was so incredibly good. The only bad thing about the restaurant is the service is SO SLOW!  You really shouldn't have any place to go after eating here, but wow, slow!   If you are trying to impress a first date and you know they like food, this is the place to go.  It is also great to go w/a bunch of friends to catch up and take your time enjoying yourselves.
