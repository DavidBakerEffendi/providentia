Location is cool, food is just alright, but i beg everyone not to support a restaurant like this. We had a small casual bday dinner planned last night. 4 people. I brought cupcakes from the birthday dudes favorite bakery as a surprise. When i asked the manager if he'd serve us the cupcakes at the end of our meal (and we had just ordered a ton of food and drinks) he said there would be a $10 plate fee per PERSON. I asked him to please reconsider and said that was akin to extorting customers but he wouldn't budge. With so many great places in NYC and managers/owners striving to offer the ultimate customer experience why would anyone support a place that doesn't do that.  It made the whole table feel uncomfortable and that we were in a place we didn't want to be in.  It wasnt like the food blew our minds It was just food. So for anyone reading this, please consider another place, that finds ways to be more accommodating to customers' requests.
