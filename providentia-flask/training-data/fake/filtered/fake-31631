Stopped in after mountain biking for a smoothie and was exceedingly impressed. The owner was friendly, the space is beautiful and my smoothie was delicious. It's a little off the beaten path but definitely worth a trip. I don't know what the negative reviews are talking about because I didn't wait in line, my order came up in a timely manner, the staff was knowledgeable and friendly and the price was fair. Give this place a shot and ignore the negative posts below.
