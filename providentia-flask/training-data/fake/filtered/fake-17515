Sakagura was one of the few places that I've been to in NYC and it was amazing!!!! Living in Boston, it's impossible to find an acceptable Japanese restaurant to dine at....I gave it up long ago. Anyways, here's the review. I went there with my family, total 4 of us. We ordered 1) IKA SHIOKARA (it's some raw squid soaked in squid liver and salt. it is VERY delicious but I would recommend this people who love traditional Japanese food only) 2) ONSEN TAMAGO (this is a cold soup with sea urchin and raw egg. I think it's just so-so, it has some kind of sweet taste in it) 3) FLUKE CARPACCIO (I ordered this based on the reviews on yelp...hmmm, I won't order it again, I don't even remember what it tasted like) 4) GYUTAN YAWARAKA NI  (it is beef tongue and its very very tender. I think its one of the best dishes I had at the restaurant) 5) HOMEMADE " NIHACHI SOBA "  (buckwheat noodle, it was okay, nothing special) 6) SANSHOKU NASU DENGAKU (if you love eggplant, its a must order! they have 3 grilled eggplants topped with 3 different kinds of sauce. I love the eggyork one!) We also got some other dishes on the special menu. I personally love the sashimi dish. There were 5 kinds of sashimi, we had salmon, tuna, sea urchin, (forgot the other 2) and they all tasted very good. I requested them to change one of the sashimi and they gladly accomodated, which was nice.
