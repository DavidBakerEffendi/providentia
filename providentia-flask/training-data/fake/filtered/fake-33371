If you know what good sushi is, then you should avoid this place like the plague! I grew up in the area and I remember how good the sushi was under the original ownership. Imagine: sushi prepared by actual Japanese sushi chefs who knew their craft. Unheard of these days (outside of NYC & environs). Several years ago, the place changed hands, and the quality plummeted. Today, the "sushi" is made with sub-par fish by Chinese cooks who know nothing--and I mean Nothing--about Japanese cuisine. And as if this weren't enough reason to run away, the service is absolutely rude.
