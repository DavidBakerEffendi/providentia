We recently went to a catered affair.  The food was substandard and very salty.  The salad consisted of water logged lettuce served on a bread and butter plate.  I ordered the stuffed filet of sole.  I needed a knife to cut through all the bread stuffing. The other guests disliked their selection as well. The portions were quite small and tasteless except for the handful of salt.  The pastry served on a table of ten were miniature and not enough for 5.  The coffee was served at room temperature without milk or spoons on the table.  The wait staff was inadequate at best. The price was high in comparison to other restaurants in the area. On a positive note, the restaurant is beautiful and the owner is quite pleasant and friendly.  He should fire the chef and hire competent employees.
