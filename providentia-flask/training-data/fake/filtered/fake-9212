This is one of my favorites places to eat in Philly. Everytime I come in, I get seated quickly with a smile. The service is great and the variety of food is always delicious. I just have to get the Roti Canai everytime because it is awesome!! Another strange thing is everytime I drive down to eat there, a parking spot opens up right in front of it! Is this a sign I am destined to eat here? Who knows but I am going in.
