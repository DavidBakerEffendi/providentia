Throughout my time in New Haven, I've heard rave reviews about Miya's Sushi, and so I was very excited to try it.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed with my food and I do not think I'll be returning any time soon. To be fair, I should preface my review by saying that I was running short on time and opted to have Miya's take-out, rather than having a dine-in experience.  Though, to be honest, I'm not sure if eating in the restaurant would have made my food taste any better, as it seemed inherently unenjoyable.   I ordered three rolls: the cucumber roll (very straight-forward, just cucumber, rice, and nori), the spicy asparagus roll (asparagus marinated with a spicy sauce), and the Chaud-Lapin (cucumber, asparagus, brie, and avocado).  I think it speaks to the quality of the food when I say that my favorite of the three--and by "favorite" I mean "least unpleasant"--was the plain cucumber roll, which had a nice textural crunch to it.   Throughout all three rolls, the rice was consistently mushy, sticky, and hard to swallow, and overall, I felt that the rolls lacked flavor.  The spicy asparagus was, in fact, not at all spicy; I had trouble even detecting the sauce on the over-cooked pieces.  And the Chaud-Lapin, which I thought was creative in its use of brie, tasted of nothing BUT brie, and had a very gooey texture going down. I'm giving Miya's the benefit of the doubt with my rating of two stars, as I am picky when it comes to sushi and did not take advantage of their wonderfully creative and even entertaining menu.  However, I would think that ordering simple sushi at a restaurant as lauded as Miya's wouldn't yield gross results as much as perhaps boring results.  And in this case, I definitely thought wrong...
