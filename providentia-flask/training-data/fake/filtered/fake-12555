A very sorry state of affairs, this place. To put it simply, Koreander is badly managed, the food is mediocre, the service is non-existent, and it's ridiculously over-priced. There's just no reason to come here for Korean food unless you have absolutely no choice. Now, to begin with... The food is prepared with very little care and cooked with sub-par ingredients. People enjoy some of the dishes purely due to the kitchen's liberal use of MSG. It's a shame really; none of the menu items are hard to make. Don't be surprised if they overcook the expensive meat. Basically, the food is incredibly mediocre and overpriced. You can find better food for better prices at just about any restaurant in the Palisades Park/Fort Lee area. Ban-chan (the small dishes given before the meal at every Korean restaurant) is very important, and Koreander cheaps out at a near comical level. They give a tiny plate of kimchi and an equally tiny plate of salad. Not more I can say about that. And, for a place that costs nearly $40 for a 2 person meal, you'd think they'd take credit cards. They don't. It's CASH ONLY. It's absolutely ridiculous, and just selfishness on their part. None of the staff are trained at all, so don't expect any sort of service whatsoever. They seem to cheap out on help and let one person do the work of two, so you'll be doing a lot of waiting. Koreander has all the signs of a badly managed restaurant. There is just no passion or care at all. It likely has very little time left to stay open, but know that you won't be missing out on much.
