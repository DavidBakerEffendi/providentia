horrible dont go there ever. the worst service ever. the people who work there are rude teenagers! i asked for the manager and one teen pretended to be him/she. it took an hour and a half for a med burger and the girl has the audacity to say she got tip 60 dollars before my table . so rude and unprofessonal. i would really want to contact the manager/owner myself edit delete
