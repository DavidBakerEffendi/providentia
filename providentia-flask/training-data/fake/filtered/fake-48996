We were having a great time with our friends until.. terrible drinks made by a nice bartender, fine. We were sitting at a table ordering drinks, until the manager Trish came up and said "we are about to be off and need this chair to sit" (about the staff about to be on break) then took a stool out from under a customer. Would never complain, since working in a restaurant understand how annoying customers can be. Until, terribly rude manager Trish had a noise complaint that our group was too loud. Normally, I would apologize profusely for this, having worked in restaurants for years myself. Trish came up to us and said, "You are being too loud, you are driving our staff crazy." The way the noise complaints were handled has to be the hands down worst management I've ever seen in a restaurant. NEVER, and I mean never, do you disrespect a paying customer on behalf of the staff who is being "driven crazy" by the noise level. Please, learn how to manage a restaurant before taking it upon yourself to disrespect 5 of the only 12 paying customers in your restaurant. I truly can't believe a place like this exists with paying customers, considering the awful drinks and service. Not only does Trish have 0 hospitality skills, she has driven away customers and soiled the reputation of Mother's Ruin.
