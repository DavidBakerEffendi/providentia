Came in for lunch today, Easy on the wallet(cash only) pleasant on the belly. been here three times in four weeks, each time food came out quick.  Their team is fast and efficient, slightly difficult to deal with when you're coming after a hangover.   Food is good, I prefer their breakfast items, seems like this place was built to turn and burn.   Friendly staff in this french inspired bistro.  Bottom line, nothing stands out of the menu but worth the locals coming back.   Clean.
