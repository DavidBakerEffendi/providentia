Visited the Totto Ramen with my friend as she heard that it's famous on Manhattan. After waiting for a long long time we could finally sit down and book two bowls of Ramen. However we felt really really disappointed. We tried many Ramen restaurants before, I can say that Totto cannot represent Japanese Ramen at all! The noodle tasted half cooked, and the soup made us unpleasant. Finally we two spent nearly $40 but did not eat up the food. I just could not understand why it is rated as a famous restaurant :-(
