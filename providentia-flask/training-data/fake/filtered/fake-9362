Not sure what I'm missing here.  Many people had told me I must try L.O., so I finally did on a recent trip to NY.  I live in SF and am accustomed to really good food; I eat out 4-5 nights a week.  (I even checked out the reviews before going and decided I had been missing something by not having already frequented the place).  Alas, I was SO disappointed.  The food was generally mediocre and overly salted.  I will say the meatball sliders everyone talks up reminded me of what my Italian nonni used to make, so that was a good thing.  The halibut was nicely prepared but nothing to write home about.  I'm sorry to say I won't go back.
