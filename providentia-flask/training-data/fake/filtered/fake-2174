I LOVE El Vez!  I always get the same thing - The Crispy Mahi Mahi tacos.  They're so good I can't imagine ordering anything else.  Before I had them, I loved the black bean & Cheese enchiladas.  Every friend I've ever been there with has loved their meals.  The guacamole is great.  The margaritas are delicious and strong.  The ONLY problem is it's very hard to get a table on busy nights - but that's just a testament to how good it is!
