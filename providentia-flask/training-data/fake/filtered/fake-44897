If you are in the mood to eat the best burger of your life...then look no further than this excellent English-style pub in midtown. I am convinced that this place is slated to have the #1 burger in all of New York. I went there in December and have been going there (almost on a weekly basis) to try new things on the menu. The roast beef sandwich was delicious and hearty, the ricotta appetizer is outrageous, the crab on toast is heavy, but also decadent. The foie gras is just incredible. What I like the most about the place, besides the ambiance, is the fact that you have 3 different areas where you can drink. A library-style area upstairs, then a loungy place next to it, and then a good old pub downstairs. The beer selection is stellar (Inis & Gun)! But if you go, do NOT waste your time on fish & chips, try the burger, please!
