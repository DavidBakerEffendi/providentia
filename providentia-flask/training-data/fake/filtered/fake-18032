The Devil's Alley strikes you at first as a fun spot to go for some drinks and bbq.  I decided this last Sunday to give it a run for brunch.  The menu comes across as spicy and greasy with fun drinks to go with.  Once we finally got our servers attention we ordered the shrimp hash with andouille sausage and chorizo scramble with grilled tomatoes.  I can be a little tough on service sometimes but I would have to say this took the cake.  Not only was our server rude and unavailable, she seemed wildly irritated with a nice server that filled our long empty coffee.  The food came under-seasoned and overcooked, though pleasantly hot and greasy.  We finished with full stomachs from the large portions.  The mediocre food was the only saving grace for our terrible service.  Our server only appeared to drop the check.  Once we had paid she only reappeared to tell us she had given the wrong check which she through down and walked away.  We will visit again, but probably just stick to the bar.
