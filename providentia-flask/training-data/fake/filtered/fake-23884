We tried bridgid's on a whim and were pleasanttly surprosed. I was a bit concerned seeing the bad reviews but they apparently have a new chef. The atmosphere is local watering hole but the food was really great. We tried the muscles, flatbread and cauliflower pasta for apps. All three were great. The muscles were huge and very fresh. We had the feticunni (homemade) with shrimp and the chicken. The chicken was amazing and to quote my sister the pasta was "little angles wings" very light very fresh.
