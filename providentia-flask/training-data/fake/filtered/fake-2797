On March 1, 2014 we attempted to have dinner at Cuban Pete's but that never happened; however I have eaten there before. I like to added to Dorels O. comment on March 3, 2014. I cannot say anything bad about the food; However the way the owner Dominick Restaino treats the customer is very alarming. I am very surprised that his business is thriving which is a testatment of the food itself. I strongly recommend that Dominick get evaluated mentally in hopes he gets the help he needs, as I afraid that he may go berserk on someone physically or before he suffers an aneurysm over the stress of sitting people in his restaurant. From what I have witnessed to this past Saturday Dominick is definitely needs to find an avenue for stress reduction and I like to suggest a nice Cuban vacation to start. Some day Dominick will meet a person that will not simply tolerate his behavior. My recommendation is have you party together before approaching the Hostess desk for seating and ignore the man near or at the desk. I would like to know what day the owner is not on the premise as this would be the time I would prefer to visit if I ever choose to return. There are plenty of good food in the area and people do not have to tolerate his behavoir.
