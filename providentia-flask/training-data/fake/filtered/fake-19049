SO DELISH! This is the best pizza i've had in the city. Â Joe's used to be my favorite, but Artichoke is better. I had the margherita pizza. The spinach and artichoke and the crab pizza is a little too adventurous for my tastes. I saw them place chunks of parmesan cheese on the dough before putting on the sauce. Maybe that's the secret....
