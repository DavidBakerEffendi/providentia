Manager out of line.  While attending the Passyunk Street Festival, we were stranded in a torrential downpour at around 3:30pm on Sunday July 24, 2013.  My wife and I along w/our 20 month old daughter stopped in Le Virtu in order to escape the rain.  After seeing highchairs and inquiring as to whether children were allowed, we were seated by the curly haired manager.  Mind you, there were 10 other customers,all seated at the bar, in the entire restaurant.   After receiving our risotto, my wife went to use the restroom.    On her way back to the table, she was standing directly behind the curly hair manager as he told the waiters that he was ready to kick us out as our daughter was crying at the time and for only a short time.  This was now 4:00, and a nearly empty restaurant. When the manager turned around and noticed my wife, he tried to play his comments off, and acted as if he hadn't said anything.     My wife returned to the table and informed me of the situation.  The waitress returned and informed us that the rest of our food was only a few minutes away.  That is when I questioned her re her manager's comments.  She acted surprised, but knew my wife had heard his wayward comments.   When the manager came to speak with us he rolled his eyes as if we had ruined his swamped Sunday.  He informed us that "He wasn't actually going to kick us out"(into the rain), and that he would "Give us a gift certificate for another day".   We politely declined, paid our tab, loaded our daughter into her stroller, and took a soggy walk back to our S. Philly abode in the down pour. Very unpleasant experience, would not return.
