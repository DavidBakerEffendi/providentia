Not ready for prime time. French is a difficult language for most. Duck should lead the menu. My duck was flavorless and not warm. The Calamari Salad was petite and less than a fresh catch. The Cornish Hen was flavorful but the size of an appetizer. This place is ideal for young couples exploring atmosphere without a budget concern. I enjoy paying for great food or satisfying Â portions, but when both are missing, who wants to order dessert?
