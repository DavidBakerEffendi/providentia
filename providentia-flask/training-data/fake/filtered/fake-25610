Wow! Hands down, Abe Fisher has the best service I've experienced in Philadelphia. My husband and I stopped in last weekend, without a reservations, and the staff was super accommodating to get us seated. Our waitress was incredibly attentive and extremely helpful when it came to menu selections. We tried the veal schnitzel tacos and we will definitely come back to order them again! The small plates are great for sharing and allow you to sample several of the unique menu offerings. My husband and I are relatively new to the city, and enjoy spending our time trying out new restaurants. The manager visited with us and shared a list, compiled by the staff, of other recommended restaurants in the city to try out. The service, food, and atmosphere exceeded our expectations. Kudos to the entire kitchen and staff for making our dining experience such a pleasant one!
