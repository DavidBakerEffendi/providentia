This place was just awful. The food was terrible and cold. We were told to pick it up in 40 minutes we were there in 35 minutes and ended up not getting it until another 55 after we arrived which you would think indicates that it was nice and fresh, not at all! Most of it was ice cold. Also messed up our order completely. Gave us an item we didn't order and shorted us 2 items we did order. We also asked that the items be labeled since we were eating with people who had never had Indian food. Not one item was labeled and some of it was thrown together so items that had nothing to do with each other were thrown together and squished up in one aluminum foil ball. Tried calling to complain and were basically told to bad so sad. We gave up trying and decided to eat what we had. What we did manage to eat was subpar and some of it was downright nasty and not anywhere near the level of other Indian restaurants. Thank goodness we used a living social coupon so we only paid $20 for $40 of trash. I wish I could give this less than 1 start because on a 1-5 star rating, this rates a black hole. Needless to say, I would not recommend this place to my worst enemy.
