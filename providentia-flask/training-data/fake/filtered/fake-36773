Very rarely does a restaurant make such a lasting impression on my life.  But what can I say...the mock eel is incredible, the string beans are out of this world, and one bite of the dumplings will have you pining for more upon leaving, it also doesn't hurt that I met the absolute love of my life here in 2008.  I could credit all my happiness right now to hard work, dedication and the courage to take a risk and put full trust in the reciprocating heart of another...but I owe it all to the mock eel.  Thank you, Single Pebble.  My life is forever changed because I dined at your back table four years ago.
