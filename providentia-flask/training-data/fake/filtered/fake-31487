I just ordered from here for the first time and we were super satisfied! Everything was very affordable for big portions, and on top of that, they gave us two sodas with our order at no charge. Their menu has a lot of variety, especially vegetarian options. The vegetable lo mein was yummy and the general tso's bean curd was unbelievable!!! I'm very happy. I will definitely be ordering from here again.
