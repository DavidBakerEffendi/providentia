Under new management???!!  This place is horrible!!   My wife and I ordered a Margherita pie and it was honestly the worst pizza we ever had. First of all, it was cold.  The crust was beyond thin and the cheese was hard, probably from the pizza being cold.  We also ordered a cold antipasto appetizer.  It was decent, but the iceberg lettuce was pitiful.  We're not even interested in trying any other food from this place.  It's unfortunate that the previous owner left, because this place will not be a success with the new management.
