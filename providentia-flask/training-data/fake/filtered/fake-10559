If you're already in the neighborhood, it is a great place to stop by for a bite and tipple.  Between 2 of us, we had 5 dishes, and all were quite good (not excellent, but worth having).  There was a DJ playing appropriate tunes, but the overall ambiance is very loud if there is a crowd (and there always is).  Close to Manhattan prices.  What separates this from the rest of the new breed of "Italian Tapas" is the friendly and knowledgeable staff.
