We have eaten here a few times and ordered delivery. The food is pretty good, especially for the area. I've had better Lebanese, but this part of Queens is kind of a black hole as far as food options go. Last time we ordered delivery, they didn't give us the hot sauce we had asked for with our shawarma wrap or pita chips for the fatoush. Additionally, there was a piece of paper towel in my fatoush. Not a small piece either, a whole sheet, enough to dry adult sized hands with. :( If you have to order in, I wouldn't recommend Wafa's. Â They don't seem to put their orders together very well.
