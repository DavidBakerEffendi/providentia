Haven't been there for regular lunch or dinner but I've eaten there twice for brunch and it's nothing to rave about. First, the wait for brunch was a bit long which would have been fine IF the food is good - but it wasn't. The menu was overpriced - I ordered the egg omelette w/ 3 choices of stuffing, served with french fries and when the dish came, I could have gotten a better omelette at your typical diner! AND it was $14 which was def not worth it. My partner ordered eggs w/ asparagus and feta cheese (which was also $14) and when the dish came, it looked like something your kid scrambled for breakfast just to whip up something real quick. It looked so unappetizing that she returned the dish to order a regular omelette which wasn't much better either! On the bright side, the waitress was accommodating and there was regular coffee refills. Overall a disappointment - too long of a wait, overpriced, food was mediocre...this is NYC - you can find much better brunch places than here. I think people just like to come here because of the charming country decor.
