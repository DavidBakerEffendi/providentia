Honeygrow gets 4 stars because the stirfry is delicious, the honeybar is amazing, and the staff is super friendly and attentive. The whole place is clean and great. I only give it 4 stars because if you don't order ahead, the line is going to take 30 minutes at lunch, and I'm usually in a big rush.
