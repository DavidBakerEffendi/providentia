As an out-of-towner looking for a nice place for a family dinner, I am delighted to have stumbled on this place.  (It was recommended by someone working at a store down the block.)  There was none of that "Hi, I'm so-and-so and I'll be taking care of you tonight" b.s., just great service from a friendly, attentive server. The food was good, not perfect, but carefully prepared.  Prices seemed a bit high to me, but not outrageous.  I would go back.
