If you go here and you love meat, you HAVE to get the lamb chops. I'm not sure what they put on it, but it's absolutely delicious and flavorful. I've never been disappointed with a Garces restaurant, and this is probably one of my favorites. Everytime I've been here, it's almost always busy. I would also recommend the Tinto Sangria
