We've been going to the Monarch, since it opened and have never been disappointed.  The menu is varied enough to provide the usual diner specialties, but with a flair. Their daily specials are very nicely planned and executed, and they have always tried to be as accommodating, as possible (less oil, not too rare, etc.).  But the one nice thing that brings us back is the consistency.  They're consistent in everything they make, unlike many local diners who seem to vary their recipes, with the shift on duty. Their service is really good, and although we have never been loyal to any one server, we've come to know them all. Their managers are all good, and they clearly have an eye on things.  Recently, they instituted a loyalty card, that accumulates points.  Five hundred points will get you a $25 gift card, the way I understand it.
