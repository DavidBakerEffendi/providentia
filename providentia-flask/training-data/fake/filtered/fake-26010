Had a nice lunch at Cafe Petisco with a friend today. friend had the delicious egg burrito, nice size and comes with salad and avocado, so fulfilling.  I had the chicken Pita. Seems like they make their hummus differently. It just to be very delicious. now it is just ok. Service was spotty we didnt get our glassed refilled through the whole meal.  Love the atmosphere though and it seems that they have made some changes around .  thumbs up for that!!   Still recommend it.
