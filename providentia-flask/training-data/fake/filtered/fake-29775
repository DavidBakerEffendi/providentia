Well, me and a few of my co-workers wanted food so we all chose this place since we haven't had it before.  The food was terrible.  We all got cheesesteaks.  Some didn't have what was requested, some had a very weird taste.  Disgusting.  Don't get me started on the people that work there either.  Very out of touch, possibly high as a kite.  Couldn't answer any questions we had on the phone.  When I got there to pay, the guy couldn't give me change, and apparently ran out of change.  This was 20 minutes after they opened!  And on top of all that, they told me it would be 10 minutes for the food, and it took 30 minutes.  NEVER AGAIN. The food tastes and smells like bigfoots dick.
