Not even an hour ago I ordered the lunch special shrimp lo mein with white rice with a small egg drop soup. 1. Egg drop soup did not have a soup consistency and severely lacked flavor. 2. After finishing 90% of the shrimp lo mein with the white rice I found a part of a cleaning product used to clean pots. (it looks like a ball of metal wires packed together) Yes, I found a lovely part of it in my food. This is not my first time ordering from here, I've ordered multiple times for the past 2 years, but this will be my last. Take precaution when taking your first bite, might have metal shavings in your food.
