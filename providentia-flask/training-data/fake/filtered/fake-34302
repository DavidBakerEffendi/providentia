This is the best sushi I have ever eaten. They're only open for a couple hours for lunch so make a reservation if you can.  I love sitting at the sushi bar and checking out how each piece of fish is delicately handled and prepared.   Really, once you try this you'll find it really hard to buy the crap sushi at your typical lunch place.   Downside right now is that they're "Grade Pending" and I walk by everyday on the way to work and it kinda bums me out.  But I'm hoping it's just a minor thing since it is raw fish and all. :/
