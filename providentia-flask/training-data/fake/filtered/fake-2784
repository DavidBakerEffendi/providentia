Delicious food and sangria but HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.  This used to be my go to spot to bring out-of-town guests, yet the other day I was rudely treated by the manager when I asked the time remaining till our table was ready (after politely waiting for an hour).  After a few minute conversation in which I never cursed or raised my voice, the manager yelled at me for trying to "outsmart him" and demanded that I leave.
