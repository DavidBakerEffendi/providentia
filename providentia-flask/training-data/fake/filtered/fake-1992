A bit too noisy for me. I liked the beet salad and the Greek salad. The grilled octopus was too chewy for my taste, but my friend's fried calamari were just right. The rice on his entree was totally bland, though, Wish they'd do something about that. Not sure when we'll get back. There's much to eat in this town!
