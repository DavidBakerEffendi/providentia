I have just recently started a personal food tour in which every weekend I google restaurants in a certain cuisine and go out to dine.I rate each restaurant I visit based on customer service and quality of food,as well as, the decorum. I recently visited Mamagyro and I must say I loved the food! The gyros are small but seeing how I watch my figure it was just enough for me and worth every penny! The decor is somewhat simple and boring and its a very small space. The customer service on the other hand was Wonderful!!! While waiting for my food I engaged with one of the girls working the counter I think her name was Iyana she was very nice and polite spoke with lots of energy and was helpful. Most people get annoyed by the ignorance of a new customer but she was very helpful and patient and rather very funny.... She definitely earned her tip!If ever in the neighborhood again I will be dropping by again... GOOD JOB MAMAGYRO!
