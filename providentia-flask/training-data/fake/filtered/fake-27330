Some of the best bartenders in the city here.  Everyone of them is top notch, remembers your name, and takes care of you. The food is great.  Some of the best Clam Chowder in town, and as much as I hate to order chicken when I'm out in the city, any chicken dish they have on the menu is amazing.  There's a downstairs, so if upstairs looks too busy, check out the downstairs with the table-taps.  Pretty awesome.
