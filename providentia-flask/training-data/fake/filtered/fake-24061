This place really sealed the deal for me with great tasting smoothies made with all natural organic ingredients. I had the Kale smoothie but you can actually create your own flavors and combinations (although I see no reason for doing any such thing with choices such as "Get up, Stand up" & "Body Tech" you will have a wide array of selections from the menu). They also serve delicious gluten free treats/pastries and Vegan Kosher ice cream! The zucchini bread is a must! They will have you returning day after day for more! The location is small so not much room for large groups, however the service is very efficient so that it never feels too cramped or overcrowded. The location is also impeccably clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. Drop by, you can't miss out on this great experience!
