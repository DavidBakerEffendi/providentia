Dinner 11/6/12 at 7:50PM The Food is tasty but I was treated so rudely and with such disdain by the smarmy little chap (stands at podium, guides you to your table, etc.) that I will never go back.  Not only was he dismissive and downright rude, he was disrespectful and literally hissed in my face.  The manager of the restaurant didn't seem to surprised, so after many a lovely meal I will not be going back... To drive home the point, the behavior was so bad we did not finish our food and just left.  Note to restaurant "fire that little bitch".
