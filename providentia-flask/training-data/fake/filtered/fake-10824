Called and asked how long for a table of 4.   Host said 20 min so we told them we were coming since they don't take reservations.  We get there and same host says about 25 min so we go on the list.  So 50 minutes later the hostess come out and tells us 25 minutes more !  Or perhaps the four of us would rather eat at the bar.      Yet four or five sets of three and a few of two get in.   No problem.  She was so delighted I said we may just leave and thanked us so much for waiting and took off.   So never got in and will never go there again.   So inconsiderate.  Unless you knew the hostess they all got in    So a great day was made a night to forget because they can't manage themselves.  It's one thing to push people off for a while but to totally miss by an hour on purpose     Don't deserve my business.
