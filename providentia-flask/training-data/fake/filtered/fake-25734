Katz Deli, NYC, Carnegie Deli NYC, Rye Ridge Deli Stamford CT The above restaurants would be rated "outstanding."  Katz, Woodbridge CT, not so much.  Wait staff grudging and hard to chase down.  Not overly clean.  What happened to Chuck and Al's of Whalley Avenue of the 60's and 70's that I remember well?  They never disappointed.  Katz was a real let down as it was nowhere in the league of the above mentioned restaurants. Lackluster sandwiches.  I have family that never leave Stamford without pastrami from Rye Ridge Deli, the pastrami I had at Katz was thick, unflavorful and despite having arrived hungry  didn't bother to finish it.l When I go to NYC if I'm in the mood for deli I know where to go.  Fortunately in Fairfield County there is Rye Ridge. Katz lacks charm, authenticity and personable staff.  Go west, deli lovers, go west.
