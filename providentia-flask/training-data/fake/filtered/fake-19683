I love pizza, like what would my last meal be if I had a choice...pizza! This restaurant surpassed my expectations because it looks like a hole in the wall but once you step inside you instantly change your mind. Its decorated well, comfortable, but still classy. The menu offers an array of appetizers and different types of pizza, that can only be Italian inspired. The ingredients are fresh and you literally feel as though you have left the country. This is my favorite pizza place to date and I highly recommend you try it out!
