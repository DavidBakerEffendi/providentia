We were really lucky to get a table here, it was busy! But that by no means had any impact on the food or service. We ate at a few places in Brooklyn and a close second would be Bennys Chop House. But Buttermilk Channel really is superb! The flavours and tenderness of the meat was just devine, I ate it so slowly to savour every bit. Bob was our waiter and he was great, gave recommendations on food and was very tentative. If you want a great steak or seafood or both and you can get a table, book here. Wish we'd of discovered it the first night!
