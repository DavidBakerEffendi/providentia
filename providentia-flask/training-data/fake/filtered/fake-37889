I have been frequenting this store for a few years and have generally been satisfied - until now. They have a good selection of products. However, I am concerned about the freshness of food in the deli. I have twice been given food that was stale/spoilt. I also once took home pita with mold on it. The owner was rude when I brought this up and did not apologize - hardly the way to run a business.
