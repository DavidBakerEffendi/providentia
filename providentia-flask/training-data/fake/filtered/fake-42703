We ordered take out for our family one Sunday night.  We got chicken tender meals for the kids, an order of coconut shrimp, a buffalo chicken wrap and a honey ham ciabatta club sandwich.  It was excellent, both of my kids ate all of their meals, and that is a rarity.  The coconut shrimp was delicious, it was crunchy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside.  The spicy sweet sauce it comes with had a bite to it and was excellent.  We used to online ordering and I was pleased with the fact that it was all done when I got there.  By the time I got it home the sandwiches were a bit soggy, but I did have a bit of a drive.  When I told the guy at the register that  I was going to get a cookie too, just one because they are HUGE, for my kids to share, he just let me have it.  That right there made a repeat customer out of me.  I really like the fact that they use local ingredients also.
