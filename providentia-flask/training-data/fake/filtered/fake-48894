I've been to the Almond in the Hamptons  a million times and I love it. it has been one of my favorite restaurants for a long time. Casual, cool, great service and the food is great. I went to Almond New York yesterday (July 22nd) for lunch. My food was good. The Avocado soup was delicious. I had skate as my main course. It was okay. Not great. What was concerning to me was the service. Or lack of it.  It seemed like an eternity before they brought my main course. I had to ask for water when my bottle was empty. The server was a nice enough guy, but I seemed to have to chase everybody to get everything. Maybe I was just disappointed because I took a friend from out of town thinking it was a sure thing and he wasn't impressed. Just another restaurant in NYC with good food average service.
