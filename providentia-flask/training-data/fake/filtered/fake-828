My family and I went to Knock for my husbands birthday. We knew nothing about the restaurant before we went but based on the reviews, we figured we would try it. Although the staff was very friendly, they were in my opinion a little put off by my two young children. (When I made the reservation I asked if it was ok to bring them, they enthusiastically said yes.) As soon as we walked in they said they didn't have anything for them to eat but that they would find some chicken fingers and french fries!! Already assuming thats what I feed my children?!(Where they would find them I am not quite sure.) The food was so so, my husband cooks better at home. I ordered the seafood combination and it came sitting in a pool of butter, and they did not even have what my husband wanted to order. Not the worst part. After dessert was nearly finished, a COCKROACH crawled across our table!!!! Like he wanted to join us! Not a single staff member came to apologize to us after we told our waiter, including the waiter. He took our money gave us our receipt as if nothing ever happened. Needless to say we won't be returning and neither will anybody we know!
