TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE The worst cheese steak sub I have ever tasted....... My family and I drove from Baltimore to Philidelphia to eat this sub. Saw Geno's and PaT'S advertisement on Diners Drive inns n Dives. Wanted to try it so took a day trip .  Traveled from home Baltimore and arrived at Pats first. Hmmm, not to bad just not enough meat . All the lights and carnival attractions took us to Genos. WHERE's THE BEEF!!!!!!!. My goodness what a joke. Could not believe it. I was so embarrassed. My family asked togo home to EAT. Disappointed. theywere so hungry.After spending 7.50 and 1.50 for a drink for each of us Iwas broke. Tolls too. you know . Anyway Pats was better ,but come to Baltimore and eat a Filetties  cheese steak sub I promise you you will not be disappointed. $4.75. and you can make 2 subs out of 1. So much beef . dDelicious.
