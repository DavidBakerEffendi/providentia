I had a family dinner here during the holiday months. 15 people. Service and food was excellent. Definitely make reservations as far ahead as possible.  Family Style eating which is great for large groups. We were there almost three hours. Their pasta is homemade and their Alfredo pasta dish is awesome!!!  I still talk about it.
