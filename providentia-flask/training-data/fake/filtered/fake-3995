My husband and I stopped in last week and were quickly seated, in spite of the large crowd.  Our waiter was pleasant but a bit overwhelmed.  We explained that we were in no hurry so they brought the bread and we really enjoyed it and the oil for dipping.  The food is good, old fashioned Italian with plenty of sauce and cheese!  Really rich and filling.  Nothing fancy here but nice for dinner, especially with a group of friends. Wine is available a few storefronts down and they have a nice selection, too.
