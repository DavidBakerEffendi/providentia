Hell's Kitchen is a great place.. Loved the drinks, the food, the music and the awesome service we received. My waitress was a girl by the name of Elle, she was absolutely adorable and had a great sense of style.. her outfit really fit the whole theme of the restaurant. Overall, I would give it another star if I could! I especially enjoyed the pole dancing after a few drinks! Â  ;)
