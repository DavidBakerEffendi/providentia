When I was a child, I used to come here and it here almost everyday for pizza and Spaghetti or sometimes both everyday. About 15 years ago I moved away from this neighborhood a few hours away into PA and ever since, I have tried the dishes i mentioned above at other pizzerias and nothing has ever come close to this place. their Spaghetti sauce as a spice to it that i just find divine. Recently i was in the area because I needed to go into NYC and stopped by here and while the older workers appear to have retired and newer younger employees work here, The food is better than I remember and better than any other pizzeria I have been trying for the past 15 years. I wish I lived closer so I can work here for free and try and learn their receipe to their Spaghetti as well as their Italian subs is also the best in the world. I've tried these dishes when I when to Italy and can say it's done better here. Nothing short of miracle this place. -Paul's Clothing
