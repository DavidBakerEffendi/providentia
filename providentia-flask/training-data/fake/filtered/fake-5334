I had my husband's 50th birthday party catered by Belgiovine's. The food was delicious, delivered on time, and enjoyed by 26 guests, most of whom asked where the food was from. Even the salad was displayed in such a pretty presentation. I had never gotten anything from here before but decided to do it based on the reputation of the fresh mozzarella. I heard that it was the best outside of Jersey City and Hoboken. Having grown up in Jersey City with an uncle who had an Italian deli and made the best mozzarella in Jersey City, I made the leap of faith that at place that has great mozzarella would most likely have great everything else. I was not disappointed!
