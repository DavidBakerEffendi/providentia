Had a great evening with friends.  Loved the avocado salad.  Tried the duck on a suggestion, it's excellent.  Service was great, very attentive and our waiter helped us choose some great dishes.  Raven, the manager, made us feel very welcome.  We will definitely be back.  A little hard to find, but free parking makes it worth it.
