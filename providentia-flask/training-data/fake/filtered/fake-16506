Valentine's Day 2012 - I called in our order at 4:30 to ensure they would have plenty of time to get it correct. I told him I would pick it all up at 5 - he said no problem. I arrive at 4:55 - they already have several tables sat and everything appears to be in order. The owner, I believe, tells me it's going to be 10 more min...this was at 5:05. Then at 5:15 she tells she they are packing it up. So I conclude they didn't begin making it until 5pm. When I explained to her that I called my order in she smiled and said "we open at 5" - which I found odd since people were already there before 5. I chose not to check my bagged goods as I was already late arriving home. When I got home I found an inedible salad (slime and mold) and my daughter's rolls (which I specifically asked to be rolled tight and sliced thin) were thick and stood about 1 1/2" high. This made it difficult for her to eat it (she's 6) and she felt sad at dinner. Overall this experience LACKED what I had hoped it would be. Let's just hope better luck next time and that they communicate with their customers better.
