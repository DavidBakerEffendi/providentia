This place is horrible.  Clearly they have never heard of two things: clean interior ambiance and food seasonings.  The dining room is filthy and drab and the flood is terribly bland.  My overpriced filet was way over cooked and flavorless and the mashed potatoes and veggies might as well have come from your kid's school's cafeteria.  In fact, that might even be a step up from this place.
