Warmest staff in town!   I went on a busy Saturday night with friends.  I ordered a bottle of wine to share at the bar, and the bartender brought it back right away, mentioning that they also have a half-price special on bottles on Sunday nights.  I thought it was really thoughtful of him, given how busy the bar was.
