Came to Ela on a whim tonight. Never been, but saw it coming back from a regular place we go to on Catherine. It is kind of hard to see from outside, but the place is charming and amazing inside. Â The bartender, Maria is so informative (I told her I want dry, full bodied red... I GOT the best wine I've ever tasted, on point!) Can't wait to come back for dinner!!!
