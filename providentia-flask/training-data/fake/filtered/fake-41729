Better Bites was a welcome addition to the Newark lunch scene.  Newark is lacking in healthy lunch options, and this fills that gap.  It does some things very well - the Santorini Bison Burger, for example, is delicious.  But I have one big complaint -- their salad greens are often not fresh.  I expect when I order mixed greens that there won't be slimy, rotten pieces of lettuce and spinach mixed in with the romaine.  Do they not notice?  Or not care? Source better lettuce, people!  This is not a difficult thing to do.  I will not order salads there again unless they address this issue.
