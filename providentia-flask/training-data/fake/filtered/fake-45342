ambience gets a 9, everything else a 1, food choices are minimal and not at all delicious, drinks overpriced with negligible alchohol. In order to get repeat business they are going to have to re-do their business plan, getting people in the door is one thing having them come back is a different story.  The table beside me also had complaints.  the kitchen is slow... Very dissapointing for me as I was hoping this would be my go to in the neighborhood.  Sadly i will never return...
