I went there to meet some friends. No one acknowledge I was even sitting at the bar. I waited 15 minutes before I asked the bartender with the pig tails if she could get me a drink and was immediately given attitude and told Kevin would be with me. I waited another 10 minutes until I could get his attention. Finally got a drink. Another gentlemen came in and got the same lack of service. Once my friends showed up we had to ask yet again to be served and for menus. I hadn't even finished my drink, nor had the gentlemen next to me, and Kevin went to take our drinks and asked if we were done. Clearly we were not we both had half a drink left. Extremely rude. Once we got our meals the wrong meals were served to us and had to be sent back. Finally got the correct order, my friend order mild tenders and got sweet and sour instead. No one checked on how our meals were. Again I had not finished my meal and Kevin took the plate right from me, which my friend was eating off of since her meal was incorrect. It took 20 minutes to just get a second drink after I had ordered it. I've worked in Boston as a bartender, as well as, Vermont and from experience both of them would have been fired on the spot. Probably the worst service I had gotten in a long time, very disappointing. Clearly the are not experience bartenders because if they were they would have known to provide decent customer service since that is how they make their money and not focus on the quick and easy in and out customers that walked up to the bar to just grab one drink. Time to get better staff or an actual manager on duty who oversee's whats going on.
