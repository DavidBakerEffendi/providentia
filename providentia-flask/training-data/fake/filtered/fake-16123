Cafeteria is a go to place for a fast meal. It's nothing great but does job. The scene is fun, very loud but a nice spot for people watching. Â I always go for the calamari salad, it's very tasty yet fried calamari. I recommend ordering a cocktail over wine because the whites are rather dull. Portions are big, quality is fair,it's loud, and fun.
