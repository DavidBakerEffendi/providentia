Zen is by far the best sushi in town!  The mango tango and 3 stooges rolls are favs.  I always make a reservation for lunch - they can really fill up.  Love the fact is it BYO - and there is a liquor store - Wine Legend a few store fronts down.  A little pricey - but not when you think about the quality of sushi you are getting.
