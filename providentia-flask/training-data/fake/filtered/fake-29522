I must say the food here is pretty good. I had the salmon w/ Mac & cheese which was tasty. The salmon was seasoned well & not over cooked. The Mac & cheese was yummy, has a nice crispy top. Sangria is also pretty good. Overall, it's a nice place, the crowd was decent, but it can be a little pricey.
