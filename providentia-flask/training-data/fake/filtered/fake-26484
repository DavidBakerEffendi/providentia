I've eaten a lot of Portuguese food in a lot of places and Chateau Madrid is one of the best I've had. The food is always great, they have specials a lot, they have events that rotate (I always check their FaceBook before leaving), and the service is always awesome. Between the food and the Sangria I can never stay away for too long! I have even attended family events in the back room which they had deced out and I loved the privacy.
