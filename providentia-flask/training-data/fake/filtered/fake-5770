BENITO ONE IS #1 The food is very good and the service is excellent. They have a special... which is very affordable.  I had the tilapia and my friend had the sausgae and peppers.  It came with salad and pasta and dessert and coffee. It was great to have an enjoyable meal and not have to leave our bank books there.  We'll go back   .
