My wife and I had dinner on Saturday night and boy we were not disappointed. Very unassuming from the outside, but when you walk thru the doors you are transported to a different world. Saw Scott Conant as a judge on "Chopped" and he definitely backs up what he says as a judge on the show for those who have seen it. Service started with the waitstaff, they were engaging and pleasant, not pretentious and distracted. Our waiter was superb, charming and not too obtrusive. The food for appetizers my had the seared sea scallops - very good though only one side was seared, and I had the tuna susci - excellent melted in my mouth. For entrees my wife and I had the special white truffles with tagliatelle the cost was worth it ( $85 per plate ) that is the first time the entree was more then the liquor bill. Anyway I highly recommend the restaurant great food, service and decor.
