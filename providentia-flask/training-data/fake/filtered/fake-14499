After reading all of the reviews on here I was excited to check this place out. I am a bit of a pizza snob but my snobbery encompasses all corners of the pizza kingdom; while I may be partial to a certain type of pie, I can appreciate just about anything that is executed well. This pizza however, is not particularly exciting. The dough is a bit on the sweet side and I think that they are going for a Napolitano style but falling short. The cornicione is lackluster and the dough itself is unremarkable. The sauce tastes like your standard slice joint stuff and there were strong flavors of oregano and the sauce itself was sweet and tasted a bit pastey. The salads were ok, better than the pizzas, but nothing too remarkable either. The service however was exemplary and everyone was very friendly and attentive.
