Been eating here almost my entire life. Got introduced when I was a but wee lad and I thank my parents for showing me this haven. I come here at least once a month, kind of my monthly pilgrimage. The times I go are usually during the slow times so I never have to wait for a table or my food. I'm given a menu and told to show myself to an empty table anywhere in the restaurant. The waiter/waitress is gruff and doesn't care about you. Just the way I like it. I don't want someone coming to my table every 3 minutes bothering me while I try to enjoy my food. I don't even need the menu because I already know what I want, sliced beef noodle soup (Ho Fun). Is my choice varied? Absolutely not but it's the staple dish for me here. While I can't review much other in here, I consider myself an expert on the #16 noodle soup dish. Squeeze the lemon and add a generous portion of white pepper and you have the best meal for blocks around. Soup is flavorful, noodles slippery, beef is beef (lots of it too!). I especially like the bean sprouts they add. The cherry on top? It's less than $6. I know that as long as I live in NYC and this restaurant is open, I'll be coming here every month.
