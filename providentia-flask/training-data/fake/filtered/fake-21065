Best Middle Eastern food I have had.  They have good quality, tasty food, the wait usually isn't too long, and the prices are reasonable.  The only downside I have is that the portions are a little small for me.  If I were quite hungry I would have to order two orders to actually fill me up.  Still, great restaurant.
