A word Â of warning whoever eats here for some reason the hostess even with a reservation will look you up and down and try to shove you into the bar for eating stand your ground and do not let her talk you into it. The next step she will attempt to shove you into a cheesey seat behind the stewards galley this is were the dirty dishes are stored. next the blond pony-tailed hostess will make a comment on people who " park and bark at a table. After looking this up the translation of this mean sitting your but down on taking a long time to eat. My opinion is this place is way over estimated to be given such praise, please don't waste your money and spread the news on this terrible restaurant.
