Amazing! Great service, wonderful food. Though the place hasn't been open long, I've been several times. The food is excellent, the servers are friendly and very knowledgable considering that they have only been open 3 short weeks. The cocktail list is wonderful and impressive. Comfortable atmosphere, AMAZING food- I can't say enough positive things!
