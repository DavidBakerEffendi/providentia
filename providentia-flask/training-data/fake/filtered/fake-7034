Crazy long wait, but worth it in my opinion! The Mais pizza is unlike anything I've had before...delicious! I would definitely recommend it. The mozzarella antipasti was awesome too, and I'll definitely be heading back for another Icarus Wing cocktail. Fun atmosphere and the owners are really friendly. I'll be back!
