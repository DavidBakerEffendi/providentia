Fans of the infamous street food purveyor on 53rd and 6th will appreciate this place. They still keep out giant bottles of white sauce, barbecue sauce, and hot sauce for people to enjoy on their chicken and rice plates. They also have beverages, snacks, and salads available too which was completely unexpected. The service is fine; nothing amazing nothing terrible. Just know this, the sit down restaurant charges $1.00 more than their cart.
