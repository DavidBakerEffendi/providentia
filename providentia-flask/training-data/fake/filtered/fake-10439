There's no place for zero stars, if there were, "Tattooed Mom" would certainly be listed. From the poor staffing (one Waitress for 14 open tables), to the cold, bland and lackluster food (everything on the menu) to the abysmal "cocktail" menu (if you like your booze watered down) one expects to find less than fine fare on South Street and that's exactly what my friends and I were served, two weeks back. With a bitter, scalding and trivial staff mixed  with a  tinge of "Jim Crow"  thrown in (four Blacks seated in the rear, after 30 minutes of dining the lights miraculously were turned down...happenstance or intentional?)  All you have to do is show your face and find out for yourselves why I'll never recommend or come back to "Tattooed Mom."
