116 Crown has fantastic (but pricy) drinks and food. The mussels and fries are great, as is the simple burger. The drinks are innovative and expertly mixed -- my favorite may be the Forth & Clyde. The decor is fun too -- this is one of the classiest places in New Haven. So why only three stars? 116 is way too LOUD. It is fine on a weeknight, but does the music need to be pounding on a weekend so you cannot bring a group out for dinner and drinks and have a conversation? I asked my waiter about it once, but they didn't do anything. If they would only turn down the music, this would be the best place to hang out in the evening downtown.
