Visiting New York, a colleague INSISTED we check out Butcher Bar... Ab-so-LUTE-ly no regrets -- 5 STARS! Not only was the food worth ranting about, the service was warm, friendly and unforgettable. Very knowledgeable of every item on the menu, Jason helped my husband and I decide on our order. Being that the hubby and I are food connoisseurs (and owners of a successful bake shop in LA), eating across the U.S. and around the world, we were very impressed by our meal. Upon Jason's suggestion, I ordered some of the most savory Burnt Ends I've ever chowed down on up north, smothered in bbq sauce (mmm-mmmm), and the hubby had a classic Pulled Pork Sandwich (which I also snagged a bite of -- LOL). Served with creamy Mac & Cheese and homestyle Mashed Potatoes, each and every morsel was heavenly. We will definitely be back for more when we're back in town. AMEN for great service and down-home southern cooking in the heart of Queens, New York. Totally worth each star... :))
