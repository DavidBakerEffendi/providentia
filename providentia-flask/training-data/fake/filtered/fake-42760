Ok, I wasn't going to do this because I thought she was just having a bad day, but after reading a review here that absolutely parallels my experience I will.  My family and I were visiting my elderly father from out of town and was recommended to dine at Angelina's. Never again, and it was not the food that turned us off, in fact, the food was pretty good.  It was the absolute rudeness and off the wall responses by the owner to some simple questions I had regarding the availability of liquor and the menu.  My family and I eat out quite often and I will certainly say with confidence that I've never been so uncomfortable in a restaurant. Angelina lets you know with very open dialogue that she has no need for patrons, hates her job and is not in the least thinking hospitality is part of the dining experience. The worst dining experience I ever had!! We should have traveled a little farther and avoided the unpleasantness. What a nightmare!
