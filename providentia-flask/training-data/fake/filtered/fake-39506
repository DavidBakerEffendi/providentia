MANNY'S IS OPEN! Went there today, October 16, 2014, and we are thrilled to report they're back in action! Prepared foods--flank steak, salmon, quiche, pot pies, and veggies sides, along with a full compliment of sandwiches. Great coffee and baked goods to boot (including a dangerous looking donut that I avoided with great effort!). Head on over Bed Stuy, and give 'em your love and support.
