I will definitely be coming back to this place. The falafel sandwich was great and and cant get any better. I have tried other places for falafel, but this place outscores the rest. The white sauce was great on the sandwich and it made it even better. I recommend this place for any falafel lovers. My only complaint is the seating. I usually come here with a group of 8-10 people, and we end up taking the food out. Other than that, its a great place!!
