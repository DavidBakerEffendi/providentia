I'm a regular at Union League and for good reason:  fantastic food, professional and friendly service, and an atmosphere that can match my mood:  from casual brasserie to special occasion.  It's got a great vibe and the food never disappoints. I have my favorites, depending on the season:  roasted beet & goat cheese or crab & avocado salad, chicken & morels or lemon sole.  They redefine comfort food.  Duck leg confit is a signature dish--that with a side of frites...perfection.  Don't even get me started on desserts! But I do have to mention their passion for wine and I credit them with building my wine repertoire--easy to do with their well curated & affordable selection.   You can tell they love what they do.  It's my go-to spot whether dining alone, chilling with friends, or celebrating.
