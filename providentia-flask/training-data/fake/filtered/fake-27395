Went there for dinner last night. We have been going there for years and never had a bad experience. We ate in the restaurant . First we ordered wine and two appetizers to start. They came in about 2 minutes. We had not forks and it took us 3 waiters to finally get forks. The sauce for the calamari was terrible. It had no taste. We had no salt and pepper on the table and the only way to get a waiter was to jump him. We had just started to eat out appetizers and the main course came. I felt like the food was just thrown at us. I waited for grated cheese and then they gave us salt and pepper. We ended up taking food home because we felt rushed. They kept coming and trying to clean our table while we were still eating.  We were looking to have a nice relaxing dinner instead we felt rushed.  Also the sauce for out main sauce also was terrible. It tasted watered down. I don't think  we will be going there again any time soon. We have been going there since we were kids but I think it changed a lot and not for the better. We usually leave a generous tip but last night we did not.
