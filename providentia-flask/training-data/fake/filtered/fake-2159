Had dinner here with a group of friends recently.  We had a good time.  The place was hopping.  Drinking out of a fish bowl was different.   However, The small dishes were subpar lack of flavor and depth.  We had to ask each other what we were eating on some of the dishes.  Let's just say I had better dim sum.
