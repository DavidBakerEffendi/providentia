My cousin grew up in Clifton and told me stories about the killer onion rings that are so greasy they soak right through the paper bag.  It turns out she was right, and these were the best onion rings I've had in my life.  Add to that amazing hot dogs w/relish and a cold Pepsi, and it just doesn't get any better.  Don't do the dining room - go straight to the counter and get it to go.
