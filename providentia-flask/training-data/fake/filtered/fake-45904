Not many Greek restaurants around. But this one does it right. Fresh seafood, traditional gyro platters, Greek wine! Â Some of my favorites are the octopus, gigante beans & the eleniki prassini salad. You have to try this place if you are in the monroe area. Only downfall is that it is a little pricy but I guess you get what you pay for
