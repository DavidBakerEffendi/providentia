Confused the place is now PASTA HOUSE, COFFEE HOUSE not so much the great PANCAKE HOUSE. Batter has changed tastes different too,  sticks to the roof of your mouth, constantly burnt and sent back it's not the cook its the cheap batter with the 2 syrups on the plate thats REUSED on the next plate if not OPENED!!!  PASTA SUCKS Host its  basically seat yourself or have a menu handed to you weekdays and weekends. The huge line on the weekends when open tables are ready for customers two idiots are standing at the register chatting, texting or eating. Who is running this place? I'm shocked that other customers aren't observant enough to see the nice water pitcher being filthy, sticky, and not washed for sometime. Place is dirtier than ever before and looks like the new owners are waiting for the place to go out of business to make it into the ITALIAN RESTAURANT that would eventually fail!!!
