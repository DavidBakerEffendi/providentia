I've been craving Japanese curry rice ever since I moved from Hawaii and I have to say that Go! Go! Curry! does it right.  I got a medium chicken katsu 'cause I was starving and I was very satisfied with not only the taste but also the size of the order - sometimes there's too much rice, but this was just right.   But the curry - oh man, the curry.  Definitely the Japanese curry I've been missing.  Very crispy chicken katsu, great Japanese curry and a reasonable price makes for a very satisfying meal.  Definitely coming again and gonna try that Grand Slam!
