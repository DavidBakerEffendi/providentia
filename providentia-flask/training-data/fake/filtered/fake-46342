The food was exceptional. We ordered the pork buns, a squid appetizer, the roasted duck over eggplant and the modern ramen. Â Everything was a great combination of flavor and texture. The soup base for the ramen was very rich and aromatic. I would have liked more toppings in the noodles (you can add extra for an additional charge but we didn't think it would be necessary). A bit noisy (staff would randomly shout out cheers behind your back so make sure you don't have any heart conditions) and most tables are shared (which is actually an authentic and realistic depiction of Japanese ramen shops) so probably not the best place to have serious dinner conversations. The wait was okay--it was rainy and we got there around 7 on Friday--we were told it would be an hour to an hour and 20 minutes but we only sat at the bar for about half an hour before getting seated.
