This place is amazing!! It's tucked away like you're walking into someone's basement but it is a real gem! The owner is sweet and accommodating. You can't beat the paninis for only $5! packed with prosciutto, fresh goat cheese or brie, they are fantastic! my boyfriend and I love this place. The panini bread is homemade, wish I had a lifetime supply.
