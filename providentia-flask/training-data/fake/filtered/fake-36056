I live in the hood here and had a less than great experience here. For one, they hold a credit card when you're ordering food and drink at a table which is odd to me. I'm used to handing over a card when at the bar but at a table with a full food menu, it seems unusual. No problem but when I went to pay the check, the waitress explained that she had my card but that I hadn't reached the $20 limit so I needed cash and then I would get the card back. In addition to the CC minimum being illegal, it's also off putting to have a waitress wait until you pay cash to give you your card back. The beers do look good but I think a bar in this area should allow a customer to charge a few drinks after work. It's better for the FIT students and most of us who live in the neighborhood as well. And of course, that's part of the merchant's agreement with the card issuer.
