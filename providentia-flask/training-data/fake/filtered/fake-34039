Went to dinner Saturday night with friends (party of 4). Although the food was okay, the noise level was awful. It was so loud that we couldn't hear each other talk. The staff, particularly the manager, ignored the few obnoxious, drunk patrons who were literally yelling to converse with their parties. We were unable to complain to the waiter since he virtually ignored us. If you must go, take two ibuprofen before you go and bring ear plugs.
