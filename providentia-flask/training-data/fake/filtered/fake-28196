I'm not sure if it's an actual menu item but I always get a traditional mac with Gouda cheese. It's pretty tight. I'm a vegetarian and the Gouda has a bacon like taste. The negatives are that the prices are nuts and the wait time is too much for the type of restaurant that they appear to be. However I gave it 4 stars because I enjoy the food and I was greeted at the counter by a pleasant staff.
