I was a BIG fan of this Anjappar Chettinad Restaurant as it is close my friends place in Dayton. BUT,   1) the service is SO BAD these days, looks like after the management change it is going BAD to WORSE.  2) I wish the guys who started this location stayed back as these new people don't know how to manage and mainly they cannot recognize returning customers AT ALL. 3) These people behave as if they are doing us a favor. 4) The quality of food also has degraded very badly, sometimes I have tasted chicken gone bad here.  5) If you are ordering for a family with kids, forget about it. I would not advice you to go here as the food really spicy and they cant do much about it. None of your kids will eat food here. 6) Don't waste your time and money, instead go to the location in New York. Good Service. 7) Saturday or Sunday - Don't even think about it :-) . Take my advice, you will be treated like a .......! I really hope these people read this review and make this a better place to visit again.
