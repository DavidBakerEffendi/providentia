I didn't come here for the ambience, I just came to try a Sicilian on a weekday. The pizza is good but not amazing. I'd give the pizza 3 stars for flavor, sauce, and texture. It's a bit sweet and I don't really like sweet in my pizzas! However, they gave me a second slice for free and I love Sicilian slices overall and most importantly, I love free stuff! 5 stars for that!
