excellent experience here. when another montclair restaurant disregarded my reservation for 25 people for my birthday meal, we called Palazzo who graciously took us and seated us shortly after we called them with our request. They catered to everyone at the party and gave excellent service to all. the food was great, music was a special touch and they even played happy birthday and surprised me with my favorite dessert, tiramisu! i would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a delicious italian meal! another great montclair byob! highly recommended!!!
