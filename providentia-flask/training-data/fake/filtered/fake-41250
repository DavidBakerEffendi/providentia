I visited this restaurant for a late night dinner after flying across the country.  Three bites into my meal, I found a cigarette butt in my entree which the waiter verified as such.  I refused a replacement entree.   When I informed the restauranteur that I would be leaving, she tried to charge me and my date for our meals and would not let us leave without paying for at least our drinks. Unless you're interested in an ashy dish and zero concern for the quality of the food or the well-being of the diner, AVOID!
