Henri is always excellent in my experience. A few highlights are the french toast, and the steak au poivre!  The prices are reasonable and the presentation of each dish is done with care and thoughtfulness.   It's a cozy enough space, and the service is fine. I would not suggest going with any group larger than 4. Check it out!
