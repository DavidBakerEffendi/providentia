I really loved this place and am dreaming of the antipasti!  I will definitely return on my next trip to Philly.  I went on a Saturday night, around 7, with the husband and we didn't have to wait for a table.  I didn't find it too loud at all inside.  I don't think it's great for a group larger than 4 due to the size of the space and tables.  Besides the antipasti, we had the grilled shrimp and ribeye steak, both were yummy.  I ended with the chocolate pecan tart- it was tasty too.  The coffee, while a little expensive- was excellent too!  I guess the coffee is high priced since it's a BYOB...Service was wonderful- worth a trip!
