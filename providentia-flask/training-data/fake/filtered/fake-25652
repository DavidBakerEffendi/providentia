Went here with a colleague for a work dinner - the decor was lovely as was the bar while we waited for our table.   we both decided to do the chef's tasting menu with wine pairing and it was all excellent.  the waiter made sure to ask us if we were allergic to anything or had any food aversions (very rare!) - they brought us a different dish at each course and we also received different wines to pair with our foods - which worked out well because i was able to eat my dishes and also try my colleagues. best part of the entire experience was the free chocolate chip cookies they gave us on our way out!  i was too full to eat them then, but they served as an excellent breakfast the next day!
