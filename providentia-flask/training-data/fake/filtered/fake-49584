I had a fabulous experience at Glasserie! I was there with a group of friends for drinks & dinner on a Friday night. The place was really nicely done, and has a great atmosphere. It started getting crowded early but service did not slow down. Food was delicious, and portions ideal to share. Looking forward to try their brunch menu!
