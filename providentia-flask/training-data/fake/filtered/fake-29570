EVER GET THE FEELING YOU'VE BEEN CHEATED? My girlfriend had the box of chicken but I made the mistake of ordering the catfish (it's been a long time since I had a decent fish 'n chips - so sue me). Thoroughly, heartbreakingly disappointing. $28 bought us a small order of chicken with sides and 3 ounces of deep-fried cornmeal with a heavily salted strip of catfish jerky (i don't know what else to call it) and a tablespoon of coleslaw. The biscuit was also dry and flavorless. For this price I would have expected higher quality ingredients and enough fish to cover a piece of toast. The coleslaw and sauce were pretty decent but not enough to make up for the dismal sight staring at me from the cardboard box. At least I'm happy I didn't eat in, since the place was loaded to the (brown and smelly) gills with the worst case of Billyburg hipster-entitlementhon atmo I've seen in a while (including the staff - which would explain why the place is all 'tude and no game). Don't believe the hype and avoid the fish at all cost.
