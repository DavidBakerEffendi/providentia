My brother and I tried this restaurant because a friend recommended it. We tried the ceviche mixto and their chicken. Both were very good but my favorite was the chicken. It was so flavorful and juicy that it was almost ridiculous. Their sangria was also very good, a little more spicy than ones I've tried at other restaurants. The atmosphere is very relaxing and the decor is great. My only complaint is that their chicken is served whole, so if you go in a party of two and the other person does not want chicken you have a ton left over, which can be a problem if your not planning to go home right after your meal. They are also pretty pricey, but it is Manahttan so I was willing to let that slide. Overall I had a good experience and would visit again if I was back in New York.
