Ate here for restaurant week lunch. Overall, it was just okay. I wouldn't really go back again because like what others have said, this is standard American food. I had the beet salad, striped bass, and the panna cotta for dessert. I like pickled beets and the dressing and greens for the salad were well done. The striped bass was cooked quite perfectly, and the sauce was delicious, as was the polenta cake underneath. The panna cotta was standard. However, overall, it was just okay because although they cooked the food well, it just wasn't that different from other local/organic/seasonal meals I've had. It's odd that the server made such a big deal about it when we were seated. Also, the host was scattered-- we had reservations and he said he would "set up the table." The restaurant was less than 25% full and we waited for 15 minutes for a table, while he sat a group that came in AFTER us, immediately. He didn't even acknowledge the gaffe that he made.
