I came here last night and the food was delicious! First, we had the calimari which was very tasty! It was topped with a sweet and tangy sauce, a perfect blend. Â We also had the grilled octopus, excellent flavor and cooked just right! There were many specials to choose from, which all sounded delicious. I decided on a rainbow trout special stuffed with crab. I was not disappointed. The trout with crab was so good and very flavorful! Finally, we ordered a lemon meringue dessert, another special on the menu. It was to die for! It was not too sweet, not too tart and the graham cracker crust was so yummy! Centro is a cool looking space with a lively atmosphere! The service was excellent. Joe, our waiter, took good care of us. We will definitely be back! Verry happy!
