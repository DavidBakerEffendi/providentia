In my opinion this place needs to be closed asap. There is no service. They ruined our valentines' day dinner. We waited there from 8:30 pm to 10:17 pm and they were unable to provide us any food. My 3 year old Â baby was crying for food but no luck. The place was never full always few table were empty but there were taking so much time to assign those to the guests. After 10.15 they brought a fried rice for our daughter. Unfortunately, we ordered noodles for her. We decided to walk out of that place never to return again.
