Great Cachapas and Arepas. The only problem I have with this place is that it is priced for out of towners. A cachapa is 13 which should be more in the range of 8. It does not come with any sides people. $13 is a hipster price. Stop it! I have to find a more hood cachapa place now. Good for your gringos/yuppies that don't mind paying alot. You're getting played!
