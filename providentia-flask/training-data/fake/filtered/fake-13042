Loved, loved, loved the beef caparccio! I would definitely go back to have that. Gnocchi was okay, but nothing special. Service was very slow and I could not get my water filled up. The seating was also quite tight, to leave to go to the bathroom my friend and I actually had to leave via the opening in the front window.
