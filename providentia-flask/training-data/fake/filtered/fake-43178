Comfortable yet lively ambiance. Great to grab drinks or small plates at the bar or for a sit down meal. I'd recommend the lobster scrambled eggs (and red sangria) for brunch or filet mignon with rosemary potatoes for dinner. All the seafood small plates are delicious as well. Will definitely be back - great neighborhood gem!
