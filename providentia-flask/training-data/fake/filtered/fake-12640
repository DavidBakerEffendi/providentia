If you're into chicken, this is the place to go to.  I went with my wife to this place from a friend's recommendation.  I usually don't go out of my way to eat chicken in a restaurant since my wife is actually a mean chicken cook!  Anyway, I went with the chicken burger and was really pleased.  I had it with mac and cheese and it was such a great comfort meal.  It was raining outside the night we went which made the food taste even better. My wife had some chicken thigh dish that was even better than mine. I made her share it with me.  I was really surprised with how moist they got the chicken to taste.  Of course, I had to tell my lady that her chicken was still better although I was really lying.
