I've been to Yuca for dinner many times, and we've never been disappointed with the food.  My only complaint is that it can get really crowded so you can end up waiting a long time at the bar and you'll likely be seated pretty close to (just about right on top of) nearby groups.  The tapas are pretty big so splitting a number of options between your group will definitely leave you filled, or get 2 tapas or a few sides and you'll be fine.  My favorites are the bbq costillitas and platano relleno, and for drinks the yuca kiss or yucajito, but you really can't go wrong!  I've also had the chocolate cake, which was amazing.
