Wow the best pancakes I have eaten so far.  Huge, fluffy, and just delicious.  Althought it was a little tite sqeezing into the chairs and I am a skinny dude I will definitely go back for brunch anytime.  I got there and didn't have to wait for a table, didn't like the table they had and they moved me to another one so I had to give a good tip. I don't know about dinner but brunch and breakfast are definitely on point
