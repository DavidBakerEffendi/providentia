We used to enjoy taking our kids to Sushi Hana for their birthday dinners.  The sushi is really very good. As these reviews note, the service is another thing entirely.  It doesn't matter if there are 3 other tables occupied or 12.  We have brought along books, magazines, playing cards, anything to keep ours family busy during the eternity that it takes to get any of the food. If you ask the waitresses about the status of your meal, you just get a blank stare. There never seems to be any sort of manager or adult in a supervisory role who can correct the situation.  After 3 times in a row of this happening, we decided we couldn't bear it any more. Too bad because the food is actually good and the prices reasonable.
