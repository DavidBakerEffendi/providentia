The food here is good.  The grandma slice is delicous.  The customer service leaves something to be desired. The owners wife is constantly yelling at the employees, i feel like every weekend when i come in there they are mobbed busy and she is yelling.  Besides the fact that she is very nasty!  The rest of the employees look completely miserable, guess i would be too if i had to work for her. They are not friendly whatsoever and dont even try to order for delivery they have no idea how to manage their deliveries, they cant even deliver in a 90 minute time frame...which is completely ridiculous!
