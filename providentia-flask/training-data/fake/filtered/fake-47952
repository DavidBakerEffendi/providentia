Fantastic every time I go! I have brought almost everyone friend and family member here and no one has ever not enjoyed it. I am not sure about some of the negative reviews since I have never had these issues. I had a part of 15 and they split the bill for us, I almost always get there before my friends as I live close by and I have always been given a table before they arrive, even on the patio. The service is always prompt but they will slow down food delivery if you ask. They have even given our parties complimentary bottles of wine on special occassions. They do switch up the menu and have even made us dishes not currently on the menu that we fell in love with on a previous menu. The manager, Laura, is always friendly and gracious even if some other reviewers do not approve of her attire. I cannot say enough great things about the staff or the food. This is one time I would say ignore the reviews and be your own judge!
