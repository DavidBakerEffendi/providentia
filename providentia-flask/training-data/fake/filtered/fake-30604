Had to come and review since I've been there twice already since it opened. Being from Argentina myself as soon as I found out Tango would be coming into Newington I couldn't wait for them to open. Everything from the pizza, empanadas and miga sandwiches are fantastic. The staff is amazing and truly do an amazing job. If you're in the mood for some great food you should definitely stop by.
