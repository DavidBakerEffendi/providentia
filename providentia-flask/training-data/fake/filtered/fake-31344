This is another belated review...I ate here a few times, the last time being around 2006/2007. Read on to find out why. The food was consistently great. Groin-grabbingly good if you will. I have a fond memory of hopping in the photo booth downstairs with my little sister -- she still has that photo strip to this day. All around, good times. BUT, something awful happened. Something that should NEVER ever happen in a restaurant. I saw a MOUSE. IN THE RESTAURANT. It scurried under our table, I screamed and literally leap-frogged my way out of there never to return. If there is a mouse in the dining room good Gd what the hell is in the kitchen??? Almost more disturbing than the rodent sighting was the fact that no one else seemed unnerved by it. Perhaps they have resolved this problem, but I am not brave enough to find out. I would have given this place 4 stars for food, but I need to give it one star for ambiance/cleanliness. EDITED TO ADD: OMFG I scrolled down through the reviews and read something Julia H posted from 2007....please read the below link that shows Bubby's was closed for numerous health code violations and take note of #7 -- perhaps what I saw was not a mouse, but a RAT. I think I just threw up in my mouth. I *know* that it was years ago...but still...NOT okay. newyork.grubstreet.com/2â€¦
