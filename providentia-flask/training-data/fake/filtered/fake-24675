Id call The Wrap Shack fast food with better ingredients. On the plus side, the food comes out hot and fresh. They have great vegetarian options, the vegan volcano is my staple. It is a large wrap filled with veggies and black bean hummus, yum. The reason this joint is only worthy of three stars has to do with their salad preparations. *stick with a wrap and you'll go far* However, the salads use the same cooked ingredients as the wraps, aka not fresh veggies and cooked in heavy butter. I've tried the thai chicken popper, spicy but wet with butter. The owner happens to be nice, he is normally around and seems happy to suggestions.  I once told him to create a wrap "mexican style" with guac and black beans.  His attentive attitude makes me hope for a successful business.  The new liquor license is a positive. Let's see where this shack with wraps goes.
