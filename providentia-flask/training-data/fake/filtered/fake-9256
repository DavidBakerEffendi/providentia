Had dinner there last nite with a friend and ordered the Chicken Francese Dinner over Penne.  I requested the chicken thin over penne if possible.  I got exactly what I ordered.   It was Great!!!!  My friend had the Margarita Individual Pizza and I had a small piece.  Loved that too!!!.    Great Job Pazzo!  I will be back next week.
