This is my Favorite Indian food EVER (i haven't been to India yet, however). i've had at least 6 different entrees and keep calling back (i've only gotten takeout). the staff/owners are super nice and pleasant as well. do not hesitate to support and enjoy this treasure. P.S. they have changed their name to AGRA CLASSIC on their menus.
