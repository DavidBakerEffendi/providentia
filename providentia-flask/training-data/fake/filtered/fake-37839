O.k., we heard the street chatter, and a few reviews - the chef is one of the best around, yadda, yadda ... then met some family members at blu for dinner. My hopes were high, but were daunted. First by the menu, then by the staff. The menu is adventurous, yes, but in these economic times don't most of us just want good food with decent portions (hello!?). You can skip all the BS, this place does not serve comfort food, and the chef obviously thinks we live in Europe. Believe me, we've eaten in the best restaurants in Europe - blu serves the chef's idea of nouvelle cuisine - his own little experiments on huge plates and you're the guinea pig - no thanks. My steak was ordered medium well, was served seared rare, and was sent back twice. Just give us what we ordered, not what you think we should be eating and not cooked the way you think we should eat it. This is America, man, join us at the table, please. Seriously, the quality of the food is very good, but it is overshadowed by the pretentious presentation and the lousy service. The ridiculously large plates make your entree look even smaller - did I say pretentious? Yes, sorry. The servers are like the decor, cold and amateurish. Where did these people come from? Are they being verbally abused by the chef in the kitchen? They are clueless Stepford order takers. This place needs to lighten up, then maybe they can get away with charging good money and being phony baloney. Any place that tries this hard to be trendy is not worth your hard earned money. If you're a trendoid who likes well-executed food you'll enjoy this place, but I can think of many other places to eat that would have made me happier.
