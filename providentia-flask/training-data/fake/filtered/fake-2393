It doesn't get any better than this!  The Prince Perfection and Margherita Pizza was the best.  The tomato sauce was fresh.   During our visit to NY we met the owners son Dominick at Prince Street Pizza.  What a wonderful young man who was passionate about his pizza!  Thank you Dominick what a great dining experience.
