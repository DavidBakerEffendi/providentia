Having lived in NYC, I can say in comparison the food at any eating establishment in Princeton is over priced and under whelming.  Tortuga's is no exception.  I go because quite literally, there are no other options in town.  The food is...ok.  They give nice size portions and I usually have a little left over.  I usually stick w/ the Seafood de Mar.  Hubby usually gets the steak burrito which I personally find boring and dry.  I love their salsa- a small cup comes with every meal.  Any extra salsa- you have to pay (what else?).  I see people mentioning the lack of good service.  I personally dont mind "robot waiters".  I don't mind someone not asking every ten minutes how is everything.  I would rather eat than exchange fake pleasantries with the wait staff. All in all, this is a good place if you are already in town.  Not worth any trip if you are any other place besides Princeton.
