FOOD WAS AMAZING!!!!!! i wonder why people all ways give this place a bad review.... the salsa is unique and not disgusting its a thick salsa which overloads the chips which they hand cut and make. I can tell you i was a kid no to long ago coming here and playing in the kid section while my family ate there food. I remember ordering chicken fingers and friends and playing all night long and never being kicked out due to use being there so late. Now that I'm older i bring my girlfriend here all the time. Its not a romantic place but its defiantly worth going to if you like a place that has music TV and a fun atmosphere. I usually try to go for there spicy BBQ pork burrito topped with Cheddar cheese.. its not so Mexican but i can say its the best thing Ive ever had. The food portions and huge and if your a light eater you have lunch for tomorrow. My girlfriend gets the enchilada with Verde its so flavor full and packs a nice kick to them. I would come back every weekend if i had the time out of five stars i give it a 8!!!!!!!! Go here and you will prove these reviews wrong. Now for the service. The head waitress is so charming and nice there's no way to complain about her, and shes on point Ive never had a problem with my order and i get drinks and more salsa nice a quick. The rest of the staff is great also. Â They love to talk and they can answer any question you have about a dish. They are extremely polite and sometimes funny too. It is BYOB which is not a problem cause you can grab a drink 3 store fronts down. I love this place and will take my friends here as long as there open
