We went to celebrate my friend's birthday at this place. We thought it would be a great place thinking about the view and as it opened not long ago.  We made reservations for a party of 7.  All was great until we were basically kicked out when we still were having our desert and had drinks in our cups.   Food: The appetizers were great but for my entrée  I chose to order the surf and turf and honestly thought my meal was very small in proportion for the price. Mgmt:  I don't know if there are two managers but the guy with the long hair was the one who approached our table stating that he needed our table for other people waiting.  This is really poor rating for a brand new place that opened. I am disappointed that the night planned turned into one of embarrassment and one that the birthday girl did not enjoy.
