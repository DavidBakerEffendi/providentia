A group of 11 of us went to Lao Sze Chuan Saturday evening, and spent a delightful 3 hours there.  The food was excellent, and we enjoyed many of the appetizers they offer, and about 11 of the main dishes, so many the turn table almost didn't hold all them. Some, which we had consumed most of. had to be shifted to smaller plates to accommodate later additions.  Many of the dishes were raved about, but the whole fish seemed to disappear completely pretty quickly. I enjoyed the rabbit and peanut appetizer, but if you try it, be prepared for the bones. The wait staff were friendly and helpful, despite the restaurants being full of customers. I read the other reviews, and from what I  experienced, it appears that legitimate complaints are addressed, even to someone saying there were no fortune cookies.  We got  them last night, and shared and enjoyed them.   All in all, if you want a delightful treat, be sure to visit Lao Sze Chuan.
