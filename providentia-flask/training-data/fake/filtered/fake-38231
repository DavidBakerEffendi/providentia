Went to Rooftop 120 with a group of friends to celebrate. We first entered the establishment and had to walk trough the restaurant in order to go to outside; there were no people inside (customers nor employees). We went outside and were not even greeted at the post. Waited a minute for a host to sit us at the table. The waitress did a great job explaining the menu very well. The major problem was that she took 20 minutes to bring us our drinks. Then she would disappear for another 15 minutes, serve our drinks, disappear again, take our order, dissapear again. It felt like I was at a Las Vegas magic show for all the times she disappeared. It clearly felt like we were being ignored. The "kicker" of the night was that when we were about to pay our bill, the wind actually blows our credit card and falls between the wooded flooring, with no way to get the credit cards out. The waitress explains that "this happens all the time"... Well if this happens all the time, then why dont they put signs stating to be aware of your belongings due to windy conditions. We had no way of paying the bill, so the general manager named STEVE told us to leave our license and phone number with them and pay it back. I didnt find an issue with paying the bill, but I didnt like how he was not showing hospitality for our trouble of having to go out of our way to come back and pay the bill another day. It was a complete hassle. General Manager STEVE blatantly lied to my face saying that he could not compensate a portion of the meal, saying that the machine doesnt allow him to do that. Showing no gesture. STEVE obviously did not care for our business. I dont plan on returning to this establishment. The food and drinks were good. If you do plan on going to eat there, make sure your credit card or cash doesnt get blown away and fall between the wood flooring.
