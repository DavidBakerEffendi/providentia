I could not disagree more "produce is a lil too expensive for me... all veggies can be bought elsewhere cheaper and even farmer's market has better stuff".  For example: The bread alone is priced great/fare and its quality seems like out of a small village near the Italian Riviera. I was SHOCKED when i saw ORGANIC dinosaur kale, I think it was only $2.00!  The gelato (Fico) was perfection.  And the olive oils!! Come on!! In my opinion, great prices, excellent quality, phenomenal everything!! And the wine store!!  I could go on forever.  Hands down 1000% better than Whole Foods, and I think, cheaper. I can't WAIT for the beer garden, when that arrives move over every food stuff in the world; NYC has everything now, with our addition of Eataly.  Congrats Mario and Lidia (and the rest of their crew), thank you!!  A million thanks.
