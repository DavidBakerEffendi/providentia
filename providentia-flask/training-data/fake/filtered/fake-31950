This place is my fav in the city..... I always bring out of towners here. Nice little hole in the wall but the sandwiches are phenomenal. The bread always tastes so fresh. The staff all seem pretty nice too but my only gripe is you never know if they are going to be open as they close so regularly for catered events.
