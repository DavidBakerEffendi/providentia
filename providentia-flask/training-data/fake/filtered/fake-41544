I tell you, I really liked this restaurant.  First of all the decor is really comfortable- not overly ritzy, but  nice and cozy. The food was superb; although not the best food I have ever eaten (that was at the Union Cafe), but really really flavorful and nicely presented. The service was efficient and proper without being overbearing. 1 star off because I had made a reservation, they claimed I hadn't made one, and made us wait for 15 minutes to get a table.
