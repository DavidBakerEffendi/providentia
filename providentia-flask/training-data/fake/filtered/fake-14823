Don't listen to Gerald S.'s review.  He's clearly a wannabe food critic with no actual taste or working tastebuds apparently.  Oh em gee, the waitress removed the sushi menu after you told her you wanted the chinese menu, how horrid of her.  If he really wanted the sushi menu, he should have used his inside voice instead of whining like a teenager online.  The choices for lunch were sushi or chinese/american food- if you really had a pms craving for thai food, then you should have found an all thai restaurant where you could have eaten there, then go write a racist review on yelp.  Welcome to the pagoda, right Gerald S. Enough of that loser. Fusion house- the sushi is very tasty and presented beautifully.  Delivery is fast and the table service is friendly and efficient.  The decor of the restaurant is upscale compared to a lot of restaurants in the area.  I highly recommend the teriyaki tofu and any of the sushi. Take that poser's review with a grain of salt.
