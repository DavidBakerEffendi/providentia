Amazing the difference in a few weeks.........have been here a few times Â during ]the week for the $9.99 dinner specials...................came on 11/24/13 for Sunday dinner..............food was really poor...........paid the full dinner price and both our dinners was bland.....the waiter was great HOWEVER the food was not......Trio special certainly was not..and the Open-face turkey sandwich was so ...BLAH...really a disappointment.....don't think we will be going back too soon............
