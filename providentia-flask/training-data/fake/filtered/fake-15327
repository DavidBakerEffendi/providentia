This is a cool spot that's ALWAYS packed. Everyone knows this place, and for damn good reason. It's definitely a great spot for a snack whenever you're in the area. The frites (and sauces!) are incredible. The staff is very friendly. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because it's SO POPULAR that lines are out the door and seating can be hard to find.
