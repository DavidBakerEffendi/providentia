So unprofessional. These guys are about as amateur as it gets. There's clearly a grading curve for the lack of options in this area but the truth is Brooklyn Belly has a lot to learn about customer service and running an actual business. They were down for weeks and weeks for supposed "construction," though nothing seemed to be going on in their space, all the while they did not leave a simple voicemail giving a date for when they'd be open again. And now that they are apparently back up and running (can't confirm that), they begin their work day hours after when they claim to be open. Can only imagine how long it takes to get actual delivery. As far as food, it's middling fare and over-priced. Talking about a buck per small shrimp or gamey chicken wing. Fried food which is most of what they serve is really greasy. Not to mention that they serve their po' boys on white bread. That's right, white bread. Buncha young guys getting started I understand. But there's a level of common sense and basic professionalism they need to grasp and QUICK if they don't want to crash and burn here like the other joke "restaurants" that preceded them. I'm rooting for them to get their act together.
