Food is solid. Those mushroom spring rolls are awesome. Pad thai can be amazing, though it's been just ok 2 of the 5 times I've had it. The huge appetizer dish with grilled meats and seafood is ridiculously good. I also love how green this place is. Packaging for to-go stuff is all recycled and the "plastic" forks are actually made of plant matter. Because so many places don't care about this stuff, I find myself going back there more often. 3 stars for food, 1 for caring about the environment.
