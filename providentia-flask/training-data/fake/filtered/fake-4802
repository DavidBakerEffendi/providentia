Wish they treated their customers with more respect. We came here on Sunday at 4:00pm. The place was packed. We were a party of 6 and the wait was over an hour. We get seated and 5 out of 6 of us were there. Our other friend was driving from Atlantic City and kept getting lost. The host Tyler was very rude when he sat us down. He said they have a policy of not seating everyone until the whole party is there. He was rolling his eyes at us like we were some annoying teenagers, and we were 40 year old professional women. And one of us owns 2 restaurants.  After buying a round of drinks at the bar area, waiting for over an hour, and planning to order for our friend who hadn't arrived yet,  there was no need to be so rude. The manager came by to explain the policy again. But he also had an attitude. We understood that they had a strict policy. But there was no reason to talk down to us. Be nice and treat your customers with some respect. But we did have a fantastic waitress. She was very attentive and provided fantastic service.
