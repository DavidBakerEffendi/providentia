I have been a fan of the food here for years. it is consistently good.  The service, however, accounts for the two stars. The hostesses are blasé, unwelcoming and seem to not know that they are there to welcome patrons. Waitstaff appears overwhelmed and over worked. only the busboys seem to realize that they are part of a service business. The manager(?) and those  in charge are officious, curt and often rude. If you are there only for the food, you should not be disappointed. If you believe that dining is about ambiance and  service along with thevquality of the food, you might want to pick up your food and eat it around more pleasant people.
