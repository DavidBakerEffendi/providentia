Perhaps Eataly was trying to recreate a true market -- crowded -- Italian atmosphere, but I am quite certain Italians don't go grocery shopping with SUV-sized strollers.  It felt like Disneyland in a crowded, over-scenic sense, that perhaps I should post in front of the pizza oven and smile.  Perhaps the food is actually good, but even as a New Yorker who frequent Century 21, the slow moving crowds here are just too much.
