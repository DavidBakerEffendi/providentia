Went to NYC for GF birthday,(sidenote, GREAT idea guys!!) She is celiac, wanted to try this place, good idea! Got there just at noon, opening time, on Sunday, got seated immediately, of course, good. It is a little cramped, but we were early, so not a problem, but I can definitely see it being a problem. *** BREADSTICKS ARE THE GREATEST THINGS YOU WILL EVER EAT** I am not celiac, eat anything, but those breadsticks....wow. I got a meatball appetizer, GFree, very nice, my girl liked it too. She got the shrimp pizza, LOVED it, i got a panini, it was good. We got a lemon cheese cake for dessert, it was very good. Cons: Seriously?? $ 4.50 for a cup of coffee??? I didnt happen to look at menu when I ordered one, then got another at end of meal. BIll came out, i was like what is 2 Americano for $9.00..... oh my god, THIS coffee is that much!?!??, and not even a little refill for it. Not worth it. It is pretty standard coffee, just saying. The whole meal was pretty damn expensive, $ 62.00 for lunch ?!?!? Seriously? made her happy, so worth it, but come on, $ 18.00 for a personal sized little pizza? $8-9 for a slice of cheesecake, not cool.
