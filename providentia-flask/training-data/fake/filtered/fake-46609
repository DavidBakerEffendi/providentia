Oh Wow!! This is my fifth time at this neighborhood gem, even though, I'm not in the neighborhood - those lucky New Havener!! This restaurant is consistent I've had another "Worth It" meal! We started with the Ensalada del Mar which was so fresh and with 4 jumbo shrimp - not an oxymoron. Also the ensalads rusa - another excellent dish -what a mixture -beets, carrots, etc... Next came the Patelon - WOW sweet plantains with beef. ( Not like my Mom made, but better!!) We had Croquetas de bacalao - the dill mayo just added to the cod croquettes. My husband loves the empanadas! What a choice of wines the hostess made was fabulous! The wine was only $24. Next was the Garbanzoz Criollos - the chickpeas Lastly, the Pintxos Mar y Tierra - skewers of beef, chicken and shrimp! I just want to say our meal was fabulous and we'll be back again SOON. Service is friendly and super attentive!! BTW - breakfast is great too on weekends
