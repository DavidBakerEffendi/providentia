Unfortunately - this was not all it was trumped up to be. Â  My order consisted of the WILDLY popular artichoke, the sicilian and the meatballs. The delivery time was good, but the temperature of the pizza was mildly warm at best. The dough was bland and flavorless- not enough cheese to satisfy the calling it Pizza. Why is there such a fan base for something that is not in any way extra ordinary.
