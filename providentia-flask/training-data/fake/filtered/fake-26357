Was called a b**** by the "manager" on the phone for complaining that a 10 minute deliver took 50 minutes. We had ordered a cheeseburger & a side of onion rings, that when delivered amounted to $14. It was cold and upon calling to complain I was rudely told off by the "manager." If I could give this restaurant (if you can call it that) less than a star, I would. Horrible customer service. I wish I could talk to the real manager or owner about this. Please beware of this place.
