One of the best restaurants in the area, I always try their specials which change daily and are made fresh, The chicken pot pie is to die for and they always have prime rib on the weekends. Their prices are great and the place is very cozy. The staff is friendly and attentive and remembers you the next time you go. The owners have done a great job with the renovations, it is immaculate!
