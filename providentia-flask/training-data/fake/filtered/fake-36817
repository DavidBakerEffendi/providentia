Nothing special. My arugula salad with goat cheese was nice, not particularly inventive. My mussels were sorrowful. The broth had some kind of stock added to it and a thickener, so it highly diminished the stock and essence of the mussels. Not a pleasant combination. Fix that recipe. My cooked spinach came out in a bowl of oil. Yes, oil. Ugh.  The bread was old and cold and the butter was not butter. Some kind of spread. Yuck. At least let me enjoy some bread & butter.  As for our entire meal..Not as good as they think.
