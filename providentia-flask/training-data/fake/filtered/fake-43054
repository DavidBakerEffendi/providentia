My husband and I ordered from the dinner menu, but we were asked to sit in the bar half because, as the waitress told us, "We are understaffed tonight".  My husbands pasta was completely over-cooked.  And my salmon was two days past fresh.  Not off exactly, but certainly not worth the twenty plus dollars charged. Typical of many a college town, the menu seemed over-reaching. A soup and burger type of place promising haute-cuisine out of a microwave and  short order grill.  We should have maybe tried the burgers and and a cold bottle of beer.  But then again, where's the adventure in that? Not a home run, but called out at first..  .
