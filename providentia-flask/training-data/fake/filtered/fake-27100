So, we heard good things about this place and since it's close to our place, we decided to give it a try.  When I first saw the name, I realized that it wasn't authentic Japanese place but more so Korean owned.  Boy was I right.  First thing I noticed was the gentlemen who were making the sushi were Koreans.  When we started looking at the menu, I saw Korean food.  So I ordered Galbi-Jim (Stew) and my husband ordered the Sushi Deluxe (I'm Korean and my husband is Japanese).  When the sushi came out, it wasn't fresh at all.  The white fish was thawed out and very chewy.  Since it was 23.50, we ate it anyway...but the Cali roll we didn't finish.  My Galbi-Jim came out.  Three pieces of galbi, one mushroom and two pieces of Korean radish for 19.95.  First, the food was horrible that I couldn't eat much of it before it started to hurt my stomach.  The lady put so much black pepper in it, it was really disgusting.  My husband wanted something else since he was down about the sushi so he ordered the don-ka-zue.  OMG, how can anyone destroy that?  He said the batter wasn't even flavored and the meat was very tough and chewy because she didn't beat the meat down before cooking.  So the only person that was happy was our 4-year who had Udong.  We will never go there again.  Horrible and expensive.  BUT I have to say, when it comes to Korean food, I am very critical and so is my husband when it comes to Sushi.  i did love their bathroom!
