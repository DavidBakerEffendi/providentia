I've came to eat at this restaurant several times but I've finally decided to comment about it on yelp. First of all the exterior design is beautiful and properly represents what's expected to come inside. The interior is properly Greek themed with a very artistically mural representing its culture. Now let's get to the food!, the taste in freshness and quality of the dishes served in this restaurant is outstanding, ranges from seafood into meats. Everything is cooked naturally with premium condiments and oils. The essence of Mediterranean quality food is greatly portrayed on these platters. I'm a carnivore so I always order the big steak! My wife normally gets the seafood plates which to her are A++ I've travelled a lot in my life and spent years living in Europe and I must say this place made me feel like if I was in Greece, and this is the intention that quality restaurants intend to deliver, making you feel as if you were in that country without the need of traveling. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone with the intention of enjoying quality food and supporting local businesses. As per my analysis of this restaurant I would definitely give it a Michelin.
