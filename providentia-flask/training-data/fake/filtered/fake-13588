Will never go back, such a rip off. Ok, the food is fine, but the service is the biggest turn off.  My wife and I just went for a Saturday night dinner. She ordered the house white.  I asked if they had a house red, like a chianti. (which is usually the house red anyway, as anyone who knows Italian food knows.) Our food took forever, and the couple sitting next to us ordered the same exact thing after us, but yet they they were served before us.  Our server was very attentive, offering us more wine (often before our glassed were done), but never apologizing for our food being late.  Once we stopped ordering wine, and ordered coffee he never paid attention to us, and our espressos never even came. The bill comes and my wife's wine costs $4 per glass for the house white.  Since I said chianti, mine are $12 a glass.  (Not the $4 house red price)  Ok, so fine so I said chianti along with house, and he chose to pick the more expensive glass.  The whole thing was so manipulative (he knew he had us) , and planned that we will never go back. Watch out for this scam.
