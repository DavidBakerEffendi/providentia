yum, Yum, YUM!  Where have I been? This place is great and no one seems to know about it.  I have been there like 3x every week for the last month. What I love:  ham & cheese brioche, apple cheddar biscuit, Honey Mama Chicken sandwich, Sticky Bun, and the Ginger Sugar cookie.  This place is in the back of Firebox parking lot but well worth the effort.
