Where to begin, Â  We walked over here on a Sunday afternoon after the storm. We were getting cabin fever over the local fare in our crown heights neighborhood and thought this would be worth a shot. We sat at the bar ordered the prix-fix brunch comes with brunch cocktail and coffee or tea. My steak and eggs, was pretty amazing , steak was cooked perf medium the black bean sauce really added to the flavor it came with two eggs (mine were cooked over medium) they were eggs and not much to say about eggs hard to mess up. Also with came with fries for 14$ I can't complain price was great bartender was so welcoming and friendly to our questions about the " hood" . Also ordered the veggie omelet. ,my gf really appreciated that they use real egg whites not egg beaters. Also veggies weren't typical veggie omelet they had asparagus,tomatoes,onions,and mushrooms. It came with home fries they were also really good.the bloody Mary's that came with both our brunches were really good, spicy nice poor on vodka and not too much Bloody Mary mix. Overall we can't wait to come again ! great food great service and most important great price ! We can't wait to come for their happy hour ! Nice addition to the neighborhood
