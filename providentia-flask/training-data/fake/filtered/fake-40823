Loved this pizza! The sauce is soooo good! My husband and I split the small with 6 slices. Delicious. We were staying on Times Square, but heard this was the "birthplace of pizza", so we took the subway to the closest street and walked here. We went on a Friday night at about 7 pm and did not have to wait.
