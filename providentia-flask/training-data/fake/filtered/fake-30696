The menu is descriptive , however when the food comes, jeez it's nothing like what was described. Why do chefs cut the scallops in half? Are they that expensive? If so take them off the menu.. It makes you look cheap when you do that.. The hand made crab cakes make with real lump crab meat, was nothing more than a lot of bread .. Not good.. The calamari with the balsamic was ok.. But if you want really good calamari with balsamic reduction go to 202 bistro.. This place should serve hamburgers and hot dogs..How can you mess that up.. Drinks were watered.. This place could be a gold mine if it had the right chef. Too bad
