CHICKEN AND RICE??? WHA? CHICKEN AND RICE?! When I heard about this place I was like, what is all the hype about. It's just chicken and rice, is it really that good? YES IT IS. The value is there too. for $6 and the amount of GOOD food they give you. This place cannot be beat. They cook it in front of you (it's already kind of cooked already though) and serve it to you piping hot and the service is quick.
