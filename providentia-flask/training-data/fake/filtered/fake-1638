Let me first start this review by saying that the only reason I made a yelp account is to review this restaurant.   I walked into Pho 68 prepared for disappointment, but what happened next can only be described as an Oprah "Aha!" moment.  I'm not the type of person to cry over a bowl of soup, but I damn near did.  The pho I just had was not merely soup, but an experience.  Without shame, I ate a whole bowl of chicken pho.   What part of the pho practically moved me to tears?  The broth.  The broth was sublime.  Having lived around Southeast Asia, I know what good broth is supposed  to taste like.  Unless you are in certain parts of the country, that quality is very hard to come by in the States.  To my utter surprise, I found it in West Hartford.  The owner told me they made the broth that morning, and you could smell and taste the freshness.   The chicken that was in my pho had been properly cooked.  It had been slowly simmered and was tender and flavorful, a true compliment to the broth.  The noodles were noodles, it's hard to go wrong with those.  The mung beans, herbs, chili and lime were fresh.   Here's an important detail, stay away from that crappy Sriracha that's on the table.  Go for the chili sauce that is kept in the fridge.  That's the good stuff, add a little vinegar and the pho will be ready to eat.   I cannot recommend Pho 68 enough.  I feel like no review could do that delicious bowl of pho justice, you just have to come here and try it for yourself. The only reason I'm not giving Pho 68 a fifth star is because I am only living in the area for a few months, and I will have to soon return to a cold, soulless world full of crappy pho.
