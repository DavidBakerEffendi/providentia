i go here every time i go downtown,i try to avoid lunch hour since that time is immensely crowded and cant sit anywhere,but i like variety of food and other things that make it what it is ,there is actually just one place in the entire market that i dont like that is a bar type atmosphere,my out of town friend wanted to go there ,we sat down and they told us we had to order a drink a piece,i dont drink and they told me i had to leave,so after she created a scene we left,but other than that i do like the market.
