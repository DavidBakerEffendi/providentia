We crossed the beautiful, open, inviting, and more than half-empty front room merely to be dumped by the hostess in the 'back of the bus' section looking at the WCs and a blocked view of the kitchen. Demerit one. Our waiter was nice but cool and less than forthcoming when asked about certain dishes on the menu. Demerit two. The Duck Tacito (sp?) was excellent, the Meyer Lemon Fritto - OK. The potato/onion/bacon soup was an experience--the potatoes and onions were undercooked and there was no bacon to be found in a broth that tasted as though a bottle of liquid smoke had fallen in and taken up full-time residence. Demerit three. The rabbit was tasty and juicy and sat upon a bed of creamy polenta but there were no oyster mushrooms and pumpkin seed pesto as the menu had proudly proclaimed. Big demerit four. Dessert was a small bowl of sliced strawberries, a smaller (tiny) decanter of what was supposed to be cream (skim milk, more like), and two small slices of (Sara Lee?) pound cake sprinkled with confection sugar. Abysmal--demerit five. But what do I know?
