Very, very crowded.  We literally could not move our chairs without hitting other guests.  The service was ok, but servers were clearly more attentive to larger parties.  Servers didn't bring us some of the items we ordered (though we weren't charged).  Could be that service is falling due to the busy-ness.  Victims of their own success.  The food was also just OK, not the best Italian I've had.
