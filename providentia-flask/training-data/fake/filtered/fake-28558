Food is decent, but not wonderful or anything. On the other hand, customer service is hell; these people barely speak English and have no respect to their customers. Literally all of the servers are unkind. They are lazy and inattentive; they never give you proper wait time if there is a wait, and they don't really care about the hygiene of the store. Delivery takes forever (like an hour or more) and the delivery woman is annoying. Â It's the only place you can get Indian food in Hanover, but unless you know you want Indian food for sure, do NOT go here.
