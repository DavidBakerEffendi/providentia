Its not rare for good wine bars to start out sloppy, get better, then take a turn for the worse. I've lived on Charles st for almost three years now and was delighted when i heard Morandi chef jody williams opened up a trendy wine bar on Greenwich. It took me a few months to get in the door, but when I finally did, I found a kieth mcnally -esque spot, marble bar, new vintage looking cake ceiling. I grew to love the place, Â because it was the only local where I could grab breakfast quickly at 9am on a mon. morning. I went in for brunch last weekend, and my, how they'd changed. My server (who wasn't the usual sweet morning guy) was short with us, and promised a table in 10-15 min. THE 3 of us agreed to wait, thinking it would be 20 min max. We're all in the industry, we don't mind waiting. But a half hour later when my friend approached her to ask if our table was ready she abruptly half shouted "it's a bar, not a restaurant." Are you kidding me? Don't take yourself so seriously Gottino, you're stinking up the neighborhood. Who knew the village was turning into Gramercy?
