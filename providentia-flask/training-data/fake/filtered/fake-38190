Greek lady is definitely my favorite place to go eat on campus. The food is good, cheap, relatively healthy, and there are never any problems with the orders. I especially like the omelettes and french toast for brunch, and the lamb gyro for dinner. I really enjoy the laid-back atmosphere in the restaurant as the service is always very solid and friendly. and the a One guy in particular, George (always wearing a Flyers hat) is particularly nice and is always down to chat about anything, mostly sports. I would recommend anyone to come enjoy a meal here, talk to the staff, and enjoy the food.
