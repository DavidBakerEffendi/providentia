Stopped in for lunch after seeing it on Diners Driveins and Dives. Sat at counter because there are few tables. Waitress was nice but was continually distracted. I got the pork belly sandwich which was fantastic. But here's the rub -- it was served on a plank. A NARROW plank. Huh? That's my only real complaint. Buy some plates ... or bigger planks.
