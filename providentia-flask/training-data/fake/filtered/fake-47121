Had the lamburger which was really done as nicely as you can expect for a burger. It was juicy and flavorful. The fried olives as an appetizer was actually really good and would pair well with a nice refreshing coctail. The service was good, with waitstaff being Â curtious and quick with your food. The atmosphere was nice of a little cramped. The bathroom however was super dimly lit and cramped. I wouldn't go out of my way to seek it out again but wouldn't hesitate if in the neighborhood.
