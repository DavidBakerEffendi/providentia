The only reason this did not get a 5 out of 5 is because the bartender was terrible. The waiter and food on the other hand were out of this world. We had a 20 minute wait for a table, and we were lucky enough to steal 2 seats at the bar for the wait. We proceeded to watch the bartender make drinks for the employees/other tables until our table was called. It was literally 17-20 minutes that we were not approached. Once that was out of the way - everything else was great. Server was knowledgable, food was phenomenal. Tables are not the roomiest, but it is a cozy environment. It will definitely be a spot I will go to again.
