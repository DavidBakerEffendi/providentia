Reading Terminal Market is great for picking up meats to cook at home.  They have a great selection at the butcher station (near the grocery) - I've tried the chicken breasts, the baby back ribs, pig's feet, and pork ribs here.  All have been very fresh and came out very tender when cooked.  The prices are good for center city, but nothing special when compared to some supermarkets in the suburbs.  However, for a one stop meat shop in center city, this does the job just fine. There are also some great spots to eat within RTM - DiNic's stands out for their pork sandwiches.  I also had some great cherry soda from the tap at one stall run by Pennsylvania Dutch, and have been looking forward to trying out their tap root beer and cream soda, though the stall has been closed each time I've gone back.  Hopefully next time!
