I've been to Mr. Adams a few times... Service is REALLY BAD. If you want a cocktail, you better know the ingredients because the girls certainly don't!!! Ohhh... Be ready to wait 20 minutes for drinks and good luck getting the correct food order! Music is way too loud and annoying people play foosball table during lunch time! This place its a perfect mess!! I'm done trying!!!
