What can i say 'Dirty Chinese' cuisine but in the best sense possible.  Hand made noodles & dumplings made to order with flavor and texture you won't find in 4 star restaurants, it just ascertains the fact that the Chinese invented pasta. Mamma mia! One of the cheapest deals in town complete with typos on the menu and a brusque attitude that reminds you and makes you glad you're in nyc. A meal for 2 can run anywhere  from $12-$15 whoa! The man making your noodles or dumplings(right in front of you) from scratch turns the experience into music, poetry and performance, the woman serving you barely expects a tip, even their hot sauce is not generic tasting. No frills, no bells and whistles just to the point great texture and flavor.
