Excellent biryani and masala dosa.  I would comment on another dish too, but these were so good we haven't gotten past them yet despite having visited 4 or 5 times.  Service is friendly and warm, and the owner is careful to have food prepared as you like.  They are quite new and, embedded as they are in the middle of Indian-food heaven, probably not as well visited as other more well established (many not as good) restaurants.  Atmosphere is plain but the food is not!
