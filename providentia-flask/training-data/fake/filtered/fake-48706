I love this place.  We eat there about once a month, sometimes more.  It's affordable, especially for Manhattan, and the food is always fresh and great.  The variety of empanadas are awesome.  My favorites are Viagra (not what you think, people, it's seafood) and spicy chicken.  The soups are fab -- especially the chicken soup.  It gets crowded and cramped, but worth it -- the Sangria and Fruit Shakes rock too.
