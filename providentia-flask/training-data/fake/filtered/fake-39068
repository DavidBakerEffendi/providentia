The worst of the worst!!! I have been to many Italian restaurants around the city but this one is just the worst. My waiter arrived to the table and he looked like he was drunk! He was highly pretending Italian accent what was so funny until I got what I didn't order (I ordered Filet minion and got veal chop). He told Â told me that the kitchen is busy and to correct the mistake is going to take 45 minutes!!! I never got my wine and desert. When I was living I complained to the hostes but she told me: you should speak to the manager, I'm not in charge of that!
