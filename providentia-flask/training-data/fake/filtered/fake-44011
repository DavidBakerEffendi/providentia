Went for lunch.  The food was edible.  Nothing spectacular but not bad, but a bit pricey.  The service was somewhat slow.  The young lady who waited on me never came by to ask how everything was, or if I cared for a refill of my drink, or if dessert was wanted.  Before receiving the bill, I had to use the restroom.  When I came back to the table, the waitress said to me "You had me thrown off."  Puzzled, I replied "How so?"  She said "I thought you left without paying."  This is not the kind of treatment a new customer wants to receive.  She didn't say it in a mean way, and I could understand the misunderstanding on her part, but that's not something you say to a first (and as a result last) time customer.  The waitresses there seemed friendly enough with those who were "regulars".  I guess I was too irregular, so I will not be going back again.
