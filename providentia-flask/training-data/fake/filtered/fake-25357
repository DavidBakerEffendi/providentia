Lamb burger or special lamb kebabs are consistently overcooked and badly burned. I had to send it back the first time and I went back and tried again and had the same result. Â The crust was mostly black. The waitress did not take it well. The shrimp with chorizo was more chorizo with 3 small pieces of shrimp. The special cous cous and mezes are good
