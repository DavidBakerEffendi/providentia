My family drove from northern Jersey to have dinner here for my birthday. It was so crowded. Was told 20 minute wait... Waited an hr. Food was ok. Too expensive for a pastrami sandwich. Bathrooms did not have changing station for babies.. not good if children are allowed. No toilet paper in stalls and no hand soap.  Diner gave me a  complimently cupcake which was stale. First and last time here.
