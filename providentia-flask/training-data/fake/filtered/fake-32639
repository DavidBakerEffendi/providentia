This place was absolutely horrible! They have more bouncers and security there than any place I have ever been to. The bouncer was rude, (I am 23 years old) clearly old enough to go to a bar and he came over after 30 minutes of being there to double I.D a group of everyone between ages 23- 27. He did not do this to any body else. The bar is incredibly trashy from the walls and floor to everybody in side of it.  The employees there extremely rude and obviously had nothing better to do than degrade us by making us all re show our I.Ds. I think that the managers should seriously consider who they are hiring because this business does not deliver customer satisfaction at all, if any thing they hired people to make your experience here a very very poor one. If there was a problem with someones I.D maybe the man working at the door should get his eyes checked because not even bars in NYC have people come looking for you after you waited in line forever to get a drink to re check your i.d its absolutely un called for . Clearly they dont care who they are letting in there because the bar seems to be FULL with underage slutty girls. All I have left to say is DO NOT GO HERE unless you feel like wasting your money and your time  with more than rude employees who were obviously not trained and have no life or manners and worse than white trash tweens.
