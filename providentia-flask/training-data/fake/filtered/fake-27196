I am usually in a rush to get to work everyday so I don't have time to cook, eat and clean without putting myself behind schedule.  With that said, starting the day without something to eat puts me in a foul mood.  I took a chance and swung by Schlesinger's and gave it a shot.  Their home fries are to die for.  I've never had any satisfying home fries in Center City since I moved from NH and I am a step away from having home cooked food withdrawal symptoms.  I haven't tried anything else from Schlesinger's menu so I can't vouch for their meals but if you want some home fries to knock your socks off, this is the place to get it.
