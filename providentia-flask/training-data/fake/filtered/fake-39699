We were out of towners setting up a rehearsal dinner for our son's wedding on Memorial Day weekend.  I can't begin to say how much the staff and Manager Stephanie help us with the event.  They were more than VERY helpful and professional in helping us arrange an execute the dinner.  We had a private room downstairs and the wait and bar staff were excellent!  From appetizers through desert, the food was fantastic.  For the top line quality of the food and service, the price for our 30+ party was very reasonable.   In the main dining area the tables were full (always a good sign) and everyone seemed to be happy and having a good time!  As we made our way around to the private room, the aroma from the different meals was unbelievable! I can't begin to say enough about the whole experience.  Stephanie and the staff helped set the tone for what was a very special weekend!   I would definitely be heading here again when back in town!!!
