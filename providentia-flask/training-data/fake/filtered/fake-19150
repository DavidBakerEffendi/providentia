We went to Koto's a couple of years ago and have not been back since.  This might not mean anything to anybody else but it did to me.  They serve a drink there called the Pearl Harbor and is meant to look like Pearl Harbor with ships sinking.  Sorry, but I found that to be offensive, discourteous and inappropriate and do not want to deal with them.
