This diner is one of my favorites! You never get a bad meal here. Sometimes on Saturdays you might have to wait for a table, but the line moves fast. Service is great...had a mozzarella and tomatoe sandwich with black olive tampenede and a cup of soup. Didn't have room for dessert, too bad, love their cakes and pies.
