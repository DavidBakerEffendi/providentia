As soon as I walked into Great Wall of China I knew something was off. The place was empty, none of the staff offered to help us, and 2 women were peeling a comically large pile of green beans on one of the dining tables and shouting at each other in Chinese. It is set up like a buffet but they serve you as you walk down the line of food where we were rushed into choosing things that we weren't even sure of what they were. The table we sat at was about a foot thick and impossible to cross your legs under. It was also awkwardly long so I was strangely far away from the person sitting across from me. Then there was the food. It was the worst Chinese food I ever had. We ordered 3 different things in which were all put into one container. They all mixed together. One item that we hastily selected was drenched in an odd brown watery goo which coated everything in the tray. That particular item was spongy and bland. We later found out that it was cow stomach. I also ordered hot and sour soup. I think someone urinated in the hot and sour soup. Overall my taste buds felt violated and my mouth raped. Great Wall of China raped me in the mouth.
