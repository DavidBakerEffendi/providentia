Anyone that gave this place a poor review should just go back to McDonalds. For everyone else that wants a perfect date or dinner; pick Rats. The Kabul lounge is a great place to bring a date for a relaxed, comfortable time without that awkward pretentious feeling. Â Grab a drink, head outside for the sculptures and sauna houses. Its crazy out there Enjoy it
