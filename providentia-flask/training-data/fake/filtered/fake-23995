I'm conflicted about this place.  I really love the TASTE of the two pasta dishes I've had there, but I have NEVER seen smaller portions.  $15 gets you what isn't even a cup of pasta.  It's ridiculous.  Pasta is cheap.  What are they thinking?  The spot is lovely and I've heard the pizza is good, but I'm a pasta person.
