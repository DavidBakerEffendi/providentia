We had a reservation and our table was ready immediately. The food was fabulous, and the drink list was impressive. What impressed me the most, though, was how the restaurant handled a situation we experienced while dining. The people seated next to us did something unsavory and really impolite, and the hostess or waiter must have noticed my face, because they immediately came over and offered us a second round of drinks on the house. Really nice way to make the situation right, even if it wasn't Â their fault. Upon leaving, we were greeted by the manager who further apologized. Will be returning!
