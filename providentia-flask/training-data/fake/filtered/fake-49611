I go to 116 for the total experience.  I love the fact that it is a rehab of a venerable New Haven hotel and that it is comfortable yet modern and hip.   I love the creativity and quality that goes into the cocktails and the availability of cocktail flights.  I love the fact that I can stop in after work and get a wonderful glass of wine and a great slider.  I love how easy it is to share food.  I love the intensity of the flavors and the quality of the offerings.  I love the combination of great food and low-key attentive service.  And now - I love the new outdoor seating.   tg  - New Haven
