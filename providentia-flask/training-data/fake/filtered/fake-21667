I have been hearing about this place for a little while now and finally got the chance to go. I was not disappointed. I met friends for drinks on Friday evening and we ended up getting a table and staying for dinner. They wouldn't seat us until everyone had arrived (rightfully so) so I got a chance to sit at the bar and order a local beer. I got the Empire Cream Ale and the bartender asked if I wanted to try it first... I didn't because I knew that was the one for me, but I appreciated the offer. Cut to being seated for dinner.... we sat at communal tables. I know that is not for everyone but I happen to love it, and it fits with the vibe of the restaurant. I'm a bloody mary person and I'm not sure when I'll make it back for brunch so I ordered the B.L.T. Bloody Mary. It was fantastic and could serve as an appetizer in itself. It comes with bacon and a pickled egg. As a table we ordered the fried pickles, which are not to be missed. Amazing! For dinner, I had the pork belly beer mussels and fries. It was delicious, and I have no critiques for the dish. I also tried some of my friends cheese grits and they were rich, buttery, and altogether perfect. The service was great as well and even though it was a busy Friday night, we weren't rushed out when we finished eating and drinking. If I had to say one bad thing about 'Jacob's Pickles' it would be.... because we were there for the transition from evening to nighttime, when the lights were dimmed down, it was way too dark. We had to use our cell phones to read the menus..(we were seated in the back dining area. Being sat out front might not have that problem.) Next time I go back, and THERE WILL be a next time, I will try the different selections of pickles, cutely presented on a narrow board in mason jars.
