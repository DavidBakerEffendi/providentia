My husband and I went last weekend. The food is okay and service was good. I had the fried red snapper, it was tasty but needed some kind of sauce....mojo or something. The black beans were a little bland. I gave them five stars because I've eaten there before and it was great. The prices are excellent. We had 3 entrees and two appetizers and only paid $74...w/o tip. The appetizers are just the right portion, original recipes and priced right. We will be going again soon.
