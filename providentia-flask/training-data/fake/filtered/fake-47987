just returned from a pretty disappointing experience at Our House. Seemed like a no brainer place to take the kids with all the mac n' cheese options. Our waitress was great, reception friendly and everything went down hill from there. Took far too long to have order taken and soon noticed that no one else that had earlier arrived had any food yet. The wait for food delivery was interminable. The food was interesting, nicely presented but most was cold including our kids mac n' cheese and what would have been a great squash soup had it been warm. I too felt like the lighting was poor and the space felt dingy and far from "Homey". Kind of done with places with overly priced food, little effort and beer for $6 a bottle. This place flat out needs some management and attention to customer service. A shame as all the pieces are in place for a great dinner out. execution is poor...
