I've been to this restaurant three times in the last two weeks, so I feel like I can give a comprehensive review. The place is cozy and has dim lighting, so it's nice either for a date or with a group. The service is consistently nice and the selection of wine and beer is great. I would absolutely recommend this place whether you are looking for a casual dinner out or a nice brunch option. I would definitely recommend this as a brunch location. For 16$ you get a brunch dish and a brunch drink of your choice (plentiful options, which was fun!) plus a coffee/tea. We had the peanut butter chocolate pancakes and the frittata, which were both awesome. At dinner you get a generous (if not super tasty) bread basket. Their burgers are huge and delicious, but they don't come with fries. I am absolutely in love with the steak salad, which comes with delicious roasted red peppers and a generous serving of steak.
