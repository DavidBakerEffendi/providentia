I thought I died and went to Italy all over again.  This tiny gem of an eatery will keep you coming back for more!!  My wife & I had dinner here Tuesday night, simply amazing.  Everything was so fresh and the pizza was like I was back in Italy.  I travel all over the world for my business and this is the best pizza in Jersey!  The place is small, but it's so worth the wait.  I believe the master pizza maker was the owner.  Very warm & friendly, he treated my wife & I like we were part of his family.  I wish him all the success and if he keeps doing what he does he all ready has 2 customers for life.
