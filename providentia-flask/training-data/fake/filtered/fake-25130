I would give Amis 2 and 1/2 stars because of atmosphere.  The restaurant itself is really modern, yet comfortable and warm feeling.  My main problem (similar to a lot of Philadelphia restaurants) is that they make couples/2 diners feel like lower class citizens that need to be crammed in next to each other.  When I go out to eat, I want to enjoy a romantic meal with my husband.  I don't want to be out to eat with 2 strangers that are sitting right next to me.  I was very disappointed in this at Amis.  The service was good and the food was top-notch, but the crammed seating makes me question whether I would ever eat here again. If you are just going for food or you have a group of 3 or more, I would totally recommend Amis.  The food was excellent.  We ordered the baked pecorino with almond honey, the sals old school meatballs, and grilled veal tongue.  All of these dishes were amazing.  We also got the swordfish meatballs, but these were a little too fishy for me.  My meal was the rotini with wild boar and ragu and while tasty, it wasn't as good as our appetizers.  The house wine is quite good and I would recommend a glass or two.   I feel bad giving a 2 star review based almost all on atmosphere, but it really dampened our experience.  I just want restaurants to know that couples don't appreciate being packed like sardines in seats next to other couples when going out to eat.
