i have an ongoing affair with Ethiopian food; but when i went to Mesob, I was slightly disappointed. i'm from la and have tried every ethiopian restaurant in little ethiopia twelve times. so when i went to mesob to fall in love again, i just kind of liked it. the food at mesob was slightly dry and no wow factor. and a little expensive, but i won't hold that against them because it is montclair.
