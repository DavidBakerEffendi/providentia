I come to Asian grill on a weekly basis and it never fails! Firstly, who doesn't love a place that remembers your name and face? The waitresses here are super friendly and are part of the experience. Secondly, the food is soooo good. There's so much variety: Chinese, Japanese, Thai, Singapore, etc. The dishes always comes out fresh and the sauces are outstanding. Plus, for big eaters (like myself) or big families, the portions are enough to fill any belly so you'll certainly get your moneys worth. My recommendations are as following: 1) Definitely try their sushi! More specifically, be adventurous and try their specialty rolls. THOSE are the absolute best. The sushi chef has a diff flavor to his spicy mayo that just makes it...so...satisfying! 2) Try the vegetarian duck. It taste much better than it sounds haha! It is served cold as an appetizer but it's healthy and yummy 3) Their curry dishes are pretty good too. Very much up to the standard of the Thai restaurants around. 4) As for drinks, the Thai ice tea is good. I actually asked for it one time without the condensed milk cuz I'm lactose, and that's actually pretty tasty without the condensed milk! Thirdly, I want to point out that I travel 20 minutes just to eat here. Not THAT far, but considering my area has plenty of Asian restaurants and I come to Asian Grill certainly means something! Asian Grill has my loyalty :) Bon appetite!
