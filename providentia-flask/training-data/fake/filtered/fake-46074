The sweetest staff accompanied by the best food I have ever tasted. These gentlemen work so well together to make sure every need is met from folding your napkin in your lap to showing us how to make their sambuca. I can honestly say I have never had better service in my life. I would recommend them to anyone visiting NYC. They truly exceeded any expectation we had going into the restaurant and provided exceptional service and plenty of complimentary drinks as well as taste testing to enhance and fulfill the experience. We will definitely return and further recommend this restaurant. x
