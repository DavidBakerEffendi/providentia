Hidden away in a great neighborhood is this rustic gem with one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Tonight was my second one there.  They also have a solid list of more upscale items which I can't seem to go for (yet).   Additionally, their brunch is one I'd say is worth the trip from other zip codes.   If I have a tiny complaint, it's that the tables are pretty close together and the room can get a little loud--this is not your spot for a romantic private meal.
