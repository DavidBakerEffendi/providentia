WOW. This place is incredible. I have eaten at steakhouses all over the Northeast, including Peter Luger's in New York City and I have to say that this steak is top quality, and the salads and sides sky rocket over the quality of Peter Lugers. I had the 21 oz Porterhouse and it was cooked perfectly and full of flavorful tender meat. I have been here about 4 times since they have opened, and I love bringing my guests here to take them out to a fine dining restaurant which Montclair doesn't have too many of, unfortunately. The creamed spinach is incredible--- especially combined with a side of mushrooms and sauteed onions. The garlic shrimp was so tasty, and even though the service has had some bumps in the past, they have changed the staff since the first opened and it has improved drastically! I highly recommend this restaurant. The ambiance is simple and eloquent, the food is amazing and will definitely leave you feeling satisfied. A great high end restaurant to entertain guests. OH and definitely try the apple bread pudding for dessert.... you WILL be in heaven. Definitely give it a shot, I hope you enjoy as much as my family and I do!
