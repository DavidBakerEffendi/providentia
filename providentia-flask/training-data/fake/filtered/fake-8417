So I've been to Jones a couple times now and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere. Got the shrimp and chicken dumplings and there were four of em for 8 bucks with soy sauce that just kinda resembled plain old soy sauce. I got the crabcake which was a good size and tasty. Fries that came with the dish were nothing special. Service was fine and I'll probably be back, I just need to figure out what entrees are worth getting.
