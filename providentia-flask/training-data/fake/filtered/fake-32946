Possibly my favorite brunch place in Manhattan. Typical brunch food, but done perfectly. My favorites are Eggs Norwegian, Pumpkin Pancakes, and Steak and Eggs. Great home fries and fresh squeezed O.J. as well. It gets crowded, especially on Sundays. However the service is great and they really get people in and out quickly. So the wait isn't bad if there is one. Highly recommended.
