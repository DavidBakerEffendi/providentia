Let me just say "AMAZING". If you ever want a quick bite to eat  and friendly smile. Go to Dig Inn.  And if your ever in need of a sandwich. Go to Kay Kay. She is the best. When she gave me my sandwich she said " I made it with love so love every bite" and Iloved every bite of that steak and avacado sandwich. I'm getting another one tomorrow.
