Suzyque's was exactly what we were looking for! The food was amazing! We had the rock shrimp app, the combo plate and the chopped pork dinner, they came with two sides each so we had Mac and cheese, creamed spinach, collard greens and waffle fries... Everything was amazing, the service the food!It's a nice atmosphere with great food and people. While we were finishing up the owner actually came up to our table and took her time to make sure everything was good for us and it was genuine convo. Can't wait to go back!
