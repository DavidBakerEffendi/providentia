Ew...roaches!  That's all I have to say. I went into this place to grab lunch before I went off to work--it's conveniently located right next to my bus stop.  And there was a huge roach taking a stroll along the baseboard of the far wall, making a dash for the kitchen.  I turned and made a dash for the exit.  It's not surprising since they have a completely open storefront.  But I don't like vermin garnishing my meals, and if you don't either I'd say pass.
