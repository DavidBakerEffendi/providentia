Loved The Cellar! We came after my birthday dinner across the street for drinks and it was lovely. The space was laid out nicely and the staff were super friendly. The way the bar was laid out was perfect for a big group to sit down and have people meet us and come and ago as they please. The cocktails were delish too - I had the Pat Burnham and it was refreshing. My friend had the cheese plate and it came out quickly, and he was more than satisfied. The staff was great about my birthday and gave the table a big slice of chocolate cake that was to die for.
