I remember when I first visited this place only had about 10 or so reviews, and it brought a grin to my face to see that the number of reviews has grown to 100. I recently went back after I was in New York again. Both times I got a panini here (deliciozo and then bubi), and both times I thought the panini was absolutely delicious and reasonably priced. The chef/owner is awesome, and I wish her continued success!
