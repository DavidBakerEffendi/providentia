I was at Harry's the other day for breakfast with a large group.  While the servers were quite abit friendlier than they used to be at the Farmington Avenue location, the food was still alright, nothing special and overpriced (I know, it's West Hartford), but the service was slow.  Granted we had a group of 10, but breakfast took forever to get to the table and we were one of the first ones in the restaurant. Now, I use to come here for breakfast almost every Saturday for 2 years after a run when they were still on Farmington Avenue.  The service was never very good.  The servers were quite unfriendly, but it was right next door to Fleet Feet so very convenient.  That will teach me to put convenience over service! Nothing exceptional... I haven't ventured over to the new location in Glastonbury and I live there!  Plus, their pizza can't measure up to Giovanni's in Glastonbury! And I look forward to finding a better breakfast/brunch place in West Hartford Center... won't be hard after eating at Harry's.
