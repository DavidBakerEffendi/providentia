Everything was delicious and i tried several things, the quail, duck, shrimp dumplings, pork belly, kobe fried rice, pad thai, everything was flavorful, couldnt complain, however, we went as a group of 6 and the serving sizes were so small we had to order at least 3 of everything for everyone to get a small taste, ended up ordering entree sizes for each of us and some of those were even small. Probably better for a date but i'd never go with a group again. Also they have interesting movie quotes playing in the bathroom.
