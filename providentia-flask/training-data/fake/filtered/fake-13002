I don't understand why this place isn't packed?!  It was about 2/3 full on a Saturday evening at 8:00 pm.  No problem in getting a table.     The food was excellent as was the service.  The prices are modest.  The decor...well as someone said, not very Parisian....but  charming enough and they were playing a fun assortment of French music.   We had the onion soup.  The soup was buttery from the slow cooking of the onions and the cheese on top was tasty and appropriately browned.  The crab salad, also excellent.  Real lump crab....very nice. For main course, we had the flounder and the hanger steak.  The flounder was well cooked and the medley of sauteed veggies were perfectly al dente and well seasoned.  The hanger steak was cooked to perfection and the the garlicy sauce was yummy. For dessert we shared the profitteroles.  The ice cream was creamy.  My only negative comment...the chocolate sauce was a little thin, but it tasted very very good...dark chocolate, not too sweet and excellent complement to the ice cream. All in all a delightful experience--great food, very moderate prices, attentive service, and an acceptable (but small) wine list.....I would definitely go back.   Just hope they don't close any time soon!!!!
