SOme dishes are spic and intense but great if you want something different and original. This hole in the wall restaurant exudes a type of elegance that this industrial part of Brooklyn just hasn't really seen before. Food is great, service was nice, authentic home feel somehow and I love the windows! TIP: go during the week for lunch, prices are cheaper
