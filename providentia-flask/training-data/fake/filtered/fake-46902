I visited second time last week ,looks like owner is taking care of  the place very well,I had this time Gujarati Thali,In my whole life of 10 years in US I never ate delicious food specially Kadhi,I love it,I had real taste of India,you feel like eating in  India,I will try something different next time probably Pizza or Kabab.
