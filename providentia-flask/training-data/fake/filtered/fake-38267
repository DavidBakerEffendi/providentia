Wanted to try this place out after reopening and I'm so glad I did! Fantastic service, excellent food, and a great atmosphere. The owner Josie was very friendly and came over several times to introduce herself and check in to see how things were. For being open only 2 weeks I am extremely impressed! Can't wait to come back.
