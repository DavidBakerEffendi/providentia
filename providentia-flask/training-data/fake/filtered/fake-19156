OMG! It was my first time there and I LOVED it! The food was delicious, better than most mexican places Ive been before, and what to say about their tequila selection!!! Got the Horni Margarita (name comes from the brand of tequila used in this drink "Hornitos") & 1 is not enough!!! Got a shooter of the tequila alone and whoa! It was great! The waiter was of great help in our menu & drink choices. Definitely a place I will go back for great mexican food & drinks.
