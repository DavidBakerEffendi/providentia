We went to Ai Fiori after a Broadway show and were greeted warmly by the receptionists but the instant we sat down we were pressed by the server constantly to put our full order in because the kitchen was closing down "that instant", even though we had called ahead before we came to make sure the kitchen was open.  Our server literally stood right beside the table looking at us waiting for us to decide what we wanted.  We weren't able to peruse the wine menu and only had a chance to take a cursory glance at the food menu before we were forced to make our decisions or go without food altogether.  I was so disgusted by the experience I didn't even try the food but my girlfriend said it was "OK".  New York has plenty of nice restaurants, there is no need to go here and be treated badly or forced to shorten a relaxing hour-long dinner into a miserable15 minutes.  If they were that close to closing the kitchen they should have told us that on the phone or when we arrived, before they sat us down and handed us menus.  Very unprofessional.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, there are plenty of other options in the big apple!!
