Sharkey's Cafe is a great new addition to the neighborhood! It's clean and stylish, from the decor down to the sandwiches, and everything in between. My turkey club was simple and delicious: Balthazar bread, generous serving of turkey and the cheese was sliced perfectly thin. Herbed mayo, great mustard- perfect. The peanut butter cookies were fresh baked and the iced coffee was Brooklyn and STRONG. Love it.
