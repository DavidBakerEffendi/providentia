Welcome to the neighborhood Wheated! Came during the soft opening saturday and can't wait to go back. The decor is really cool, the pizzas are fantastic and creavtively named after some surrounding neighborhoods (the brighton beach bacon is heaven). The bar is eclectic and versatile . The bartenders mentioned to someone i was with that they all the components of their hand crafts drinks are made in the house (simple classic cocktails similar to Clover Club). Very classy and unique for the area. The guy and girl behind the bar had great chemistry together and were on point. The servers were very friendly and kept it all under control despite the rush. This was by far the most organized opening I have seen. Just to warn everyone now: get there early. They ran out of pies pretty early and I can see that being a constant occurance (we got one of the last pies ha ha ha). Again, welcome home Wheated!
