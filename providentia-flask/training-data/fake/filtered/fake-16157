I have never had a bad experience at Cafeteria.  I usually try to stop by when I'm in town.  The food is always on point and the staff is trendy, friendly and cute.   (Miguel is the bomb)  They also stay open late....so if you need some great food to soak up the liquor you just drank....look no further.   A few notes for the first-timer: Must haves:   Chicken & Waffles, Mac-n-Cheese Spring Rolls and of course....The Rude Margarita, complete with a pepper for that extra kick.
