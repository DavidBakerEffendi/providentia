This is one of my go-to places for meals when my friends come to visit. They have a great mix of Asian foods--Chinese, Malaysian, Indonesian--that all taste delicious. They have a decent sized portion, not great, though. The interior is large, but comfortable; though, it can get quite noisy around dinner time. They even provide complementary orange slices at the end of meal, which adds a bonus point or two in my books.
