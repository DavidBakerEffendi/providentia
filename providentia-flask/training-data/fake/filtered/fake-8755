Stopped at this Restaurant hoping to get something quick and delicious not exactly what I received. I ordered the of oxtails and rice and peas the oxtails were old and some of the cabbage was moldy YUCK... the rice and peas were good but once I saw the cabbage I was done. I also bought a chicken pattie with coco bread but I need to get myself prepared for that. I would suggest looking at your food before you walk out the door.
