I was a little wary going here because of the bad reviews, but my family had a great experience.  The staff were very friendly and our food came out as quickly as can be expected considering they cook everything fresh to order.  The burgers were very good - on par with Culver's in the Midwest if anyone knows that chain.  Sure they aren't the $12 juicy monstrosities you might find at some other burger joints, but you can tell they use quality ingredients.  I haven't had a milkshake that good in years - incredibly thick and served directly in the frosted steel mixing cup.  They had lots of flavor options for the shakes too, which is awesome.  We'll definitely be going back here.
