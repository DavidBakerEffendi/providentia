Today I tried the Italian Stallion and the Uncle Gaetano.  Both were outstanding!!!   The Gaetano had a great balance of roasted turkey, pancetta, and garlic aioli.  The Italian Stallion is my favorite and is a must.  They had a perfect blend of fennel and genoa salami, topped with provolone cheese and pickled peppers, garnished with pepperoncini aioli.   The delicious taste truly reflects their care and high quality! Excellent!!!
