I usually get cravings ALL the time (no I'm not preggo) and this week's latest craving happen to be chicken and waffles. After google'ng and yelp'ng for about 5 minutes I came across the reviews for Clinton St Baking Company on yelp. After the 2nd review I was convinced and made my way to the LES that evening. I can absolutely say I had the best experience ever! Why?! Because I came, ate, and conquered! LOL The chicken and waffles was amazeballs and the maple butter was the icing on the cake. I've never been a waffle fan (I'm more of a fench toast or pancake girl to be honest) but Clinton St Baking Company has to be doing everything right to produce such fluffy and light waffles. I will definitely visit again to try other items on the menu including another plate or two of those delicious chicken and waffles. Thank you Clinton St Baking Company for your superb customer service and excellent chefs in the kitchen! :)
