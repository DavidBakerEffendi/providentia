Best lunch deal in the area!  They always have a good selection of pizza for lunch time. $5.25 will get you two large slices and a drink.  most times, i cannot even finish a slice by myself!   Delivery takes some time and price for whole pizza is a tad on the pricey side though, hence only 4 stars.
