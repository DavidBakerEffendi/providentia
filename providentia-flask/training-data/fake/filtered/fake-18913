This place is nonsense. They purposefully make you wait in an unnecessarily long line so they can keep their "buzz" and the service is some of the most rude, callous and obnoxious treatment I've ever received at a restaurant in New York.  The "pizza" which is far from NY Traditional is not worth putting up with the employees rules and attitudes. The pizza slice is rich and dense and makes you feel ill by the time you're only 3/4ths done.   I felt as though I wanted to puke already from the deplorable and inexcusable behavior of the workers. I hope this place crashes and burns, not because of the food, but because the staff deserves it.
