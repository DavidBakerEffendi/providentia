Went for my birthday with a party of 30+ people.  We had dinner on the second floor of the restaurant before heading up to karaoke.  They were extremely nice and accommodating making the reservations for such a large group.  The atmosphere to eat was very nice, the food was good (depending upon what you ordered,( i went safe with the dumplings and Cali rolls) the service at dinner was slow but then we did have 30people.  The karaoke room  was great our server was fast.   They even gave us the room for an extra hour for spending so much on dinner.  Everyone had a blast, would definitely return!
