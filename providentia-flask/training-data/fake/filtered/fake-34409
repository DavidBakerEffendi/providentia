Hosted my fiance's surprise birthday party in the private back room last Friday.  It was an amazing night!!  The food and free-flowing wine were all delicious.  Everything about the night was perfect.  Definitely think of Supper when hosting a big group of people for a dinner party...you cannot go wrong!!!!
