I went last night for the first time and really enjoyed it. The vibe of the place is awesome, cool dive bar feel with great food. The highlight was the charcuterie menu. Everything is house cured or made. I had the duck prosciutto, surryano ham (take on serrano), country pate, and roasted veggie and goat cheese terrine (I was with a pescetarian), and a house-made ricotta with an espelette pepper jam. We also had some pickles (some house made, some mcclures) as well which were fine. Then we split a ricotta-stuffed zucchini blossom, lightly fried, over heirloom tomatoes. So delicious. I only wish there was another blossom because it was a bit hard to split...and that blossom was amazing. Finally ended with the scallops with a tomato vinaigrette. It was good, but I really wanted the burger which I saw next to me. It looked intense. It's a bone marrow and brisket burger. Damn pescetarian friend...but he probably saved my arteries. I'll just have to wait until next time. A few minor service issues, but it's a new restaurant, and everyone was really friendly, so I was fine with minor annoyances. The wine list is solid with about 20 of each color. We had an albarino which was perfect for the heat and the meat...wow. Can't believe I just wrote that. Anyway, I'm into the new place. It felt neighborhoody, and comfortable, and the food was excellent. I'll definitely go back to eat, but I think it's a perfect place to have drinks and snacks. So many more pates and cured meats to try. Nice job...
