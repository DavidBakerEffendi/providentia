A great place for a Saturday night out! The bartenders are fabulous and the music hit the spot. There are two bars (upstairs and downstairs) so plenty of places to get a drink... even in the crowds. It is a spacious bar that definitely draws a lot of the crowds on a Saturday night. We didn't have food on this particular visit, but when we went on the Grand Opening a few months prior, we were able to taste a variety of appetizers and enjoyed everything we tasted. Overall, Three Monkeys did not disappoint. Definitely a fabulous bar to visit on a Saturday night!
