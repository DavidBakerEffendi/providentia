I have eaten here several times now and the food has been excellent every time. I usually get one of the specials, but honestly they have the best chicken parm I've ever had. Beyond the food, Matthew himself is there every night and is a great host. I have already recommended Matthew's to many friends and will be back again myself...hopefully soon.
