Fantastic place to eat. The menu items very from light, to very rich and cheesy (and even meaty). Portions are fantastic and certainly worthy of my money. You are almost guaranteed leftovers. Worth every visit. Go there hungry! Did I mention they deliver FOR FREE? They also have gluten-free and lactose-free options. Very trendy!
