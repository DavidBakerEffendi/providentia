You would not believe the wait to get in this place.  It is worth it though to treat yourself every once in a while.  The pizza is exceptional from the crust to the tomatoes to the light cheese baked in.  This location (now the only one) also serves salads.  It too, is a BYO and has glasses instead of plastic cups like the original.  Don't get me wrong I loved the original despite the no wine glasses.
