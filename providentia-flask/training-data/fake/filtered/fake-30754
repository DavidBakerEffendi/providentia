The food was good, even in some cases exceptional.  However other than  the breadservers, the service was impersonal, cold and distant.  The decor was bland.  To be a good or great restaurant, all the ingredients have to come together.  Only good food is not good enough, particularly at these inflated prices. To make things worse, they added on charges on the prix fixe menu that were not set out in advance.  Ouch! It has had good reviews.  Maybe I don't understand NYC restaurants but this one was a great disappointment.
