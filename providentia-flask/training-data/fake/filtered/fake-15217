5 Stars for decor and service 3 stars for food The service was on point the knew the menu backwards and forwards. They were always refilling something or bringing us food back to back. I wasn't too impressed with the food. Nothing really wowed me, But the oxtail was pretty good. The desserts on the other hand were show stealers... we ordered all three of them.
