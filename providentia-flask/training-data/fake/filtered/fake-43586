Simply put it was barely above a terrible dining experience.   The. steak tartar looked and tasted like undercooked ground hamburger and was definitely only edible with the included bread.  They had no "homemade" hash browns but mashed and baked potatoes??? The mac lobster & cheese was incredibly bland; needed salt.  I'd recommend anyone who enjoys it go to no Dylan Prime in NYC and taste the difference; you'll thank me I promise you.  The sesame tuna (med rare) was good but sauce contained way too much ginger and was incredibly salty.  By far dessert was the best part of the meal but since it was from outside; from other local Princeton business, that sums up the total experience. Definitely would not recommend or dine at again.
