The Writing Room was recommended to me by one of my colleagues. She told me that the atmosphere would lend itself to my personality. I wasn't quite sure what that translated to, but I decided to pay it a visit anyhow. Although I appreciated the design and layout of the space, I still had not grasped the punch line of my colleague's joke. After being greeted, I gave up on the joke to focus on more pressing items, like my ever growing appetite. The aroma that filled the air was heavenly. As soon as my waiter approached the table, I was ready to place an order. Gratefully, he was able to gage the sense of urgency that was now surrounding my hunger pains. He was quick and efficient in his greeting without feeling rushed or forced. He waisted no time suggesting an appetizer, after I stated I was in the mood for seafood and starving. From the start, I was impressed with the way he carried himself, his demeanor, and how he moved about the restaurant. His pace was perfection and in very little time, my hunger pains were old news. As the pains subsided, I was able to enjoy delicious food and great service. Nicoye (Nicole with a "Y", he shared when I looked puzzled at the first time he shared his name) was very well educated in matters of the restaurant, beyond the menu. Being someone who loves a good story and acquiring new knowledge, I genuinely appreciated that! And after finishing my meal and dessert, Nicoye gave me a tour of the restaurant which finally assisted in comprehending my colleagues joke. The Writing Room has a beautiful room you can dine in that's modeled like a library, filled with books! He didn't know this, but I am an avid read and self proclaimed book worm. Having that shared with me, made my day. From start to finish I have nothing but amazing things to say about the Writing Room, it's food, and the service provided. Such a pleasant surprise! This is one library I will be visiting quite often.
