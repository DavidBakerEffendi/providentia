I have been enjoying lunch and dinner here for about 5 years. The clams and mussels in white have always been superb. Once they came out lukewarm I called my waiter who returned with a fresh bowl piping hot and comp'd my date and my appetitizers. The salmon is to die for. A nice portioned salmon steak. Served with spinach which i hate but cant get enough of when eating here. And the desserts are just as good. From the mista salad to the fra diavlo pasta this reteraunt is every Italian food lovers dream. And it doesn't hurt that you can watch the game on one of the several televisions
