We LOVE Village Trattoria! It's reasonably priced and always consistant. The bread rolls they give you while you're waiting for your food to arrive are amazing. Try them with the olive oil they provide at every table. I could just order those and I'd be happy. They also have really interesting pizza flavors and great pasta dishes. I tried the large greek salad with chicken and it was suprisingly delicious-- well balanced lettuce to topping combination and the vinagrette was light tasty. Dan and I normally order the Kitchen Sink pizza since it has a nice blend of meats and veggies-- everything you could really ever want on a pizza. We've also tried the broccoli white pizza and that was yummy as well. The crust is some of the best we've ever tasted. The Trattoria is probably better for a light fun evening or on a night when you just really don't want to cook at home. It can get a little crowded and noisy since everyone in South Orange loves it. They do take out and it's byob. Great stuff!
