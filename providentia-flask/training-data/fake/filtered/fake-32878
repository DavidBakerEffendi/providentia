The perfect place to have Thanksgiving dinner !  Inviting & comfortable,  incredible staff,  delicious food.  What more could you want?  Oh,  and a view of the River.  It was a real treat to eat at Perry St.  Can't remember another restaurant with such an attentive & accommodating staff.  (They must like their work.) Definitely a 4.5+ stars.
