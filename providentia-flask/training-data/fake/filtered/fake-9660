This is all I need in the State of New Jersey...truly a great restaurant of the caliber of Le Bernardin, Eatally, or other great NYC places. The difference is, I get a great meal.  Every bit as good as NYC, but for a fraction of the price.   I am in love with Andrew's Project.  I've brought my clients here, and they love the food and ambience. Thank God, New Jersey has finally got a decent restaurant that serves high quality food served by a great chef. Tonight I'm having "Rawsome salads".  What a treat for me and my wife!!!!!!!
