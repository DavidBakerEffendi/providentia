we ate dinner at Balthazar on April 4, 2011. There were several problems. First, I asked a gentleman, wearing a suit, that was patrolling the dining area and assisting diners what he thought of the Pork belly which was on the menu. He told me that he did not eat pork and therefore did not have an opinion and that i should ask my waiter! i asked our waiter and he also said that he did not eat pork but that he had served the dish many times and that no customer had complained about it! Such ineptitude and lack of professionalism reflects a deep problem. Who is tending the store? The inability or unwillingness to discuss any item on a menu in a venue such as this is inexcusable. Second, both of us ordered beef and it was of poor quality with no taste. Third, the sardines tasted old. Overall, quite a disappointment.
