When first walking in, you get the feeling that they're just trying too hard.  Everything is white, with red accents.  Our server was snooty, but nice.   Overall the food is good.  We ordered the Singapore Noodles which were some of the best I have ever had.  Just the right about of spice and the puffed tofu was incredible.  My boyfriend ordered the Sweet and Spicy Shrimp which were very good - cooked perfectly, nice light sauce.  I ordered the Peking Chicken and was very disappointed.  It was cooked perfectly, but there was no flavor.  I ended up cutting up the chicken and mixing it with the noodles.   The portions are on the smaller side and made to share.  Also, make sure you order some type of side (rice, noddles, etc).  My boyfriend's shrimp was literally a plate with 5 shrimp on it.  Nothing else.  He was very happy I decided we had to try the Singapore Noodles.   For dessert we got the Dip Some Doughnuts.  These were the only reason we even made a reservation at Buddakan in the first place.  We saw Ted Allen recommend them on the Food Network and we had to stop on our vacation.  We also got the Creme Brule.  Creme Brule was great.  HUGE portion.  The doughunts were also great.  They come with three sauces to dip in.  The ginger cream cheese and blackberry were the best.  The chocolate was WAY too rich for my liking, but I'm not a fan of dark chocolate at all.     Overall, Buddakan was a good night out.  They're trying was too hard, but that's easy to over look.  I had on jeans and flip flops and was still treated greatly.  The food is ok but not amazing.  I would compare it to a step above PF Changs.   Also - if you're price conscious - our bill totaled $120 for 2 beers, 2 glasses of wine, 2 entrees, 1 noodle order, and 2 desserts.  Much more reasonably priced than we were expecting.
