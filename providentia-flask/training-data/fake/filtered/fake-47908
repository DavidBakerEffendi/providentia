Beware- they serve hige portions... Ordered the famous chicken cutlet grinder- could not even fimish half of the half-grinder ;) Chicken Cutlet was OK I would say- not the best of the sauce though. Owners are very friendly and courteous. Note- they do not accept cards here! So, the next time you wanna check out this place, make sure you have enough cash on you.
