I was having hunger pangs when I decided to stop in here. After analyzing the menu for 5 minutes, (yes I was starving but you make bad decisions when hungry so I took my time to avoid hungers regret) I settled on The Southern Comfort. It was the best decision I made all day, next to wearing my seatbelt and brushing my teeth of course. I'm not even a catfish fan but it was seasoned very well and fried perfectly. Next is the waffle, pure perfection. It had a little sweetness and the perfect texture. The gravy tied it all together to make a perfect dish. I ate all of my food, something I almost never do. Looking forward to coming back already and I haven't left yet.
