I came here looking to experience a great beer selection and attention to detail vis-a-vis beer service. While it is undoubted that they have a great range of beers on offer, that fact is irrelevant when service of said product is terrible. Three Â points: 1) The pours of the beers I ordered were erratic, normally not such a huge issue, but when you pay premium prices you expect these things to be taken care of. 2) Criminally neglected cask beer option. When you have a daily cask special, I expect that to be low-carbonation, fresh beer, with a unique dry-hop twist. It should NOT be stale, hop-less, and flat. How a supposedly beer-centric venue (named after this very approach to beer no less!) can let this situation occur at all is beyond me. If your cask beer is stale, don't serve it. 3) When I attempted to point this out to the bar tender in the most tactful way I could, I was told flatly that a "you bought 'em, you drink 'em" rule would apply. That an establishment could be so callous in the face of a clear customer satisfaction issue was ridiculous. I'm giving two-stars instead of one, because I would really like this place to fix these issues. I would go back only on the hope that something had been done about the above. Until such a time, Prime 16 or Rudy's would be better options.
