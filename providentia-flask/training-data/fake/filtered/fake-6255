I went there for lunch with an old friend. We both live in the area and thought why not. Well, with the exception of the bar, which is quite nice and comfortable, the corned beef special was inedible! I fear that even though the bar is comfortable, I will not be going back again. Too bad, it's nice than the old tavern but the food is horrible.
