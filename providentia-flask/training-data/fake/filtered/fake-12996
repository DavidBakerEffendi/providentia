I was at this restaurant last Sat with a group of five friends. The food was decent but the waiter refused to modify any item off the menu. I simply wanted a different sauce with my pasta. So we took it in stride and took what they were serving. But then as soon as we finished eating and we indicated we didn't want dessert the waiter kicked us out. I was embarrassed, shocked and extremely disappointed all at the same time. With so many great choices in Soho I would avoid this place at all costs. Someday places like this will realize good service is just as important as what they are serving.
