My favorite cute little girly spot in the city!  Unfortunately can't bring my husband here as he says the place is too small for him and the plates/glasses/everything is too miniature, but its perfect for a girl's dinner!  I think I tried almost everything on the menu and I love it all!   The only downside is that the wait can be a while and there isn't really a spot to wait except for outside.. But I just go on odd hours now.  Really late lunch/early dinner is perfect!
