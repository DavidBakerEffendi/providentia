I just found a brand new deli and it is AMAZING.  It's not your typical deli.  This is by far the best deli I have ever been to in NYC.  If you are looking for a deli that is not ordinary by any means, this is the place to go.  They offer sandwiches, salads, hot food, cold food, pasta, ready-made and for-order sushi, pasta station, pho, udon, and a whole section of gourmet cookies/snacks.   I highly recommend anything in this place.  I love love love how spacious it is and the seating area upstairs gives you a birds eye view of the whole deli. Check it out if you're looking for food that tastes like home cooking.  You won't regret it!
