My buddies and I ordered two General Tso's chicken and some rice.  When we opened the bag, there was only one General Tso's.  We called back and they said they would send over the other General Tso's.  After waiting over hour and not receiving anything, we called back.  They told us that the driver came to our location and called us but we didn't answer the phone so he left, and was now refusing to come back.  The phone showed no missed called, so clearly the employees were lying to us.  When we asked to speak to a manager, they hung up.   I do not recommend this restaurant.  Thank you for your time reading this.
