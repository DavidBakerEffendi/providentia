I want to offer a correction on one of the reviews below in regards to the corn: The corn is covered in cotija cheese and some kind of creme. some places do use mayo or Mexican Crema or mayo or yogurt, not just mayo. it's got garlic, cayenne, lime...I am not sure how someone who wants to review food couldn't figure that out especially after eating it, but it's not fair to Cafe Habana to publish that incorrect info. They don't serve corn covered in mayo. I really love this place. A few misses, but as much as I've eaten there, it sometimes happens. Overall, they always more than deliver on the taste. It's fun, casual, and packed. Good vibes and yummy!
