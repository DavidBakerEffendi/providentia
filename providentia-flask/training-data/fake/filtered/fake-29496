Why the hell can't I find REAL southern fried chicken. Is the emphasis "southern" or "soul food"? My experience is that the food is in the style of soul food, and not traditional southern cooking. I grew up in two of the three of the world's most interesting eating cityies, New Orleans and Rome. I didn't get to NYC until my adulthood. NYC gets it so right on with Italian food. I still haven't found a great southern cooking restaurant.
