I went to Iris Cafe this morning and it was a lovely, warm and inviting place to be on a rainy morning. I ordered the avocado toast with a poached egg, and a rosemary panna cotta. The panna cotta landed a delicate balance between sweet and savory and was topped with crystallized rosemary crumble. It was a unique flavor, and I'd definitely go back to try more dishes next time I'm in the neighborhood.
