This has to be the best pizza outside of Italy. It is easily the best pizza in New York. I've been coming here for almost five years and I wouldn't say I moved to Boerum Hill to be closer to it, but I don't want to move now that I'm close to it. Freshest ingredients, charming environment and the service makes you feel at home. The waits are never fun but worth it and all it takes is a little bit of planning to limit the hassle. I've also gotten the chance to eat next to Jay-Z and Beyonce on two occasions. Can't beat that.
