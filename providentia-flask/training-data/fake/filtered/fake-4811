This place makes NYC Pizza nervous. Being a New Yorker, I was pleasantly surprised with my recent visit to Bliss Famous Pizza. Stone Oven baked Pizza tasted so much better than the so-called city brands. I particularly fell in love with Vindaloo Pizza, speaks volumes of how creatively the chef/owners have transformed the tastes mixing South Asian flavors with European. We were a group of 6 people, the place is very clean, cozy, friendly staff, great for families/couples and especially kids would be so excited with the chocolate fudge Pizza, another novelty inspired by South American cuisine. Prices are way too reasonable, it was indeed the best value for money and quality beyond expectations. I requested the staff if they could cater for my Pizza parties in New York City, and they very kindly agreed to try. I'm already looking forward to my next visit. Truth be told, this place is a treat to yourself and your loved ones. Highly Recommended, best wishes to its staff and owners for the great job, keep it up.
