I will say, Di Fara reminds me how much good ingredients matters - good cheese, good tomato sauce, fresh basil - makes an overall great pizza. That being said, I don't see why anyone would ever want to put up with the crowd, the wait, or the ridiculously high prices for a place on Ave J. In my opinion more than cancels out what I just said.
