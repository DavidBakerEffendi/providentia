The food is good, but the service is preposterous!! The most ridiculous waitress I have ever been served by in my life. Why we left a tip is beyond me.  My friend ordered the shepard's pie and I a burger. Waitress delivers me the burger and him----CHICKEN!! She said, oops I accidentally pushed the chicken button. Do you mind?"  He's English so made a joke but couldn't bring himself to vociferously object.  I however, clearly stated, I hope he won't be charged for that since it is not what he ordered.  She mumbled something about if it made him sick she'd order the shepard's pie?!!!  I assumed since he accepted it he wouldn't be charged (she never offered to put the order for the Shepard's pie in at all. It was nearly comical it was so absurd)  She brought him a desert he neither wanted nor chose and charged us for the chicken, more expensive I might add. I, as a local business owner, am appalled by this level of service, and as a local business owner would never write a review unless I was really really disturbed by the service and hoped that the owner(s) might read this.  Server (woman) had long blonde wavy hair in a pony tail. Sadly enough to keep me from returning or recommending it to others.
