The whole experience at the Farmacy is great! They have a lot of unique and delicious dishes (I love the Benny bar) and often give complimentary extras (we had a deliciously sweet fruit plate today). They're also so accommodating with outdoor seating, dog friendly, and splitting checks. I've recently become a regular!
