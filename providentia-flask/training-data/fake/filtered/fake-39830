It can be difficult living in this neighborhood because when it comes to local restaurants, most of them cater to the large tourist base as they leave their Broadway shows for dinner. Â So I'm happy to report that my craving for pad thai on a more than semi-weekly basis has been satisfied in a restaurant that does not resemble a loud cafeteria and is reasonably affordable. Thank you.
