Great view and good food!  Fun place where you can enjoy the city skyline!  We loved the sangria and the surf and turf recommended by our server, Allesondra.  She was so pretty with a great smile and lots of energy.  We sat  outside and she was pretty busy but always kept that smile and gave us great service!  Definitly will be back!
