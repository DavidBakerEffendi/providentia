Last night I went to Scarpetta for my management team's holiday gathering. It was my second time at the restaurant and i have to say, it was much better a few months ago. We were not impressed with the food at all. It started off OK with the bread basket - stuffed breads and caponata were a nice touch. But we ordered a bunch of apps and they barely fit on the table - they should've replated the 8 apps to fit on our table of 8 so we could share. A restaurant of that caliber should know that. Also the fritto misto had hardly any fish in it, but somehow an annoying flavor of anchovy. Our second course came out and same thing happened, no space! They only thing that was good up until this point was the wine - which I ordered. The entrees came out and I had the dry aged sirloin - which I am pretty sure was NOT dry aged. My colleagues agreed. Dessert was OK - the server took the liberty to order everything. If you go, you have to order a lot of food because the portions are small. So be sure to try everything. The GM was rather nice though and very hospitable. Maybe it was just an off night...
