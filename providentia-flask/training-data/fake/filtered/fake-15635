Stopped in with a friend-  she had the Chicken & Waffles and I decided to try one of their specialty sandwiches the Turkey & Bacon - yumm!  I couldn't help but try some of her waffle and it was probably one of the best waffles I've ever had.  My sandwich was spot on - the chipotle sauce definitely made it.   I would definitely come back - their prices are more than reasonable, staff is nice and the overall décor is chill~
