By far the best seafood restaurant in Philadelphia. Though not a very large restaurant, there isn't anything on the menu that isn't incredible.  The fact that it's a BYOB make this whole experience even better.  The service was excellence and the atmostphere was very pleasant. I rate this 10 out of 10
