We took the pizza bus tour. I would highly recommend this tour it was so much fun, Scott knows more about pizza than anyone I know. Not only is it fun but you learn about every aspect of pizza ..the dough the sauce the cheese different types of brick ovens. i have been on many walking, food tours this was one of the best. I cannot say enough about Scott he really loves pizza and his excitement is contagious. I will defintely be booking a pizza walking tour next. Go on this tour you won't be disappointed!!!
