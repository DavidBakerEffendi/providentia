Wonderful spot to go to if you are looking for a great deal of meal options and a quaint shopping experience. I ate at a Cajun place and it was absolutely superb. I HIGHLY recommend this place if you are new in town, it will definitely leave a lasting impression. If you hate crowds, this place may not be for you as it is EXTREMELY busy
