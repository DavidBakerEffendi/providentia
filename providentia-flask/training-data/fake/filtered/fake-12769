Post office is one of the hidden Gems in Williamsburg nightlife - one of the newer and better, for sure.  Located off the beaten track in South Williamsburg, just off of the BQE on Havemeyer, Post Office boasts an outstanding array of whisky and gin concoctions (more liquor mixes available, if you ask) that'll have you raving to your friends for nights to come.  Generally speaking, their liquor offerings are enough to win them bragging rights amongst their compatriots. Jeff, one of the bartenders, has an excellent knowledge of each cocktail; he was able to recommend a cocktail to suit each of my changing moods thoughout the night (yes, my moods change throughout the night... apparently).  If in the mood for something sweet, I recommend Post Office's "Benediction", which Jeff made for me without my asking. Basically, just go - enjoy yourself, the food, the cocktails, the Americana decor.  I highly recommend it.  They're right around the corner from Traif, and present an excellent cap to one's night in Williamsburg.
