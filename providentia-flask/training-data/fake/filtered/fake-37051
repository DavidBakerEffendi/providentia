This place gets jampacked, so I expect a few butt hurt people to use yelp as way to bitch and moan about not being seated right away. What do people expect? red carpet service? Geez!  Talk to me when you become a legit celeb (or a demanding Yelp Elite member ) Granted, I was told  a few occasions that my wait was 30 minutes - at that point I had a choice whether to leave or sit in the bar and wait for my turn. There were  times that the place gets so jammed, the owner even gave everyone waiting a round of appetizers (which is so shocking to me!) to appease everyone. Regardles, what made me give me this place 5 stars is how fast the order came out. The quality of food never failed me and the servings are huge (especially the fried rice orders- which I always get. what! I need to carboload). The staff are also very attentive (and their strong accents really gives this authentic vibe). Don't even get me started with the modern aesthetic vibe of the place. Very atypical when you think of Thai places in New York.  I always make it a point to bring my visiting out of town peeps here for dinner to give them a taste of Brooklyn dining. ok maybe I am little annoyed with the cash only policy, but this just speaks how lazy the whole world is becoming. Why do you think its prices are wayyy reasonable  than everyone else? Instead of bitching, why don't you go across the street , withdraw money, come back then order yourself a thai Iced tea and call it a day
