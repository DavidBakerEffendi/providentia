As someone who is allergic to milk, I absolutely love this restaurant. There are so many options for a cheese-less pizza it's just incredible. Keep in mind, this is not "New Haven Pizza". As they advertise, they make artisan pizza; it has a thicker crust, not burnt in the slightest. Also, the service is excellent, they are nice people who seem to genuinely care, and don't seem forced into a job. Really good beer selection too, and outdoor seating! This is one of the best in New Haven.
