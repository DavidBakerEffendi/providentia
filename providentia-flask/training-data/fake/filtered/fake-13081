Last month I did my daughter's birtday party in Mirchi banquet hall for 80 people. In the middle of the party, the food is not enough for all my guests. I felt so embarassed in front of my friends. I ask the waiters several time to fill it up the food because many of my friends complain where is the food. But it looked like the waiters are very unproffesional and not bother at all. So, many of my guest left hungry after party. NEVER EVER Â again go to mirchi. Also no response from management about my complain. Maybe they should hire profesional staffs with knowledge about the hospitality industry not just some cheap staffs.
