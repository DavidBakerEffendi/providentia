Horrible.Not like it used to be. Been coming to this place since it opened in 2000, used to have fantastic food and service with fantastic prices up until owners changed now its a 50/50 if fish is fresh, prices are up and the worst part of all is how the service is, no matter how good a customer you are if you walk in a minute past when the owner decides hes randomly tired you will literally be thrown out no matter how many people you are with. Also, you are expected to leave a very high tip every time you go no matter how much money you spend weekly even if you just sit at a bar, or you will be discriminated, not treated well and named called!. I had an embarrassing experience with a date and i left before i ate and i was very very disappointed disgusted and unhappy and so was my date on how we were treated, i will never in my life go back to this place again and i will not recommend any one else going. i will find a new place to have my business.
