The pizza here is really good, but it's worth it to order delivery. The vibe here is nice, but good luck getting a seat. The service plain sucks. Very pretentious attitude and slow. I have better things to do than wait an hour or more to get a table at a place where I will then be made to feel like I am inconveniencing the servers by asking questions. Seems like this place belongs in SoHo, not Bushwick. For 'scenesters' only.
