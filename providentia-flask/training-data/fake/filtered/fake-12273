Warm and cozy interior.  TV's were great to catch the games.  Service was spot on!!Awesome grilled pizza, yeah I said it!!  Shared one with my girlfriend, a hint of truffle oil was a nice touch on the mushrooms pizza.  She had the cranberry salad with a tofu burger added to it, not my taste but she loved it!  I had the filet on the bone, tender and juicy, could have cut it with a butter knife.  We split a berry parfait for dessert, nice finish to the evening.  We will be back for sure.
