Maybe i'm a pizza snob given I have New York roots but this pizza was the worst I've had. I mean Whole Foods makes better pizza than this. The crust was burnt and flaky and very thin and I was wondering what the difference was between this and a cracker. The sauce was okay but pretty greasy and there was barely any cheese on my cheese pizza. I felt like I ordered a diet Margherita pizza from a fast food restaurant. I'm usually a one slice pizza girl and tonight I've had three and I'm still hungry...not cool. I can't believe this is supposed to be the best in New Jersey. I recommend Romeo's in Plainsboro or Manino's in Hightstown if you are looking for the "best" in the area.
