Absolutely Terrible.  Loud, Cramped, Poor Service, Food was sub par if you ignore the fact that my boyfriend and I both came down with food poisoning less than 24 hours after.   I had a Tuna Special, the tuna was inedible so I ate the side asparagus and risotto.  My boyfriend had the fish of the sea dish which no doubt lead to our illness, as we both at the shrimp from that dish and fell ill.  My Mother had the Lasagna which was utterly unimpressive and the gravy if you call it that lacked flavor.  My father did have a Veal dish which he seemed to enjoy.  The two men ordered espresso which had to be sent back as it was watered down coffee.   All in all I will never be returning,  $200 for a dinning experience that I will definitely not soon forget and wish I could.
