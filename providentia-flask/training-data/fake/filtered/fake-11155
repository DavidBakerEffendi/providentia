Manzo.... was a tremendous disappointment.  The ego of the place is just unnecessary and unwarranted as are the prices.    I was told by their manager in a snotty condescending manner,  when i made a suggestion that if they wrote all their rules down they would have to write a book.. this IS a restaurant is it not?   not school? Are they aware that they are a restaurant sitting inside a giant gourmet grocery store?  essentially that is what it is after all... I have eaten at 5 stars all over the world, and NY especially is known for its good food.. Why would anyone return to this place? Portions are small, prices are high, food was very good but... not outstanding... service was surly and slow and management worse they offer a tasting menu for 90 dollars which is nice.. but if you want to order it, your entire group is required to have it otherwise you have to sit by yourself.   my brother in law is from torino, and he lives in the states now.  he has waited a year to come try this.    and they refused to serve it to him..   we said we didn't care if his meal was timed differently than ours we just wanted him to get this as it was for him that we were there for... they not only were not accommodating, but very rude about it..
