Rude service. Poor value. Over-hyped - only thing it has going for it is the convenient location. You're far better off going down to other store for banh-mi sandwiches for $4-5. I ordered a duroc pulled pork sandwich. Bread to meat ratio was too low. Bread was hard and created the squeezing of meat out the other end effect. Pork was also bland. Nothing special - not worth the price.VERY BAD
