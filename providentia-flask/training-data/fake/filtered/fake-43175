I have been to their Brooklyn location many times and loved it. So when I heard they were opening in Chinatown, I had to come and check it out. The decoration is beautiful, almost feels like I'm back in Asia! And because it has two floors, I think it's bigger than the one in BK. The food is fresh as always, and I recognize a few of the waiters and hostess from BK store. I came on their first day opening, and made a reservation before so I didn't have to wait at all. I will recommend this place to my friends!
