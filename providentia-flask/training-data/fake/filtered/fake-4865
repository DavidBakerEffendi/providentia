The one pro: Food was delivered before the estimated time. Cons: My steak sandwich had ketchup and mayo in it. Who puts ketchup on steak? I guess i should have known better and asked for no ketchup, but why would ketchup and mayo be the default for steak? I got the half orders because the full orders mention fries and rice, and the half orders don't. Turns out that you get rice and fries with the half orders too, even though it doesn't say it on the menu. My half order of ribs came with 4 ribs, and over 2 pounds of rice and french fries. I am not making this number up; i removed the bones, and weighed the container. It came out to 2.4 pounds! My half order of chicken was pretty much the same; not much chicken, and over 2 pounds of rice and fries. So after tax and tip, I paid $25 for a steak sandwich (with ketchup in it...), 8 pieces of meat, and 5 pounds of rice and fries (the steak sandwich came with fries too, so that put it over 5). Never again
