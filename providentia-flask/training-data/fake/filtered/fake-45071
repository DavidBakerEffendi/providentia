My husband and I have loved the food here for a few years, but our opinion of the Reservoir Tavern has changed since we tried to bring our toddler here. We walked in with our nearly 2 year old daughter who typically has no issue at restaurants, as long as we bring some food that we know she likes to avoid any meltdowns. I had just given our daughter an avocado on a napkin when the waitress came by and told us that there was no outside food allowed. We explained that she is a picky eater and we at least know she'll eat the avocado (especially since there is NO kids menu). She said that outside food can't be brought in because other people might get sick. We bring food for her everywhere else we go and we have never had an issue. She agreed to let us keep the avocado if we had it put on a plate. Thinking the waitress would simply come back with a plate, we agreed. Before we knew it, the waitress had taken the avocado off the table and our daughter started flipping out. We decided to pay for our drinks and leave, and I guess a good part of the story is that they said not to worry about it. Long story short, this is not an appropriate place for young children, which in my opinion is an absolute shame. Their eggplant parmesan is fantastic, as is everything else we've tried; however, we won't be coming back for a very long time.
