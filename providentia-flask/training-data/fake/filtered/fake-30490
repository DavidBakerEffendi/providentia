A group of friends got together for some fun and food on a Saturday night and we all wanted to try Papa's.  I ordered the mussels marinara - the sauce was to die for - but all I got was empty shells - no mussels. So if you order mussels marinara  be prepared to get a plate of shells, with  sauce and bread. The owner came over to ask how things were and I told him I got a plate of shells with no mussels in them and his reply was I don't grown them - what kind of answer is that? My husband ordered the stuffed artichoke appetizer and it was so dry he could not eat it. The pizza is alright I would not vote it #1. My dinner was pasta, broccoli rabe and sausage in a wine sauce - it was all butter  by the third bite I could not eat any more it was to greasy from to much butter and not enough wine.  The waiter was wonderful but the owner seemed to have a problem with our table. So, guess what....you won't see the 10 of us again.  We dropped a pretty penny your way that night -- but not again. The only reason I gave you a star was because your marinara sauce was one of the best I have ever had.
