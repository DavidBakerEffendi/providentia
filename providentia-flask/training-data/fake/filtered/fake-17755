I worked at Village Pizza, and it's just not a place that I'm proud to have in my town. The presentation is tacky, with this faux cave look, the food is ok but nothing special, and they have horrible karaoke 3 times per week with the same awful people singing every time. The owners are really nice and I guess they give the people what they like, but I think it's just disappointing.
