I live around the corner from D & C's and am a frequent client.  I admit the sandwich's and cold cuts in general (which I buy here b/c they do a lot of sandwich business and the meats are always fresh and all Boar's Head) are great.  Their prepared foods are very expensive, and to my palette, not worth the money, but in a pinch, when I dont want to cook, they are OK..  The reason I gave them only 3 stars is their catering.  I have tried them 3 times for catering and all three have been disappointing, both in service and quality/price.  One occasion was my sons' graduation and me and my guests were left waiting 2 hours b/c someone screwed up my order.  The other times the food was just not worth the price (very high).  The key is to get catering when they are not busy (i.e holidays, graduation season, etc).  Im curious to see what will change (if anything) when they open a much larger and similar establishment about a half mile from D & C in a few weeks called The Market Basket (or somethingl ike that).  Im hoping the competition will bring up the quality, and bring down the prices.
