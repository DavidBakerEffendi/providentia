I went to Bridget Foy's  with a group of girlfriends a  few months ago to have dinner  for my birthday. I had the head house market burger (minus the mushrooms)... it was phenomenal! I never had a burger topped with a fried egg before, omg, sooooo good! Everyone that I was with said they really liked their food., which is surprising for my group of friends! We can hardly ever find a restaurant  that everybody likes or agrees on.. Another plus is that  we liked how the waiter had this cool little twirled up handlebar moustache : ) Now that the weather is cooler, I plan on coming back to sit outside and have another burger... which I consider to be the best burger I've probably ever had so far...
