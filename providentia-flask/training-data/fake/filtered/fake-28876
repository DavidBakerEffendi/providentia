The host was professional looking, the food was great (good portion size), the dessert was excellent, and our waitress was very attentive. However, I have to agree with Nicole K. The girl at the register needs help. She lacks professionalism. She rang us up while she was talking to other staff. She took my credit card, swiped it, gave me a pen to sign, took her copy, and didn't even look at us (no mention of "thank you"). It is too bad that this diner has her at the register. I don't think I'll go back to this diner again.
