Well, I'm a very picky eater with a sensitive stomach, who's eaten in some of the best restaurant around the world. I don't like many places, but in New Haven, Zinc is my top pick. I recently made a second visit to Zinc and this time around, I had the steamed pork + ginger dumplings and the grilled natural hanger steak and every bite was full of flavors. My second time around at Zinc was as mouthwatering as the first and wondered why I did not come back sooner for such a wonderful experience. I guess I wanted to leave it for special occasions, but why deprived myself of such great food and atmosphere? Zinc is my top pick in New Haven, CT.
