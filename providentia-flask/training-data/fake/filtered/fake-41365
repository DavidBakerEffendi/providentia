There are quite a few forgettable elements to this place mostly the overpriced beer selection, yet the Wednesday we stopped in our waitress Liz was by far the most redeeming quality to this restaurant. Gorgeous smile beautiful personality very attentive and never missed a beat. A model employee and now our only reason to go back.
