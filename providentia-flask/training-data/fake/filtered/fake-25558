Village Pizza is one of my favorite places to eat lunch or dinner, the food is fresh and home made and the soups are especially good, The owners and staff are pleasant and friendly and their appreciation of your business is so sincere , their portions are big and their menu has a variety of many types of food , I would highly recommend Village Pizza for lunch or dinner
