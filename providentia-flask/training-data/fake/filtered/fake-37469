Joju makes the best Vietnamese sandwiches period. The combination of their amazing tasty food and helpful friendly staff makes this establishment one of the must-visit restaurants in New York! Not only are their sandwiches a bomb.. but their sides and bubble tea are killer as well! P.s. everything tastes better with an egg
