Not a bad diner. I went with 5 people who ordered dishes ranging from breakfast to lunch and all enjoyed their meal. Service was fine and food tasted like diner food should. I will say that there is a musty smell when you enter which was very off putting. But we were in a hurry to get back on the road and figured it couldn't be that bad. Overall it was a mediocre experience. I'm not from the area, but I would wager there are better diners to be found. But it served its purpose.
