I had been raving about the Christmas decor for weeks so my friends were excited to try all the drinks on the menu that we saw on the online menu and when we arrived and asked the bartender for the drink menu she scoffed at us and said "there's no drink menu." Â Very rude and odd considering we are locals and would have frequented this establishment often.
