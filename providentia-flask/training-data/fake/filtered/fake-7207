I've been to Basque Country in Spain.  This is close but not quite IT.  Beautiful interior, very comfortable.  Service was very good...not perfect (they tended to leave used plates when new dishes arrived) Chef Garces is Iron Chef (well,  he won a contest not an invitation) and as such, along with the prices, I expected a much higher level of presentation and creativity in the dishes.  The food was generally very good but lacking in imagination   (the Lomo was tough & chewy) .  At an average of over $100 for two for a normal dinner, I have had much better taste sensations for less $.  Even the printed menu lacked the required detail to explain the dish.  In Basque country when you go out for tapas (or pintxox) you see the dish on the counter and choose.  Here you rely on the menu.  This is tapas "Garces Style".  Hopefully this will not catch on.  Chef Garces, step it up a notch and act like an Iron Chef.
