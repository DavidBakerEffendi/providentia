I would love to give a 5 star review and on the food alone I would but there is something very wrong with attitude of the staff at Luca's. I have been dining here for years and love the food but I have been very reluctant to recommend this place to friends/family because of what seems to be a management ssue.  I hope they take these reviews seriously because the food alone does not make the total dining experience.  I am glad to see others share their views on this in hopes that there will be some improvement the next time I decide to dine there.  The wait staff on multiple occassions blames the chef rather freely for not being customer service oriented and they are vocally reluctant to ask the chef for a substituion request stating that the chef does not like these type of requests.  I am not a big fan of broccli rob (little bitter for me) and asked for spinach instead (on menu) - the wait staff immediately stated with uneasiness that the chef will not like this request.
