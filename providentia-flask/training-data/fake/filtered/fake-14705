Just stopped in today for some amazing grilled cheese. I had sourdough with smoked Gouda, saut√©ed spinach and tomato. My husband had sourdough with muenster cheese, caramelized onions and short rib. I would happily order either again, but the short rib is what will keep me coming back. Also had the tomato soup which was excellent and absolutely necessary with grilled cheese. One of the owners, Gus was is in. Super nice guy, as was our server. Sounds like they should be getting their beer and liquor license soon. Will definitely be back!
