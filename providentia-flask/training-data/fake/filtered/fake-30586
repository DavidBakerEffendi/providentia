I love this place. :-) I have been looking for good ramen place since I got to Philadelphia. I am a typical Japanese guy who likes to eat ramen at least one a week. I just droped by this restaurant couple of weeks ago, and ordered Shoyu Ramen, which is ramen with soy sauce based soup. The taste is very authentic Japanese ramen, which is very close to ramen in Japan, and I loved it. I am glad that I could find very authentic ramen restaurant in Philadelphia and have decided to come here often.
