I went here last night for a New Year's Eve dinner with friends. We had the prefix menu which I thought was awesome in general and reasonably priced but I wish there was more variety in terms of the main dish. I had the salad to start which I thought was nice and I could tell the greens they used were really fresh. The sweet potato soup I had after was the best though!! It was the perfect size with awesome flavors and it was just perfect for the really chilly weather we had last night. The main course was a choice of different versions of lasagna. The pesto lasagna I had was really good and I understand it's a prefix menu but I wish they had more choices other than just lasagna cooked in 3 different ways. For dessert, we all had Tiramisu which was also really good. The space was a little tight but overall, the ambiance was really nice, cozy and romantic. I really liked the giant lantern/lighting they had in the garden. However, I think someone kept turning off the heat. It was nice and warm when we got in and during the soup course or main course, it got super cold and drafty. Our waitress was really nice and friendly and I liked that the manager (or owner - not really sure on this) went to our table to see how we were doing. I'm giving them 4 stars for the great customer service and for the sweet potato soup and the tiramisu!
