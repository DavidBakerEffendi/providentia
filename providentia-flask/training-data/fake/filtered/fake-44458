So I went to Mcladdens for a beer or two with some friends tonight.  It was my first time.  I spent 70 overpriced dollars (my own fault) and left with a sour taste in my mouth.  The food was sub par as well as the service.  I tried the corned beef and cabbage and it was bland and super dry. The crowd was mostly college age guys...all drunk, loud and sloppy.  The bartender gave me an attitude because when I approached the bar I didn't IMMEDIATELY know exactly what I wanted.  Pardon me for needing an extra second to decide.  One of my friends was there with her boyfriend who was in the band that was playing.  I watched the manager (Ben, I believe) tell her that she could not go out the back door to her boyfriend's car to get her purse and that she would have to walk around the entire building. He was a real jerk about it.  (As if she was a threat to the establishment by walking out the back door). Dude. Give me a break.  It was POURING rain. Your bar sucks, your staff sucks, and your food sucks.  Go get a real job.
