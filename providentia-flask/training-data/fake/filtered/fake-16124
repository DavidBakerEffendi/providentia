Does "trendy" really have to equal "deafeningly loud"? No, we didn't run afoul of unfriendly doormen or snotty waiters and our Â party of six got seated immediately at 10:15 on a Sunday night, and, yes, the mac and cheese was great, but can someone please tell me why it's a good idea to pipe really loud music into a jam-packed restaurant that's already loud because it's small, full of people, and finished with sound-reflective hard surfaces? It was impossible for us to have a conversation that included everyone at the table. Fail.
