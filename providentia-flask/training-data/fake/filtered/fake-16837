This was my second visit to Burger & Barrel, and I was just as impressed the second time around as I was on my first visit. My friend and I went on a Sunday in the dead of summer, so it was unusually slow that night. Plus, we had a 6:30 p.m. reservation, which could have also accounted for the lack of occupied tables. Nonetheless, the service was friendly and efficient, and we had a lovely meal. Order this: - Kale Salad - it's a take on a classic caesar salad. It was lovely. - Fried Chicken - not the best I've ever had but it's definitely a winner. - Bash Style Burger - the meat was juicy and very flavorful. A little over seasoned. - Steak Sandwich / Or Steak Sliders - both are the same. just different portions.
