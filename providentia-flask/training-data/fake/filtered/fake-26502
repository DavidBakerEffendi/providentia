I went to eat at this place with my friend because i was dying to try it but i couldn't regret it more....It took ten minutes for us to get a menu we raised our hands a couple of time and the hostess who was in front of us kept ignoring us...when we finally got the menu, it took half hour to get a margarita and a coke? seriously  i can understand the food taking long  but a coke????....then an 45 min  later when we finally got our food it was good i can't complain about the food...but the manager personally went and asked every table how everything was except to us? i wonder why? he gave water to the people behind me and even though my glass was empty he didn't bother even asking.....i don't want to say we were treated bad because we were the only hispanics there in that room but i can't find an explanation for it because my money is worth the same as everybody elses......won't be going back there .........
