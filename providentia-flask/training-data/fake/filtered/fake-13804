Great Place!  Bartenders know your name and offer you your favorite cocktail right away.  With Amalfi's being Family owned and operated, their presence always make you feel warm and wanting to always stop in and say hi and have a Brooklyn.  Wings best in town!  Looking forward to our next weeks visit.
