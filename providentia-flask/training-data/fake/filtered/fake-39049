I love RiRa. If it's comfortable food and atmosphere you're after, this is the perfect place. I go out of my way to come here every time I'm in the area. The Whiskey Room is my favorite part of this particular location. This is the closest you'll come to a genuine Irish pub here in the states. It's just brilliant.
