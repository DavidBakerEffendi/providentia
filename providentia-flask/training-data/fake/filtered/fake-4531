We have been coming to Green Eggs since it opened.  Unfortunately, the overall quality has gone down hill over the years.  We have been visiting less frequently than before, and during our previous visit in January everything was well below expectations.  When we read that they hired a new chef and the excitement they seemed to have about him, we decided to return.  Today, we were sat and given dirty menus that were old and the laminating was peeling from the corners.  Our server was beyond unfriendly and never cracked a smile the entire time we were there.  When our food was delivered, my husband's coffee was empty.  No one ever filled it throughout the meal even though we watched our server stand at the service station staring into space the entire time we ate.  My waffle was so cold that the butter didn't even have a chance of melting and the cold syrup didn't help anything.  I never send food back, but this was inedible. We flagged down a server walking by and told him.  He got the manager who took the waffle away and asked if I wanted a new one made, but never apologized.  After my husband finished his food, we sat for sometime still with no coffee and no server.  Finally, I waved to our server who was still staring into space.  She turned her back for a few minutes and then when she turned back around, she proceeded to drink her coffee at the service station.  It must have been nice to have coffee at breakfast!!!!!  After we finally got the check from another server, no one ever came back.  When we left our server was hanging out at the host stand gossiping with the manager and host.  This was a terrible dinning experience and it felt more like an iHop than a quality cafe.
