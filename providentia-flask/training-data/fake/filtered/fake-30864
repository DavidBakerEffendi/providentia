I just got a chance to go to the Double Windsor after waiting what seems like forever for it to open.  I was not disappointed.  The beer was great, the bartenders fun and the crowd was everything I had hoped for.  A great mix of young and old, hip and not so hip.  It felt like it a true reflection of Windsor Terrace and I will happily become a regular. As for the reviewers who complained about kids, I saw none in sight.  But hey, this is Brooklyn and even a mom needs a drink now and then.
