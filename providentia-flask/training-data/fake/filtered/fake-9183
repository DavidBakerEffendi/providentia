All these haters obviously have never been to a real bar cause this is it!!!! The service is both relaxed and yet professional. If you don't have the time for a quality cocktail then I'd suggest staying home and serving yourself. Love this bar and we plan on making it a staple of our night life. Viva la anchor bar!
