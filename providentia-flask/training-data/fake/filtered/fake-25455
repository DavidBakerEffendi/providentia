I was in NYC for business for a few weeks and one of the our customers suggested we go to Cafe Habana. WOW! I'm from Houston and we have great Tex Mex. But, I have never, never tasted anything like their corn! Beyond YUM! Someone should start a corn chain - please send royalty here for the idea...I hope someone in Houston can someday duplicate this unbelievable food experience. The pork sandwich as good also.
