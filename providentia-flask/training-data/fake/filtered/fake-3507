People who complain that this food isn't authentic enough, are dumb.  I'd love for them to refer me to the marketing line they use where they claim to serve "the real tastes of Mexico" or some other such thing. ... Oh yeah, they can't because no such claim is made.  You walk in, you see they serve burritos and you have a pretty good idea of what to expect.  You're going to get rice, beans, meat, cheese and sauce wrapped in a giant tortilla, and the final product is going to be about as big as your foot.   The chorizo here is delicious, don't listen to anything the haters have to say.  As best I can tell, some reviewers just make things up and post them on here.
