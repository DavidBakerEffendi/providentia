So I went to Percy's with one thought in mind - the $24 eat everything on the menu deal. It's why we chose this spot. The menu says that a minimum of four people in your party need to order this option...cool - we had four out of six that were all about it. FAIL - we soon learned from our sweet but way softspoken waiter that there are rules at Percy's - many rules. It's an all or nothing deal - either the whole table is in on it or no one can be. Well learning that rather critical rule totally f-ed up my plans. So i decided on another combo - 1 meat and two sides...only to learn that the mac and cheese is considered an appetizer, not a side...WTF! The rules say i'm allowed to have the mac and cheese but it counts as both my apps - REALLY - just make a smaller portion! So anyway, I get over the rulees and i order chicken...that tasted like smoked ham...seriously...i was craving pineapples instead of bbq sauce to make it all right.. Before I took a bite of the mac and cheese all I could think is this had better be worth the BOTH my sides..eehhh...not so much. it was decent, but my mom makes better! On a positive note - the cornbread was damn good and I ran into some friends while i was there...guess that made things a bit better...knowing they were as foolish as i was to think I could get some good bbq in lovely gentrified "Washington Square West" WHAT?? when did that neighborhood come into creation??? In closing - I'd give Famous Daves more stars than this joint...seriously!
