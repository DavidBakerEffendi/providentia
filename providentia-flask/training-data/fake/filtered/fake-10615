This restaurant serves the best Puerto Rican Food around....I believe they were the former owners of "El Coqui" their pasteles are delicious and not too much fat filling like other restaurants.   I love to buy a pound of pernil because it's cheaper than making it yourself and really tasty.  The food quality is always excellent...but I can't understand why a lot of the young kids go there to buy the pizza pocket things...Great Jamaican patties too.  I also like their Yuca and banana alcapurrias...guineos con bacaloa..  They never have the bananas but they'll cook them for me.   Very nice folks!
