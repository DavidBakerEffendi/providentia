We went here for my birthday, no expectations. Gorgeous decor and great ambiance as soon as we walked in. Service right away is there to help you with any questions. Wine list is long and full of great selections. We ordered the scallop and beef short rib appetizer, which is awesome! We then split the romaine salad with walnuts, also great!! We both had steaks and then paired them with garlic mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli! Our meal was phenominal and so was our service. Our server was Irish Mike, who was professional and prompt with everything we needed. This is now my favorite restaurant in the city, a must for anyone! Prices are high but worth every penny if you're looking for the best! Enjoy this place if you decide to branch out! We did!
