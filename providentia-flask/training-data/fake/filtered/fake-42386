Talk about being in the right place at the right time.  Our dinner at Saxon and Parole last night was fabulous. We arrived early had some awesome cocktails at the bar - Celery Gimlet and an Almond Fizz.. SO yummy, and were sat promptly.  I loved the energy in that main room.  We are fans of Minetta Tavern and have loved going there for the last 9 months since arriving in the city.  I think though we may have found our new favourite. The food was simple and delicious - the kind you would be happy to eat 2 or 3 times a week.  Lots of vegetarian options. Our service made us really feel at home and look after us super well.  Can't wait to go back.
