I really want to like this place - I go to all of Gabe's places and really love them. But something went wrong here and they're messing with the menu too much and trying to put twists on things that don't need them and frankly, are worse with them.  It reminds me of the Asian fusion craze of the late 90's.  Oysters were absolutely GREAT. Wine list - GREAT.  Service/Setting GREAT!  Burger - one of the WORST I've ever had in my life.  Lots of bread, saturated in butter, and very thick.
