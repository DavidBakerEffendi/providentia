I'm really into this place.  It is as down-to-earth and polite as service and food can get for a neighborhood bar, and the kitchen puts out consistent and delicious food.  In particular their "Hey Stud" sandwich is phenomenal!   Anybody who is going out for a low-key beer and sandwich should pop in to this place and get some tasty stuff.  I cannot stress enough how polite the bartenders and servers are.
