Let's face it, there's not many options for a $10 and under lunch/dinner in the Rittenhouse area. There's Cosi, McDonalds, Chipotle, Qdoba, and a few other pizza places. And now Shake Shack can be added to this list. The food here is good; it's average. When I come I usually get a burger and fries. I've also tried the milkshakes in the past. The burger is simple and is on the smaller side (compared to some of the other burger joints in the city). I actually like that it's simple and on the smaller side because I don't like finishing dinner feeling over-stuffed and filled with grease. The fries are normal/average and the milkshakes too. When I say that the food is average, I don't mean that in a negative way. Average is a good thing sometimes, it's reliable. It's what I expect when I pay $10 for a meal in Rittenhouse. I will come back again. I would give Shake Shack 3 stars alone based on the food but 4 stars because of the location/price.
