Of so many choices down that end of Market St, this was a terrific find.  I've been to higher end places down there, i.e. Cube de Libre, but for dinner.  I had a scrumptious lunch with menu choices - sure everyone has nachos, fries (Sto's are really good).  I really enjoyed the cream cheese balls - who would have thought cream cheese balls would be such a delight? Not me, but they were a huge hit with the side of sweet strawberry and a kick of spice!  Different and thoroughly enjoyed.  I wanted to take some for dessert.  At the wonderfully attentive waitress suggestion, we opted to split the huge "Stogie", its apparently their signature and original sandwich! Again huge and delicious. Its a variety of Italian(?) meats, fresh tomatoes and spring greens on a toasted flat bread with some kind of yummy sauciness I was enjoying on the huge bread leftover all by itself.  The prices were very reasonable for such big servings.  We also shared the, get this!, scrapple sticks with a side of the best cinnamon applesauce dipper ever!  Yes, I said scrapple! and Yes, I said Sticks.  I know, you think Philly and Scrapple definitely goes without saying, but sticks?  They were delicious as well and cooked to perfection, not at all mushy and stood up to the applesauce dipper great!  A wall of TVs did not distract from our eating pleasure.  The décor was minimal, but nicely so - I can so see this being a great place to go after work or a night in the city.  My friend (and sister, the beer connoisseur) had 2 different local beers (all their beers are local and all pint pours).  So I'll definitely be going back for that Stogie and apps (its going to be a new craving, lol) and maybe try another menu item - they all looked great - nice portions too.  We left full and satisfied and looking forward to the next time.
