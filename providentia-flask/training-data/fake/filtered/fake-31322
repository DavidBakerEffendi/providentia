What a disappointment.  Had lunch there with my almost 4 year old son.  The staff was as kind as can be but ... 1.   I knew I should worry when the table next to me was seated about 10 minutes after us and got their food first.  Took a long time for the food to come out.  That's usually fine so long as the food tastes good and is hot.  No luck there.  The hush puppies were luke warm.  My son's chicken fingers and french fries were cold.  How can fried food be cold? 2. A few minutes late, the brisket sandwich arrived ... cold and I told the server that it was cold (obvious if you just put your hand over it).  Told him the hush puppies were cold as well as my son's food.  He took back the hush puppies and the sandwich, but my son was hungry and he kept eating. 3. When I look at my son's plate, I realized we got the "tailings" of the french fries, the little odds and ends that are all crisped up with just a few real fries... for a kid's meal from the kid's menu?  Just not acceptable.  Anyone with kids will know and appreciate the fact that french fries is really the child's main course. 4.  I thought about not sending back the sandwich because I was afraid what would happen... and it happened.  It appeared they just microwaved the brisket and the brisket was really more cardboard than anything else, dry as can be with zero flavor. I am really disappointed to have to write this review.  I have gone to Bubby's for years, but just not recently.  No longer, off my list of neighborhood places.  Just plain sad.
