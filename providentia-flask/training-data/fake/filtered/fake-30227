Burgers from the Cheesecake Factory used to be my favorite until I tried GoldBurgers. Their Cheggy burger KILLS ME it's so good. Every time I visit my girlfriend in CT I have to eat a Cheggy. Out of the dozens of times I've been there I've only had one unpleasant visit where they barely cooked my fries, they were practically raw. I guess they were in a rush to serve me fries with no salt by speeding up the process. A little helpful hint, it's better to wait for good food then to receive crap food in 10 minutes.
