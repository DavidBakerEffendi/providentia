I f you love salt and your blood pressure is low, this is the place for you! Started with the little neck clams.They weren't rubbery but they were more like petite neck, all about the size of a quarter except for that one 50 cent size clam. I had a cheesesteak sandwich. I asked for it topped with sliced provolone cheese and it came with velveeta on top, salty runny velveeta. The bread was OK, but I didn't go there to eat bread. The waitress brought some fries to the table, smally skinny crinkle cut fries, comparable to the diameter of about 5 or 6 toothpicks and just as long. I couldn't smother the saltiness with ketchup or pepper. The beer was good. So if you want to have a beer and watch 35 televisions at once, this is the place for you.
