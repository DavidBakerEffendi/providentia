We went to a wedding there last week, and everything from the food to the service and staff were just great!  There was an abundance of appetizers, all so fresh and one was better than the next!  For our entrees, my husband had fillet mignon and I had salmon. Each were delicious and perfectly cooked. Would definitely recommend for a wedding or any type of party!
