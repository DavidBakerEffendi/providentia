This was my second visit to the restaurant. I agree with others who said that the atmosphere is attractive, that it can be noisy, that you should have reservations if you try to go on a Friday or Saturday night, that the waitstaff is attentive and that the menu is very creative. Some of the food is excellent, but some is less than desirable. I had the bib salad as a starter course. It was fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. The baked Alaska for dessert was amazing! The Peruvian chicken and beef stroganoff were both nicely prepared and solidly good, but not amazing. I had previously ordered the PEI mussels Asian style and enjoyed the tasty sauce. Tonight, my one of my dining companions order the same, and did not find the sauce to be delicious. I did not sample her dish, so I do not know if her opinion was based on a difference in taste, or if there was  a difference in preparation. However, the truffle mac & cheese with lobster was so salty that it was inedible. Everyone at the table tasted this item and agreed the dish was much too salty. The mac was also overcooked and too soft. We asked the waitress to tell the chef that the dish was oversalted. She apologized, but did nothing more. For a $22 entrée that is inedible, you would expect some reduction in cost or offer to replace the meal.
