Rude service.  I've been to Alta many, many times and tried everything on the menu (which is quite extensive) at least 3x.  I've never had a problem until today.  When I called to make a reservation for 3 people, I spoke to the most unpleasant host.  He spoke to me as if he was doing me some high and mighty favor by telling me that he had a spot at 10PM; when I said I would take it, and if it didn't work, I would call to cancel in the next 5 minutes, he snottily told me "No, no, no. We don't take provisional reservations".  Well excuuuuuse me.  What if I hadn't said anything and just taken it?  This s***head host wouldn't have known the difference and would have just taken my name, wouldn't he?  Well, he just ensured that someone who has brought dozens of people to Alta over the past five years will never do so again.   For an equivalent food experience (and none of the bs hassle), try ilili or Mercat.
