As far as diners go, you can't beat this place. I am stuck in Freehold on business. I stopped by last night on a whim on my way back to my hotel. Glad I did. Very clean, very quaint atmosphere. Super friendly staff. Unusually so for New Jersey from my visit thus far.  This place has some real history. 85 years in business at the same location.  Must be doing it right.  The food was awesome.  I had the meatloaf special.  3 or 4 slices of meatloaf covered in a real(not canned) mushroom gravy. You can tell they use fresh mushrooms. Green beans were also fresh from the garden vs canned stuff in most places. My meal came with a home made lintel soup that was amazing, Bread pudding, salad & a beverage for $12. Best diner I've been to in years. I'm going back again tonight and this time I'm bringing a friend. There isn't much in this little town but Hightstown Diner is worth the trip. p.s.  For those I see have posted bad things about the service, well, there is a new waitress there who was as sweet as they come. Her name escapes me but I do remember Becca. She is just as friendly and helpful.  I only remember her name because  that is also my Wife's name.
