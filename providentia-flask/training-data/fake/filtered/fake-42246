Just ate a Traif for the first time. WOW!  Amazing.  Just amazing.  Can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Had to wait 30-40 minutes to get a seat at the bar(didn't have a reservation on a Saturday night).  Well worth the wait, bartender was great with suggestions on drinks and food and, being able to watch all the dishes go by just made us want to go back and try everything else on the menu.  Well worth the trip out of the city.
