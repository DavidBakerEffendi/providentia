The Catfish and Pulled Pork sandwiches are no joke.  I can't get into details with textures and grains as some reviewers are doing, all I know is my mouth and stomach we're chilling. (and thats a good thing) The sandwiches aren't huge but the portions are perfect followed with a bottle of water (standard Poland Spring size). There's a line for a reason, there's been times when I couldn't get a sandwich due to them selling out. As a born and raised New Yorker I don't mind / don't notice the attitude everyone is talking about. What attitude? You want attitude? Go to Chinatown and don't be surprised when one of those waiters throws chopsticks at your face and leaves the bowl of noodles you ordered at the corner of the table.   You know what I'm talking about....
