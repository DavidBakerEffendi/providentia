Worst service that I ever received! 1) I was over charged for my pizza 2) I didn't get the online discount 3) I had to wait about an hour for the pizza 4) When I asked why my order was taking soo long I was verbally assulted (probably for making them look bad in front of customers) 4) My pizza was cold and greasy So zero stars! If I could...
