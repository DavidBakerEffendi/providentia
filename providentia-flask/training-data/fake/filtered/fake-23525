When we were first seated the server's cell phone started ringing.we didn't mind, people forget to put the on silent sometimes. However, at the end of our visit we overheard our server, Â Anthony, talking about us, after we tipped him 25%. We then heard him talking to his friend, both of which kept swearing. It was very unprofessional and we will not go back. The stale bread wasn't worth all of that.
