The best Chicken Cheese steak Evaaaa!!!  Went there at 10:30pm, FYI place is owned by Korean's they are really friendly and nice unlike other places.  It was my first time there and they take orders in the English native tongue unlike other place's told the gentlemen i wanted a chicken cheese steak with onions and wiz.  They make all there food fresh to order.  Also got an order of cheese fries. Wow this Sammy was fnnnnn awesome the gentlemen loaded it up with tons of cheese wiz both on my sammy and the fries.  I was in heaven guys. Dont miss out on this hidden gem, if you go to Jim's you'll enjoy the nasty tasteless wet cheese steaks and the putrid smell of a slaughterer house and the crazy stupid lines for there pill of crap on a bun yuccccckkkk... Go to Ishkabibbles, Great Food, Friendly staff, Your not just a number here guys, they hook you up with the good stuff lots of luven on there sammys. Also tried the cheese steak sammy with wiz on later date on sunday afternoon, it was good but my owners wife squeezed the wiz on my sammy and she didn't nearly put enough on it like her son hooked up but it was still good.. Also check out Johns pork roast and Joes steaks and sodas... Those are my fav's
