Was mortified when the manager came to our table looking for an extra $6 for an oversight on tip. We literally miscalculated by 3%, and he came over to our table and very rudely and loudly brought it to our attention. It was very embarrassing. So now for $6 they will lose 3 different couples repeat business. That is NOT how you do business with people. Will not be returning and will tell friends about the unappreciative manager/business. Â Then we gave an extra $20 for the oversight, and the guy never returned the $16 we were owed!
