Being that I'm a dog, I'm really not allowed to step one paw in this joint. But, my master says it's the cat's meow. He had the grilled cheese and man, I was drooling from the patio just watching him eat it. It was freaking massive! Like 5 different cheeses and this really thick toast! Of course, if I were in there, I would have ordered the mac & cheese with lobster. This lady that was sitting near the window had that and it looked better than a heaping bowl of Alpo! Apparently the beverage list is quite extensive to boot. But don't worry about me, I indulged in some high-quality toilet water upon arriving home.
