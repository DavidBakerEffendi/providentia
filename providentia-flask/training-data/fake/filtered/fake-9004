Can be hard to find, because there is no sign, except for a neon "psychic" marquee, and usually a woman sitting in the storefront window doing tarot in front a red curtain.  But walk on through the curtain and enter an extravagant bar and patio.  There's not really meals (think tapas), but the apetizers are exquisite.  The mixologists that own the bar take great pride in the selection of expensive cocktails, but I usually go for the scotch.  Pricey.
