The BEST cheeseburger I've EVER HAD!!! I went there once with my mom and the cheeseburger was was absolutely delicious!     I thought it had to be a fluke, so I went by myself about 2 weeks later. My server was Justin, he was as attentive and kind! No wait, food served promptly and again to my pleasant surprise, it was NOT a fluke!  The cheeseburger (medium rare) and french fries (well done), were again cooked to perfection!       I will be back often and I now have a new restaurant that makes me CRAVE their food!
