wonderful experience here at a specially themed prohibiition dinner.   A friend told us about it and thought we'd give it a try, and we were very happy we did.  The place  was papered over with a faux-prohibition notice in the window and a password to get in;  staff dressed in 1930s attire.  It made for a fun and different ambience, which set the tone for the delicious cocktails and food.  What made it still more enjoyable were the talks the chef made before each course, explaining the historical context for the dishes.  His enthusiasm for both his food and the history of it all was infectious, really enjoyed the evening immensely.  And the wonderful and well priced bottle of barolo only added to the experience.  Look forward to returning for another themed dinner -- they evidently have them once a month -- and also to try them for their regular menu.  Highly recommend.
