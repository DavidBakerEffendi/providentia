I live in New Haven and I'm happy that I found this restaurant which is sufficiently near New Haven. I tried some Korean-style Chinese dishes: jjajang-myon, jjam-bbong, tangsu-yuk, yang-jang-pi (here `'jj' means strong sound of `j' and `bb' means strong sound of `b'; I don't know how the names of these dishes are written in English in their menu). I liked their jjam-bong very much. I've been here only twice, and I'm wiling to visit more often, to try their Korean dishes. They also have sushi and others, but I don't think I'll try them there because the reason why I come here is for Korean food. They also have Korean alcohol; soju, mag-geol-li, baek-se-ju. I'd like to try them some day, because I can't get them in New Haven so easily. The place is pretty neat and bright (they recently renovated and changed the name of the restaurant), and it looked more like family atmosphere than being fancy side. People there are pretty friendly if you speak Korean. I don't know how they treat non-Korean speakers, but I'm sure they are nice people. Also, what I also like about this restaurant is their price. It is not ridiculously expensive as in some Korean restaurants in US. It's pretty affordable.
