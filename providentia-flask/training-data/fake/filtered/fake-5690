Went to a Flyers/Rangers game with next door nieghbor ("Bootie" Frank King") who as a teenager worked for Delasandros.  He llved right next door.  We stopped at Delasandros for a cheesesteak before the game and afterwards I got another one before I drove back to Levittown.  I'm tired of hearing about those other two steak places in south Philly.  Although I haven't been to Delasandros in quite a while I am planning on doing so.  The "best" cheesesteak bar none!
