Peruvian restaurant - rotisserie chicken, The menu is more or less the same as the other Pio Pios: A $38 Matador Combo (a whole well-marinated rotisserie chicken, rice and beans, tostones, avocado salad, and a giant pile of fries topped with sliced hot dogs) is enough food to feed a small Peruvian army. Ceviches are good but pricey.
