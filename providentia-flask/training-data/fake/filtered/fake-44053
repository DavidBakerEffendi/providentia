Best pizza in the city: Pier76 arugula pie (I include Otto, Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Joe's, John's, all the Rays, famous and otherwise). Also, their fried calamari is great (though the sauce could use more taste). The only reason it's 4 stars not 5 are the TVs along every possible eye-line. Makes sense in a sports bar, not a family or date restaurant, no matter how casual.
