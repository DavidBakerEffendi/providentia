I heard raves about the food so me and the girls decide our girls night out would be here.  After being told an hour's wait, we still decide it's worth it and we were ushered into the waiting area which is where the sangria bowls were.  As soon as we entered the room, I slid across the floor which was wet from spilled drink and who knows what else.  Before I could warn anyone walking in behind me a girl on crutches and her friends come in and she falls, landing on the leg that was in a cast.  I go to a guy who appears to work there and start to ask if he worked there and about the floor problem.  He tells me to tell the girl who is taking reservations.  I tell her and she says someone will fix it. 40 minutes later no one came to mop or "fix it" but I kept warning everyone coming in to walk slowly and carefully. Then we notice people getting seated who came in after us.  So I go up to the same guy and ask why folks are getting seated and why the floor wasn't done...that's when he says to me "you're a would be customer" and "we will get to it when we do".  Next thing I know the girl I told about the floor comes up to me and says the owner has asked me to leave.  I am stunned and said I would love to speak to the owner.  Well guess who it was..the same idiot I spoke to.  The girl kept telling me she is "passing the message along and I am asked to leave"!  Ridiculous.  Did I mention the girl on crutches leaves crying??  Cuban Petes may have good food which I will never know but they serious lack in customer service and didn't give a hoot about safety or cleanliness!  Unreal..such a disappointing experience.
