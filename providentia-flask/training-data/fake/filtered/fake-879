The food was great.. i had a iron bound burger and if i hadn't been full with the fries and smoothie i would have order desert. a little pricey but i didn't mind.. the smoothies are amazing. the wait staff was pretty cool they let my friends and i just hang out after we ate. I'm going back for sure..
