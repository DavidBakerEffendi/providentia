We have been going to Hawthorne's since its opening weekend and have been recommending it to others.  We live around the corner and go here about once a week for a casual beer after work, or to stop in for a mixed six pack while on a stroll with our 1 year old son.  The weekday staff is always friendly and helpful.  Food is hit or miss.  The sandwiches are unmemorable and usually dry.  The brunch fare is ok; the breakfast burrito was good the last time we had it.  The beer is overpriced, but the price is about the same as other single serve places in the city, so I cannot complain about that.   What I can complain about is the service (or lack thereof) we received this past weekend from the female owner of Hawthorne's who was seating patrons for brunch.  We tried to get a table with my wife and son and our stroller and asked for a high chair.  She curtly replied that she could give us one but we would have to park our stroller outside.  I said we did not want to leave it outside because someone might steal it.  She rolled her eyes at me and my wife and said "you really think someone is going to steal a stroller?"  (inner voice-Yes lady, this is Philadelphia, people will steal anything!)  To which I said, yes, someone will, or we could just leave?  Another eye roll and she ran off to her husband behind the counter (the other owner).  We put our coats on and left without even sitting down.  We saw one of the weekday waitresses on our way out and complained to her about the situation and she apologized.  The female owner is rarely there.  If she was, she would have recognized that we support her establishment on a weekly basis. It is a shame that we had so many nice experiences at Hawthorne's, yet it is this one terrible customer service experience (and from the owner no less!) that forever changes my opinion of this place and makes me post a review on Yelp.  We will no longer patronize Hawthorne's.
