Nauna's is one of Montclair's better Italian restaurants. They have two different dining areas. One of the dining rooms is formal, with a full dinner menu including entree's, pasta, salads, etc. The front dining room, where they serve Pizza is much more casual, and there are usually many families in this room. It makes for a nice mix of family friendly and formal dinner service in the same restaurant. The place is always packed, the dinner side has nice pastas, entrees, salads, and soups. The service was friendly, but not great, but at least it was friendly.  The pizza crust is a little thicker than I prefer, but it is still good.  One of the best features of Nauna's is the private parking lot, which is a rarity in Montclair.
