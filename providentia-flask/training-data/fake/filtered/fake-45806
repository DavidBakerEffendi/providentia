First time at the restaurant, and definitely pleased. We had great service in the dining room (although we did go on a Monday night). The food was amazing. The clam chowder was deliciously smoky and full of clams, and the cold sampler was very nice (although raw shellfish is not my cup of tea). I had the fluke, which just melted in your mouth, and the tarragon spaetzle/brussel sprouts was very tasty. My husband had the fish of the day- Nantucket Bay scallops, which were the sweetest scallops I've ever had, and all of the seafood was so fresh. We also shared the Hot Fudge to the MAX, and were pleased we saved room, because it was a great ending to our dinner. The almonds/bananas make it.
