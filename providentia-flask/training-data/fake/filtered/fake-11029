Absolutely fantastic meal! The rice bowls are delicious and the service was wonderful. The restaurant is geared towards smaller parties, but i went with a party of 4 and the wait was not long whatsoever. I am really impressed with the food coming from San Francisco, home of many great Yakitori places. I would highly recommend to any one looking for good quality, great tasting good. The atmosphere is great and the service was good!
