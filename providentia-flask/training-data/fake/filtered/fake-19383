PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOU MONEY!! It is a clean place But food -- No good. 1. they intentionally over price their regular dishes and lead you into all you can eat. 2. Small portion. I never had a sushi is that tiny. They cut it in small "cube".  Obviously, they use loose piece "sushi" fish from vendor for all you can eat. 3. Rice, totally not unacceptable for sushi. Quality is not there. Too much water while cooking their rice. 4. Service:  Waitress is nice. Waiter: he got a long way to go. OVERALL, don't waste your time and money. You can have better option around this area.
