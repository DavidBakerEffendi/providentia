Hawthornes is a nice casual place that is a great addition to the neighborhood. The food is good, sometimes better than good, but if you really want fine cuisine, best to look elsewhere. The beer selection is terrific, either to drink in or take home. Also, and I didn't see this point in the other reviews, this place is VERY kid friendly. The staff is nice about children and helpful with the key details (yes, I really need a 2nd high chair for a nearly 6 year old because otherwise she's too jealous of her sister), and the space is uncrowded so there are no issues if a little one wants to wander around a bit. So - drop by and enjoy it.
