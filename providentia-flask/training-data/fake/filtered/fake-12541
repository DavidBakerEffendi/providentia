It's not just about the quality of the coffee, or the pastries, but rather the attitude of the people who serve you that makes the difference. There have been several instances when I came in with a negative attitude due to the cold weather, waking up too early, or just not being in a good mood; and left with a happy vibe because of the positive attitude that the workers have which naturally rubs off on you. I would definitely urge people to check this place out! Not to mention the coffee is great.
