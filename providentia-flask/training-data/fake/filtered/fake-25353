not worth HALF of the price. I have been here before and understood there is usually a wait however last week it was a bit extreme. The hostess asked if my whole party was here - yes 4 ppl, and then said okay 20 minutes max 40. We ended up waiting 1 hour. I kept telling my friends the food was worth it but they just kept looking at Jaques across the street hoping i would stop being so persistent. FInally the wait was over and we were crammed into a tiny space where peoples asses were in our faces while we were trying to eat and have a good time. When the waitress came to place our table settings she gave us each a napkin in front of us Â and then threw the forks and knives onto the middle of the table. For the tiny table that it was this action seemed SO harsh and barbarian. Reminded me of what my mom would do when i was 8 years old and she was busy with other things, except with a spoon, never knives or forks. The food i kept raving about, in the end did not match my expectations, and failed to justify the wait. To add insult to injury the bill was heinous. To wait an hour for food, get terrible service, and feel rushed out with a crowd of ppl in this tiny restaurant all mashing their asses near our food was just a gross experience. In the end we all had to laugh that i am so terrible at picking restaurants and that i was never allowed to choose a place again. Oh and the drinks were weak. I had been here before and remembered the drinks being good but that was a huge contrast from before to now. My friend told something to the waitress about it possibly being made stronger and she said "its a standard recipe" Well the recipe sucks Cafe Habana. - and never will i be foolish enough to return. On top of all this in house disgrace, when i got home i threw up and i believe i got food poisoning from this place.
