Great friend chicken! Williamsburg tends to have a lot of places that "claim" their fried chicken is the best but then it's disappointing. But this place is genuinely got the real deal. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the biscuit was cold. Buttery and cold isn't my thing. I see that other people have said this before. Overall, Pies & Thighs was good on service, food and decor. If you like fried chicken, go eat there.
