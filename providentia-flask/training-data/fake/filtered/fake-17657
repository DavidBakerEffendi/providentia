This place which I had high hopes for really really disappointed me ,A wood fired pizza  restaurant should be serving a pizza from a VERY HOT WOOD FIRED OVEN GIVING THE WOOD taste to the pizza ,this places falls so short its pathetic.The pizza was delivered very soft ( not a wood fired pizza style at all)A true wood fired pizza is crispy thin a little burnt around the edges and underneath as well not this one it could of come out of your toaster oven .It was so under cooked and I saw it was far from the only one like that .I sat directly in front of the two ovens and saw numerous pizzas being returned to be cooked more!.The "kids" cooking the pizzas don't have a clue and should be moved to the back of the kitchen. I did complain and in all honesty the server was great and said he would be right back and he said they would not recook the pizza but would make us a new one to take home and it would be cooked correctly this time (free of course)He did what he said it was cooked more than the first one no question and we took it home.It was ok but certainly far from good  they are doing lots wrong here.Go get a wood fired pizza at the flat bread pizza restaurant in burlington ,its thin (which is key in cooking it quickly in a very hot wood fired oven)Its crust is super thin slightly charred in places making it a true wood fired pizza with the wood taste.I will never ever go back to this place again it was just a pitiful pizza one of the worst I have ever had ever mind the $20 price tag,Oh yea the selection of beers were absolutely fine ,no complaints there.the waiter was great (I wish he would of been cooking the pizza not the kid)This was a saturday night it was busy but the server was great but I did go there for the "wood fired pizza" that is where this place fails miserably . I will  not return
