Are they watering their drinks? I had two martinis (at $14 apiece) which usually puts me in a good place but at the Odeon, nada which leads me to conclude that they are either watering down the drinks or putting bottom shelf booze in premium bottles to fool the customer. Â Next time, I'll head to the Racoon Lodge for a well-poured drink.
