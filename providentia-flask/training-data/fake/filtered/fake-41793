If you are looking for great Latin/Caribbean food then you MUST go here. It is a great place to have a party as well, as long as you call ahead and talk to the owner (who is also the Chef). They will treat you like family and make sure that you leave satisfied and with leftovers. I live in upper Manhattan but have found myself making trips over the  bridge and through the woods to eat at Cintander.  The area is still developing but once you walk inside the restaurant you feel as if you are in a different place.  The owner mentioned having live music soon!
