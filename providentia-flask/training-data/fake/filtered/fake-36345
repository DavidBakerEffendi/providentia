One of the very best Italian restaurants in New York. It's not classic though - the atmosphere is a little "clean," not super warm and friendly, and the portions are not what you'd typically find in a standard Italian place in the US. Not that they're too small, just that we're usually used to getting so much food you either have to take half home, or be rolled out. The pasta though is fantastic, the desserts are delicious, and the entrees well prepared. Not the place to go for your moms spaghetti and meatballs, but you can have an excellent meal here, and have your eyes opened as to how Italian food can be when prepared in the right hands.
