One of my favorite restaurants in the city. I have dined a number of times in the dining room but Â I love going to the tavern area for lunch. The service is always top notch and on weekends, they offer an off the menu burger as well as a house made sandwich. Both the beers on tap and the wines by the glass change frequently so there is always something new to try. They also have the best ice cream that I ever tasted. You must try a scoop of the butter pecan.
