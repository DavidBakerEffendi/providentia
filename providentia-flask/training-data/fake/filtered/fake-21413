I love this restuarant.  I've tried several Indian restaurants around Princeton, some more than once, and I keep coming back to Tandoori Bite.  I've had dinner there 4-5 times and lunch a couple of times.  Attentive service, intimate atmosphere, but the best is the food of course.  Love their lamb dishes, garlic naan, have tried some of the Tandoori and some of the curries.  I recommend the lamb kabob appetizer (it's lamb chunks - the lamb kabob dinner is ground lamb and I prefer the chunks).  Very tasty!
