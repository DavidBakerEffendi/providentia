Palazzo Restaurant was an amazing experience for my family during our first visit - food was fresh, presented beautifully and just like a NYC 4-star restaurant at a fraction of the price. Then, we went during the week, with my toddler daughter when there were few in the restaurant, and they had a beautiful mini-plate for her of rice, salmon and sweet peas. My little one ate everything with her fingers and then asked for more! And more recently, at Thanksgiving, we pre-ordered and picked up our meal mid-day. It was brought out to the car on a snowy day, and the presentation was so perfect, and my daughter had her first taste of stuffing, and she asked for more. Palazzo is now my go-to restaurant since we moved to Montclair and I love the amazing energy of Chef John and his team. This is a must visit with a nice atmosphere and discreet staff who ensure that you are not rushed through your meal, yet they remain attentive during the meal. Five stars, and a gem!
