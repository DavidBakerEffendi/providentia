Strolling through Old City with my wife, the morning after we were married, we came upon Panini's. We just wanted to go somewhere relaxing and go somewhere that had outdoor seating so we could take in the more beautiful than usual November morning. Having a few lattes and being Very European, in other words. Their Sunday brunch comes with complementary mimomas or bloody marys and we highly recommend you try it. The service is timely and fantastic and we took a look at their regular menu and would definitely come back for more than coffee. Not only that, but my wife casually dropped that we'd just been married and our server brought us a canole - on the house. Even the bus-people are friendly here. We highly recommend Panini's for a quaint Sunday brunch in the fall morning sun.
