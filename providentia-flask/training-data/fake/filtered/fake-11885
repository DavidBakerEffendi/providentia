came here after the News station showed it. Well, I guess i should have known better. First the staff was friendly and helpful. Restaurant was clean and very nice. Definitely a place you can bring a date. Now, for the food, it was mediocre at best. I had the all you can eat pasta. In fact I would say it is not much better than school lunch or Olive Garden. Ravioli was ok, penne was bland and the other one was so forgetful I forgot what it was. Now, maybe their regular dinner menu is better, but if they make pasta that taste like that, I dont really know how they can make any of the other dishes better. The 2 stars were basically for service and decor. There are way better Italian for the same price around the neighborhood. Won't be going back.
