We ordered wraps over the phone for the Ohio State Women's Rowing Team and not only did Ammel staff his establishment on Sunday (normally closed) to make the sandwiches, but he delivered them to Mercer Lake to us all individually packaged and with a big bag of gel packs. AND the wraps were yummy! Thank you so much to you Ammel and your staff. We all appreciated it.
