Unfortunately zero stars is not an option. After not eating here for 10 years because of a badly prepared meal I decided to try only because I got a coupon for $25 off from a website through my company. Immediately I was turned off by the angry owner yelling over her shoulder that they don't take coupons, then she proceeded to yell "we don't take credit cards either, cash only".   Now embarrassed, we sit and when my shrimp francaise was brought to the table it was sitting in a pool of francaise broth about 3/4" deep.  THE EXACT REASON OF THE BADLY PREPARED meal 10 years previous. The shrimp was unrecognizable as shrimp it was a soggy mess and the pool of broth was sour.   The kicker was when the bill came because I was charged $29. I won't comment on the length of time it took to be served as I can understands she prepares it herself, but as I was sitting there I had bad memories of years ago when we waited well over an hour to be served. The decor is horrendous but I guess that she may be trying for a quirky atmosphere, which would be ok, IF the food was acceptable. In business since 1975?, it may be time to hang up the apron.
