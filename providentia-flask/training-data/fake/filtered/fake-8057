I've been coming to big Wong for over 10 years now. The food is great, the service is fast (usually), and the prices are very cheap. Almost everything on their menu is great - for some reason I just can never appreciate their dumplings. I don't know if its the dumpling itself or the sauce they put on top of it. Their Chinese broccoli also tastes a bit funky, I think they cook it in oil to give it a crunch but it doesnt work well. Sometimes the staff is rude and ill tip them 10% when its horrible and they'll actually make a big stink with you if you don't "double the tax" as a tip. If anyone's ever done this, I'm sure you've had one of ten chase you down and complain about the tip!
