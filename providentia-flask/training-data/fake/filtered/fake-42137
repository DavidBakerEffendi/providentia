I've rarely met a slice of pizza I didn't like, but there's pizza and then there's PIZZA! Luzzo's pizza is slap-your-grandmother good! I especially like the "Tartufata" which is a simple pie with mozzarella, truffle pate and basil. So, so good! I'd rave on some more, but I'm drooling onto my keyboard. Run, don't walk to Luzzo. And hoist a slice for me!
