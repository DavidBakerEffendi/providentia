I came to this place because I tried before and I liked it. However the service yesterday was terrible. So much SMOKE that my eyes were watering and many customers left! And no pico (did they tell me there is no pico, before I ordered? NO. Did they charge me less, because there was no pico? NO). I went to reliable Chipotle 3 stores down to get my pico.
