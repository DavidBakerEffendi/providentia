Stopped into Ofrenda for drinks and appetizers last week -- and it was fantastic! Super cool, cozy new neighborhood joint that's perfect for a date. The atmosphere was great, the staff was really friendly and the cocktails were amazing! I'd recommend the jalapeno margarita to anybody -- not too spicy, not too sweet. And the goat cheese dip was delicious. Nice addition to the neighborhood -- not overly sceney, but very cool, eclectic and fun.
