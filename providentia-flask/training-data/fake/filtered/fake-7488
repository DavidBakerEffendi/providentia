Located in my favorite neighborhood, this place amazed me from the moment i walked into it. It looked smaller than it really was, the first thing that came into view was the bar scene which is basically what I was looking for, me and My friends have been wanting to come to this restaurant for a while, this time we just stayed at the bar and let me tell you , THE BEST MARGARITA YOU'LL EVER HAVE IN NYC, or at least that's what my friends and I thought. The bartenders we really cool, the staff very friendly, the atmosphere superb and the decoration simple and astonishing at the same time.
