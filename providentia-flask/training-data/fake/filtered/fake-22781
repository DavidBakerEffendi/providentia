In Hartford for a conference and ran a cross this place on a Sunday evening.  I eat a fair amount of Thai food, and am familiar with typical American Thai.  I wanted something simple, so I ordered the coconut fried rice, and was not disappointed.  It tasted fresh and light.  The veggies (peas, carrots, onions) were not over cooked or dry, and the rice was not heavy as sometimes Americanized fried rice is.  The shrimp was small but tasted fresh.  I ordered medium spicy but it was very mild.   Service was fast and accommodating, but there were only 5 or 6 customers.  Price was very reasonable for the amount and quality of the food
