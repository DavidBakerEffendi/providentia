This place is huge and romanticaly colorful. Specially when you eat their Lasagna and salad most of my favorite, worth it place and services. although you will wait for the orders to serve and its worthly enough because of the surroundings Nice for a group of friends and even romantic date with your love ones. Great and perfect place to take your relaxing mode. Your eyes will never get tired while watching those waiters refillings empty glasses in every table. Most of all my very enjoyable part when im looking at there tables mostly have this what we called "cheesecake", Honestly speaking I dont like cheese its makes me vomit. But over all the food here are delicious and worth it.
