A hole in the wall that is almost too small, a guy named Rocco and the best tasting sausages in the world.  I love it.  I love the hole in the wall eating experience, it just feels so visceral, so alive and not to mention their sausage is bursting flavor in your mouth, literally the best sausage I have ever had.
