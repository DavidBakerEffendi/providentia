We had been here before and it was good. Last night was New Year's Eve and we made reservations for 730 pm. When we arrived there were lots of people. We put our name down and we were told it will be 20 minute wait. An hour went by and we went to find out what was going on and when we went to hostess desk we were told it will be a while. We come to find out that in talking to people they were there since 630 and still not seated as of 830. We all went to talk to the manager who had no idea what to say or do. They did not offer any apologies or drinks or snacks. The manager ran into the back and started serving food to tables and pushing dirty dish carts. He left the front hostess stand and disappeared. We finally left after waiting more then one and half hours and will never return.
