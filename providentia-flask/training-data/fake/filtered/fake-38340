While I went with high hopes after reading all of the reviews, Ah'Pizz finished as just an average place.  The decor is amazing, and the brick-oven pizza a Show Stopper when you walk in, but unfortunately the pizza -- the food -- didn't match up with everything else.   In fairness, we went on a slow night (before the Super Bowl), and we only the Margherita pizza (needs to be good, right?)...but the sauce wasn't much, the cheese was only ok, and the crust wasn't as crispy or as flavorful as you expect from brick oven.  The promote the 90-sec pie, but is that really enough time to infuse the flavors together? I'm willing to give it another try, and I do temper my review with the very high expectations I had going in.   I just hope this was an off night.
