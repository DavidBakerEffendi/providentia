I thought Ootoya was cool the first 2 times, but today it turned out to be very disappointing. I went there for dinner and ordered a glass of sake. It was served in a tiny glass which barely holds 2 oz, and they charged $15 for this! This is definitely NOT that kind of fancy restaurant. Their food is reasonably good.
