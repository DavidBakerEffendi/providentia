Not enjoyable...ordered for delivery Malai Kofta and Palak Paneer along with bread basket.  Bread tasty but very greasy.  Kofta was super spicy, no nuts seen and only 4 small balls in very soupy mixture.  Paneer not so tasty, in my opinion very odd.  The rice provided wasn't fully cooked and was crunchy with a few small peas and a carrot.  Do not know what that was, not the basmati rice to which I am accustomed.
