Needs some tweaks since the reno.....  Great food....  great wait staff.  Time it takes to get food on the table... A REAL PROBLEM!!  Although everyone seems to hustle, there is a serious problem coming from the kitchen.  They clearly don't have a system to account for their increased seating capacity.  Assumed it would shake out after the bumpy start.....  but it hasn't.  It seems they just can't figure it out. One example... If after dining, you ask for something from the deli to take home....  they put your order behind every other food order in the restaurant!  Took us 15-20 minutes to get a half pound of turkey.  Really?  No one simply dedicated to the deli? Hope they figure it out.  If they don't get a better system in place, they will lose some long standing... but very frustrated.... customers.
