I hate to give Westville a bad review.  I wanted to like it so much and did - until I got food poisoning from their veggie burger in May (I eat at home generally so there was no doubt where the food poisoning came from).  I recently moved to the neighborhood so I was super psyched that this very trendy and healthy restaurant was just steps away from my new apartment.  I checked it off as my go to spot when friends and family were in the area.  However, after the food poisoning, I didn't go back for months ... until today.  I finally ventured back with a friend and found a GRUB in my Kale side (a green worm!). This means that they do not clean their food properly (wash away bacteria and bugs).  I loved this restaurant but they are not cleaning their food!!  Why?!  I hope that they change their ways but they have unfortunately lost a regular customer permanently because of their oversights.  :(
