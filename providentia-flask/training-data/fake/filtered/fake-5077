The first thing I noticed when I came into this restaurant on a Friday night was that the place was packed, and ALL the customers (except for my sister and I) were Indian. I took this as a very good sign: this place is probably pretty authentic, and the food would probably be delicious. I was right. We ordered a Spinach Masala dosa, a Gobi 65 (spicy fried cauliflower) Â and a "Mini Meal" thali. The dosa, filled with creamy spinach and potatoes, was delicious and extremely satisfying. The thali was like a clock: a pot of rice in the middle, surrounded by small dishes at all the hours. The dishes gave a very good sample of what the restaurant has to offer, ranging from the mild to the very spicy, and it even included dessert. (It changes every day, but that day it was a delicious, cardamom-scented carrot halwa.) I'd recommend sharing the thali with a friend, as it really is a lot of food. Overall, I was EXTREMELY satisfied and went back again the next week (it was equally good). I'm so glad that there's finally a delicious, authentic Indian restaurant in the area -- and it's vegetarian to boot!
