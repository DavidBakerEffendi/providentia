I'd give this restaurant 4.25  We came for New Year's Day Brunch, which was great because the restaurant had a comfortable number of patrons, but wasn't too busy.  We took our time and didn't feel rushed.  My guests were each discerning Greeks, who prioritize the quality of the food they eat as among the most important aspects of everyday life.  The feedback was consistent: great quality for Astoria, unique meals, and amazing octopus (probably the best item on the menu).  The hangar steak and bulgur salad (latter not on the brunch menu but we asked for it, and we were happily accommodated) got high marks as well.  Great wine, cocktails, sangria and craft beer menu.  Finally on the positives, ambiance was terrific. Go with a bigger group if you can. One negative was that we all agreed the food needed less salt.  We felt the effects afterwards and needed a lot of water.  This prevents us from coming often due to general health consciousness, but if this changed, MP would probably be our go to Astoria spot. Another negative was the dumpling dish. Dumplings are a uniquely shared dish in cultures across Asia and Europe. Greeks have their versions in dolmadakia and lahanodolmades, and those Greeks from Asia Minor or near strong Turkish influence made manti, which is more of a meat filled dough dumpling.  Some unique twist to these common and delicious dishes, with strong flavor characteristics would have been awesome. I couldn't understand the mish mash of ingredients in this dish to the point that I couldn't finish it. Overall, nice place. Hope the evolution from here is positive and am looking forward to returning.
