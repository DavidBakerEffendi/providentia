I love it here. One time My sister mother and I walked in with 8 yes 8 kids without reservation and they were packed!!!! But the owner as sweet as he is kept apologizing and assuring us he would get us seated soon brought us a free plate of spring roll appetizers to hold us and the kids over! how nice!. He reconized us because we go in there often. Not that often but often enough to be a familiar face to him. They are a bit eager sometimes it feels like they are watching you to get empty plates off the table or refll tea or water but still very nice.
