The food was great! Be sure to call ahead. It was a party of three and we had to wait 45 minutes. The Kimchi was yummy. I had the spicy tofu soup and a spicy octopus dish. Â This is some of the best tofu I have ever had. It was busy so it was noisy (not a big deal just hard to talk).My biggest complaint was that our waitress was not fully on top of it otherwise I would have given this place a five star rating. I would go back and I highly recommend this place to anyone.
