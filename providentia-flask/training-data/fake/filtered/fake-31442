PF Market is a great place to eat. I have been there on several occasions and each and every time I walk away happy. For starters, the environment is very friendly. The servers are happy and helpful and always full of great recommendations. The downstairs is more of a friendly atmosphere, while upstairs tends to be more intimate. The food has always surpassed my expectations. I would recommend the lobster bisque if you like lobster. I swear there is a full lobster in every bowl! My favorite meal is the seafood medley, but if you are looking for something lighter the lobster roll is also very good. I also always manage to save room for dessert!
