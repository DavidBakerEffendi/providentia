One of my absolute favorite places in NYC.  The food is amazing and unique to nearly any other restaurant.  My favorites are the pork buns, the shrimp, and the modern ramen noodles.  They also have a great sake list, which isnt too expensive.  The only issue is because there are no phone reservations the wait can be 2 hours!!!!
