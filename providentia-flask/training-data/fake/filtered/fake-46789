FRIENDLY! DELICIOUs! Two words that describe Yoan's. I have had Chinese food at so many places in the area and I have to say I had Yoan's for the first time just the other day and I was shocked how great fresh and flavorful the food was. The bonesless spare ribs well done are honestly the best I have ever had. The chicken and brocolli was fresh and not greasy. The staff was so friendly and thankful for the business!! Definitely go to this ordinary looking chinese restaurant for an unforgettable great priced meal!
