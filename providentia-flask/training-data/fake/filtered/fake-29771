My daughter took me to Ellary's Greens for brunch on Mother's Day.  We appreciated how clean, and attractive it was; that the owner was present and attentive to details , and that she genuinely cared about her customers.  We happened to be seated at the counter and liked watching the preparation of the health drinks and enjoyed the fragrances so much, that we decided to try a " sunshine" juice , which was really good.    We ordered the Mediterranean omelet which was served with a side of greens and the open faced smoked salmon sandwich.  Both were delicious. We continued with desserts  -- a chocolate mousse made from avocados and a chocolate strawberry  shortcake.  Again delicious .  It was wonderful having great tasting food that is good for you.   We're definitely returning!
