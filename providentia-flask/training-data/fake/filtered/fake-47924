I'm actually pretty surprised Kelly's didn't have better reviews!! The food was awesome and the manager was so friendly and helpful! She even let us keep our bags in a back room while we took a day tour of new haven. My family and I were in new haven for the day and parked in Temple street garage so Kelly's was our first choice since it was right there. We liked what we saw on the menu and decided to try it. We had the butternut squash risotto, brie cheese appetizer, and I had the sesame seared Ahi tuna. We also ordered an extra serving of the Yuca fries. Everything was amazing! Â The price was reasonable as well. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone!
