This place is SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD!!!! I had the coop platter- to die for, sampled my friend's fried chicken with pancakes-will be ordering that when I return next weekend. Had the biscuits with sugar and maple butter...indescribably delicious. The wait time was about 45 minutes, but so very much worth it. Friendly and knowledgeable staff. Couldn't ask for anything more.
