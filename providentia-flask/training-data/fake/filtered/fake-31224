Made reservations and came here on a Saturday night for a birthday dinner. We arrived and no one approached our table for 20 minutes. I told a worker we wanted to order cocktails and he said he would grab our server. The server finally came over 25 minutes later. He never introduced himself and was not friendly at all. He kept rolling his eyes and trying walk away as we were ordering. He got offended when we ordered everything at once, because we knew it would take forever to get it. Except for this long- haired server, we had a good time. The food was excellent. But I will not go back to Adriennes.
