Ten Stone is one of the BEST places in the city. It has a great beer selection, it can be a little noisy but sitting outside solves that. The ham and cheese on a pretzel is the BEST SANDWICH I've ever had in my life, the honey mustard is to die for. I've even asked for the recipe, it's a secret. Pretty much everything I've had there is amazing, the flank steak sandwich, cheese fondue (very big so share with a lot of people) and the staff is very friendly. Its always busy which says something about a place and the staff hasn't changed for the few years I've been going which is also a great sign. I consistently choose Ten Stone over many other Philly restaurants I LOVE IT.
