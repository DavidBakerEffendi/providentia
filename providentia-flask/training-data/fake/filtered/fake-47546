Quite honestly, I find the place overrated. The pizza has a level of "fanciness" that you don't find everywhere, it's certainly made well, but nothing about it really blew me away. I love classic Brooklyn pizza, the simplicity of it, and when made with some really excellent mozzarella, the basic pie you get from a shop on the corner can't be beat. You can probably find a place within walking distance of Grimaldi's that makes a perfect Brooklyn pie without all the hype and long lines.
