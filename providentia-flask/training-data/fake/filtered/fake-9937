Never Again, Stopped here for Beers before meeting some friends at Tengda. I used to be a huge fan of this place until our last visit. We waited way too long just to get 2 beers, and the reason why, the wannabe Jersey Shore douche bartender was too busy taking shots with two trashy women. And management don't you worry, none of these shots were paid for. On top of this, we couldn't even get to the bar because there was a 6 year old sitting there with his mother (Illegal in CT.) Â And the icing on the cake, this child got to watch the bartender take multiple shots as he was fortunate enough to be sitting next to the to trashy women. Management needs to wake the hell up in this place.
