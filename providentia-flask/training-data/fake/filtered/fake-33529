Once inside you are transformed to a magical drinks world wear all the fancy drinks sound impossible but you still cannot make a decision on which one to have!!!! .  Sat and sun- They have 2 hour unlimited mimosas & sangria  and it  was divine' also had the Frittata and the South American Tamal, were amazing !! A very large selection on the menu!!! Great food , & A great service !!!! Such a great spot !!! Totally recommend !!
