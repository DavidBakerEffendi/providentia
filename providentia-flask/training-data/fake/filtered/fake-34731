This was my favorite Astoria restuarant when I lived in the neighborhood.  They renovated the space a few years ago but, luckily they did not make too many changes to the menu.  They offer a wide variety of items and everything I have tried was wonderful.  The mushroom risotto is amazing.  The grilled vegatable sandwiches are great.  The squash ravioli is good as an appetizer or main entree.  They also how a large selection of wine.  I still eat at Sanford's even though I no longer live in the neighborhood.
