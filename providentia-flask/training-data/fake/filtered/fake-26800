I got food poisoning from here. Enough said really. I remember the food tasting okay when I ate it but not that great. Didn't taste so good but i had a craving for a burrito (should have gone to Taco Bell :( Crappy burritos that claim they are bringing "West Coast" Style burritos to NYC.  We'll, I've lived in SF and this still doesn't fit the bill. Do yourself a favor and don't go here. Food is dry, salsa is no good, guacamole is that crappy tubed kind, tortillas are stale. Just nothing about this place is good. The lines are unnecessarily long.  Price is average. The owner was there when I complained to him about the bad service, he made a derogatory comment about his Hispanic staff...UNACCEPTABLE! I don't know why I'm continuing to tell you about this place, it sucks and you're not going to come here!
