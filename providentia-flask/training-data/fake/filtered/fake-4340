i adore this place. Classy and friendly. Upscale, but relaxed. The Tartine d'Ancoiade was stunning. The brandade tasty....but it was the rabbit (bone in) cooked in mustard with boiled potatoes that really charmed me. The boys behind the bar are great. The maps on the wall indicating the location of the wines is such a cool idea. Please go to this place. 5 BIG STARS
