Food is OK, but service is terrible. The guy at the register didn't even say hello to me when I walked up to the counter. I gave him my order and he just stared at me. I had to tell him I was done with my order. Rude, young, and very inexperienced children work there. I have never seen anyone over 21 work there. An adult manager should always be on hand showing these kids how to work in customer service.
