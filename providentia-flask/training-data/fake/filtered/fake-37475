Joju is absolutely AMAZINGGG. reasons why: 1. The people there are always polite and friendly. They take the time to greet customers and make you feel very welcome. 2. Their sandwiches are deeeelicious. My favorite is Lemongrass chicken (#2) . The bread is always toasted nicely and all the times I've gotten it, it never failed for a yummy meal. Favorite drink: Jasmine Green tea with milk and tapioca. Their tapioca has a different taste to it, it doesn't taste bland but rather sweet with a hint of green tea. Definitely try it! 3. Its soooooo clean! The tables, chairs, FOOD, and even the bathroom!
