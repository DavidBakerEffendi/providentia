I have lived in California, Texas, Louisiana, and all other parts of the country and am from Florida.  I have enjoyed Tex-Mex in many places and this is NOT authentic Tex-Mex.  Everyone raved about Jose Tejas, said it was THE place when I first moved to NJ.  I tried it more than once, I believe in giving a second chance on an off day.  It did no good.  The food is not good and their version of anything Tex-Mex would make a real Tex-Mex restaurant blanch.  I found a much better place just up the road in Rahway but it is only Mexican, authentic Mexican, food.  No wait, very hole in the wall, and 5 star.  I just wish I could remember the name after having been gone 2 years.
