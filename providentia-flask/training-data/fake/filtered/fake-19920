I love this place on a Sunday afternoon the quintessential Irish pub a pint of Smith-wicks some bar food a relaxing atmosphere to chat with your mates no god forsaken TV in sight a decent pub without the glitz something in this town getting harder and harder to find...try it if it disappoints you then it simply wasn't meant to be!
