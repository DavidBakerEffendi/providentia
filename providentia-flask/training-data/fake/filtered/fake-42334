SO SO worth it to make the trek into the heart of Chinatown, outside of the touristy Chinatown, to eat here.  The pork dumplings are amazing and the sesame pancake with anything in it is incredible.  I had mine with egg which comes with cilantro and carrots.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  My husband and I walked to the Brooklyn Bridge and ate our dinner in the middle of the bridge with a view of the city. Perfect!
