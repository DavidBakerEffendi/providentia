refering to michael m's posting about having a reservation at 8:30 and  being told it would be another 20 minutes  until they would be seated  is straight up malarkey. i live in the neighborhodd and have frequented the restaurant a few times. the place does not accept reservations, i know frirst hand, i tried to make them myself over the phone when they first opened and was told  by the hostess that they only accept walk-ins. i'm sure if  the restaurant did take your resrvation it  would probably be because you were a friend of either the chef, owner or someone who worked there. i'm sorry but your review sounds malicious and are trying to bash the place intenionally. listen, the place has it's issues just like any new restaurant that 's been open a few weeeks and is as busy as they are. but your posting sounds like a straight up fib, especially while your also trying to personally attack the chef for making the rounds in the dining room. stick to real purposeful and insightful reviews not personal attacks my man.
