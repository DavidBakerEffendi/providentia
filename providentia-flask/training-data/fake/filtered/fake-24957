Went last night for dinner with a wonderful girlfriend for a long awaited girl's night out. Thought about going to Wayne Steak House, boy am I glad she chose this location. Am a chef myself, so not easily impressed. This time I was so much so that I had to call upon arriving home to thank the manager, Steve, who was not present when we departed. Let's start with the pre dinner cocktail - I had a lightly dirty martini with fabulous blue cheese stuffed olives - top notch. Started with a Caesar salad with a dressing that was perfectly balanced & QUAIL eggs - delicious! Next, their "Cowboy" Steak - cooked to perfection with wonderful whipped potatoes with creme fraiche. Friend had same, loved it as well. Dessert was the yummy banana cream pie (black bottomed) & homemade chocolate gelato. Only drawback the creamed spinach - lost it's integrity by being overchopped. We lingered for quite some time, arriving at about 6:45, leaving around 10. Our server, Adam, while quite attentive & personable, made us extremely comfortable & never feeling rushed. Felt so good about his service we told him next time we will call in advance to make sure he's there.The ambiance was great as well. Cozy, warm, although they were rather busy, we were very well taken care of & were able to hold conversation with no noise interferance. Bravo to these place - a wonderful evening all around, great job!
