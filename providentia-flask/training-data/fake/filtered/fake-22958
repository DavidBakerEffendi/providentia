I am not writing a review. I actually have question for people who have been to VerlainesI am looking to have my birthday here early next month. I am wondering what to expect from Verlaine's. I hear they have a good happy hour and food. What kind of dynamic does this place have. What kind of music do they if any? And what is the crowd like on a Friday night. Hope I get some responses. -Rosemary
