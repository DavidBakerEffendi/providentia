Not the most unique d√©cor, but definitely the BEST THAI in Hell's Kitchen, and the service is good too! The Papaya Salads are awesome, as is the Larb (Laab) Salads. We've never had a bad meal here.. DEFINATELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE! (Stay away from YUM YUM on 9th @ 46th though, unless you like to get treated like crap, and fed crap tourist food!)
