Tried to order pizza here and when it came to delivery the girl had to ask if they delivered to my address. I know they deliver 2 block away. Â When Dan got on the phone I told him that and he got arrogant and say they dont like to deliver to off forest road as its to far. They are at the end of forest rd? I don't get it. I was getting ready to order for pickup and was rudly talked to by "Dan" and was hung up on. I called back and I don't know why but ordered. When I got there I asked who Dan was and I said you don't hang up on customers, he says you know why cause it was about the delivery and says I don't have to even serve you. Me and my friends spend alot of $$ here and this is the treatment I got. I will never go here again nor will my friends. Pizza is ok but you can go down the street to Earnies on Whally Ave and get treated like somebody. Poor attitudes cant even ask why....
