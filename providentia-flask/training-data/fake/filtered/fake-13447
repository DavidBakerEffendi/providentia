The food is nice but beware if you pay with your credit/debit card. They overcharge you with the tip. I had a very nice brunch over there and happy with service and food. However, I paid for the bill with my debit card and tipped them more than 15%. That night I checked my bank statement and realized that they overcharge me! The amount that is overcharged is not much (about a dollar extra) but it is not nice to get this kind of advantage over customer. Imagine that if they usually do something like this with a lot of customer? So they will end up by getting extra tip (small amount from many customer can combine to a lot of money) and no one want to waste his time to complain with this problem. So I recommend to carefully check you bill or pay them with cash.
