Small batches, made to order. Anything ground breaking? No, not really.. but they execute a simple product really well. I had the War Sauce, which I enjoyed except I think caramelizing the onions could actually improve this sauce. My wife opted for just a regular order plain. At first, I was shocked. So many sauce options, why forgo them and get plain? In hindsight, I'm glad she did. The sauce, depending on which you order, can become overwhelming..especially if it contains raw onion. They are generous with their sauces, which are very good, but the plain fries were a nice change of pace every few minutes. Additionally, the place is small...real small. You'll need to get there early to avoid the lines around lunchtime which can extend out the door and down the block. The wait, if there is one, is worth it. By the way, portions are large. A regular size is certainly large enough to share with a second person.
