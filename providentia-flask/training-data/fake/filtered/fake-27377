It's basically the worst pizza ever made. But people seem to enjoy burnt cardboard crust, no cheese, and hair in their food. It's no wonder there is a long line of fat people who probably are so tired from standing for more than one minute that they rush their food down their throats without anytime to even taste the damn thing. If they had any taste buds, they'd probably refuse to eat certain foods every once in a while, and maybe they wouldn't fall into the obese category of the BMI scale. Chew your food, taste it! This place is gross! If you actually like the taste of food, J & V on 18th ave is the place to go for pizza and any other dough, cheese and sauce related foods.
