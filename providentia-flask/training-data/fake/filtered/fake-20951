I absolutely love this place. Im always welcomed like a family here. I recommend the spaghetti Bolognese, all of their food is simply delicious. Yummy yummy food - the worst part is trying to get a reservation here on the weekends. We made ours a week in advance. The bread, oh the bread...I'm not a fan of eating the complimentary bread that comes prior to receiving your meal but ahhh, that brioche type bread with pepperoni and cheese, brought me to life. Â I didn't even need dinner anymore, the bread was enough. It started with the bruschetta with cheese and the meat bread. I had to ask for extra meat bread because it was so good. Our next course was the crab salad and chopped salad. Then we went to the clams which tasted great I will say that the order was a tad small at six clams but it was priced relative at about 10 dollars. The artichoke was also very good and was quickly devoured. The middle had this tasty bread cheese stuffing that went wonderfully with the sauce. My main course was the Langostinos and they were delicious. I was quite impressed that they provided a large platter of these little gems with a butter sauce. Overall: Food- amazing. Portions- ginormous. Leftovers last you days. Service- excellent. Atmosphere- romantic, traditional, and old school.
