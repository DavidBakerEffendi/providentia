Small restaurant. They won't take reservations after 7pm or if you have less than four people. The assorted seafood hot pot was filled with fresh seafood - fresh, live seafood - even the lobster that was cut in half in the center of it was alive and waving its claws. As no one in my party was Korean, it was a little overwhelming but a great experience. My only tip is that you must use the buzzer on your table or you might sit there all night.
