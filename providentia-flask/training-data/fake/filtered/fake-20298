OMG! This STAGE sets the stage for a serious home-cooked meal any day of my week. FRESH ingredients. QUICK service. RESPECTABLE prices. CLEANer than B&H across the street. The best is Red Borscht in the summer-cool and refreshing with chunks of beets, cucumber, boiled egg, w/or w/o sour cream, and thick slices of homemade hallah-all for $4. It's thicker than most Borscht and not watery. Also try their Hamburger Deluxe. Stuffed cabbage is real special too. No nonsense, please!
