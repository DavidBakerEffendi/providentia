I have read great things about Maialino and was really looking forward to trying it out.  But overall, the restaurant was just ok.   This is what had: BREAD: The bread basket had a good variety of breads, with the pizza bianca being my favorite, but the others (breadsticks and another) were not memorable.   PRIMI: The two of us split the spaghetti alla carbonara.  The texture of the spaghetti was good, but the dish was SO salty that I could taste nothing else.   ENTREE: For our entree, we had the maialino al forno, which was supposed to be the highlight of our meal.  It was ok, but definitely not the best that I have tried.  The skin was chewy, not crispy.  And while I understand that great ingredients don't need to be overwhelmed with seasoning, the meat could have benefited from some seasoning (aside from salt).   DESSERT:  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake dessert (forgot the real name) with buttermilk ice cream.  This, I liked.  And I don't even like flourless chocolate cake.   Service-wise, our waitress was professional.  Not too friendly, but then again, that's not her job.
