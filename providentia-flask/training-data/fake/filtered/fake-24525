I sometimes go to the one in Flushing because my hubby loves their soup dumplings. I, on the other hand, not so crazy about their food. Perhaps because my home is northern China, the flavor of things are just not quite the same. Southern cuisine are often too sweet and too saucy, and their dishes are like the better Chinese take-out that I get from the neighborhood.  The decor of the restaurant is just like many of the older Chinese restaurants in the city, bright with fluorescent light and loud chatters. It would not be a good place to take your date to, forget about  intimate conversations. Their service is efficient and direct, like many of the Chinese places. "What's your order", followed by delivery of food, followed by delivery of the check. It's what I like to call "Eat and Get Out". The prices are pretty reasonable. But if you're in Flushing, you could get so much more for your money by visiting the small hole-in-the-walls.
