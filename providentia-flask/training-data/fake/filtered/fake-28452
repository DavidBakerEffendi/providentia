I had couple of ppl coming from overseas and i was looking for a good place for sunday dinner in the city , so I heard about this place and decided to give it a try , it's a small place but food was good we were seated near by the fireplace and let me tell you that something I've never seen before I mean very original I had mussels as a main course and the were good but the waffles were beyond excellent !!! Our waiter was right on every recommendation we gave us about the food and beverage even we helped us to get directions to tourist places in the city lol all I can say is I'll come back to this place again very good food and friendly service .
