Just went here after receiving a recommendation from another friend. We've eaten Rodizio-style a few times before, and were very pleasantly surprised to see prices that were nowhere near as high as we've paid in other places, specifically in NYC. We did not have the sangria, but instead had a great bottle of wine that was $20! There are more expensive wines on the menu but it is nice to go out for dinner and not double the bill because you'd like some wine. The food was pretty fantastic.  We had a wide variety of meat, not all of it was mind-blowing but next time we will know which cuts of meat do not tickle our fancy and so we will let those pass by when they come around.  Sides were really enjoyable, and the pineapple dessert was a highlight. I will definitely go back, my husband and I had a great experience and really enjoyed ourselves.
