Oh Grid Iron Waffle Shop, how I love thee... This place has delicous coffee!!! It is always very tasty and fresh. My husband and I love to take our weekend adventure over to South Orange, NJ for their irresistable gourmet waffles. Even if it's a quick stop in, they are easy to eat on the go. Because their waffles are a perfect size, it's always a treat to try more than one kind everytime we visit. Can't wait for our next adventure to Grid Iron Waffle Shop. The owners are sweethearts and are always looking for customer satisfaction. When are you opening a Grid Iron Waffle Shop near me!! (smile!)
