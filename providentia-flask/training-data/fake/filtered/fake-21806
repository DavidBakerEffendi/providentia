Being new to the area, I thought I would give Fare a shot.  Wow was I impressed!  Drinks were strong but not over powering and the Salmon Entree was one of the best I have ever had.  Service was on point and even the manager stopped by to make sure that everything was okay which meant a lot.  I will absolutely stop back again!
