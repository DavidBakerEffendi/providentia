Ok, I have to say that Foodtown in Lake Hiawatha is not your grandstand grocery store, however I don't need a SUPER store to do my food shopping.  My experiences at Foodtown are far better than Shoprite of Parsippany. The Foodtown staff and management are helpful and friendly, willing to assist their customers, and their weekly specials are great.  Not a great selection of produce and meat, however they are far better than some other stores around.  I like the fact that when I shop there they know me and my kids and greet us with a nice hello! I shop at Foodtown regularly and enjoy that I dont have to fight for a parking spot, wait in a long line and deal with impolite shoppers.
