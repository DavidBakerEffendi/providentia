I am trying to get anyone who hasn't been to Pio Pio  there. Pio Pio is a perfect place for a group, my sister had her birthday and we ordered 2 orders of the matador combo and it  was finger licking good, and there was enough food for everyone. In total we were 5.  The tostones and that green sauce super yummy. Chicken was also delicious and we cant forget about the avocado salad. The service was friendly and on point. Do they serve brunch?
