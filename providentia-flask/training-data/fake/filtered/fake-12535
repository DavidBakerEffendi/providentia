Nauna's has always held a special spot in my heart. For the majority of my life it has been the local pizzeria and restaurant. The food is always delicious and the staff is always courteous and helpful. The owner, Tommy runs a great business and the expansion is a testament to this success. But beyond putting out a great product he makes sure to give back to the community as much as he can. Â All of this is why I will be a customer for life.
