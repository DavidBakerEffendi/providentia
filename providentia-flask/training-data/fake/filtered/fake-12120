This is one of the best tacos I've ever eaten, and I lived in Las Cruces, NM for 15 years. the guy's cooking it really understand how to smoke meats, as they beef is succulent and tender, with a rich mesquite flavor that isn't overwhelmed by the jicama or the sauce. my mouth is watering just writing this. The guacamole was really really creamy too. so good. And the guys were really nice, too. Â amazing that it's all cooked in a truck. top notch.
