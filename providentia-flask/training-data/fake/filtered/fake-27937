Have driven past this restaurant numerous times so my hubby and I finally decided to try it. What a great dining experience. The food was delicious! Â The service was even better. We both ordered steaks that came with a choice of complimentary sauce. The red wine sauce was a great accompaniment. We will definitely be back.
