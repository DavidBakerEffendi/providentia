Not worth it. We came for the first time a month ago and they told us there was an hour long wait. After patiently waiting for 1.5 hours, we found out they skipped over our name and they were completely unapologetic. This month we decided to give it another shot, but waited for an hour only to be told that they were no longer seating anyone else because of a ceiling leak. Save your time and money and visit one of the many other Italian restaurants in the city!
