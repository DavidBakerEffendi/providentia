I called after about an hour and a half wait, which was the second time this happened to us but the first time that we called to complain about slow service. The person on the phone, who identified himself as Donnie, told me to stop calling for service. We're upset because Donnie offered no other solution except to stop calling. What a shame to lose a customer over poor attitude. Called occurred at 9:50PM Sunday March 10th, 2013. I will follow up with the owner/manager but I will not be ordering from this establishment again. I understand it must have been a busy Sunday- but that's not how you handle a customer.
