Old school, traditional, authentic Italian restaurant with very courteous & friendly staff.  Might be a bit on the upscale side. I loved the calamari, but the highlight of my night was the Mahi Mahi, which was simply amazing.  The only reason i'm not giving it a 5 is because I found the drinks/wine to be a bit on the pricey side for Iselin, NJ! It's on my list of favorite Italian restaurants. :O)
