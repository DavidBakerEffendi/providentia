This is the BEST sushi in both Philadelphia and the greater Philadelphia area.   Make sure to BYOB, and choose a seat either outside close to the Singing Fountain, at one of the indoor tables, or at the sushi bar.  The staff is attentive and accomodating, and the atmosphere is soothing with its indoor Asian-inspired decor and fountains.  They have a nice selection of moderately priced sushi as well as more elaborate and creative handrolls as well as tasty appetizers and specials. My only complaint is that sometimes the seating indoors feels a little cramped, but that's because it sometimes gets a little crowded, and they are trying to accomodate as many patrons as possible.
