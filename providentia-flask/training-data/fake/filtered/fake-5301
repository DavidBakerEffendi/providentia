The atmosphere is fantastique- crowded, good looking peeps, intimate, and bartenders that can ACTUALLY make a decent drink. Like a few others have mentioned, the grapefruit margarita is out of this world, however, if grapefruit isn't your thing, the regular margarita is quite excellent as well. Â I am not sure if they take reservations, but if they do it wouldn't be a bad idea to make one, the two times I came here (neither of which were on a weekend) I waited a good 35 minutes. It is worth the wait, grab a drink (or five) at he bar and fantasize about the delicious mexican that you are going to fill your hungry belly with:)
