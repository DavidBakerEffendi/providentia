This place seems to have it all. I went one day for an early dinner, and I got Pork buns and the Akamaru Modern Ramen. Absolute heaven. The decor is great too; low lighting, modern design, atmosphere, etc. If I had any negative qualities to list, it'd probably be that this place is too popular. If you want any chance of getting immediate seating, you'd have to come in around 5-5:30 in order to beat the dinner crowd. In my honest opinion, however, it would be very well worth the wait
