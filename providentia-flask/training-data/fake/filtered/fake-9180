Interesting reading the reviews. The Anchor Spa was owned by my dad and a guy named Louis "Whitey" Mineri during WWII, when I was a puppy, thru about 1948. I can tell you that the decor and the existence of Â Mermaid Room is now as it was way back then. Need to get back there soon now that I am old enough to drink.
