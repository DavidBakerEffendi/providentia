I went there last year with close Japanese friends from Japan and I commented on how good the food was to the Chef and that my Japanese friends said that it reminded them of home, which was a compliment. But the Chef told us "Go back to Japan. You don't need to eat here." WTF?!?!  For the rest of the evening, he was visibly angry and grumbling to his staff. I didn't bother writing a review since I thought the food was good.  But after reading the article about his discriminations against Asians, I need to tell everyone "DON"T EAT HERE! NYC has much better restaurants, Michelin or not, to be subjected to such a deplorable person. Yes, I am Asian too.
