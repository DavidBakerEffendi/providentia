Ok I guess I shouldn't expect much from a food kiosk in an airport, but you know what?  I've had great dining experiences with food and service at many airports during my travels.  This place however....is on the opposite spectrum.  It was during the am and we just wanted to grab some breakfast prior to getting on our flight.  The line seemed long so I guess it might be good.  Nope.  I'm sorry but when you can't get a breakfast sandwich right....that's a problem in my book.  Granted they might have been overwhelmed but really?  Two egg, sausage and CHEESE on a bagel sandwiches...come on.  Not only did mine not have cheese, my friend's was missing sausage.  Overly greasy and bagels tasty old.  To top it off, the price was much expensive.  Won't be heading back here during my travels at Newark Airport.
