This is a 5-star restaurant. This is one of my favorite restaurants. The food is amazing, the service is great, and everything is just phenomenal ! The waiter said the entire menu witnout even reading it off paper. Water was served as soon as our cups were empty. After my meal I asked if there was hot chocolate and the waiter said they don't sell that but he made it for me anyways with out even charging it. This place is great. The people are very kind and the food is delicious. It's pricy but it's definately worth it. I would recommend this to anyone who loves italian or just great food !
