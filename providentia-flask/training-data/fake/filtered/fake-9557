Ordered via phone to pick up and was told 20-25 minutes for a sausage calzone... Â When I arrived over 30 minutes later, I was told "just a few more moments". Ok. Another 10-15 minutes later I watched a man just beginning to cook sausage while eyeing me nervously. When I asked if it were for MY order, they blew me off and said "it's busy". I understand busy, but how about honesty folks????
