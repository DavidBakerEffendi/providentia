We were on our way from New York to Six Flags and thought it would be a great idea to take advantage of one of New Jersey's greatest resources, the diner. We used Yelp to find one on the way that had a decent review and randomly chose Teddy's and none of the four of us could have been happier with the choice we made. First off the town is ridiculously adorable and that totally counts for something. Beyond that the food was absolutely delicious. I myself had blueberry pancakes with a side of scrapple and was sad when it was all gone. The other three had a combination of eggs, potatoes, pancakes and various other breakfast meats and everything was spectacular. The bacon came to us super crispy without even having to ask for it to be well done, the eggs were cooked perfectly, pancakes are fluffy and delicious and well lets just say that everything was great. We all enjoyed the meal so much that there are talks about just taking random drives into Cranbury just to get some breakfast. Â Bottom line, if you're remotely close go and enjoy a great meal for not a lot of cash. I will be back as often as my path takes me near Cranbury, NJ.
