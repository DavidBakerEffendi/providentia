BIZARRE! Couldn't wait for the opening outside of Chambersburg.  What's with 'bottled water' only-served warm with ice cubs?  Why no tap H2O?  Do they really need the profit on the $1 water? Tuesday nite manicotti was barely warmed.  Double sausage tomato pie was oily and limp-not crispy. 16 " pie was smaller than the metal server. Very flimsy paper napkins couldn't handle the grease. Chef wandered around dining room, kitchen & outside with glass in his hand and never interacted with patrons.  Counted 7 in wait staff for 22 tables.  2 Hostesses.  Check came in a folder with AMEX insignia but no credit cards are accepted. BIZARRE! Go to Palermo's-half the price three times better.
