I went to Adriana Restaurant with 8 friends and will never go back!!!  The restaurant to crowded and we could not pull our chairs out.  The noise in the room was overwhelming and you could not talk or hear one another.  We had reservations and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  When management was asked a question he was VERY RUDE and when we asked for an apology he refused.  I WILL NEVER REOMMEND OR GO BACK
