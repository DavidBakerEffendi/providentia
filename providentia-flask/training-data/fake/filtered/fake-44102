Was here for the first time last week.  Went for the all you can eat sushi they advertise and it was very limited compared to other all u can eat sushi places.  You are given the normal menu when you sit down and told the limitations u have......very limited in the soups and salads you can order (only miso soup included) and limitations on the rolls as well :( service is poor and slow - it took half hour to get our order after it was placed....no desert options included - a sliced orange was what we were given.  Sushi itself was okay but not a good experience overall :(  will not be returning :(
