Sorry but this place is overrated.  The big draw here is the concept of dipping your fries in the sauces of your choice.  The sauces are pretty decent but cmon, how can you people tell me that they have good fries. They don't.  They are out of the bag and not quality fries.  This basically goes undetected because the fries are masked by dipping them in sauce.  If you really want to rock my world, go out a buy a french fry cutter machine, some sacks of fresh potatoes, and hire somebody to make fresh french fries.
