I took my mother in-law to Indian Hut for lunch and thought our meal was delicious.  We ordered Masala Dosa and Gobi Manchurian Curry off the menu (they offer lunch buffet for $10, but it doesn't include dosas).  The Dosa was very crispy and the chutney and sambar were flavorful.  Since the dosa was over a foot long, it seemed like the filling was sparse.  The Gobi Manchurian was so tasty and made up for the light dosa.  Service was friendly and the place was very clean.  Indian Hut is my new favorite restaurant in Pboro!
