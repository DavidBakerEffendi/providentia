While the bartender that we met is very nice, the owner went out of his way to harass our group of 20 new customers.  He turned the music up full blast and told us that he "might be able to lower it if we spent more money on drinks."  He continued to provoke us and finally kicked one of us out of the bar for getting a glass of water.  We will never subject ourselves to such an abusive, hostile, coercive environment again.  Shame on the owner of this establishment!
