Let me just say, in general I really like Grindcore House. It's great to have a place to go where you dont have to worry about what you order and whether they remembered to make it vegan or not. It's also great to have a place with more options than just soy! The tea list is nice and extensive and the staff is super friendly! Tip your baristas, it's just common practice AND these people are really helpful! With that said, I was initially excited hearing about this place having events, a free library, movie screenings, art shows, etc., but sadly it doesn't seem to be the radical space that I was thinking it might be. The events are few and far between and seem poorly organized while the art shows have been problematic on a number of occasions (The current on display features unquestionably exoticised women and a previous one was graphically triggering). Also, it's good to hear different music in a cafe, and I realize the name is "grindcore house" but I've never heard a female-fronted band play over the speakers here. As a radical space, doesn't that seem exclusionary? There are countless bands that fit the sonic vibe of Grindcore House that aren't just male-fronted. Please realize that radical women and non-male identified people come here too and know better than to think that Madball is the epitome of "radical anarcho-vegan hardcore." C'mon. Mix it up. Grindcore House is a nice place for a vegan to get a drink and a snack. The staff are always welcoming, but sometimes the space isn't. I hope this at least makes them think a little bit.
