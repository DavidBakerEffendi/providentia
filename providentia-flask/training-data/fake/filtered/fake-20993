Had takeout from Honest Tom a few times, and before they are on 44th st I had tried their tacos from their truck.  I highly recommend their breakfast tacos, which tastes as good as it looks: tomatoes are red, guaca is green, and fried potato is golden!  Very fresh and filling.  They are also open late.  Tacos are $6 for 2 and burritos are $8.  Do think veggie burritos could be cheaper.  I love their sweet potato burritos, even though they do have a bit of potato skins in them.    Their beef burritos use ground beef, while I'm more used to chunks of steaks in burritos.     I expected faster food preparation for tacos and burritos.  Kinda an awkward place to wait for 10 min.
