They are the best in baking goods. I love their espresso coffee. My favorite product is the "Pamonha". This bakery sells the best pamonha in Newark, made by "O Rei da Pamonha". For those not familiar with the product, pamonha is a delicacy from Brazil, made of pure corn and wrapped in its husk. Portuguese and Brazilian products are dominant in Newark and the fusion of both flavors is a recipe for success. I used to buy the products from "O Rei da Pamonha" at their restaurant. However they closed their store, and now have their product at the Daily Bread. This is an excellent idea, since the Daily Bread has a wonderful customer service, friendly people and the highest quality of pastries and coffee. Whenever you are in town, don't forget to check this place out. If you live in Newark, go visit the Daily Bread and don't forget to try the "pamonha".
