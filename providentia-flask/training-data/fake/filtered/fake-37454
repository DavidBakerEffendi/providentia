This is just a really great bahn mi place. i have not had one bad experience here, the service is always great and quick. One of the more exceptional places in Elmhurst. After trying a few of their stuff, I always go back to the bulgogi bomb me, get if if you haven't yet! The only downside to this place are their drink offerings and their weird sandwich ingredient arrangement, you never really can get the perfect bite lol. I would pass on the in-house drinks since you can get a better version of nearly everything there within a few blocks. The price is spot on for the value. All in all a great spot to eat at if you're around the area.
