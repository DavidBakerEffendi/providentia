My parents and wife went to this steakhouse for Mother's day. We made sure to call ahead for a reservation because we knew they were busy. It was worth it! The food was amazing, I was surprised I finished it all on my own because there was so much. It was a little on the expensive side, but it was a price fixed menu for the holiday. They were also out of some of their more popular steaks because we had a late (7pm) dinner reservation. Aside from all that the food was delicious and it would definitely be a place I'd go back to again. Just next time, not on a holiday. The food was pricey, but you get a nice portion for the price. Plus this is a steakhouse, and they usually don't run cheap. Their menu was 50% steak, 50% seafood. They also had some pasta and salad dishes. They had a pretty robust menu for a steakhouse, and they had a full desert menu. We were just too full to have any!
