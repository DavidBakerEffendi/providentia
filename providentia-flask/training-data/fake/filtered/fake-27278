This was a perfect Sunday brunch for everyone in our party.  Most of these cafe restaurant brunches are nothing more than coffee shop breakfasts in a cooler setting.  But Le Barricou served good omelets, nice side salad, and real fries. Reasonably priced, friendly staff. Now we want to see if it's as good at dinner.
