No - DO NOT -  STAY AWAY!  We had reservations made a week ahead of time for a party of 13 for birthday celebrations. Waitress was terrible, no one even came out when we arrived - seated ourselves - waitress showed up 20 minutes after we arrived! 90 minutes for food to arrive - 4 people were ill after they got home!  JUST AWFUL!
