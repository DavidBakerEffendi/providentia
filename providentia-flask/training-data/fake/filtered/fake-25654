The atmosphere is extremely pleasant!!!  The decor is somewhat retro, which is a fun classic!!! From beginning to end the food is beyond wonderful from the presentation to the fabulous flavor!!! The table next to me loved how the portions were abundant but the price was reasonable;  no skimping on portions and no gouging on price! It was my first time dining there, but will not be my last!  You will do yourself a favor by putting it on your "must do" list when in the city.
