I just came from this place a few minutes ago. If you asked me to rate it while I was walking there, I may have given it a 3 or 4 based on the food, which is good. However, I just walked back to my hotel and now I'm giving it a 1.     I'm visiting from out of town and it's the only place I've found that's open for dinner and within walking distance of my hotel. On the first night I went in, I was immediately attended to by a nice older woman and I ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which is delicious. After that nice meal, I decided it would be my go-to place every night. The next night, I went back and was immediately attended to by a younger woman and I had the fish & chips, which was also great.     Tonight, I went back, hoping for another positive experience. I walked in and there were a few folks eating and sitting at the bar. I took my same seat, grabbed a menu, decided on the House Deluxe burger and then waited for a waitress or somebody... So I waited... and waited... aaaaaaand waited. Then I got up and left. If you want my money, give me some attentive customer service please.
