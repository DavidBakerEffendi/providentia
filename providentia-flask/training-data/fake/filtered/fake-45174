Awesome food. We stopped eating Indian food at other places coz nothing else comes close to the tasty food prepared by these guys. My favorite is the crab masala and the Mutton sukka. Never have I eaten such perfect buttery Nan's. Chicken 65 is yet another fav in our family. Very authentic flavors and the meat is always cooked to perfection. Nothing comes close to the customer service that we have gotten from the folks who work there. My special thanks to Allen and Abhay who take customer service very seriously. Place continue preparing such yummy food and thanks for great service :)
