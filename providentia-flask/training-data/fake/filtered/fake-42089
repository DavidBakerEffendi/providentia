My absolute favorite place for breakfast and brunch in NYC. The food here is so yummy, and the service is attentive, even on the very packed weekends. Looks can be deceiving- From the outside the restaurant looks small, but has ample seating inside. I went with a 6 friends around 1ish on a Sunday, and had no problems at all getting a table. I had the feta cheese and spinach omelet, which came with a side of home fries- magnificent! I also had several cappuccinos during a two-hour + brunch. That are highly addictive.
