Let me start by saying I LOVE THIS PLACE! the food is great whether you come for brunch, lunch or dinner and the vibe is amazing, beautiful interesting people, great staff, and very good prices. I love the green shakshuka, small plates, hamburgers and desserts. whether you come during the day with your kids or at night to party, I wish they will open another location uptown!
