I will try to be fair with comments eventhough I had a very nasty exchange with the manager. The wait time was too long given the restaurant was only two thirds full. The decor was dated and decaying. The bathroom was horrendous. The smell was so offensive. I saw two customers slip on the water and trash left on the floor. The service was very slow. The waitress complained that she had too many tables to service. We had to wait 15 mins for her to initially come to our table. We also had to stop her as she passed by for the status of our bread, salads, drinks and entrees.ONE THING TO NOTE--15% gratuity is automatically added to the bill. I would have left a lower percentage had I been given the option. Upon checkout I spoke to the manager relaying my thoughts here. He gave an excuse for every issue I presented. As I was signing the receipt I said I could tell that he did not care about my comments to which he replied "I'm glad you can read my mind". Rarely have I ever encountered a manager who never acknowledged the customers concerns. Poor customer service. Dated and unkept. Food was plentiful but lacked flavor. I will never recommend. The one star rating is for the waterside location and view.
