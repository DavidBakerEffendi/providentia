i have to say that pub 46 has done a huge turn around in the past couple months....its def a fun place to party!!!! the music is so much better on saturday nights. its looks like it will be the new hot spot for the fall!! they have great drinks prices and the food menu gets better and better. halfs price apps! whats better than that!!! they even fixed the bathrooms which is a plus.
