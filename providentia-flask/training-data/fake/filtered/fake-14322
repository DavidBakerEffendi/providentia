The best burger I have had in a while. Don't let the appearance fool you. This is the sort of place that you might look at and drive right on by. But you would be missing something great. Located in a gritty industrial part of East Hartford Augie & Ray's has been serving some of the best food in the area for over 6 decades. The burger was not the biggest but was juicy and tasty with almost no fat. You can get any number of toppings on you burger from the condiment  bar or have them put it on when it is made. The fries...hot, crispy and not covered in grease.  These can rival fries from any other place out there. Augie and Ray's is famous for their dogs, but they do so much more so well. I have not been here in a number of years but I am glad to see it is still the same. Good things just keep getting better. Prices are  less than the other options (mostly chain fast "food" places in the area. Skip all the chain fast "food" places and head over to Augie & Ray's. It really is the best kept secret in town. Note. .inside .seating is very limited. Just a few stools at the counter. But that is part of the character of this place. They do have a large outdoor seating area in the warmer months. But regardless of where you sit you will not be disappointed.
