The environment is very romantic, but somehow it's too dark. We have difficulty to look at the menu. The waiter was very polite and provided excellent service.  Our waiter's name is Kike.  He served us professionally.  The food and drinks were delicious.  I'm highly recommended it and I'm definitely will go there again!!
