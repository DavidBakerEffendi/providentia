Grimaldi's? what they DO is famously fabulous pizza. Here's the deal: They serve pizza, pies only, no slices, no reservations, no credit cards, no nonsense. The menu is concise; you can order a salad, wine or beer, and there's a huge range of pizza toppings from chicken to olives and salami, but this is basically a meal of pizza.Like Grimaldi's food, the restaurant decor is modest, simple and focused; tables are covered in traditional red checkered tablecloths.People go nuts for Grimaldi's pies, which come in either 6 or 8 slice pies-- and yes, one person can eat a whole pie. Expect to to wait in line with scores of out of town tourists for whom Grimaldi's is "the" DUMBO destination. Given the lines, Brooklyn residents, who are well aware of other excellent pizzerias in the borough, might find the cost-benefit ratio between the wait and the meal unattractive, depending on how dedicated they are to the specific taste of Grimaldi's. They boast of "fresh ingredients, handmade mozzarella, 'secret recipe' dough and pizza sauce." And shhhh... even their fresh tomatoes are, apparently, imported from Italy.
