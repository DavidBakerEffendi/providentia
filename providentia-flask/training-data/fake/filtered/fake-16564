I was eager to try out Mood Cafe given the positive feedback but was hesitant upon entering because it just started for the day and the owner was on the phone. He gave us some time to take in everything and decide (I can be very indecisive) and he was really patient! I ordered a chaat and a lassi. Each step in the preparation is visible and we were served quickly. It was my first time eating chaat and given that is a cold dish, I was a bit tentative. However, the first bite brushed away all thoughts. It was delicious and crunchy and perfection in every bite! Even though it is easy to miss on the outside (depending on which direction you're walking to get to it), it's not a place your taste buds would want to pass by. Absolutely recommend!
