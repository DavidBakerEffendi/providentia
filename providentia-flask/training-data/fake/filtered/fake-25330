4 Stars for takeout. I love the value this place provides. I eat here once a week and can fill myself with plenty of protein and relatively healthy options on the cheap. For under five dollars, I can almost fill a Styrofoam takeout container and it's a satisfying meal. I often get nervous with Chinese food because of the msg and the after feelings, but I can honestly say that I never find myself gasping for gallons of water and I always feel well after. Quick and friendly too!
