This is our favorite brunch place and a must eat stop we take our out-of-town family and friends to whenever they drop in to the city.  You cannot go wrong with any of their eggs benedict and you MUST order their French Toast.  Service has been very good all but once - but I have not seen that waitress in subsequent visits. We were back last weekend and were sad to learn that they no longer serve their roasted brussel sprouts (which are a definite must) during brunch any longer...wish they would bring them back.  I would also love to see their biscuits and gravy offered during Saturday brunch instead of exclusively on Sunday.
