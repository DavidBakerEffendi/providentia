To those poor souls who think Sally's and Pepe's are the end-all for New Haven pizza the only thing I have to say is stop kidding yourself! Modern has to be the best of New Haven pizza and Italian cuisine. I've considered myself fortunate to dine here on numerous occasions and have been treated the the best eats! Granted, there are times when they're busy that things may not be as fast as hungry heats desire but when it lands on your table you'll bound to enjoy what you ordered.
