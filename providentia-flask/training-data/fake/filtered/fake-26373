I was so looking forward to going to Parc as my cousins were treating me for teir Christmas present.  They have really enjoyed the place in the past so they were anxious for me to go.  It was a nice day and the place was really hopping which I love to see for Philly.  However, that said, the service was a disappointment.  The server was the nicest guy, but left out some of the niceties you expect when dining, like what temperature to cook the filet.  I had also asked for a Pinot Noir with the filet and even asked if I could have before the main course was served (as I knew they were busy) but it arrived as I was taking my last bite of med-rare filet (preferred medium).  We had also asked for a couple of things during the meal (oil for the bread and a paper napkin) - neither of which ever appeared.  As it was a really busy day and the noise level was pretty rough too.  Unfortunatly, for some places popularity and high noise levels go hand-in-hand, it is just not my preference at this age.  Want to enjoy the ambiance a bit more quietly.  Not sure if I'll head back, but do think it might be worth another try.
