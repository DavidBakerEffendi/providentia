Let's start with what Donald Trump says "YOU'RE FIRED"!  We work at a large company and have frequented Nolita's several times for HH events.  As of last night we will NEVER return. The bartender totally ignored you as if it was so inconvenient for him to serve you. We ordered a Fra Diavolo pizza which had literally one dollop of cheese not even on every slice which was also cold and soggy when arrived. We used to go there just for the pizza when first opened, however, we are DONE with this place, it's TERRIBLE!!!!  Also, when the bills arrived they were wrong as we were charged for drinks we didn't even have. Of course we then had to approach the unfriendly bartender. My advice to you is RUN and eat at home!
