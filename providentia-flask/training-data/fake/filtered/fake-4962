Yes. Just Yes. 100 Montaditos delivers just what the name says--100 different small sandwiches, some with traditional Spanish fillings (Manchego and Serrano ham) and some less traditional (bbq or a hot dog). The sandwiches ares small, so the idea is that you buy several, along with Â a side of Brava potatoes (more like wedge fries than traditional patatas bravas, but delicious none the less) and a big mug of tinto de verano. Overall the concept works. The food is good, the restaurant is welcoming with a steady stream of Spanish pop music playing, and, perhaps most importantly, it's all so CHEAP! It certainly doesn't compare to a nice night out at an upscale Spanish restaurant, but what you get for the price is great. Minus 1 star because they forgot about our order of dessert montaditos, but it was opening weekend, so I'm sure they'll get the kinks ironed out soon enough.
