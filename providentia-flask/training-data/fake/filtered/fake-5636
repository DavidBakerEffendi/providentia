I just ordered via delivery, and it was my first time trying this place. The soup that was ordered spilled all over the bag, emptying the soup carton, and coating the other dishes in greasy soup. Secondly, the amount of duck in the duck salad was appalling, considering the price. Personally, I will never eat here again, and I wouldn't recommend it either.
