I just created an account to let y'all know-- delicious ramen, but! don't get the extreme spicy ramen unless you are ready to pay for it later during a painful trip to the w.c. Hot in, hot out. No kidding. Otherwise, same as a lot of people are saying-- yummy, long line, a bit skimpy on portions and toppings--but the pork is great.
