Sunday night, we were a table of four for The Chef's Tasting and Wine Pairing. The smoked trout caviar w/ dilled cucumbers were perfectly paired with Clavelin Brut Comte Jura Chardonnay. The Roots was one of my favorites, carmelized root veggies w/hazelnuts and quince paired with Girard Sauvignon Blanc. Autumn Greens Gnudi paired with Gautheron Chablis, Chardonnay. Country-Time Suckling Pig, delicious, black walnut, 3-hour pair, kohlrabi paired with Isole e Olena Chianti Classico was great! The best food I've had in recent memory. Service was great. Can't wait to go back again.
