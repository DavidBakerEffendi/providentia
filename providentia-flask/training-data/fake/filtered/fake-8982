Dis is where I want to go if I feel like hitting up a house party where I know no one. Its small, crowded, and packed with an eclectic group of downtown intelligentsia. Every time I go, I feel like I've been transported to Paris in the 20's. It feels old school, but in an exciting way. I always seem to get caught up in conversation with someone I've never met before. Besides the excellent mingling environment, the cocktails are DELICIOUS. Pass on your usual G+T and get weird with whatever they put on the menu that week. The great spot for after dinner cocktails or post-movie snacks (Reuben Croquettes? Yes please!). If you're going to eat, call ahead and get a table. I like to get to this place around 9:30 or 10. Any time after, you'll likely be turned away at the door because its reached capacity. Also, you'll be required to respect the dress code. No flip flops. Go beyond casual. Show them you care, because they certainly do. Hands UP!
