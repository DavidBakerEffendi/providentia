Good grief! Never again will I go to Noir.  Good selection of beers and liquor, very over priced.  Why anyone would go there for food is beyond me.  Especially when it is right next door to two amazing restaurants.  My wife and I were in recently just for a simple date.  We live in the neighborhood and wanted to try a somewhat new place.  We ordered the poutine and shared it.  No where near as good as the real thing!!!  It was the equivalent of eating a philly cheesesteak in Canada.  We sat at the bar where there were two people tending.  Well actually, one of them was tending to us and the other one was talking to customers.  She said hello to us and smiled making small talk.  She seemed nice, her name was bobby or billy or some kind of boy's name (I can't remember) and I think she was a lot younger than she actually looked, but right after saying hello to us, she began berating a waiter about something (couldn't hear what it was) but he seemed defenseless and utterly upset, which made my wife and I feel pretty "slighted" by her facade.  She was so loud that everyone at the bar looked up to see what was happening.  My wife and I were really turned off by it.  After an $80 tab including a few beers, 2 shots, and a poopoo-poutine to split, we bolted out the door and got a cheesesteak...only a few blocks away.  Thank god for geno's!
