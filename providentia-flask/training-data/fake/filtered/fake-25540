I Ordered A pizza they sent wrong one. I called to get a replacement they got nasty claimed this is what I ordered. I would never order pizza with some of the items on this pizza in fact I am allergic to one of the items. They hung up on me I called back asked to speak to the owner a girl there claimed she was the owner and started berating me saying that was what I ordered. Needless to say this is the last time doing business with them. Very nasty people.
