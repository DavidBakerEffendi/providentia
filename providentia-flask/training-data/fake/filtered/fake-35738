I've been going to this place for some time now and I have seen the restaurant go through a number of upgrades.  One thing that has remained consistent is the quality of the food.  This is THE most authentic French cafe in the 5 boroughs.  Between me and all of the friends and family I have brought to Triskell since I moved to Astoria nearly four years ago, I have tried nearly everything on the menu.  I have never left disappointed, nor have any of my guests. There is a reason Triskell was voted best French Onion soup in all of New York.  It is.  The crepes are superb and truly authentic and the brunch menu has some choices you will simply not enjoy anywhere else.   Without a doubt: the best French Toast you will ever have. The Quiche is wonderfully presented and amazing.  The wine menu is carefully chosen and they have a unique list of beers from France you will not find elsewhere. Sometimes brunch is crowded but, hey, it's New York and this is a popular restaurant.  I will continue to return.
