Food was mediocre at best. Unprofessional and mean-spirited staff was a definite shock. Needless to say, I will not be back. Owner is argumentative and unprofessional. Â The owners/staff huddles at the register to trash patrons proved this to be a hostile and horrible place to dine. I wanted so much to like this place. A no go!
