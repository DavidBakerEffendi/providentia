The London Grill is combination of delicious and exciting food, great beer, and a fantastic environment.  I have never walked in there and not been welcomed with smiling faces (from the staff and also the happy patrons).  But without question, the food is where its at. The bar food includes, in my opinion, the best burger in the city, a one of a kind potato pizza, or muscles with a red sauce that can match any italian joint in the city.  If you want dinner, almost every entree is amazing and changes on a daily basis to keep you on your toes.  I am a huge fan of the gnocchi and the brick chicken. And it doesn't stop with the food.  The bar has a endless selection of booze and probably a dozen craft beers. I really cant say enough about this place and there is no reason why you shouldn't stop in to see for yourself.
