I always have a great time at this place! Cool atmosphere with a fair amount of seating including some outdoor tables. And you should order something on the menu that has pickles because everything from the fried pickles to the pickleback shots are amazing. I also really like the selection of beers here. It can get pretty Â crowded on the weekends, but I consider that a plus!
