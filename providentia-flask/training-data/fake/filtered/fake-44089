This place has Good Food and nice owners who are dedicated to food and service.  Unfortunately, the 2 women who work there are extremely unpleasant and should be relegated to backroom or just the grill stuff not taking peoples orders or dealing with the public in ANY way.  They are ruin-your-day kind of people and that can also ruin the food on the plate. Hopewell is better than that and I'm sure there are many people who would be excited to have these 2 ladies job if the 'backroom' isn't welcoming.
