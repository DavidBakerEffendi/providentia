My son and I were in town for a Philadelphia Orchestra performance. It was sort of a last minute thing so no plans were made where to eat after. We just stumbled onto Entree. So we thought we would give it a try. I have to say the NY Strip was the best I have ever had. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned. It was set on a bed of asparagus, scallions and linked potatoes.  It was fresh and wonderful.  The staff was very accommodating and the chef came to each table to make sure everything was to everyones liking. I can't urge you enough to give this quaint little place a try. I was wonderful. We will definitely be returning.
