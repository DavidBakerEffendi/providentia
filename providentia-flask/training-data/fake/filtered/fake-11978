I ate here on my way out of town for a weekend getaway great way to start my trip!!!!! Food was amazing we had the Chicken Argos highly recommended and my girlfriend had the rt 78 burger another great choice we started with the Feta bruchetta WOW is all I can say. Prices were lower then I expected and service was far better then you would expect for an airport. Staff was friendly and attentive food was super quick to come out. All in all a wonderful experience !!!!!!!!!
