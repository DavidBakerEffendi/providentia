Purbird is amazing. Their grilled chicken is to die for, and we love the variety of sauces to choose from. Not to mention the mac and cheese, which we almost always get. So delicious. Oh, and the grilled pita. Amazing. We highly recommend this place. It's such a welcome addition to the area, and the folks running the place are always so friendly and helpful. There's not a lot on that 6th Ave. stretch, so I hope more people are able to find this place and enjoy it. Truly wonderful.
