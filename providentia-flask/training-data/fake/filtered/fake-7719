I tried Joey That for the first time last night in the form of a delivery; it will be my LAST.  I asked for a tofu and veggie dish with no mushrooms.  The dish was GROSS, over-cooked grey string beans and broccoli and loads of mushrooms.  I didn't taste it, it looked and smelled so bad.  The Thai salad was awful.  Chunks of iceberg lettuce and shriveled grape tomatoes.  One was completely black with mold.  I asked immediately to have my order picked up and money returned; it took an hour and a half.  The owner was gracious when she picked up the food, however.
