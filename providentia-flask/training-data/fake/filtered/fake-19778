I always thought that Guru Palace, NJ has the best food ever tasted....yes even I tasted it when I went for a dinner just before the party that I booked for my Kid's birthday. I ordered the same dish that I had for the party....Dinner food was amazing....But food for the party was a diaster....They burnt two of my dishes...Paneer was yuck....Malai Kofta was not even close to what I had eaten earlier....I ordered for Mughlai Biryani & the owner, Jasbeer changed it to a normal Veg Biryani....They are real cheaters...they promise u something & deliver something else...Food is the main thing that people remember after a party....The banquet hall is good but when the food is a disaster then everything takes a back seat....I would never recommend this restaurant to anybody whom I love...infact would not even recommend to my enemies...not interested in taking a revenge this way... They are cheaters...never book a Hall or restaurant here...u will repend....Please do not spoil ur loved ones special day....
