I've been wanting to check out this restaurant for a while based on all the raves, and I'm so glad I was finally able to.  We got an earlier reservation on a Sunday based on the fact that prime time reservations usually get filled pretty quickly.  When we arrived, the restaurant was pretty empty, but by the time we were leaving, it was packed!  Despite this, however, the waiter was very attentive and did not have any problems answering all our questions about the meal and offering us suggestions.  Everything we ordered was delicious, and the ricotta app special was especially good.  Portions were small, but sufficient - although it matches the prices and the multi-course menu style.  I will most likely come back soon... if anything it's a good place to recommend to friends.
