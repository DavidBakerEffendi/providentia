More like Thai House Sucks. Went there for the first time today for lunch, nothing special. I had the Pad Thai, barely any chicken and not that much flavor. I have been to other Thai places that have more to choose from (they didn't have two things we asked for that most Thai places have), more meat in their dishes with more flavor and a nicer/cleaner atmoshpere. I will be sticking to my Mei Thai from now on.
