I saw this quaint cafe in an intersection in West Philly and decided to stop in for some dinner. As soon as we arrived I was greeted very warmly by the staff. They offer inside and outside seating but we opted for the inside because the sky looked a little gloomy. We ate inside in a cute little red room, the walls may need some extra decorations, however. This place proved to be just as adorable inside as it is outside. Once we were seated, out server came by to tell us about the menu. There weren't any physical menus however which we both thought was a little interesting. The server brought over a chalk board with the menu written on it. She then explained to us there was an incredible deal. (3 courses-- appetizer, dinner, and dessert with coffee or tea for $20) Of course we opted for this option, how could you not?! Our meal consisted of a wonderful cucumber soup, mussels, crab cakes, chicken with homemade potato salad (excellent!), and two slices of chocolate bread pudding. We both thought everything was absolutely delicious especially the desserts! I will definitely go back and I want to see this place succeed. My only complaint would be the lack of a physical menu. I hope they decide to print out some menus so we have something to look at. I felt kind of awkward having to decide what I wanted while the server was standing right there.
