Modern is one of New Haven's best pizza spots -- and that's saying a lot considering how many historic joints there are in New Haven. Old School pizza at it's finest, Modern is all about quality ingredients. I find this dough is a touch thicker than other New Haven places, but it's soft, chewy and delicious. Highly recommended if you want to get beyond the Pepe's and Sally's.
