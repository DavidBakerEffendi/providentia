I went three days ago to this restaurant and a ate noodle with seafood. After eating I felt bad all afternoon. When I arrived home I womited all the food . Next morning I have diarrhea and fever 101 degree. My stomach hurts a lot. I think it is due to the bad condition of seafood or maybe the condiments. I do not want to go anymore, also I want to go personally to complain. And I also consider not to go to any chinese restaurant anymore I still feel bad and with diarrhea and i could not work for a couple of days.1
