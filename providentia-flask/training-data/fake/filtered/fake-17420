Empress Garden doesn't appear to be anything special from the outside, but if you know where to look you can find some truly amazing dishes here. You do need to order off the Chinese language side of the menu to take advantage of all Empress Garden has to offer, though; their English menu is typical anywheresville USA Beef n' Broccoli, General Tso's, etc. If you can't speak or read Chinese, bring a friend who does -- or perhaps, as someone below suggested, ask the waitress for some authentic recommendations -- and you're set for an amazing experience. The zha jiang mian (fried sauce noodles) and the beef noodle soup have really kept me coming back; no matter how long between visits, it seems the super-nice waitress still remembers my boyfriend and I and knows exactly what we want to order :) I really wish they'd offer a menu with a translation of the more authentic dishes though!
