THIS PLACE IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS !!!!  The food is amazing, i recommend every tapa on the menu from top to bottom. Great wine selection, good sangria, and great mixed drinks. The shot specials keep the night life interesting. I have tried every entree, and they are all great. People always say they have an issue with the Paella but thats because they are not familiar with that specific style of making it. Its not the traditional paella that you can find anywhere else and that is what makes it GREAT.  The staff is very friendly, and the chef will sometimes come to the table and speak to you and ask how your meal is and i feel that that makes for an even greater atmosphere.  It has a very unique decor, the design is like none other seen in the Ironbound area. This is just what Newark needed. The fact that the Redbulls Viking Army holds all its game events there makes the good times even better because everybody gets pumped!  There is no doubt that if the owner has the chance he will always greet the guests whether its at the bar or at the individual tables.  The crowd is very mixed, there are always people of all ages. Catas is the place to be !!
