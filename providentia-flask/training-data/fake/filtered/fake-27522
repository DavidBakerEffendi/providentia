There is just something about the sauce. The way it tastes... that it is over the cheese on the Sicilian. This place is an institution and I pay homage. Always a very interesting cast of characters sitting around outdoors during nice weather. The lot is almost always full and people are double parked up and down the streets. My suggestion - buy a half or whole sheet and jump the line. Always a treat
