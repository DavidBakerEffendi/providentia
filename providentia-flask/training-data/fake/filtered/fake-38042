I first came here with a friend for their birthday. We split fried pickles and the mac and cheese. Divine! The dirty aphrodite cocktail was to die for. My husband and I decided to return here the evening we eloped with some friends. It turned out to be a larger crowd than we imagined and the staff was incredibly helpful sitting everyone close together. The waiters noticed when a person switched seats (out of 20+ people) and at the end even broke up the tab individually. On top of it the food was ridiculously good, cocktails were perfect. (try the bloody mary!) Everyone raved about it. Â Recently, we returned for our one month anniversary and couldn't be happier we did. Chicken and pickle sandwich, root beer on tap... and incredible service again! We bought some pickled beets to take home to tie us over until the next meal there!
