Nice vibe & aesthetically pleasing, made for a beautiful night. I highly recommend the chicken gnocchi, it was absolutely AMAZING, and the garlic cheese bread is not even optional. Plus, the serving size was so large I left stuffed & had enough leftover for a full lunch the next day. Best restaurant I've been to in Hartford thus far. (Make reservations first!)
