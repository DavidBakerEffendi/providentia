Delicious!!!! I was walking down Church Street..hungry and was drawn in from the cold by a delicious aroma and jazzy music. The Salmon was incredible all 3 of us got it and it was perfection! Beautiful plate, fresh.. Hit the spot! Excellent, excellent service and great food. Absolutely recommend it. Also tried the Glugg I believe it's called a warm fragrant red wine concoction perfect this time of year!
