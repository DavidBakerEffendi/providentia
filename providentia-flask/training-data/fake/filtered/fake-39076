No, no, no no. Happened upon the restaurant by chance and they accommodated me late at night. 5 stars for that! Nice decore, really nice in the Chicago style. I  didn't know that it was Lida's restaurant until I saw the cook books on display. As I come from the same part of Italy as Lida, and my wife has her books,I was surprised and hopeful of a touch of the old country. Unfortunately, no. I could find little(nothing) from the north east of Italy on the menu. The waiter disagreed and said it "is a North Eastern Italian restaurant, sir". Then why,prey tell, do you have Sicilian Mussels on the menu? I chose the seafood Brodetto with Polenta. Mistake. No flavour,no texture , just no !A light  bisque with polenta sediment  and two of the most unbelievably large scallops on top, or two cookie cut pieces of ...whatever. Think the second! It should be a thick seafood stew with slices of polenta ( peferrably grilled). Read reviews, maybe I am wrong. After all they were very friendly and they did sea me very late.I Went back again for the" Sinfonia di pasta" and one more time  for, I forget ( It really was forgetable). Better than Little Italy( maybe) but, I have never eaten there so, I really don't know. The bottles of wine ( from Lidia's own vineyard) are good value at $25, and are nice. The food is not and I suggest that Lidia has spent too much time in the US  or on TV. On the last visit , the waiter ( may have been the manager, not sure) said that if I really like  Italian, I should try Il Babbo, their premiere restaurant. Why should I?
