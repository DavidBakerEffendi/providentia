Tre Scalini is on the corner of Wooster St. aka "Lil Italy" in New Haven. I have been coming here for years, and have never had a bad meal. There are a lot of good Italian restaurants in New Haven, and I have a few other favorites, but this place is definitely at the top of my list. The food is authentic, fresh, and amazing! They have different specials every day so even if you are a regular there is something new to always try. They have a very impressive and extensive wine list that would please any wine enthusiast. Definitely a must try place if any one is looking for authentic Italian food in the New Haven area.
