I decided to try this place after so many great reviews. I had to wait 2 hours to get my pizza since they are closed between the hours of Â 5pm - 6:30pm. After all the wating outside in the cold, I found the pie to be salty and nothing real special. I had better pizza in the bronx on Morris Park...ie Patricia's.
