I just joined Yelp so I could write about my new favorite place.  I really enjoyed my visit to this restaurant and wanted to share my experience.  I didn't actually order food here yet but I already planned a date for Friday night!  I cannot believe I never tried this place before.. I was very pleasantly surprised.  Wow!  A real place to relax and have a drink after a long day at work, there is such a great selection to choose from.  Can't wait for dinner Friday!
