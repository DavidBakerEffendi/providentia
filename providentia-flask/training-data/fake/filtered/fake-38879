Wolf + Deer is a GREAT BAR. well, it is for me, and so i think probably for you too. One of the very nice things about it - besides the wine, cocktails and MOST IMPORTANTLY TO ME beer! - is that they encourage you to stay a little while, hang loose with your friends and family. i went the first week and it was nice and the service was good although did not have a traditional American pace to it (opposite experience of what i think another reviewer was saying about rushing the check).and then my second visit was a few days ago and everything had improved. i think it will always be getting better. cheers to wolf + deer!
