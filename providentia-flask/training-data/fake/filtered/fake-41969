this place is awesome , customer service is even better , the decor is beautiful , and choice in music is out of this world. i love when i find classy african american owned establishmets. i had the smothred pork chops over a bed of rice, collards, and mac and cheese. my mother had the salmon. all the food was seasoned to perfection!! every last bit of it !!! the bartenders created excellant alcoholic beverages. i will be back for sure! one more thing, you will want to make a reservation. it's key to having a great time without a hitch!
