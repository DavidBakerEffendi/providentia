The spinach pie is good but it doesn't come w/a Greek salad. You have to substitute the salad as your side dish (and pay extra).  The person I was dining with last time I was there ordered a falafel and it didn't come w/yogurt sauce.  He had to ask for it and it was 15 minutes before he got it.  Their baklava was really disappointing as it was very dry but their pastry puffs drizzled with honey are very good and they come free of charge at the end of your meal. Their humus is very good and the atmosphere is nice but the fact of the matter is that I've had Greek food that's just as good at Greek-owned diners such as TOPS and Nevada.  Everyone I know raves about this restaurant and while its' not bad per se, I don't think its' worthy of ALL the hype.
