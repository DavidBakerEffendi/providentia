Glad that the area has a new taco place, but authentic is not the word I would use.  Tacos were fine, fillings decent, however found tortillas (the backbone to any good taco) to be average at best.  Find it odd that you have to specifically request corn tortillas for your tacos, because flour tortillas simply isn't right for tacos.  Chips were stale, salsas were very good, and beans were flavorful, but not the rice. If this place opened in any city that had a high degree of Mexican-food consciousness, it would probably struggle to survive.  But perhaps with time they'll get it right.  No matter, glad they are in the neighborhood serving an Anglo version of a Mexican classic.
