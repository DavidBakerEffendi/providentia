J and K Steakhouse is one of my all time favorites. I have followed them from Morristown to Montclair to check out the new location. The business is still starting up in the Montclair so the service is not as developed as the Morristown location, but it is still great! The food is incredible, and if you truly are in the mood for a tender delicious steak this is the place to go. My two favorite dishes are the porter house and the rack of lamb. The creamed spinach will never let you down and for dessert I would HIGHLY recommend the apple bread pudding with rum raisin ice-cream. The food is simple, elegant, and delicious and the decor and ambience are relaxed and eloquent. Definitely need to give this place your belly will not leave dissatisfied!
