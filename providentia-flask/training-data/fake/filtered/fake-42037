If you just want to eat a lot and not spend a lot of money, then this is probably a good place to go. There's a decent amount of options, but I am a big fan of noodle soup and for a place that has "Great NY Noodle" in it, I expected it to be a little bit better. The soft shell crabs are good, but the texture of the noodles was only mediocre. If money is a big factor when rating a restaurant, then I guess you could give this a 4-star. But quality is most important when going out to eat. There are also much better restaurants out there that have great noodles.
