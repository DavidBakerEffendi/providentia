I literally can't say enough good things about this place.  The burgers are beyond phenomenal - high quality meat, well cooked, perfect toppings.  Service is friendly, fries are great, really nice setting.  Sit outside if you can (although I saw a mouse out there one which kind of freaked me out).  Seriously go here for burgers.
