So my bf moved into the area and we absolutely love thai, we decided to Google restaurants in the area and imocha came up and was very very close but the amazing part of it was reading the reviews, each one was better than the next and only made our decision easy and our decision to come back even easier all the reviews was correct the food is authentic the owner Nat just had an amazing charismatic personality, THIS PLACE IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED IN MY EYES DEF CHECK IT OUT
