Hands down, the best thai food in New Haven.  I am quite picky with the pad thai, and these guys did NOT dissappoint! yay! try the larb as well- spicy and delicious. ALso- the sticky rice with mangos is to die for. I kinda went nuts on ordering take out here my first time, and holy smokes, it was all so very tasty and fresh.  I think I'll go get some right.....now!
