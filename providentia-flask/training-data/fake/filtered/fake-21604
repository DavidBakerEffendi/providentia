I had my first experience at Hat City Kitchen, I loved everything!  I ordered the shrimp with grits. It was appetizing perfectly seasoned, freshly made and piping hot. I ate every drop, I would only add that maybe it could be served with some type of bread that could used to sop up some of the  delicious sauce. I wasn't ready to leave so I ordered the desert. I ordered the warm chocolate chip cookies, the plate was dressed with homemade whipped cream. The desert was a perfect end to a most pleasing meal.  The waitress was personable and attentive.  I felt the prices were fair and within reason for an evening out. I dined in an area where art is displayed for purchase that added to the expeience, I look forward to returning there when live music is played. I plan to patronize Hat City Kitchen again soon! If your looking for something new to try Hat City Kitchen you won't be disappointed.
