This place has the hands-down BEST pizza in the area! Great cheese, great buffalo chicken, great BBQ chicken, great pepperoni.... Great everything! They make an awesome Greek salad with tons of feta and their garlic knots are super tasty! The place is really clean - and even their staff is incredible.... Really friendly and FAST! Eat here!
