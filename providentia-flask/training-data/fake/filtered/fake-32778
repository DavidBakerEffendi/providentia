I was not very pleased with the flavors of the dishes I had.  The chicken mango tasted more like tomato sauce drizzled all over it.  I must say the Roti Cannai was excellent. I had two other dishes that I can not remember but that is because they were not that excellent either. I told the waitress the mango chicken had too much sauce and tasted of tomatoes and she looked at me as if I didn't say anything.  I must say she had a lovely smile and atleast continued to refill our water.
