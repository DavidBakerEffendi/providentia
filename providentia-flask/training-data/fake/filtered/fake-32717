A friend gave my me and my husband a gift certificate for this restaurant. A bit of a walk from our apt, but was worth going. Friendly, attentive service. Good wine selection (though I'm no connoisseur). Delicious lamb entree & brussel sprout side! Had a young vibrant clientele. Simple, cute decor giving the appropriate ambiance to let the food really shine!
