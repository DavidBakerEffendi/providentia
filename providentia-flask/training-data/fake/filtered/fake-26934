The service was the best part of my experience today. Larissa was always smiling, very helpful, and made me feel at home from the start. I don't want to take anything away from the food. It's was amazing and Larissa recommended it all to me. Dear Mr Butcher Bar, Hire all Larissa's and keep up the Burt end game!!!
