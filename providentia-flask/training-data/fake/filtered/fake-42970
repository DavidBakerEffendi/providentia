I am a kind of frequent visitor to the restaurant, almost all the time I do take out food for my family of 3.  My order is the same, most of the time. 2 Chicken Biriyanis, 1 Mutton Biriyani. Some time I replace 1 chicken biriyani with Chicken 65. Occasionally when I reach the restaurant before the order is ready, always a pleasure to talk to the host Vishal. Today for a change, We dined at the restaurant and ordered our standard food (1 chicken biriyani, 1 mutton biriyani, 1 Chicken 65). I told Vishal the food is great as usual, then suddenly he asked me, why I am not putting my reviews on YELP and other review sites. These 3 items are so suited to our taste, that we haven't felt the need to try any other item from your menu.  (I had tasted their Gobi Manchurian at some house party and it was also a pretty good veg dish) The ambience is great, seats are comfortable. The food presentation was very nice. However I felt Chicken 65 quantity was a little less than what I had about 2 weeks back. Chicken Biriyani and Mutton Biriyani were of ample quantity.
