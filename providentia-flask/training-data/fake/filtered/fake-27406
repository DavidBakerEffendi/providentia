Don't be suckered in by this loyalty to this famous Brooklyn eatery.It used to be excellent but now its hit or miss.I don't know if it's due to laziness and they are riding their reputation,but i have always thought that you have to upkeep that reputation to keep it valid. The slice is good but not great.I could name a couple of other pizza joints that are better and less expensive. Try it if you must,but don't let it be your standard for Brooklyn pizza.
