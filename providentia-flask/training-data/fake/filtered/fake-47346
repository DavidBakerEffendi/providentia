Wowakowowza.  What a find. Stumbled across tip top while in town for a tupelo show.  Holy mackerel this place is the bomb. From the cilantro with the bread to the garlic fries it was a palate pleasing pleasure. Daily special ribs were out of this world. My bride had the steak and that too  treated the  tastebuds . saw a lot of good-looking stuff go by on the trays. Will be back to test the rest. A definate must try if you're in the area
