hallo yelper ! this is for all the people who gave this place 5 star : HALLO ? HOW CAN ANYONE LIKE THIS CART FOOD ? made from people who don't wear any hair restraints, beard cover or disposable gloves,they touch the pita with bare hands and i don't see any place they can wash their hands around there.i also saw their arm and elbow get in contact with that big mountain of meat while thei chop it with spatula ! the meat comes already cooked(who knows where...)and keept in a van parked nearby then just heated on that thing.i bought that combo a few time cause i was really drunk and i just followed my friends but you can bet i totally regret next day ! I will never undrestand how people can stand half hour in the cold to buy that stuff and YES ,the carts on all the corners near by(including one on 52th and 7av belongs to them,thanks to you "drunk guys" they made so much money to buy the licence,leasing,permit or whatever it's called to expand on the near corners. Do yourself a favor,stop at McDonalds or get a slice of pizza next time you get drunk out of the club. have you ever heard that phrase" We are what we eat" ? ? so i assume if we eat garbage we are garbage..
