Staying with family nearby, they recommended this as a place they take people to show off neighborhood restaurants.  We were disappointed.  Admittedly, we didn't have a full meal so it may not be a fair sampling.  But the gazpacho was the saltiest I have ever had, and it's texture too thin--they don't blend in any bread with the mix, just toss in a few croutons at the end.  At $8.50 for a small glass with a lot of ice the sangria is simply a rip-off.  Limited beer list once you pared out the crap, and they were out of one of the good ones.  Noise level was very high and the tables close together.  Service was prompt and friendly and that helped a bit.  We had pita slices with three kinds of sauces which, like the gazpacho, were too salty.  Overall a disappointment.
