Sat at the bar for dinner. Tried the wings, pork belly, tapioca cake. The wings tasted only of overused grease. The pork belly dish was just pork belly submerged in soy sauce. Rice is an extra charge here. The tapioca cake was hard and fairly tasteless. The sticky rice was not sticky rice. I have been to Thailand and have eaten many different dishes while there from restaurants, roadside stalls and in remote villages out in the jungle. None of the food I saw at Pok Pok NY was like the food I have seen in Thailand. Sorry to say that the food at Pok Pok NY was not good. The bartenders were not the friendliest people either. The cocktails I tried were okay, but not great.
