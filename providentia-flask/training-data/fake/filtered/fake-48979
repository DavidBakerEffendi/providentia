What a great place to eat!  I LOVE the friendly atmosphere and service.  I met Dave, the owner and Shawn the GM.  They were very courteous in recommending different entrees for my boyfriend and me since it was our first time there.  I had the Mardi Gras Salad and my boyfriend had the Arizona entree and protein shake (which was HUGE by the way). All of it was cooked to perfection and delicious!!!!  It is great to finally find somewhere that serves good, healthy food!  THANK YOU MUSCLE MAKER GRILL!!! FINALLY A HEALTHY OPTION!!!!
