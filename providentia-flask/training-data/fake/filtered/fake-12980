Bought 2 dinners using groupons, and went there twice in 1 week. Food was good to above average. Services was ..... they have daily lasagna specials, that day the server told me it was sausage and onions, when I ate the  lasagna and it was eggplant. I told the server that, and she took the meal off the bill. I told her it was unnecessary, as the lasagna was good and I liked it very much. She insisted - this is a restaurant which wants you to go away satisfied.  I'm a fan.
