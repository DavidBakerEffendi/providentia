"This is the best Italian restaurant in the city...for the food and the price." That's how my friend described this restaurant before heading over there. Needless to say, my expectations were high. The restaurant is small and cozy so if you need anything, a simple hand wave will get their attention. What I loved about all these dishes was the flavor in the sauce, and al dente texture of the pasta. We also order an elder flower cocktail which was light and sweet. The pizza was also great...loved the thin crust! Dishes ordered: Black Ravioli Seafood Fettuccine Emiliane (fresh red noodles with asparagus, mushrooms, and prosciutto) Taglierini sorrento (black noodles with seafood) Pizza Umbra (chicken and asparagus topping) Writing this has made me hungry. I want to go back soon. :)
