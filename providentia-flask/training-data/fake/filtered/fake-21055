The guys who own this place are pretty sleazy and only pay the waitresses 2.50/hr. The food is cheap and good though (not high quality,but yummy), and they are open late which is convenient. I'd reccomend going here but only if you tip decently  and have a strong stomach for creepy older  men. I've also smoked cigarettes in their kitchen, I'm pretty sure that breaks some sort of health code.
