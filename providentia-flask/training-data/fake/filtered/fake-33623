I love this place! The food is good and their service is amazing too with really pleasant staff waiting on your table. However, what makes this the most fun restaurant in NYC is their live musical band.This band is Â the soul of Himalayan Yak and makes every trip there worthwhile! New York has become culturally richer thanks to Himalayan Yak and it's live band:)
