So thankful and happy that there is a good place, with fresh green food and drink made with whole ingredients.   Today I ordered for the first time. THey delivered in around 30-40 minutes. Firs the good... and there's a lot of it! Freshly Squeezed Juice: The Apple Carrot Beet Juice, was perfect. Clearly no added sugars, but nice and naturally sweet. Perfectly juiced. I'm a little under the weather today and it was an instant pick me up! Food: I ordered the Mediterranian sampler appitzer for lunch. 1. Veggies were cripsy and fresh. 2. The Tabouli... perfect. I often feel that mediterrian places mess up Tabouli (I've lived in Isreal) they nailed it. 3. The babga ganouj was smokey and lightly sweet, nicely rich. 4.  The olives were chewy and delicious (not overly firm, not past their prime, just right!). 5. Hummus delish! 6. Grape Leaves - Marinated well, but not too soggy, just right. Excellent spicing. The only reasons I'd give this place 4 stars instead of 5 are: 1. Generic Pita 2. Falafels were dry and cold. This could be because of delivery... I'm assuming their excellent in the store. THank you for Falafel and Hummus & Juice Bar!
