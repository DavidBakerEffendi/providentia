If you like cockroaches in and around your food then this is the place for you!!!! Our House bistro is infested with American Cockroaches, they are in the walls, floors, ceiling and even,.... IN THE ICE MACHINE. Â Its also one of the dirtiest establishments I have even been in. I heard from an employee of thiers about all this and felt I needed to say something. Its unfortunate since thier menu is so inviting and whimsical. and the waitresses are doing the best with what they are being givin. I personally will never eat there again!
