The restaurant has both an outdoor seating area (with heat lamps) and an indoor seating area.  Both areas are spacious, but I prefer outdoors with a view of the river.  Brunch was a great deal.  The monkey bread was gooey & sticky, the bananas & pecans were a bit sweet but still tasty, and the French toast with rhubarb sauce was amazing
