If you're a vegetarian, this may be paradise for you as it is for me. The food is fantastic! I can never get tired of their beets salad, and their poikilia, which are three dipping sauces, they are to die for. Their service is also great. They are usually so busy during the end of the week so you might need to call ahead of time to make reservations.
