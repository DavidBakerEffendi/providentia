Went for brunch on Saturday and had previously been there a while back, which was great. Went this time and it was so-so - they got rid of specials, which were very nice last time. Also, incredibly cold in the restaurant even though people were not coming in and out of the entrance very much. The waitresses were also very inattentive. The food however, was very good quality-wise, but not very interesting (tomato soup and grilled cheese, eggs with hash browns). Not bad, just not very good - disappointing.
