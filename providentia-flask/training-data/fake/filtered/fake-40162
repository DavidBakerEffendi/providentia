We came about two hours before closing on a Saturday, ordered 4 regular pizzas with a 45 minute wait, and magically got seating for 8 (some stalked tables while the rest ran across the street to buy beer - its BYOB). The pizzas came out one by one, with a perfect amount of time in-between. The pizza itself is worth the hype - crispy and hot with great sauce, olive oil, little nuggets of parm, and freshly snipped basil. Perfection.
