I had high hopes for a particular Peruvian restaurant in Montclair, I went even as to telling my friends and friends of families to go and try it. I went there and tried there food and  it was below my expectations I myself being a Peruvian thought that the meal was bland had  little portions and to my surprise everything in total was too much in cost. On top of that the service was quite lacking, there weren't many people there and the servers were very inattentive. There were more servers then people in the restaurant. However, knowing all this in the end of the day they didn't deserve a tip so thats what i did i didn't leave a tip and mark down as such. The most insulting thing about it was that I recently found out after a week ago today that they snatch there tip from me. It was so insulting to a customer, to be as it may slapped across the face like that. So I myself will no longer being going to this place ever again because, of such actions this business done. So if you do want to try and eat at this place go ahead, if you want to lose even more money you earned.
