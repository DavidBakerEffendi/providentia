I love Houston's restaurants and was a frequent customer while living in Miami, FL. This was the first time I visited this one specific one in NY and was extremely happy with the service and ambiance. I actually felt the ambiance was even better than the other 3 that I have been to before. I went on a Sunday evening and we were seated right away. The dip was truly amazing and is a MUST when visiting any Houston's! The 5 nut brownie is also delicious. The waitress was extremely friendly and all staff was very attentive to our needs.
