pretzel fried chicken !!!! so goooddd, im talking about when you think you have no clean underwear and out of no where you find one last one in your clothes drawer because you are like me and not fold your clothes after the laundromat and just stuff everything into a closet, that's how good it is. Amazing Decor, its appetizer size plates, so if you are with your girl and you are trying to be cute and save money, just order these 2 items and you both share it. The grilled cheese sandwich with mushrooms, get Â mushrooms, if there is anytime you listen to a stranger for advice, it is this moment in time. The mushrooms add a soft contrast texture to the crispness of the bread. The Pretzel fried chicken is great too, definitely dope. with that being said, you now have some spare cash to spend, save it! Just walk with her to the park near by and enjoy swinging and asking her about her favorite book and tv show growing up as a kid. If she says fresh prince of bel air, take her back for a 2nd date =) -swag
