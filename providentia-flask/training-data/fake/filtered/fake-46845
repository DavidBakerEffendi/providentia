Wow!  Classy place.  Fabulous food, distinctive and delightful cocktails, charming decor and ambience--a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  We had the chicken curry, which was spicey enough to be interesting, but not overpowering.  The lamb sausage was mouth-watering too, and there were plenty more selections that we intend to go back to try--soon.
