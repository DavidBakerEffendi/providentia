I've been curious about checking this place out, but the building exterior and the funky, cheap-looking signage had put me off for a while until a friend recommended it. And, I'm so glad he did! The place is GREAT! It offers affordable (and to my mind) Cali-inspired Mexican food--something I've missed since I moved from the west coast. The food is FRESH (and gringo-friendly) and playful--the inspired green eggs & ham w/ tomatillo salsa & chorizo for brunch was delicious. The food is not greasy and heavy the way that truly "authentic" Mexican taqueria food can be--unless, of course, you're in the mood for that. The staff was extremely friendly, and I'm so glad this branch of the Los Jalapenos restaurant opened in Bella Vista. Ill be back again with friends!
