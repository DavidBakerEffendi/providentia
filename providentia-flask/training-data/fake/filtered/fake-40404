I've had dinner and brunch here a number of times and was very happy to discover that their brunch is once again fantastic!  I had a disappointing experience in January but recently gave it another chance and everything was absolutely delicious.  This past Saturday after almost no wait I had a frittata with the perfect blend of creamy goat cheese and slightly bitter broccoli raab, a scrumptious piece of fruit bread and a tasty salad made with local organic greens.  We started with a mezze plate which included homemade soft pita with a romesco (red pepper dip), feta and perfect hummus.  We finished with a side of blueberry pancakes, really fluffy and creatively topped with a red peppercorn butter.  My friend ate a buttery polenta with perfectly poached eggs, greens and asparagus, yum!  We had trouble deciding on a drink, between the raspberry sangria and sake bloody mary (not included in the prixe fix).  I definitely recommend you check this place out for brunch if you haven't already!
