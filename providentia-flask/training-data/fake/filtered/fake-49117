We came here for a birthday dinner on a busy Saturday night. The staff was excellent, our waiter had great suggestions when we were ordering and really knew his stuff. For a larger party, they took great care of us. They even allowed us to bring in our own desserts and helped with serving them. It was busy the whole time we were there, and I liked that they didn't rush us at all. I took one star off because my entree wasn't as good as I was hoping (I had lobster ravioli, it was pretty tasteless), but everyone else really liked their meals. The garlic bread was fabulous. Overall, I would definitely go back!
