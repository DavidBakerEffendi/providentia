The dining area has a bright, cozy atmosphere with cool artwork.  Most importantly, they have fantastic burgers!!  Both times i've eaten here, the wait staff was very knowledgeable about their extensive beer list.  The mussels were just okay, in my opinion, but the rest of their food definitely makes up for that.  One of my favorites in Fairmount.
