This is a solid and reliable neighborhood spot for Italian food.  I've been there at least 3x and have yet to be disappointed, and each time I always get something different. So it's not like I just got lucky on my first selection and keep sticking to it.  Definitely worth going, plus it's very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.
