I have been going to this place for years since my dad started ordering from here. Â One thing I like is that the owner of the place is always there working alongside his employees. You can tell he wants to give 100% to his customers at all times! They have a nice dine in area where you can eat in but I rarely have time for that. There was maybe one time where my broccoli was a little overcooked but it happens, everyone is human. But overall, the place is clean, the service is good and the food is great! I don't go anywhere else for Chinese food and luckily it is right up grove street from my house so lucky me!!
