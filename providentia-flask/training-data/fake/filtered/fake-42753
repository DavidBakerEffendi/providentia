Loved this place!  We dined there last night as a group of 4 and everyone loved their food and drink!  The jalapeno margarita and beet-tini were both delicious!  We had the beet salad, the fried cheese app (cannot remember the name, but it was tdf) - both were excellent.  I had the goulash which was a good size and delicous - I would highly recommend it.  The others in my group had the Korzo burger, duck entree and the pulled pork - everyone was very happy with their meals.   very cool decor, great service (they even threw in a dessert wine on the house, which was great - sweet but not too sweet), good times!  Definitely will be back.  Also, we had a reservation and I'm glad we did because there isn't a ton of seating.
