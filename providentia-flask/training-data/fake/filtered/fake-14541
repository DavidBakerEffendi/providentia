Food was great. The tartar and the ribs were my two favorites, and the donuts for dessert are a must. The food did take a little while to come out, however. And it seems like there's only one or two waitresses handling all the tables even on a busy night, so sometimes it'll be hard to grab their attention when you need something. Otherwise, this is a great restaurant.
