The food was good as usual and also the waiters are great but 1 thing they do is gross spray the tables next to you when your eating with cleaning fluid it stinks and then the person sets the tables back up with her hands with the cleaning spray on them what a turn off . Â thats unsanitary for sure !!!!!!!
