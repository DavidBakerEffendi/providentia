I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday with her. Oh my gosh, finger foods that are worth every single penny. I had the burger with curl fries.....D E L I C I O U S. The portions are huge, I was only able to eat half of everything. I took home the rest, not for myself*, but for my bro-in law, who is huge foodie. However, as soon as I got home around 3 am that morning, my taste buds were yearning to just explode with the flavors that were still lingering from earlier. *So much for him, I ate it as soon as I got home. I sound like a pig, but the burger is out of the world. I would definitely go back to sample their other foods. The atmosphere is very inviting and the staff was gracious. At first glance it doesn't seem like a place (decor) that would serve the things that are on its menu; hamburgers and fries. Although, there were people our age (20s) group, it was also family friendly, and seemed to be the spot for yuppie NYers, and middle-aged men.
