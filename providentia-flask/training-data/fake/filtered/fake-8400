I wanted to take my friend somewhere special for her birthday and this place was just not it. Our waitress was awesome so no complaints there! However, the place was SO. DARN. LOUD....we literally could not carry on with our conversation without SCREAMING. The drinks were over priced and the food was just average. I had the chicken kabobs and they both had the chicken and waffles. They were both meals I felt as though I could have cooked better at home (and I am by no means a great chef....) SO....if you want somewhere local in Philly I suggest going elsewhere!
