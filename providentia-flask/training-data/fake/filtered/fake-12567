The staff is willing to explain what everything is. I tried the walnut cake, with a coffee drizzle on top - a big rectangle of seemingly wine-soaked sponge cake with layers of whipped cream. Lovely, and more flavorful than I usually find whipped-cream-based cakes to be, not exceptionally sweet. The hunter's stew one week had sliced meat, the next, chunked, and more kielbasa the second time, with red and green peppers and a smoky tomato-y sauce, and I enjoyed the stew both times. I loved the Polish pancakes, a sort of a cross between a French crepe and an Ethiopian injera, both the savory filled with sauerkraut and dusted with sauteed breadcrumbs and the sweet filled with sweetened white cheese.
