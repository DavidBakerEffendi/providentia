Really wonderful atmosphere, the waitress was great, the tuna tartar was rally great.  However, the hostess isn't aware of the word friendly or that she's in a service industry, the cod was overcooked to the point that it might as well have been a rubber chicken, and the beer selection was limited.  They were out of the only decent beer, which left the selection to be equal to that of a basement sports bar.  There are too many good restaurants in NY and the West Village to go here again.
