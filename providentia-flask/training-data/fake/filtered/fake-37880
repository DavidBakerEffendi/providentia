I've ordered from Marco's twice and twice I've been disappointed. The first time it took a little more than 2 hours to receive my food, luckily I received my food hot and just the way I ordered. I ordered a second time, and not only was my food late, but the driver delivering my food became angry because he couldn't find my address (although Marco's frequently delivers to UVM), he was cursing under his breath because he was frustrated with the fact that he thought I was paying cash when the receipt said I paid with a credit card. When I opened my food the sandwich was poorly done. The meat was not in the sandwich, parts of the bread was burned, there were ingredients missing and it was not made the way I requested and the way I had ordered the first time. I highly doubt I will be giving them a 3rd chance. Poor food quality and poor customer service.
