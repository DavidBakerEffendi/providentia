Visited Lam Zhou on a recent trip to the city, and Â absolutely loved it. I have to give Yelp props, too, because I really only tried it based on all the positive ratings it received. The hole-in-the-wall look was a little intimidating for me, since I'm not experienced with noodle foods (outside of mac and cheese I mean!) but it got such great reviews I had to try it. So glad I did! This is definitely worth checking out.
