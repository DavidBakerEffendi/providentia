Everything was pretty good, EXCEPT for the food!   The glaring overhead lights were finally dimmed down a half an hour after our 7:30 p.m. arrival for dinner (that's good), and the blasting, annoying background music - featuring percussion drums nonetheless! - was totally changed and significantly modulated downward shortly thereafter (that's also good).  And the casual, capable front-door and wait staff were both quite friendly & accommodating (again... good!)  But the food ...??  Perhaps a totally off night, but Osteria Morini's featured petroniana veal Parmigiano was surprisingly devoid of any discernible taste; the Branzino (sea bass) was unusually oily, yet grossly overcooked at the same time.  First courses, save for a nice cappelletti, were equally unimpressive. Desserts: somewhat better than the rest of the evening's fare, but still far from best in class.  And all this mediocrity, plus an acceptable wine, for just about $125 per person!  Shame on Michael White who has fully disappointed this group of past admirers with this "dumbed down" pretender!
