El Almacen is more than a charming place. This is a place where the owner is taking care of any of their customers by providing high quality food. Meat 100% grass fed, non-GMO and working as much as they can with sustainable local farmers. After months of restaurant avoidance because of health issue related with food allergies, I went to El Almacen and didn't experienced any stomach cramps or any side effects that any other cheaper restaurants would have cause. Of course quality products make delicious meals. El Almacen is place for people who wants to eat healthy.
