Awful food and even worse service!!  I just wasted my hard earned money on what should have been an enjoyable dinner with my family.  I ordered coconut curry shrimp.  I didn't taste one bit of coconut or curry.  It was bland and disgusting.  I understand that one meal can be "off" but all of us agreed to get up and walk away.  When we told the hostess of our displeasure, she smile and said "oh, sorry".  As if she cared at all.  Forget the waiter....he couldn't have been any ruder.  What a crime!!
