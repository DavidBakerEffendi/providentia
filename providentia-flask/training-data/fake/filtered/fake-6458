Excellent food for the area, a very creative, complete menu of continental food with many nightly specials.  The atmosphere is casual but more upscale than other "pubs" in the area. The seafood seems to be the speciality, but pasta dishes are excellent too.  The menu is slightly pricey, and my only other minor complaint could be that the seating is very tight, but NO complaints about the food, service or overal experience there.  I highly recommend the Columbia Inn.
