Went here for my birthday and had an awful experience. The staff was extremely rude to us. Before ordering drinks, we asked if the five of us could have separate checks and were told they would only split it 3 ways because "it's a pain in the ass". Meaning, they were 100% capable of doing it but just didn't feel like it. While we talked over how we could pay on one bill(only 1 of us had cash) the waiter angrily told us that he'd split the check 5 ways but to note that they don't normally do that. We said thank you and waited for our meal. The food was okay but nothing great. He came back and threw the checks on the table. My bill was a little over $13 and I gave $15 and asked for change so I could give him a bigger tip. He came back with our bills and threw them down on the table and said "thanks for not tipping, we really appreciate it"  and stormed off. I looked down and notice he gave me my change in all coins. Really? We just got our change/cards back and you're already saying that? MY friends with cards didn't even have a chance to fill out the tip portion of the receipt. Then, a girl, we assume was the manager, came over to us, bent over and said "did you guys really threaten to leave if we didn't split your checks?" we all looked around confused and told her no because those words never came out of our mouths. She continued to ask us  "really? you didn't? um are you sure?" we assured her we didn't and she goes "well just know its kind of a new york city thing so yeah" in the most sassy tone and walked away. What kind of customer service is that?
