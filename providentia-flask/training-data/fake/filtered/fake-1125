Sat upstairs at the rooftop bar to enjoy brunch with some friends. Such good food, the banana foster waffles were delicious. The bartender Anna was such a sweetheart and made some fantastic drinks. I would recommend the "London Iced Tea", so refreshing! Overall a fantastic experience and I will definitely be back!
