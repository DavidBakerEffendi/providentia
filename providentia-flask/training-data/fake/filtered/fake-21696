I came here with my son on Sunday at noon.  The restaurant was packed but we managed to snag the last table.  I was looking forward to the food, because I read the great reviews on Yelp.  We ordered pancakes and an egg/cheese sandwich and waited.  And waited.   And waited.  After 30 minutes, I asked our waiter where our food was, and he said that the kitchen was swamped.  Looking around, I don't think we were the only frustrated customers.  Finally, after 45 minutes of waiting, we left, stomachs still hungry and disappointed in the experience.  I felt my waiter could have warned me of the lengthy wait, which would have given us an opportunity to go somewhere else.
