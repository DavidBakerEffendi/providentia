This summer I had my backyard party at my home with the food and service from Guru Palace. It was excellent. The set-up and quality and guantity  of food. No wonder it's voted as one of the Best Catering and to dine for in North Jersey. I recommend all to my friends. You guys are doing a great job. Try  their " Spinach Kofta Curry" .
