I went to Cask Republic with my friends and husband a couple weekends ago and had a great time! It was really busy, which is expected on a Friday night so we had to wait for our table but they have couches with waiter service to get drinks while you wait. You can not get that from a lot of places in New Haven that is for sure. The beer selection is out of Â this world and everyone who works there seems to know their stuff. Our waiter was even able to help us pick out what to get because we were so lost. Once we got to our table our hostess could tell that we were really hoping for a booth, but there weren't any opened. Even though she was really busy she was able to get us a booth like 10 minutes later which was so amazing. The bar atmosphere while sitting in the booths is the best seat in the house. Our waitress was amazing and recommended great food. My husband got the burger which he loved and I got the clam chowder and it was great. We decided to linger and drink for a couple of hours and had a great time. Cask is a trendy new spot that I really like to go to, even if it is just for a drink after work. Great service and awesome food and drinks! Thanks Cask!!!
