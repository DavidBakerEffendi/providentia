3 Stars for the food ! Nice and quaint location. I suggest that they create a Lunch menu in the $9.99 price range I paid  $17.89 for two turkey burger sliders, small cole slaw and fries. A $9.99 lunch  price special menu needs to be created**** Some restaurants have a $9.99 lunch menu for items until 4pm such as sliders with fries etc.. I hope this was helpful ****Other wise I enjoyed the experience and I would re-visit ****
