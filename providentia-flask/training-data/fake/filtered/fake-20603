re: bad experience-minetta tavern long time diner in nyc restaurants from 0-4 stars and have never been approached by anyone to order more quickly since they needed the table. we were on our second cocktail-had 6pm reservations for 3 arrived early and were seated. we had advised our waitress we wanted a leisurely meal and she agreed. so when the manager approached us with the above advisory-which was half way into our second cocktail- and i had already advised the waitress we would order half way thru the second cocktail-we were a bit taken aback and i mentioned that we had just gotten  done commenting this has never happened to any of us in the past-he proceeded to continue his dialogue we would be more comfortable ordering now and not have to be rushed -i proceeded to tell him we would order when we finish our drinks and "good bye"-mind you this couldn't have been 30-45 min  --after we were seated--we left the restaurant at 8:08 after appetizers and entrees and a couple of glasses of wine each---2 of us wanted to leave and eat some place else the third wanted to stay and not bother trying to find a place on saturday night---our bill was over $400-the waitress was just about pleading with us to stay for dessert and it would be "ok" so doesn't seem like the waitress initiated this. needless to say our evening was ruined and we will not return to any of keith mc greedies places.  aljrnyc
