Pizza was good. But it was unhappy experience for me.  The old guy there was really uncomfortable. He said that I have to put my stroller out of the restaurant cause there is no place to put a stroller. I didn't want to do that cause I don't want to lose my stroller. So I decided just to take out the pizza. But when I came in to the restaurant, there were many people with stroller(and they even didn't fold it). I was really uncomfortable with the old guy, so I changed my mind to eat pizza in the restaurant. I folded my stroller and had to take my baby in one hand and bring my stroller the other hand. The pizza was good but not so special, it was just  normal brick oven pizza. I was really unhappy with this bad service. The worst thing was that some people pushed their stroller with their baby after me and the guy provided high chair also! What the....?? I am not gonna visit this pizzeria again.
