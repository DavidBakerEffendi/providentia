Excellent pizza, tasty sauce and crust.  Not typical thin east-coast pizza, but quite good.  They advertise a Chicago-style pizza.  As a former resident of Chicago, I can state this this is certainly not Chicago style; I'd recommend their regular pizza. Nice atmosphere inside; service is good, though I haven't been there when it was busy.  Overall, well recommended for the pizza.
