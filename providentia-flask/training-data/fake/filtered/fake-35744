As some other reviewers have pointed out, Cafe Triskell is really small. But the food certainly makes up for the cramped fit. The crepes are certainly very unique. I had a dessert crepe with strawberry jam and it was very rich and delicious. The service is very quick and friendly too. Well certainly be coming back.
