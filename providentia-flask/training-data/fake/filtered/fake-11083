This place is amazing.  We arrived late on a Friday night for dinner after seeing a movie at the Kip's Bay theater.  They checked to make sure the kitchen was still open and then welcomed us in.  We had an amazing arugula salad to start - super crispy and delicious granny smith apple slices were an unexpected and welcome addition to this kind of salad, and then we shared the pappardelle with pork ragu, and wow!  The pappardelle was obviously made in house and both my husband and I couldn't get over how tender and delicious the pasta was -- the ragu was just a tasty bonus!  Great service, and our night was their first with the liquor license, so they're all set in that department.
