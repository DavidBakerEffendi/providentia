If good food and good service are why you go to a restaurant... Eat here. If maintaining your right to be a Glasshole wherever you go is important, go somewhere else. I don't get to New York very often, but Â when I do, my wife and I make a point to come here. I think that says enough, particularly because I've enjoyed everything I've eaten, so I can't even recommend one dish over another. :)
