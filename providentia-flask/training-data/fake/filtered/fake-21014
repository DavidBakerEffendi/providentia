My friend took me here on a Wednesday evening for my birthday, and I can't really complain about anything. The service was excellent, but it also wasn't very busy. Our waiter when through and told us everything not on the menu that they had and gave very good descriptions, including the prices. They were very on top of keeping our water glass filled. All the food we ordered was really good. We got the bureki for appetizer, the winter ravioli for my entree, and then the pagoto homemade ice cream trio to share. It seem likes they have different flavors of ice cream every evening, and they were all very interesting and distinctly Greek. My friend also really seemed to like the cold Soumada almond drink. Overall, an excellent first experience with Greek cuisine for me.
