Just went  there yesterday. Amazingly delicious and healthy food!  The dinner plate portions were good with a variety of sides. The eggplant salad was yummy. The falafels were crispy and tasty, the best I have had yet. The food was freshly cooked and not greasy. Good ambiance, clean, and the staff was friendly. The only regret was we didn't have dessert because we were stuffed.
