This place is great! First of all the place itself was really cute, and our waiter was very polite. Agood place for adate.The food was tasty, and being vegetarian, I was happy they had seitan. The service was fairly good, despite only one waiter being on the floor. If you're craving good Mexican, I highly recommend coming out here.
