Spectacular!  The food was delicious, there was a variety of dishes ordered by the group at our table and everyone was raving about their menu choices.  I had the basil salmon it was awesome, my husband had the duck and he couldn't stop talking about how good it was.  The staff is friendly and the enviroment is stylish and welcoming.  Highly reccomend trying Siam Glastonbury out if you are in the area!
