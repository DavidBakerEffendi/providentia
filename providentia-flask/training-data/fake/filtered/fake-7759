I love Handy's.  Rarely do you find places anymore with this type of charm.  The counter invites conversation from total strangers, especially the proprieter, Earl who aside from being a die-hard Yankees fan, is a great guy who always remembers your name and 9 times out of 10 can tell you exactly what you're there to order.  The prices are great and the food is comfort food at it's best!  I started out being recommended that I HAD to have a Texas Burger, which stood by it's recommendation, and now I'm hooked on Handy's breakfast.  Eggs McHandy - with bacon!  I have to stop myself from making it a daily habit!  Earl also makes me a wrap of my own creation, not on the menu and it's delicious (chicken ranch wrap!).  I HIGHLY recommend just going there for the sweet potato tots (they're delicious!) - but ANYTHING from Handy's is delicious and they could not have a better staff there.  Everyone is so friendly.
