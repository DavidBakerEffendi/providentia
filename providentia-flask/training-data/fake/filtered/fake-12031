My partner and I tried BLVD last night. Enjoyed the food, the new owners and the atmosphere. He had the turkey meatloaf and I ordered the baked chicken. The chicken had a dusting of what might have been cinnamon. Was not 100% sold. I will have to eat my leftovers to know if I will reorder it. The biscuits were incredible! Dessert- warm apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream - pure ambrosia! Will be back for brunch and expect to make this a regular spot for grub. Looking forward to trying the much talked about macaroni and cheese topped with crispy bacon. Today's restaurant owners in Harlem seem to be doing away with Soul Food. These guys are smart enough to bring some of it back! It is not your down home, hole in the wall (where the food is usually the best) experience, but we'll take it. Congratulations.
