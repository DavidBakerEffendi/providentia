I've walked by this place a lot lately and I kept wanting to try it out purely based on aesthetics.  I didn't know anything about it. The short version: great ambiance, okay food, horrible service.  Possibly the worst service I've had in a while. I suggested Pio Pio to a group of friends and one of them called at 11:00 am to make a reservation that same night. No problem they said. When I friend arrived 45 minutes before the reservation, the restaurant had no record of it.  Strike 1. They then put us back on the list and said a seat right around the same time (9:00 PM) should be possible.  We weren't seated until almost 10.  That's bad enough, but the entire time, nobody bothered to ask if we wanted a drink or a menu for appetizers.  Strike 2. Once we were seated, we had to wait for a server, they didn't bother to bring us water until we had already ordered sangria, and disappeared after we got our food (no follow-up). And to boot, the music (although great) was so loud we couldn't even hold a conversation. Strike 3. With that said, the food was decent (I have a penchant for South American) and the decor/ambiance was awesome.  The music was great and the sangria was very tasty.  But the abominable service sank the ship.
