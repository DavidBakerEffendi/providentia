Ate here today for lunch. Was not crowded. I had the cubano with shoestring fries. Although it doesnt taste like an "authentic" cubano, the sandwich is still good, the bread definitely makes it even better. The shoestring fries are extremely thin, lol, i was surprised at first when i got them, they felt like a pile of paper strips, overall they were pretty good. Overall i guess i could say the spotted pig was enjoyable, nothing out of this world though....
