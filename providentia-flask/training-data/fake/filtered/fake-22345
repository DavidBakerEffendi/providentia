I thought the 5pm rule was a good middle ground. I was wrong. All of the sudden, I was surrounded by more children than adults today. I'm sorry, but no matter how you look at it, bars are not good play spaces for kids. But that's what the bar became. So I left. And I told my three friends I would meet them elsewhere because the bar stools where they would have sat, since all the other seats were taken, were being used to built a fort. Again, DW, is it worth turning away 4 drinking guys for the one or two beers that dad was having (mom had a coke)? By the way, have a good time cleaning up all those Cheerios or whatever snacks those were. Hope it's worth it for you.
