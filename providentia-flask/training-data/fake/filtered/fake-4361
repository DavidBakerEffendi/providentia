I was visiting a family member at Bayonne Hospital and went across the street expecting vinny's pizzaria but saw that it was now Maria's Pizzaria Restaurant.  The place was nice so I ordered a slice and a chicken parm sandwich and it was very good.  The next week we had a vegetable pie delivered along with a couple dinner entrees and it was really the best food i've had in a long time.  I've been to other pizzarias in Bayonne and to me this is the best one by far
