I came all the way from Maryland because Philly is supposed to have the best cheese steaks. Geno's didn't deliver. The bread was chewy, the sandwich was barely warm, it didn't have much meat in it, and the fries were just ok. The woman at the counter was rushing me, she asked me for my order twice before the customer in front of me even left the counter. Â It was like a McDonald's for cheese steaks. You probably have to be famous to get a fresh one. It didn't taste bad but I've had better in D.C. I did enjoy all of the pictures and patches though.
