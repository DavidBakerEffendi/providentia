Got take out from here on a whim. I got the roti canai and the duck tacos. Yes, the roti was thicker than I'm used to but still delicious and the curry dipping sauce was great. Duck tacos were AMAZING! Just the right combo of spicy and sweet, rich and light. It was enough for a lunch portion for me (2 large tacos). I'll be back.
