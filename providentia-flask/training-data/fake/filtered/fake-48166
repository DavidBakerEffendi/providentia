Met two friends here on a Friday night at 7pm.  We were able to secure three seats at the bar where we remained for the next... 5 hours or so.  We sipped cocktails and munched on some small bar plates.  Risotto, chicken liver pate and devils on horseback.  Delicious.  Nothing AMAZING, in terms of innovation, but delicious none the less.  Bar tenders were attentive.  It's a good winter meeting spot, cozy, warm, dark.  It fills up pretty quick later in the evening but it was not an obnoxious crowd.
