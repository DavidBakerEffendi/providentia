La sagesse des foules. I believe that would be the French for "the wisdom of the crowd." I was led to La Sirène by the glowing crowd-sourced reviews and was not disappointed; flawlessly executed food. We began with the octopus appetizer, which was copious and extremely tasty, and followed that with the filet mignon de porc and the hanger steak. The latter was perfectly cooked, generously proportioned, and had a wonderful garlic and pepper side sauce, while the pork was tender and excellent with a sauce that may have been even better than the steak's. The Bordeaux I had by the $9 glass was also very good. Also, the side-plate vegetables that accompany the main dishes, which in many restaurants would be an after-thought, were also quite wonderful: four or five different vegetables (green beans, purées, etc.) that all sang. The ambience is fine, but the food is the real star.
