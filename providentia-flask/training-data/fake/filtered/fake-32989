If I didn't have to watch my girlish figure, i would eat a Jose's burrito for breakfast, lunch and dinner. This is the home of the best burrito in Philadelphia. It's the size of Texas and it has just the perfect amount of every essential burrito ingrediant distributed evenly throughout the burrito. I would suggest going there to eat, take-out just isn't the same for me anyway. Unfortunately they do not feed you chips and salsa while you are waiting for your food -but it only builds up anticipation for your meal. This place is 1st date material, I know this from experience.
