Okay, I'm coming out of retirement (she said self-aggrandisingly) to write this - not that anyone needs to hear a Lucali rave from me.  I'm the first to admit I'm not one for the angels-dancing-on-a-can-of-San-Marzano that is the Dialectics of New York Pizza and is, incidentally, the best judge of a bore since people started pretending to enjoy Pinter plays.  But! I do like good food, and I love Lucali. The pizza, others can describe better than I, but I will say that I've been probably 20 times and, even when Mark wasn't happy with everything due to weather or other vagaries, I've always enjoyed it tremendously. I've been coming here since it opened, and I love it. Sure, now I am friendly with a lot of folks here, but not because I'm anybody special: Mark and the staff reward loyalty, like anyone else!  Yeah, the waits are long; there are no secrets in New York. But in my experience, the staff is nothing but kind and professional, and if you're courteous and polite and have reasonable expectations, you'll have a wonderful experience! When I read about people who were treated "rudely," quite frankly I'd be curious to see how they behaved themselves: sure, the staff may have had a bad day, but I have seen people be unbelievably entitled and peremptory and the hostess deal with it with grace and politeness. People talk about being rushed; I've seen folks linger for half an hour with the bill while a pregnant woman waited outside - so, keep in mind these things go both ways! It's funny how invested I feel in writing this, and I think it's a testament to my experience there as a regular.  Do go, and be nice, and bring wine - you'll be rewarded! Is it the best pizza in America? I neither know nor care - it's delicious, and t's a great place.
