So I heard some great reviews about this place,  so my friend and I decided I check I out. I checked out the menu online and knew what to ordered.I heard they usually have long lines so we went there when it opened. This a cash only place. The ATM available was out of order. We were promptly seated. I ordered a hurricane drink. I was extremely disappointed. I felt like I was drinking fruit punch. When I brought my concern to my waitress, she was unapologic and ignored my complaint.  A word to the wise when it comes to drinks to this establishment , there are 3 options: drink b4 u come; burn ur 10 dollars instead of a drink; or order an nonacholic drink. On another note the wings were great fresh and pipping  hot, I enjoyed them. As for the main, we ordered the   crab and lobster combo. Since I explored the website in advance and knew what I wanted to ordered, I had my heart set on the crab. However, when I placed my order I was then information that there was a surcharge to the listing price due to the fact that the shipment of crabs they received was larger than normal.  It would be nice if they post a warning of a price increase on the website for situations like this. The Food arrived, it tasted well seasoned however greasy. But on a positive note not salty at ALL.  On sad note although we spend over 140 and tip, we were no where near full. I suggest that u come here for the novalty for crafish and seafood nice place to come to. However if u r looking to leave full, don't bother. Overall, I would say the food is decent however the service is less than mediocre. At the price point,  you would expect better service but  I leave it for u to judge.
