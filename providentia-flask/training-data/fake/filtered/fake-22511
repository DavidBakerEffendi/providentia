I was very disappointed in Mediterra. The menu is surprising limited. Additionally, and perhaps more disconcerting, the service was horrendous. Our waiter was extremely rude and suggested that since we did not order enough food, we should not have sit in the dining room because the restaurant was so busy. Of, course, it was not our choice to eat in the dining room as we were seated there by the a woman working the front area. We chose to leave at that point, and complained to management. I have to give some credit to management as a representative ran after us a block away from the restaurant to apologize. I credit them for their concern, but I cannot recommend eating at Mediterra.
