My wife loves going to the cheese steaks shops in the city so I have waited in line many times with her at Pat's and Geno's, that is normal here in Philly. Sometimes it is a 45 minute wait because it is a definate tourist attraction. Although I have not been in Philly in the past few months, Â I have tried these in the past and they were very good. They are kind of expensive at over $7 each, but you need more then one to eat and the workers are very hasty and have little patience for new customers. It is definately worth the cost, as it is great tradition that everyone must experience if you ever see Philladelphia. We usually end up here whenever we are in the city.
