I was introduced by a college boyfriend and fell love with the square pizza and the spumoni. I now live in Queens and when my ex-husband saw me bring pizza home from brookyln he thought I was crazy. I gave him one slice and had to hide the rest so I would have some for me.  Even converted my non-pizza eating mom into a pizza lover-hers was the round with extra cheese and mushrooms and double cut.  I no longer have a car to get there--wish they would deliver to queens. The BEST PIZZA IN NY--in the country!!!    Its been 40 years since my first slice there and would rather have their pizza than the best steak or caviar.  You must get it!!!!
