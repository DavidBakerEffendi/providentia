ZERO stars. I cannot emphasize how much of a rip-off this place is. The food is ridiculously overpriced. Try $7.50 for a pint of Tom Kha veggie soup!!!!! The quality is horrible. The aforementioned soup was devoid of flavor, the only taste was rancid oil/coconut milk. $9.00 for 2 veggie fresh rolls.$12.00 for a pint sized pineapple rice with 3 pieces of pineapple in it. The Larb salad I had to toss-so salty/fishy and hot It was inedible. Owner sneered when asked for peanut sauce, his establishment is 'different' he tells me. He envisions he is a 4 star Manhattan Chef with lines around the block. Actually only one other person was there-no wonder the ingredients tasted rancid. While waiting I noted a female cook in back coughing all over the can of coconut milk she had just opened, then she used her finger-bare fingers to scrape the Â food from inside the top lid, into another dish.... Need I continue? Take out dinner for 2 came to almost 70 dollars!
