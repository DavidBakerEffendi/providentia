The food is amazing, the folks are super friendly, and the place is adorable. I went with a group of friends and ate off all their plates. Everything was delicious. The biscuits with honey and jam were Â superb, and I could have eaten my weight in Jezebel wings. We had a sampler plate that included pickles, tiny biscuits, and ham. I had no idea ham could be that tasty.
