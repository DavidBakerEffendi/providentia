Despite all of the stellar reviews below, I was disappointed in my meal at melt shop.  I got a bowl of tomato soup that was only half full, and a meager amount of bacon (that cost me an additional 1.75) on my grilled cheese.  The actual grilled cheese was alright, but I do not think it lived up to the hype or the $11+ cost.
