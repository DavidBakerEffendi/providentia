Am I the first vegan/vegetarian review?!  Super.  This place is a vegan dream.   I spoke with the waitstaff and owner and they pointed out more options than I'm used to--plus they offered to modify the few dishes that just have a meat component that can be easily left out.  (No beef broth in the "vegetarian" dishes here.) The imperial roles are amazing and the papaya salad (without shrimp) was incredibly flavorful, crisp and refreshing on a sweltering day.  I had leftovers and ate them for breakfast the next day, and they were still bright and fresh. The lemongrass tofu was fantastic...I'm still dreaming about it.  I would marry the Eggplant.  It has an incredible flavor profile and is everything I miss about Vietnamese food in the SF bay area (sob, sigh). My meat-eating and okra-loving boyfriend loved the spicy shrimp satay and okra.  Okra can go so many different directions...we hate it in the west african place near my house, but crave it from Falansai.  They made me a vegan okra sample.  :) Overall I love this restaurant...if there are 3 things I point to, to remind myself how much I love Bushwick, it's this new addition to the Roberta's/Momo triangle, Goodbye Blue Monday, and the apartment I've loved for years.  :)
