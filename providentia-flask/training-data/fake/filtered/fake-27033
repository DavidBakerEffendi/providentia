This used to be one of my favorite local places, and I still go from time to time, but I've had a few complaints that feel are worth sharing. I will say that their food is consistently good (especially their pizza) and they have a good beer and wine list. So, here are my complaints: A regular bartender calls women "girls." I'm in my late 40's, I've sat at the bar with female friends in their 50's & 60's and the 30-something bartender always calls us "girls." A few nights ago I went in with a male friend and this time, the bartender read the specials to my male friend. Not once did he make eye contact with me - he looked directly at my friend only as he read the specials. The owner has a tendency to sit at what is, to me, the prime bar stool on one end. I did come in once with a friend and we went to sit toward that end, and the owner moved, but why would an owner take the best stool (off to the side, in a quiet corner) in the house? I went for brunch once & ordered the fresh-squeezed OJ on the menu. The OJ had turned & I told the waitress that it was bad. She told me that they fresh squeeze OJ every OTHER day and that this is from yesterday. She said she would squeeze some fresh. If I'm paying several dollars for a glass of fresh squeezed OJ, I expect it to be squeezed today. The owner then came up to me & tried to tell me that my OJ was "just squeezed yesterday & is fine - some oranges are sweeter than others." He then offered to squeeze some fresh, but he was clearly doing me a favor. The new glass of OJ they brought me was fine. So, good food, good beer, and good wine, but I find the attitude of the staff, and the customer service to be lacking. The last few times I went there - Saturday nights - the place was dead. I'm wondering if their lack of good customer relations will be their downfall.
