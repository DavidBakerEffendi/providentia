Went there with the family food and ice cream were good. Ice cream actually quite good, it's the atmosphere that's lacking. The staff is young and only a few seem to know what to do with themselves and no one seems happy, you would think that ice cream and candy would be Â a happy place. There is no music playing in the dining room which makes it feel even more somber, then the only decorations on the walls is pictures of sopranos cast members, I like the show as much as anybody else but again maybe add something to cheer the place up a bit?
