Okay, Bunny's is actually my preference for this type of thin crust pie, but the Star is a landmark and you gotta go at least once.  The lines are long to wait for a table, the beer sometimes isn't tapped right (but they have a large selection of bottled beer), but you still have to do it at least once.  We enjoy it from time to time, especially if we've been to Montclair for a movie and are driving back to Maplewood via the back roads.
