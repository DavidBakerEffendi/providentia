Great pizza! Fun bathrooms! Terrific staff! Giant TVs are either a plus or a minus depending on who you are...if you like sports and a nice cold beer, it's a plus, if you're with kids and you're trying to have a conversation, fuggedaboutit. I would give it 5 stars, but there is one particular bartender there who is just hipper than thou and I refuse to go in when he's there.
