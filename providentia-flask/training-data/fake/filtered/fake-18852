Parkway just celebrated it's 1st birthday,  They opened a year ago today.  Great food at reasonable prices, friendly staff and wonderful service. I go there a couple time a week, and have introduced many friends to the great  homemade everything !  !  !  I Everyone loves it.   This is the best diner in the Chittenden area.  Breakfast is super, you may have to wait a few minutes to get a table but the wait is well worth it.  The daily special are exceptional.  Their homemade soups are the best in this area.  It is an added plus that they use local foods. If you haven't found this "gem of South Burlington", check it out.
