Went to Get Fresh for brunch and was, once again, extremely pleased with my experience.  Food is consistently fresh and creatively prepared.  Best staff in Park Slope.  Attentive, pleasant, and very knowledgeable of the menu. The food, airy atmosphere, and charming staff make Get Fresh one of our favorite picks in the area.
