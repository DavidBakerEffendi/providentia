Had a fabulous dinner. Based on Yelp reviews, we tried the aged manchego w/ truffled lavender honey - wonderful!! Gambas al ajillo - better than other versions of this i've tried over the years. Patatas bravas were incredible - potatoes cooked to velvety perfection and topped with a tangy rouille. Dessert: arroz con leche - wow! Manager/maitre d' made sure my 92-year-old mother and i were seated in the least noisy part of the restaurant (which is not saying much, but at least we could *sort of* hear each other! Great service and great food.
