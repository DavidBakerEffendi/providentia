Randomly chose this place since it was close to where we parked on Bloomfield and served wine! We were pleasantly surprised by great service. I checked in in yelp, which i rarely do, and received a complimentary gift bag with really nice olive oil, spices and sea salt ... i loved this place already and hadn't even tried the food yet! After sitting down we received complimentary pita points with nice seasoning. We weren't too hungry, so we shared the combo platter. The portions were huge! So this was enough for 2 and then we had another hot appetizer with a great tomato base with pork and potato...yum! A great selection of greek specialties ... we loved the tzatziki! The best though was the complimentary baklava that we received from the Maitre 'D....it was amazing. We practically put the plate up to our face and licked it! Good food good service ... we will be back to see Pasqual! Thanks again!
