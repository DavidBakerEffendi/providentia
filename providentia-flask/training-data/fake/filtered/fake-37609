Nicest owner/ chef I have ever met.  Their food is reasonably priced and they have great deals for large orders.  The food is amazing and they are friendly and punctual.  I have been ordering from there for years and the sushi is always fresh, orders are always correct and the customer service is fantastic.  I am usually very critical of sushi places but this place nails it every time, that's why I keep going back.
