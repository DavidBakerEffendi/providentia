Can this place please open up a Florida location! this falafel shop has the best falafel, lentil soup & hummus anywhere in the United States. Everytime I fly in to NY late at night, It is the first go to destination. If anyone complains about this place, then all I have to say is shame on you! Get your money back because you don't deserve this good of a falafel!
