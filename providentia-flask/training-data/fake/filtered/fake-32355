This is my first yelp review ever as I had to create an account to rave about the King of Falafel and Shawarma cart on Broadway. Â They are located a few blocks from the school I work at on the way home and the delicious smell of that cart plagues me every day. I had their beef and chicken plate (Freddy Junior) and found it tasty but it does not compare to their Chicken and Rice. That plate is money. The mix of rice (either basmati or yellow) with Chicken, salad, tomatoes, pickled turnips along with their hot sauce and white sauce it the most amazing combination. Top that off with a delicious falafel and you just can't go wrong. I've had my share of falafel carts and this is by far the best. In addition, Freddy is amazingly friendly and has a great memory. I saw him greet a customer that hadn't stopped by in a year! That's how devoted he is to his customers. Not to mention, I work for a non-profit organization and he was so excited to do community service work. So if you're looking for a place to eat, go to the King of Falafel and Shawarma. Big portions, big taste, and big hearts.
