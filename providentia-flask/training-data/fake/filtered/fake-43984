ok so it always has soccer on the tube and it has nice beers.  Nice right?  Have you had the french onion soup with the brazzed tenderloin sitting on the top of it?  Holy crap!!! Mike the chef should get an award for that one.  Ribs in Mac and cheese is also brilliant.  Bar tenders are a bit care free but what ever.  Great place.
