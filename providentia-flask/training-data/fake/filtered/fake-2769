We had come across this restaurant by error due to highway detour and was super packed but left to return at later date. So yesterday we visited.  WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!!!!! As we were seated, we noticed that the table glasses were filthy along with others around us and as we proceeded to point this out to our waiter, he grabbed them and tried to clean them in front of us instead of apologizing and getting us fresh ones. He gave us a moment to review the menu and as my husband put his hand down he touched the plate on the table and it was gross - greasy, still dirty and such.  I immediately proceeded to check the silverware and one set definitely needed to be replaced. We were now worried at the cleanliness of the place overall.  The food was less than ok.  My husband ordered the "roasted pork" and it was more of a boiled thing.   From here it was downhill - our beans were blah, rice just so and the sweet plantains definitely were cooked earlier and left to sit in it's cooking oil. We ate what we could, asked for the check and got the heck out of there; folks it was only 3:00pm and hardly any reason for this.  It felt more like a fast food joint gone horribly bad!
