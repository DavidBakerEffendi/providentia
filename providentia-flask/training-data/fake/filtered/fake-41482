I was there about a week ago & my wife ordered a chicken teriyaki, which was OK but nothing special. But I had the super-Fuji and we shared one of the special rolls of the day...AND I have to say sushi was FABULOUS!!!!. Â The Madai & Kikapachi was SPECTACULAR!!! Even my wife was crazy about the special roll we had. I do admit that it was a little pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. I will definitely come back!!!
