I have only been there once. Admittedly, you do not go for the athmosphere, but the plaace is quite comfortable and clean. The food is very good if you are up to something different than a typical "meat and potato" mainstream american food. It is not high gourmet "Haut Cuizine" but very enjoyable Serbian Food. There are plenty of choices and the prices are more reasonable than 90% of other restaurants. All four of us had a great time and liked the BYOB feature too.
