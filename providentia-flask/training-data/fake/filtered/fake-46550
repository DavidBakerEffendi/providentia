Anthonys rotisserie chicken dipped in their homemade hot sauce, is one of my favorite things in the world.  Ill admit I havent tried anything else, but who needs to!  I love their wing sauce, its fantastic.  They only have rotisserie chickens at certain times, which is a bit of a pain when you are on a set lunch break, but who cares when it tastes soooo good!
