Pretty much perfect. Honestly I was shocked we were able to get in at 7pm with no reservation on a Thurs. The best thing we had was the pappardelle (sp). That said, everything was great. Our server really went out of the way. He was great in general, but when we mentioned that we were from out of town he took the time to write out several recommendations for restaurants and bars for the rest of our visit.
