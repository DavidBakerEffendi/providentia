Delivery review: I would usually order pizza from here, which I love. Shroom town and formaggio Bianco are my favourite. However, last 3 times I ordered pizza, they would deliver literally patched up pie. What I believe happens is they put different pizza slices together to create one new pizza. After the first time I thought, oh maybe they were really busy... But then after 2nd and third time I had enough! Pizza was clearly made out of at least 3 different pizzas which didn't even made the pretty round shape, it was sprinkled with cheese over all the topings, and crust was black burnt- WTH!? I'm paying to have a fresh made pizza to order, I'm so disappointed! I love the pizza, I really do, but why would I want to pay for something that's not fresh!? Posto step it up!
