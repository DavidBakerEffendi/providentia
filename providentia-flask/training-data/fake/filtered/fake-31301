Never again... Bad service and I walked out with my family.  I'm a big person for service. And this being one of the few times I've been there, I headed up to the post where you stand to be seated and got yelled at and told "excuse you" for standing to be seated. Apparently I didn't know now you have to pay before being seated... I sat down and waited my turn trying to shake off the rude vibes... then as its our turn. We'd get interrogated.  Asked if how old was my younger sister and if she ate like a kid or adult. And told just for her was $13.09. I'm sorry, your sign clearly says Monday-Saturday dinner $10.xx. as I translated for my family (they speak Spanish) the staff kept repeating for us to "pay now before eat". I asked for a moment and they rudely kept insisting. That's when I had it. Said forget it said they were rude and I didn't like the bad service and took my family. Ended up going to Tripple A Diner in East Hartford. With the prices they're charging and the bad attitude having staff, I'm sure this place won't last. Enjoy while it does!
