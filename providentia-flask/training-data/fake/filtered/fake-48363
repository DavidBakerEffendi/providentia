Born and raised in South Jersey I have been to all of the 'known' cheesesteak places in Philly. Pats and Genos are virtually of almost the same quality. Big name, overpriced, rude staff and average to below average steaks. More roll then meat and little seasoning. I don't order whiz anymore because they saturate the sandwich in it. Variety is terrible. If you want heavy, delicious steaks and roast porks youll go to Tony Lukes. They have 3x the variety and are worth every penny. Jim's steaks isn't bad either.
