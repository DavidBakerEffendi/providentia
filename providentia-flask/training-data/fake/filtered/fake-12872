Everything was fantastic other than the hostess. We had reservations for 8:00 and were there ahead of time. Instead of giving us our table, she sat four parties - which she seemed to know - ahead of us. When I asked about our table after a 15 minute wait, she was rude and had poor attitude. Although I believe in giving great service to "regulars", it should not be at the expense of others Especially when you are dropping over $300 for dinner. We were there to celebrate my moms' birthday and waiting for 30 minutes while others were seated put a damper on the celebratory mood. I definitively do not think  Le Chéri would have approved. Although the wine list was fantastic and the food delicious, I will have to think twice.
