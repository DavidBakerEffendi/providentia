My husband and I had a fabulous dinner at Marc Vertri's latest venture Amis.  We are big fans of Osteria but we actually enjoyed the more relaxed vibe at Amis even better.  The service and the ambience is extremely friendly and engaging.  Highlights of the evening were the arancini; the ravioli and asparagus; and the eggplant capanota bruschetta.  Other hot sellers seemed to be the swordfish pasta dish and the artichoke dish.  We will definitely return to try those specialties.  The wine list was a pleasant surprise with nice diversity and good value.  Our bill was also extremely reasonable.  Amis is now my new neighborhood haunt.
