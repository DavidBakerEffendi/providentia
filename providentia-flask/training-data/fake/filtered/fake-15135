Many people, including myself, have allergies or intolerances to different foods. I have an intolerance to gluten (the protein found in wheat, rye, barley and some oats). So this restaurant is so awesome to me because I can go there and find gluten-free breadsticks, pizza, beer, paninis and baked goods including their delicious tiramisu! I can't eat any regular bread or pizza or pasta so every time I visit New York City, this place is a special treat for me to visit. They also have a lot of vegan items as well. I wish they'd open one in Orlando... :)
