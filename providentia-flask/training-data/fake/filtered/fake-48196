I think it's overhyped... really... trust me... its good... but I think five guys fries are as good as their fries.. if not better...  the main course is fries... and u get dressings on the side for dollar each...  dressings are ok... we were 3 together .. and tried rosemary mayo... cheddar cheese.. and mexican ketchup... rosemary mayo was ok.. cheddar cheese sucks... mexican ketchup was the best one... we ordered double... that is priced at 7.50 something.. which is ok.. with the amount of fries they give... quantity is good... but the taste is ok... try five guys cajun style fries.. well done.. its better... though u don't get the choice of dressings there...
