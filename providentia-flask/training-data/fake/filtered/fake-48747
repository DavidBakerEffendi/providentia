This restaurant is a pick-up joint. The bar is soooo crowded and you can't hear yourself think no matter where you sit. The food is really not shabby. I thought it was very good but how can you eat when they seat you at a teeny tiny table for 2, next to the bar. People crashing into you, garbage cans being dropped. Drunk people falling over you, etc. etc. etc. What a nightmare. They should have really paid me for my trouble. I will never go back! Way too many good restaurants where you can actually carry on a conversation with some one. If you want to pick someone up and you are in your 40's to 70's then this is the place. Otherwise, find something else.
