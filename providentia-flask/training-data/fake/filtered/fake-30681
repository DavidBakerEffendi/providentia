Not a bad place. Kinda place you don't mind going to on a Sat night or a Tuesday night casual hangout. Decent beer selection. Didn't order any food but will next time around. Menu looked good but just ate before we got there. Atmosphere seems very chill and laid back and clientele seemed cool. Hope to make this one of my regular spots. Actually the whole block seemed really cool. Try it you won't be dissapointed.
