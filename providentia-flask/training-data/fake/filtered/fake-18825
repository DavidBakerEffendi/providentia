Ordered take-out on a Sunday night. They gave us a 45 minute wait estimate, it ended up taking an hour and 40 minutes. No apology, no discount given. The food was HORRIBLE. I was excited to order from there because they have so much vegetarian food, but it was a huge disappointment. The veggie "chicken" was inedible. The veggie wonton soup was edible but extremely mediocre. The dumplings were so chewy I couldn't even swallow them. Â It didn't help that none of the food was hot. My bf's general tsos chicken was also disgusting, he barely ate any. Will not be ordering from there again, needless to say.
