Went there a few weeks ago, let me tell you, this place is sleek and very sophisticated, but be prepared to leave hungry (portions are tiny tiny tiny) and with a light wallet, over priced beers and food....sorely disappointed at my own ignorance for not reading up on this place beforehand. The little food I ate was delicious but left me wanting more but torn because my groups bill was already around $250!
