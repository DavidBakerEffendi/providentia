We had a wonderful dinner and this has been our 3rd visit. Each time the food and staff were equally good. Â We went when they first opened in the fall of 2012, then in February of this year follow by two weeks ago in July. We have always gone on the weekend, two of the times on a Sat night once on a Sun. Food is delicious. We have tried many different entrees and haven't had a bad one yet. The ribs are fav of my husband and I thought the meatball appetizer was phenomenal. The meatloaf was also delectable and our servers on each occasion tended to our needs. It's a shame to see so many negative reviews because we really enjoy going here and the proximity to home. I usually do not write restaurant reviews, as I can be picky. However after reading many negative posts I wanted to highlight our positive experience. The place is very good and I do hope more people give it a chance.
