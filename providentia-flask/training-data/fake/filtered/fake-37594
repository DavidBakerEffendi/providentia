A true gem in the neighborhood.  The imperial rolls are so decadent and just right.  I could eat those for breakfast lunch and dinner.  I've been there a couple times since they opened and have been impressed every time.  The fish in claypot is my favorite and so is the ginger chicken.  The lamb dish didn't do it for me. Good wine, good service, and good atmosphere.  Thank god they're only 2 blocks from the subway.
