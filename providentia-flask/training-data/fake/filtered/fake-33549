I made a reservation on a Wednesday night. The place was pretty much empty, only a couple of tables taken. Once we were seated, we've waited 20 minutes for someone to come up to us which I could understand if it was on a busy Saturday night but that wasn't the case here. Â  For dinner I had the chicken with spinach (very bland) and my other guest had the gnocchi which she describes as nothing special. We decided not to have dessert and go elsewhere for a more pleasant environment. Overall, the food was not the best and the staff seemed miserable. Very disappointed, I will not be returning.
