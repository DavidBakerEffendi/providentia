One of my favorite places whenever I visit Philadelphia. Waffles are the star of the show and you can tell the batter is made in house filled with deliciousness. They just started a dinner menu on Thursday & Friday and both the Oxtails and Coconut Shrimp are simply to die for. Yummy!!! All the items I have tried have been amazing and the service is equally as warm, proficient and pleasant. My favorite part of the experience is the decor and kids room. While I sip my coffee in the largest, coolest mugs I have seen in a while, my 4 year daughter gets to play in the kids room with the train set and chaulk board. My kid has never requested a restaurant by name, but Rose Petals is clearly on top for her. Cudos Rose Petals!!!
