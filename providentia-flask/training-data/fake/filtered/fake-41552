What's great about Fish is their fresh seafood comes in generous portion, affordable $ and with friendly customer service. I wanted to order lobster roll but the thought of it coming with french fries make me hesitate. The waitress asked me what would I like instead. She then offered me spinach to which I gladly accepted. It became a guilt-free & satisfying meal. My husband ordered the yellow fin tuna. It was cook medium well perfectly & comes in generous portion. When the bill finally come, I was half expecting that the price will increase since any menu alteration will usually give people a reason to jack up their price. But they didn't. Such great experience will definitely bring us back again, soon!
