I used to like it, until I bought a Caesar Salad from him one day, and there was a small rock in it! I'm not at all joking. I didn't realise until I bit it, thinking it was a crouton on my fork. Â Now there is a huge chip in my tooth that I'll have to pay to get fixed. Not at all worth it for a $3 salad. Don't go to Jon's Lunch.
