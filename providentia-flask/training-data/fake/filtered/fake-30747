I had a very disappointing Â experience. Let me start off by saying I liked this restaurant. It's close to my apt and I've been there at least 5x in the past 2 months. The food is well executed and the service is usually good. A couple weeks ago I had gone there and ordered 2 half pastas as my main and when I got home I realized that they had charged me for 2 full orders but whatever.... I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was an honest mistake. Tonight however I had a horrible experience. I ordered the 4 course prix fixe menu. It's about 100 bucks which isn't cheap for the amount of food you're getting. (The plates are tiny) Anyway I got the steak as my main course. It was super tasty but Very small. 3 slices. About half way through the dish I saw that there was a Hair seared onto the steak!! I peeled it off to inspect it. I didn't want to believe it. I called the waiter over and when I showed it to him he said "oh ok" and took it away. I sat there for 5 minutes until he came back. He said "I'm sorry about that but we inspected it and realized that it wasn't a hair but a piece of thread". That's bullshit. It was hair. Then as a solution to the problem he offered to take that item off of my prix fixe. I was still hungry though. The portions are tiny to begin with and I only got about half of my main course. I don't care about saving 40 bucks. I'm already in for 250 with my gf and myself. So if They take it off the bill then I'm still spending 200 and leaving hungry and pissed off. It's stupid. I was very disappointed with the whole thing. One of the worst restaurant experiences I've had in NYC overall. Sad because I was starting to like it.
