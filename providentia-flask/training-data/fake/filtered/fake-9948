it was not as bad as it looked from the outside, the food was ok, salty but ok. but they push you to buy drinks and then when it was all done, they charged me even for my 1&half year old, even thou I complained about it, they still charged me for her. they said under 2 is free but still they charged. what can I say, I was not in the mood to start a war with them so I just paid it and left.
