When I first entered I had medium expectations. Reading previous reviews I noticed a few things I would be looking out for. Everything that I was looking out for was aced. Never quite had a meal like this one. When you first walk down the alleyway, you see lights strung all around the front door. When you enter, you are met with a very charming little room with several different doors, all leading to anther room. My party sat at the booths, which were amazingly comfortable. On the wall up the stair case, there are the biggest dear heads WITH antlers that you will ever see. The top floor was charming, although I sat on the first floor. The service was 100%. With only a few slight, but very acceptable mistakes, my waitress proved that she was worthy of the job. An earlier review stated that they had to go get their own silverware, and that they weren't pleased by the waitress's enthusiasm. Both of these mistakes that were previously mentioned should be taken back. My waitress was enthusiastic and told me everything I wanted to know clearly. Spectacular job. The appetizers were incredible. The devils on the horse back was like eating had many layers of flavor. The crisp bacon gave way to the beautiful Â taste of the cheese and prune combo. The artichoke dip was cheesy and crispy on the top. It was very savory and went well with the rest of the meal. Now the food. I myself had the lamb stew, with a side of mashed potatoes. The lamb was so tender that when you stuck your fork in it, it crumbled to bits. Beautifully put together with the sauce and the mashed potatoes, it was the perfect combination. The potato cake was crispy, not too oily, and richer than hash browns. It was very tasty, and fit nicely with meal. The cooked carrots were cooked to perfection, and everything else was as well. All in all, it was a very good experience!
