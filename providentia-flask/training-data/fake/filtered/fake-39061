I was totally underwhelmed by the food. Six of us ate at Basso56 after a recent theater trip to NYC. 5 of us were early and were allowed to sit at our table until our 6th showed up. Thanks. Drinks were somewhat expensive, and the Cosmopolitans were heavy on the cranberry juice. Even after requesting less cranberry on our second round, the drink was made exactly the same. The Calamari appetizer was made with what seemed like paper thin squid. not much flavor, although the tomato sauce was good. Our entrees were all mediocre at best. The seafood risotto came with some of the most anemic clams and mussels I have ever seen, the risotto was very dry and bland, and the shrimp were medium size. The seafood linguini was a very small portion. My wife hardly ever finishes her dinner, but she finished this and was still hungry. We passed on dessert, not wanting to spend any more money here. With tip, dinner for 6 was $370.00. I hardly write negative reviews, but this place was not worth the money.
