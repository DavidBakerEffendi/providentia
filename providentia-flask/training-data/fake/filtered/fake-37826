I have eaten at this restaurant about 4 times since it opened. The food is ok and sadly the pancakes are probably the weakest item on the menu. But worst than the food is the service. The first time I was in the bill was given to me and I had to wander around looking for my server to pay for it. Only to find out he should have taken it from me. But the worst was today. After getting the bill which was 9.58 I gave my server $20. When she came back she gave me $10 in change. Ok, where was the other $0.42?  When I asked the server she told me "we always round the bill up or down". Really?  First not when you pay by credit card they don't and more importantly who gave them permission to keep the extra money. I know $0.42 is not a lot but multiply that by the number of times they probably do it in a day!  When I asked to speak to the manager he repeated the "we round up or down" party line & then said it was the servers fault because she should have used the register in the front. Either way that was the last meal I eat at this place. BTW I was about to leave a $2 tip when they helped themselves to some extra money
