Over-rated. First off, the sushi was very good, but not off the charts. I've had better. The appetizers were overcooked. The wasabi was fresh and excellent, however. Then there was the service: slow slow slow to bring out the hot sake (took three requests and 20 minutes). But almost from the start, we were rushed to get through our meal and leave, in an obsequious, yet persistently annoying manner. Finally, the waitress just flat out told us they wanted to seat someone else there and we'd have to leave (this was after an hour and 20 minutes -- not terribly long. For a meal that costs more than $100 per person, that's incredible. Never going back.
