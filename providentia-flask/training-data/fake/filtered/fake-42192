My boyfriend and I went here on Saturday, Febuary 15th for our valentines day meal. Overall , we had a pleasant experience: we were promptly seated , the cocktails were great, the food was on point and service was friendly and fast. Actually, the service was too fast. Rather than given the freedom to order two plates before looking over and committing to more dishes later on, We were forced to order all of our meal selections at once. (Keep in mind that this was no more than ten minutes after Â being seated.) We settled on the tuna tartar, sweetbreads, head on prawns and mussels in a foie gras broth. Our cocktails arrived and then literally two minutes later, our first dish arrived. It was nicely executed but We felt that this was just way too rushed as we Both wanted to sit and catch up on our day before diving into any food. After our meal, I ordered one last beer before heading out and was not able to finish it without being asked to leave for the next round of reservations! I understand that this is their business model and that many people may prefer lightning fast service but perhaps not on a romantic evening such as this! Overall, we felt very rushed but the food was delicious and we would love to give this place another try.
