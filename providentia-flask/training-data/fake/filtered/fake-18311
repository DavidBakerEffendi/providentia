I was surprised to see some less-than-stellar reviews for The Cannibal. I love the ambiance of this place because it's so typically New York.  Small, unique, great food, and a beer lovers haven.   We are in the process of tasting everything on their menu but I have to suggest tasting their whipped lardo and roasted bone marrow.  Don't miss out!
