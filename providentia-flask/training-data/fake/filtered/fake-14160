Good food.  Poor service.  We went on a weekend for brunch. They told us the wait would be only 15 minutes.  After 30 minutes of standing there in a packed room, I asked the hostess for another estimate.  She again told me 15 minutes wait!  I was a bit upset but we waited anyway.  The food was pretty good but not good enough to endure the frustration and annoyance of it all.  The service was also quite poor once we had sat down.  We had to ask for a glass of water three times before it finally arrived.  Will I give it another shot?  Not sure.
