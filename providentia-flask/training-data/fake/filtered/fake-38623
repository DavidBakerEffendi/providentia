The place looks nice but its very loud and the service was not so good. The food itself was mediocre and the price was way to high for the quality. We had the lobster and shrimp with fries and fried vegetables. The lobster and shrimp was over cooked. The sauce was too creamy and the vegetables was way too oily. We didn't stay for desserts.
