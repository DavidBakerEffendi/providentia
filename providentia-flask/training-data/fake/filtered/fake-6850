My friend Kemba reccomended this place to me and I was lucky to have listened to her. The customer service made me feel like I was receiving southern hospitality in Brooklyn. They knew all about their dishes and were happy to explain the creative menu. Honestly, I was nervous at first but it was love at first bite. The outside sign and inside decor made me feel as if I was eating among the wealthy. This is a must try/eat when visiting Bedstuy!
