Wild Wood is unlike any other pizza in a town known for its incredible pizza and where pizzerias are a dime a dozen. It truly is a diamond in the rough. I first discovered this gem a few months ago when they first opened and have become a regular and loyal customer. Wild Wood pizza is simply different, in a good way. The crust is not your traditional NJ/NY style doughy blob. Nor is it what you would expect from a thin pie. It has a crispy texture, with a faintly smoky flavor derived from the wood fired oven from which the restaurant takes its name. Unlike other thin pies, it isnt soggy and holds the sauce and cheese well. The sauce is delicious and has the mild flavor of fresh tomatoes and italian stlye seasoning. The standard cheese topping is Sam's (the owner) secret proprietary 4 cheese blend and is of a very high quality. You can opt for a mozzarella only pie as well, but the blend is something to experience. The selection of specialty pies is wonderfully different from the norm as well. I highly recommend the lamb and lemon pie as something not to be missed! If you dont see your favorite combination of toppings on the menu just ask and Sam will make it happen! My personal favorites are Â pepperoni and onions, and sausage with onions and chipotle peppers YUM!! For dessert dont miss the Ciao Bella sorbet and gelato! Blood Orange is amazing! The customer service is second to none as well, and Sam is a very nice guy who loves to talk to his customers (something many peoplin Bayonne are not used to). Overall I give Wild Wood 5 stars. They are the total package. Give them a try today!
