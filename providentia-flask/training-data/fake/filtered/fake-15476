This was our 1st trip to this place.  It was welcoming and relaxing fun at the same time.  Our waiter was great.  He was very helpful with suggestions and he check on us a lot.  I loved the their crispy salad and the pulled pork sandwich.  My sister had the ribs, I was so jealous when saw how thick & meaty they were.  (No, she didn't share either.)   Besides the great food and our fun waiter,  was the reasonable price of our meals.  We are very happy about this spot and looking forward to another tasty meal.  Next time however, I'm going for those tasty-looking ribs!!!  : )
