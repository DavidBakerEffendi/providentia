I've been to this Penang about 4 times now.  The service is really good, the staff is very very friendly.  We most recently went on Valentine's Day, and we arrived about 20 minutes before closing, and they were still able to sit us with no issues.  The dishes are great, however the specials do not come with rice -  you must order on the side. I had the sumbal sauce with squid, which was spicy and delicious (warning - the dishes can be quite spicy! I love spicy food, but for those still warming up to eating spicy dishes, be careful). My fiance had the pork with dry vegetables, which was delicious as well, but definitely had a lot of fat on the meat, which i know scares some people away. Overall, had a great time and always had, so it's a great place for a nice dinner for two, or for a family dinner.  The reason I am giving 4 instead of 5 stars is that the Thai iced tea is somewhat dissapointing.  The tea I ordered was definitely watered down, and not as typically sweet as in other Thai restaurants. Might have been due to it being a busy day though.
