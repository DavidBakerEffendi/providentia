Unique cocktails and delicious food in cozy Anglo-Indian décor.  Warm and friendly service.  Nice background music (eclectic, including Bollywood and Western), but not too loud, and conversation was possible at the table.  Went with a large group, including Indians and non-Indians. Servings not family-style, but we shared multiple appetizers and almost all the entrees.  I love Indian food, and frequent restaurants on Lexington Avenue, in Jersey City and in Edison, but this restaurant has several excellent "homey" dishes I have not seen elsewhere.  The crispy okra (amazing!!!), the chilli cheese toasts (one of the Indians waxed poetic about his childhood memories and re-ordered), the stuffed baby bell peppers, and the Tandoori tiger prawns were very yummy appetizers. The lamb chops were heavenly, the curries were all excellent, and the biryani was mild but well-spiced and delicious.  We shared several bottles of zinfandel (I lost count) that was very well-matched with the food.  The vermicelli dessert was outstanding (I wanted more, even though I was already stuffed).  In the future, I would love to see a family-style serving option for large groups, and a chef's tasting menu.  Would definitely recommend reservations, as the space is limited, and it was quite busy when we were there.
