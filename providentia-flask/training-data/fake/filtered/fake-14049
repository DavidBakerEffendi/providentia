Not only the food is great, but it is also cooked next to you. The table we got was next to the kitchen and we could see all the dishes been made, which added a charm to our visit. During our meal, Jonathan Waxman himself arrived and, despite my already tipsy state, was super nice and accessible and took some pictures with us. Awesome!
