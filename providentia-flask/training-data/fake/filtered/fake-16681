I waited an hour for my food to be delivered. I called to ask them where my food was and they said I had to wait 15 more minutes but my food was ready. I asked them if my food would be delivered cold and they laughed and said yes. When my meal finally arrived, it was luke warm at best and they did not even discount my meal at all. Rude and poor customer service.
