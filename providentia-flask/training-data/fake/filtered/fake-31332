Our office typically orders out on Friday's for lunch. Given what we have learned from Bubby's in the past about how slow their delivery is, we decided to order for pick up. We called around noon today, placed our order and were told it would be ready by 12:45. Once we arrived at 12:45 or food wasn't finished, apparently. We then waited for an hour inside the restaurant until it was almost 2 hours since we initially placed our order. Not only are the prices ridiculous for mediocre food (our fault we know, but they do have a decent chicken sandwich though!) but after waiting almost 2 hours our food finally came out, no apology offered and not even a thank you for waiting that long for a $200 order. Regardless, our entire office was starving so we rushed back to eat our food only to find everything was cold. Our soups, our sandwichs, our fries... Everything. Oh, they also forgot to include all the additional sides we ordered too. Needless to say, we should've learned the first time. Once bad food, always bad food. Don't waste your time, money or taste buds on Bubby's.
