Came here for dinner last night with a group of friends.  I got the combo a "boil special" which has crawfish and shrimp.   The shrimp was not fresh at all! I usually love shrimp and fresh shrimp should be peeled very easily. Their shrimp was hard to peel and mushy. The crawfish was a bit better, but still not the freshest seafood for an all seafood place.
