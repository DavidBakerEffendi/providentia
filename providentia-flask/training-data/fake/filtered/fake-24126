Obviously, if you're going to claim to love ramen in New York, you've got to have tried Ippudo. HOWEVER, a lot of enjoyment of Ippudo relies on how one goes about approaching the (nonexistent) reservation system. A few tips: -Show up at an off hour, preferably 2pm in the middle of the week (if you're employed, tough luck); -Put down your name and pretend that your entire party is waiting outside. When asked, gesture wildly; -Wander off to St. Mark's place (kenka if you're feeling lucky, je'bon if you're not) and drink something authentically Japanese (read: no sake slushes! Okay, you can have a sake slush at je'bon if you're not feeling particularly ethnic or chaste); -Come back two hours later and tell them you've been waiting outside the whole time. This is a little dishonest and morally reprehensible, HOWEVER if you are even a bit Machievellian and like pork broth you can probably write this off as a minor sin; -If it's your first trip, try the Akamaru Modern -- if not, go wild; -MAKE SURE TO LEAVE LOTS OF BROTH IN YOUR SOUP; -Once you've finished your first batch of ramen (same bowl), order "KAEDAMA" (noodle refill) and note that you can specify different hardnesses (cookedness or al-dente-ness) of your noodles; -Repeat until stuffed. -Say, 'gochisousamadeshita' on your way out. Really, you should do this -- it's only polite.
