I was in from St. Louis visiting family and friends over the holidays, and we stopped in one day for lunch. The decor was clean and simple and the atmosphere was very welcoming. I enjoyed my visit so much, I made sure to stop back in before I left the city. The braised pork bun was amazing, along with the Unagi roll and the seaweed salad, both fabulous. Â On our way out of town, we stopped in again and this time tried the spicy tuna burger and the tempura sweet potato fries. The burger was amazing, and the fries were quite simply the best I have ever had! Service was friendly and the place is unpretentious, and very inexpensive. I can't wait for my next visit to the city, I will be stopping here first!
