Please do not eat here if you do not want to torture your taste buds. This Chinese food sucks bad. The location is sketchy and the only reason you will come here is if the fat guy behind the holiday inn recommended it, and he did. A blind man cant screw up fried rice. They did. Only reason they stay open is because hungry people in minority neighborhoods don't k now better and will eat that slop.
