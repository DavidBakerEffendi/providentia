It's pretty hard to hate on this place but I found a way. has anyone eaten here lately? Sure it was great when the whole pork pie hat thing took off for the first time back in '05, but now the meat is fit for a chinese restaurant, you know those bullet proof ones? Pretty sad because it used to be so good there, but I guess the ....economy....something. Still, its busy, If you sprayed the corner of Elizabeth and Prince with 12 gauge double ought shotgun shell you would collect a lot free swiss cheesed Marc Jacobs and Varvatos.
