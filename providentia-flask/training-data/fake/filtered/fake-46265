I go here when I want to grab brunch/lunch with friends and have a simple but good meal.  The prices aren't expensive and the food is better than average.  The place can get packed on Saturday and Sunday morning so expect to wait at least 20 minutes. The location is walking distance from train stations and buses if you need to travel to get there.  The staff is awesome, attentive and friendly. Perfect pick for brunch on a weekend with friends, even before the night's activities.
