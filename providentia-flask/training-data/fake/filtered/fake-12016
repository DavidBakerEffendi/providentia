They are the horrible version of Chipotle. No matter what Chipotle is the BEST. Tres carnes portion of the food is very little for the price you will pay. Very disappointed. The rice is hard, lettuce is like a big chunks, The chicken portion is like hardly any chicken on my bowl. I will stick to my Chipotle. Â Will NEVER order from this place again.
