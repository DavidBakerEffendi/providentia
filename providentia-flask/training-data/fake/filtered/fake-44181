I went to Stella Rossa  last night for dinner and was very  displeased with the food and the service. the waiter that took my order had no idea what he was doing I asked General questions about the menu and he could not answer them I explained I had a nut allergy and I asked to have the penne with out any nuts so after he took the order it took OVER AN HOUR TO GET MY FOOD ! and when it finally came out there were pine nuts all over the dish I asked the waiter to take it back cause I asked for no nuts and there were pine nuts all over it the waiter looked confused and took it back them came right back out with the same exact dish all he did was scoop the nuts off but it already came into contact with the pasta I still saw that the dish had nuts remaining in it ! I said I have an allergy it can't be cooked in or around or in contact in any way what so ever I demanded to speak to a manager and no manager ever came I highly recommend not going to this restaurant !
