Went here last night with my family due to the positive reviews. I have to agree with everything said before. The staff was attentive and got everything right. The menu is relatively small, but this seems to allow for better dishes all around. We had half the menu items, including the ribs in chocolate sauce (sounds odd, but was delicious), the truffle calamari (didn't taste too much truffle, but I was ok with that and the calamari was cooked well), the charred edamame, and the chicken lollipops for appetizers; the rolling chicken, duck confit, udon with shrimp, chicken fried rice, and pad thai for entrees. Everything was cooked well, and what surprised us most was the flavor combinations, especially in the sauces and sides. We kept going back for more, just to see what the hell the flavor was (whatever it was, it worked really well with the dish). My favorite was the jasmine panna cotta for dessert. Everyone from my parents to my 5-year-old niece enjoyed the food. We will definitely be back.
