Honestly, this was a super let down... I have been to 116 many times before and I was a fan of the laid back atmosphere and the amazing farmer's pizza. However, I went last week and the service Â was super overbearing- my date and I couldnt get a word in because we were constantly bombarded by servers. And the farmer's pizza came with anchovies- never happened before. So salty and basically unedible. Then we were bombarded by servers trying to get us refills- maybe because they knew how salty and disgusting the pizza was. Anyway, the competition in New Haven is fierce and 116 needs to step up and go back to the fun atmosphere they once had...
