Today I had a blackened scallop salad that was good but with a big surprise and not a good one. For $13 it was the size of smaill side salad.  I've had this same salad there more than once but it was a nice-sized salad that you would expect for a main course. I understand that the price of scallops is high and they give the same amount of scallops as when they had the large salad only smaller. And that's okay but what would be the cost to give you more greens and keep a returning customer happy? Being that the salad was small I then asked for bread.  The waiter said that bread would cost extra!!!  For a small roll or two! What an Unbelievable insult. My family and I won't ever go back there. Nothing like practically shouting out loud "we're watching our costs and we want you to know that because we don't care what you think!".They should change the name to Perplexus Frugal House.
