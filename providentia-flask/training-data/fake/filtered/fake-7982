I took my family there and it is such a cozy place but not so crammed that you didn't feel you can turn around.  The staff was excellent, very prompt, and friendly.  Mochas were amazing as was my daughter's hot chocolate.  Ok now I've never expected that huevos rancheros on a waffle would be something that would work, but oh man it was so perfect.  The flavors of the cornbread waffle, the fresh salsa, chroizo (not greasy), beans, balanced so well with an incredible holindase  sauce topped with an egg.  The right mix of spices, savory, but not so heavy.  It filled me nicely and kept me satiated for a long time.  The Nutella/strawberry and the french toast waffles were also excellent, just perfect.   we will definitely be back.  Nicely priced especially for the amount and quality of food and service!
