Cute atmosphere,  very different.  However I went there under the impression there would be music as it was stated on the greenpointers blog from 8-12. Got there at 930 and the musician was packing up. Stayed for a drink but had a hard time reading the drink list because it was so dark and I couldn't make out the hand writing.  The seating didn't allow a flow from inside to out without knocking into chairs or tables. I was disappointed in this one.
