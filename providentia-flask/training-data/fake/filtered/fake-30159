As Ireland was beaten by Italy in the European Cup, I decided to go with my wife to an Italian bar where they played the match on TV to cheer for Italy when they were playing England.  I went to BarBossa (as I was on holidays in NYC).  I ordered a couple of drinks and was ready for a good game.  However, a man (who later appeared to be the owner of the bar) shouted, for no apparent reason, that we had to get out rather than watching the match inside where other customers were drinking.  I looked at the waitress who had served me and whom I gave a good tip, and she did not seemed bothered.  I ignored his rudeness as I thought this was simply an uneducated supporter.   Furthermore, we did not block anybody's view and had ordered drinks to stay.   However, the same man came back and shouted that we could not stay inside.  When I politely asked him why, he just repeated his order and barked that he was the owner of the establishment.  As I am not confrontational, and wanted to see and enjoy the match  I decided to leave this most unwelcoming bar.  I noticed that he was equally unfriendly to other customers after they had ordered their drinks (not before).   Perhaps this was his trick to sell more drinks.  I don't know but certainly did not feel welcome.  I cannot recommend BarBossa at 232 Elizabeth St., New York, extremely unwelcoming with a rude owner who looks Italian but does not have the kindness unique to Italians.
