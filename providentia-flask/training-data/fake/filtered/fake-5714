I work around the corner from this place and frequenters usually call it Kennedy Deli. Great place to grab a quick lunch. Multi Grain Baguette sandwiches are fantastic and the gourmet meat selection goes unmatched. Alos very convenient if you need other household items in a pinch. Try the rotisserie Chicken....mmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
