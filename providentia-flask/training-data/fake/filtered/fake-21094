So I was Â at boloco the other day and all my friends were like yo this the best food in town. So when I went there I had to stand in line for 30 minutes. Then it took another 30 minutes for them to prepare it. I was upset but finally got my food and the order was completely messed up and on top of that the rice was stale. It was a waste of time and 10$. I will come back in the future but I hope that it improves.
