Whoever states that this is in anyway authentic Mexican food has lived in caucasian suburbia their entire life with zero concept of what Mexican food tastes like.  Aside from authenticity, the plantains we were served were still frozen on the inside.  The beans tasted canned and the rice tasted instant.  The "main" part of the dish was extremely dry chicken.  The staff was taking swigs of rum in front of their customers.  My original reason for going here is that I always pass by it and it seems busy for a hole in the wall.  The chips were served prior to our arrival and were completely stale.  They served their salsa out of a thermos.  The base for the salsa seriously tasted like canned tomato paste to me. This is the first time in my entire being that I have walked out of a restaurant and refused to eat their food.  That is just a small indication of how terrible this establishment is.
