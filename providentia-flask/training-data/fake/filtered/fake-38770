I spend three weeks in Thailand every year, so I can verify that this is an authentic restaurant.  The couple who run Imocha, Nat and Paul, are from Thailand.  They pride themselves on constantly refining and improving the dishes and the menu.  Two of my favorites are the Thai dumplings and the Tom Kha Gai soup.  I cannot eat spicy food, and they are very accommodating in customizing the dishes for me.  If the mangoes are in season, you must try the mangoes and sticky rice -- my absolute favorite!  Unlike some other Asian restaurants, which bring in a lot of pre-made items, almost everything on the menu is homemade and hand-made.  It has the feel of a cozy neighborhood restaurant, but the decor is tasteful and upscale enough that you can feel comfortable bringing friends or business associates for a very pleasant dining experience.  Prices are mid-range. The service is excellent, and Nat even remembers the names of regular customers (Paul is the chef, so you may not see him).  Thai food is the best cuisine in the world, and this place is authentic.
