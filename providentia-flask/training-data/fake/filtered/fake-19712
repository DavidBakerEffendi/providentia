This is an update -- My husband loves the chicken and I enjoy the jim cade burger (actually more than the burger at the regular Peaches) but thats it. The menu is super lame outside of the two selections I mentioned above. I never seem to find something that i want on the menu. Unless you are looking for fried chicken then Peaches on Lewis Avenue is a better choice.
