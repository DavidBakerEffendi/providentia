Bland food that could be had for much less money at any garden-variety Indian restaurant.  Gorgeous interior design is the only draw... but that is not what we went for.  A disappointment for Little India.  While we were there, a drunken woman was shrieking and laughing at the next table.  We, and two other tables asked the waiter and the manager to speak to her.  Our requests were politely ignored.  Not only was the food bad, but we left with frayed nerves.  Then again, maybe their drunken customers are their best because they will eat whatever is served.
