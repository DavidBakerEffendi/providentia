This quiet and small restaurant has so much to offer! The food here is sooo good! There is something for everyone on the menu and all of the entree's have their own little twist. I had the Tandori Fried Chicken with Collard Greens and it was so good! Also, this cute little restaurant is BYOB and they provide the mixers! They have games and trivia lying around while you are waiting for your food. That was a fun distraction although the food did not take long at all. The atmosphere is so fun for friends or cute dates and I felt so comfortable eating here that my boyfriend and I stayed for a while. All of the staff is very friendly and inviting making you feel like you've been a regular customer for years. I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone cruising through Liberties Walk and looking for a bite to eat.
