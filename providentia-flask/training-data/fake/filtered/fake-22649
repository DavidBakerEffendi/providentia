Went here over the weekend with a party of 11 for a birthday dinner--great food, attentive waitstaff, prompt seating (for context, it was 7pm on a Saturday). We ordered the onion rings and beer-battered string beans to share with the table, and I split the tuna tartare with a friend. Assuming you enjoy all things fried, you can't go wrong with those string beans. The tuna tartare was great, too: a tower of diced tuna, mixed with black sesame seeds and a wonderfully acidic jalapeno dressing. For my entree, I ordered the hanger steak medium rare, with the Bearnaise on the side. The steak was cooked to perfection, with a delectable crust on the outside. The fries were only so-so, and too many of them on the plate. Dessert was, of course, the birthday cake sundae, which is just a slice of yellow cake/chocolate frosting atop several scoops of ice cream. Two sundaes was completely adequate for the table. Great all around!
