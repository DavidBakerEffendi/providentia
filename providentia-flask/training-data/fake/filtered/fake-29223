Taqueria Kermes has been a local staple in Ridgewood since it opened last year! I really could not believe how incredible the food is here, especially the shrimp quesidilla ; which I Â usually have when I eat here! Only negative I have is there is no liquor sold yet! Guess best is yet to come! All in all, I highly recommend them!
