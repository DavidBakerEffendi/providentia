I am a big fan of South American cuisine. To me the Pio Pio has an excellent Peruvian selection, accompany by flavorful sauces and fantastic rotisserie. So when I tried Pio Pio Riko in Chelsea I expected the same quality of food and I was severely disappointed. The chicken was dry to the bone, the amazing green sauce I love so much, Ahi Verde, was white and thick and tasted like paper towel. The beans were watery, very salty, flavorless, and the service, especially delivery, was just awful. I ordered over the phone, in Spanish, since it seems to be easier, and even after I repeated the order twice, I was delivered the wrong thing. Moreover, the delivery boy, Oscar I think his name was, was very inappropriate. Not only was he asking me questions like how much money I make and if I'm married, he smelled of something terrible. My friend, who was accepting the order with me, stated it may have been the smell of marijuana. In any event, this experience did not dampen my love for Peruvian food, but I will definitely stick to the original Pio Pio and stay away from this knock off.
