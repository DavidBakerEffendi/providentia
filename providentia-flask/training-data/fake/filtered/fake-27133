The service here is a joke, slowest service I've experienced anywhere in my entire lifetime anyime I come. I get to the drive thru at 6:40am before work at 7, no one else in front of me and am stuck here for 15 minutes. Ridiculous!  How long does it take to pour a damn coffee. Whenever I come inside theres a huge line anytime of the day, one person working like a snail at the register while 4 other employees are just nonchalantly walking around behind the counter, they NEVER remember to give you a pickle with your dish, I ALWAYS have to ask. After waiting 17 minutes today just for the pick 2, this will be my last time coming here, this place obviously has no interest in catering to a high volume location effectively. I've worked in the marketplace for 10 years and this is the only place I loathe.  I guess people must like mediocre/inadequate service if this place is still in business.
