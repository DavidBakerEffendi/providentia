This restaurant is really great! The ambiance is really cool, and it's owned by real Italians, which never hurts. All the food we had was excellent. The focaccia , the pizza with onions and pancetta, the beans "uccelletto" style, the side of herbed potatoes. The garganelli pasta with pork sausage and wild mushroom was to die for! And then there were the desserts: the lemon tart almost gave me orgasmic pleasure and the tiramisu was creamy and light. I'll be back to this restaurant very soon.
