After a nice greeting at the door, we scored 2 seats at the bar after Christmas. Loved the Lambrusco selection. It was a great show watching the bartenders mix all the complicated house cocktails. Â The tagliatelle with meat sauce was perfection, al dente pasta just coated with sauce. The meringue with gelato dessert was sublime. I cant wait to go back!
