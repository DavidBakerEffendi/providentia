First and last time i order anything from this place. I had the Fried Calamari w/ Garlic Bread and cheese. The Order process was smooth and fast delivery. The women that came to deliver was rude! The bread was burnt on top and stale. It tasted nothing like garlic it was just butter and cheese! As if thats not bad enough the calamari... Ugh the calamari. Ive had better calamari from my shoprite freezer section then this tasteless disgrace for calamari. Talk about rubber! To top my bad experiance off i asked for extra marinara they send me two of the 2oz containers talk about cheap! It wasn't even enough to make it taste half way descent! NEVER AGAIN!!
