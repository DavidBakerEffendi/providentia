Had a lovely birthday dinner celebration with friends. I had the prix fixe menu which was excellent. Sardine panzanella, tortelli and spade...a swordfish dish. Dessert was the torta di olio, a wonderful moist cake with strawberries on top and a scoop of gelato. Â The service is excellent, and although quite crowded, we could easily hear each other in the restaurant.
