We are regular patrons-- like the food, like the casual atmosphere very much, and enjoy the variety of offerings. The problem is that often something goes wrong. For the second time in recent months we were served warm white wine and then told there was something wrong with the frig. That doesn't make a lot of sense.     The service can be very friendly, but the problem is that the servers are having too much fun fooling around with each other away from the tables. And one of the male waiters who has served us a few times has such a thick accent that we have to ask him to repeat, not once, but twice, and then we are so embarrassed for him that we don't ask him a third time and just make do with something else. It's great that he has a job there, and he's a really sweet guy, but he shouldn't be discussing food with the patrons.    Last night, worst of all, after telling the waiter that my wife can't eat dairy products, and asking him to find out specifically if there was butter in the veal dish, he assured us there wasn't, after talking to the chef, which we always insist on, and today my wife has a miserable stomach, which lasts a few days, and she knows very clearly what dairy syndrome feels like. One wonders, if one said he had a shellfish allergy, what would happen if he was assured there was no shellfish in a sauce, and there was! People die from food allergies.    The problem with the restaurant is a pattern of carelessness. We like the place and come often, but we are beginning to wonder if it's time to find a different default restaurant.
