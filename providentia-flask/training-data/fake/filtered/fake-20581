This is one of the best places to get authentic vietnamese food - bar none.  I got the grilled chicken banh mi with a fried egg - and trust me, putting the fried egg is the way to go!  Absolutely fantastic!  Some reviewers are commenting on the decor of the cafe and sure, it's not the best but I like the hole-in-the-wall feel of the cafe and the food is  as authentic tasting as you're going to find in the city. Word of caution though - when they say spicy, they mean it.  I got it medium spicy with the Sriracha sauce and jalapeno slices and it was definitely up there in the spice level.  I enjoyed it because I like things spicy but I guess that some people might have to watch for that.
