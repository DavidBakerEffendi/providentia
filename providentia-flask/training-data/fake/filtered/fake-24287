This is the freshest Thai food you can get.  Yes, you are going to pay more than your local dive Thai place but it is well worth it.  The papaya salad is among the freshest things I have tasted, the Chiang Mai "fries" and coconut-accented corn chowder are a delicious treat, and the basil chicken is dee-lish.  Definitely place a half order for the chicken dish - the portion is HUGE! Highly recommend this place for its great ambiance and fresh, delicious flavors!
