Very loud as mentioned by other reviewers. I didn't care for the fact that although there were no alcoholic beverages they wanted to sell you their sangria to mix with your wine; we were hassled for having just wine coolers. (Note: their drink choices are priced like alcoholic drinks!!) We wanted to order the tapas first but our server insisted on our ordering everything at one time. We have been burned in the past by entrees coming out before we finished our appetizers (and NO, we are not slow eaters!!) As far as the food was concerned, some of the tapas were good...others were just ok. Our server spilled a couple of the Al Ajillo garlic shrimp (the most expensive of the appetizers) and didn't replace them. My Pollo a la Plancha was very good but my wife's Ropa Vieja was bland, dry and seemed as if it was sitting around for hours. Let me qualify my comments by remarking that we travel to Miami frequently, so we know good Cuban food (and good service). I suppose that as long as they have long waiting lines, they will continue with this mediocre food and service, but we will not return.
