My husband and I are new to Nutley and really wanted to try this restaurant out, as it always looked cute from the outside. We went in one night for a celebration and it did not disappoint one bit! Everything from the bread to the dessert was absolutely delicious. We went again with my parents this past Sunday and again from beginning to end the food was so good. Try the stuffed meatballs appetizer, so good! We will definitely be coming back here time and time again.
