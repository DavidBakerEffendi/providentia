We wanted a restaurant close to the theater district that was casual and not a chain restaurant and the Hourglass fit the bill.  The first floor dining area was very small (I mean tiny) but yet it had an intimate feel to it. and we were able to have a conversation without yelling at each other.  The food was good, not great, but good.  The server was very friendly, prompt and attentive.  The one downside for me was that it was quite dark.   All-in-all, we had an enjoyable meal.  We were first time NYC visitors and were quite pleased with the Hourglass as our dinner choice before an evening at the theater.     Liz A.
