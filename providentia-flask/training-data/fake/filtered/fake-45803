My boyfriend and I went here one night as a little treat because it is pretty expensive. I am personally not a huge fan of fish but I can take the easy way out by getting fish and chips. It was DELICIOUS. We also got the fried calamari as an appetizer, and it was a bit too spicy for my taste, but still good. My boyfriend claims it wasn't spicy at all, so maybe I'm just a wimp, but he really liked the calamari as well. My boyfriend had the yellowfin tuna and he absolutely loved it. It was cooked perfectly and came with green rice and eggplant which turned out to be a very satisfying meal for him, he favored every bite. I will definitely return to this place when I have a bit more money in my savings, haha.
