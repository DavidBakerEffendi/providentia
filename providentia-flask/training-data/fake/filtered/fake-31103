I really hoped this place would be good.  I love the look of it, but that's about it.  The waiters were extremely slow in coming to the table to refill drinks or check up.  It took about 45 minutes (being generous) to get our appetizers of salad and mac and cheese--the mac and cheese was pretty fabulous to be fair but I had to remind them that we had also ordered salad.  It took another 20 minutes to get the burgers, which were ok at best.  For three of us to get one drink and burgers it was $100, which was just not worth the price especially given how long the wait and how horribly loud it was.  Super disappointing!  I've never missed Tritone more than I do right now.
