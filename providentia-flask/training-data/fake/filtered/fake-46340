Every time I go to eat at Ippudo, the line is always long. The appetizers, especially the pork buns and Yamitsuki Goma Kyuri (Japanese cucumber) taste soo good. Ippudo has delicious dessert options. My two favorites are lady m mille crepe cake and matcha brulee. As for ramen, for beginners it is best to try Akamaru Modern. Some people complained abt the noodles thickness, remember, it is ramen, not udon/soba. I love the thin noodles. If you love spicy, you can add Bakudan topping. The service is good, the servers are fast but friendly. They always check up on you & fill up your glass w water. I love the atmosphere & trendy decor. I'm not bothered by servers shouting Japanese words, because that what makes the place alive too. It's not boring like most restaurants. It makes you feel welcomed also, because they say irrashaimase(welcome) and arrigato goshaimas (thank you). I love Ippudo ! At Â H.W., Are you by any chance saying that these 2500 reviewers who give positive reviews about Ippudo have bad taste of food? I went to your profile & I noticed how you always gave negative reviews and low ratings to all the places you visited. Seriously? Why don't you just stay home & eat home cooked meals if you never satisfy with eating outside. I bet you tip low too.
