I would definitely recommend this restaurant. My husband and I are both very picky when it comes to restaurants-especially Greek restaurants and I'm very happy that we found this place and I look forward to going there for dinner. We went on a Sunday afternoon so we ordered off of the Brunch menu. When going here you can totally walk by and miss it, it's not very big. However, upon entering the ambiance that the owners have created is very warm and inviting. From the decorations, lighting, soothing music and comfy seating one could sit for hours and enjoy a lovely meal. We began our meal with the Horatiki salad, which is basically cucumber, tomatoes, feta, onions, capers and black olives. It was very good with the right amount of seasoning and the veggies were very fresh. I then had the Moussaka which was garnished with a small roasted tomato and a sprig of rosemary. The layers of eggplant, zucchini, meat sauce and bechamel were rich, succulent and hearty, just the way moussaka should taste. Our waitress was very attentive and overall the store seamed spotless, it is very well taken care of and clean. I truly enjoyed my first great tasting Greek meal in NYC and can't wait to go back- so I can order dessert!
