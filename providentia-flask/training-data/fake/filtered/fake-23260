An excellent addition to the neighborhood - a cut above the standard pizza+fine-Italian food joints that surround the area. Well decked out, good wine options and the food was delicious - the salad with grapefruit is very refreshing. Service was attentive - other reviewers must have hit a bad night for a newly-opened spot. Certainly recommended.
