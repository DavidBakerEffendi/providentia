Without the high prices and craziness of getting in and out of NYC, we can enjoy a beautiful evening of jazz at Trumpets. The music is always terrific, and there's a very good chance wonderful musicians will stop by and "sit in"...always a treat! Kristine and Enrico are wonderful hosts, and amazing musicians themselves. The menu includes authentic Italian cuisine, in an inviting setting. We love this place!
