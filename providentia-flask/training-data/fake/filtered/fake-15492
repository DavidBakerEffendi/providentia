I love this place. The food is not cheap, but it really is excellent, and the atmosphere is charming. Good lunch spot. Be careful with the bar...the pounds add up fast and you can easily walk away with a $16 plate because everything looks sooooo good (and it is). I avoid this risk by ordering the roasted tofu sandwich just about every single time I go there. I would love to try other things, but I just cannot tear myself away from this amazing sandwich. The first thing to know is that it is huge, so you will not leave hungry. It has an amazing blend of flavors and textures. You can't go wrong with this sandwich.
