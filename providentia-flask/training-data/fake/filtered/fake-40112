You could easily eat the best slice of pizza you ever tasted here. It's just not very consistent from day to day. Maybe that's the reason you see a high star to low star mix of reviews. Worth trying at least once and another try if you don't live too far away. Either way it's always nice to see the prep of the pizza being done right there in front of you.
