Went to Hillstone last night surprisingly busy for Thursday night...we made reservations for 6:15 and we waited for about 5 min and immediately were seated. Loved the ambiance, the colors, the jazz playing in the background. The food took about 30 minutes however the manager Sophia came to our table and acknowledged that our food would be next...we told her we were celebrating my moms b-day and so at the end the waitress Lindsay surprised us with a delicious dessert. Amazing!! Steaks were delicious and the Brussels sprouts and fries were to die for. Over all great place, not too quiet nor too loud and all the waiters and runner were constantly smiling loved that. Definitely got to check out the bar next time looked like fun..lot of hotties ha.
