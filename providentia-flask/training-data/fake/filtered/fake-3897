A very unique and classy place.  The wait staff are particularly great.  There is a bar on the upper deck that is an experience in itself.  Dress very formally and be ready to get a valet.  Deep pockets will help because everything is expensive.  I went for a surf and turf and the steak was incredible.  The wine selection was great and the deserts are remarkable.  The ambiance is unique, it does not feel as if you are on a ship by the design of the interior , which is a sort of plush modern American style.  But if you sit near the walls, you get a great view of the Delaware.  Bring as many people as possible; if it even remotely seems like a special occasion, the wait staff will bend over backwards to ensure you have a great time.  Perhaps the best time to go is during lunch when the place is nearly deserted and your view and enjoyment are unadulterated by noisy young people and very long wait times.  The Moshulu excels when serving more people rather than fewer.  It is not crowded and the noise level is low.  Expect to pay 75-100 dollars per person including gratuities.
