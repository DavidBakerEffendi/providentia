This place is a wonderful hidden gem and it has become my favorite thai place in philly. Entering the restaurant from washington ave is like walking into a Thai oasis filled with elephant sculptures and intricate tapestries. It feels more authentic than you would expect, given the neighborhood. The tom kha soup is just right- not too sweet, spiced perfectly, and filled with the right amount of fresh veggies. The spring rolls are crisp and delicious. The penang curry is addictive- I ordered it with coconut rice. I also recommend the "Lovely Eggplant" dish. The chefs clearly take great care in the presentation of each dish, and the portions are generous. The service was great- though I must say the restaurant has been pretty empty the few times I have been so far, probably because people were scared away by the old management and haven't rediscovered it yet!
