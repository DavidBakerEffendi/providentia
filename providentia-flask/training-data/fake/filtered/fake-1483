Stopped here on my way to Boston with my family.  We all loved the pizza.  It was lunch time so there was only a few minute wait and the pizza was seriously the best pizza I have ever had.  And I grew up in NYC!  We all got a different small pie so got to try a few.  The white clam pizza was sooo good.  The plain was great too as well as the one we got with veggies.   We all loved it so much we were going to stop by again on our way back home from Boston...but that time the line looked so big we decided to try Sally's (will write review for that one too).   Although we loved both pizza places, our vote was if we only had to go to one next time, we all said it would have to be Pepe.  After writing this review and thinking about the pizza, I'm craving some now!
