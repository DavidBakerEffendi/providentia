Considering high average rating, we had good expectations. Wine list was kind of okay for the central Manhattan location ( house Montepulciano was good, but really pricy at $48/bottle). Fried calamari were well done, not too much breading, tasty sauce, however salted unevenly. Special green salad was also okay. However, the pasta special - a dish containing 4 different pastas - lasagna, Bolognese meat sauce, cheese ravioli and penne alla vodka simply had no taste whatsoever (may be Bolognese was somewhat okay and penne vodka acceptable for kids). Dessert called Titanic was huge (yes, this is family restaurant), but at least half of the huge dessert was whipped cream - overall average taste and really not worthy $30 price tag.
