Very good red sauce. Very tasty and huge portions. Friends took me here and then we went again. It's a neighborhood bar but the people are very friendly. Many people from the neighborhood I haven't seen since Carmichael's was open. We had a good glass of red wine here but I forgot which one it was. I think they're all italian. Drinks were very good and we had a nice dessert drink the manager made us. They played some records that brought back memories. All in all it's a fun night out.
