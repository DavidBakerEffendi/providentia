The Thirsty Koala is one of the best new restaurants in Astoria. The food is SO flavorful! There are also Gluten Free options on the menu. We absolutely loved the Ginger Beer Battered Mahi and Chips with Thai Basil Yoghurt. Â The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable and the chef Kathy even stop by our table to say hello and see how our meal was. We had a fantastic dinner and look forward to inviting our friends to join us next time.
