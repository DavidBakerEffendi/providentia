I'm not one who typically writes reviews....not because I don't appreciate them, more because I'm lazy.  However, my experience at The Pickled Heron went so well that I thought a positive review might benefit this start up restaurant.  It was unique, cozy and most importantly...delicious.  I had the eggs, sausage and cheese and it was arguably one of the best brunch meals I've ever eaten.  The potatoes consisted of a flavor I didn't think was possible and the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend had the eggs benedict and we were both vying for each others meal.  It was a great experience and I'm confident I'll be back soon.
