I have eaten here numerous times and never had an issue; the food is great and the service is quick.  HOWEVER, last night the doorman was rude and harassed me so much I may consider NOT returning.  I have been all over Philly and not once ever had an issue with my ID.  I look exactly the same, yet he did not believe it was mine.  I showed him my old college ID and that all the credit cards in my wallet had my name on it and he still had doubts.  He finally let me in, but almost did not give my ID back - which is my driver's license and I need to drive home  ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
