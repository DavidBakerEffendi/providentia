We just moved to Burlington, and Bluebird is easily our favorite restaurant out of all the places we've tried here. The food is fantastic--thoughtfully sourced, prepared, and presented, and consistently delicious. The staff are friendly and responsive. We've been to Bluebird 6 or 7 times already and have been thrilled with each dinner. The chicken wings and burgers are top shelf, some of the best I've ever had. They've got a great beer list and serve Rookies root bear. Haven't tried brunch yet, but we've heard it's great too.
