Pros: great ramen, friendly staff, price, everything. cons: bathroom, too crowded, long waiting. they have the best ramen in town. Though it definitely worth the wait, try to avoid lunch time 12-2, or the dinner 5-7. Try to go there 2-5, then you will not have to wait too long for the delicious ramen ! CASH ONLY.
