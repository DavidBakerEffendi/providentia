First: Â The pizza is 5 Star all the way. It's brick oven done right. Tasty, thin crusts which won't fill you or get in the way of the delicious toppings and sauces. There is a lot good pizza in NJ and there are certain places which stand out. This is one of them. Since I've only eaten the pizza there I cannot review the salads, etc. Second: The atmosphere is "cozy". There aren't many tables so if you come during peak hours, be prepared to wait. (It's worth it). They could sell a lot more pizza and expand the menu, if they had the space. I look forward to returning again and again. Enjoy.
