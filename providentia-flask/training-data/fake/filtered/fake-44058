I planned my fathers 60th surprise party at Pier 76. The place was super accommodating and the staff was superb! The day could not have gone any smoother and my father could not have been any more surprised. My biggest worry was that my family (major critics) would not be impressed by the food that I swear by (they are not from around here). Not only were they impressed, but they were blown away! "I don't even like arugula but that salad was the best I've ever eaten!" -Said both my 70 year old aunts who are excellent italian cooks. Everyone was scraping their plates, full of pan seared salmon, penne vodka and more. I would plan my next ten affairs with pier just to be able to eat more of their food! Jill, Megan and Danny were great hosts for a rowdy italian bunch on football Sunday. I would recommend this place ten fold. BRAVO & 1000 THANKS!
