This place is okay. The burgers aren't that bad. It's a little overpriced. $10 for an okay burger doesnt really make want to come back. The service is also okay. The women with glasses at the door isnt very welcoming. She wanted to seat us near the kitchen in the back when the place was empty and then sorta gave us an attitude when we asked to sit somewhere else. This place in my opinion is just okay. I'll probably go to smashburger the next time.
