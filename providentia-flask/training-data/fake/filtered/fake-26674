Cute place!! The food is fresh and good.  I especially love the Mediterranean tuna, which is tuna without mayo and I think it has lemon and olive oil instead, really good.  The quinoa salad is also delicious and healthy.  This place is great for breakfast or brunch, too.  The coffee is always fresh and nice and strong.  The owner and staff are pleasant and friendly.  A nice addition to Caldwell on Bloomfield Ave.
