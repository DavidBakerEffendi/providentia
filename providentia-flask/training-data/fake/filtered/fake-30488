Decided to give it a 2nd chance since the 1st time was when they just relocated to Robbinsville and it was a bad experience.  Never had a "Papa's Pie" before they moved here and now after 2nd try I know why.  Score on a scale of 1-5 ( 1 being horrible). Wait Staff = 3 Cleanliness = 1 Atmosphere = 1 Salad = 1 Pizza = 1 Sooner or later the Goomba's in this town will figure out that this place is not all that cracked up to be.  It might have been good 50 years ago but that is not the case today.  For a real Tomato Pie just walk down the street to Delorenzo's Tomato Pies and it is absolutely worth the wait.  If you want traditional Pizza then head over to Jojo's Tavern just down Nottingham Way.
