Can one review white hot Williamsburg hangout, Five Leaves without using the dreaded 'H' word?  We can if we dance around it, say to the sounds of the Dirty Projectors in our skinny jeans, beards and flannel shirts, with our fixed-gear bikes secured nearby.  Delicious diner/bistro food with gourmet flair, this is Nu-Brooklyn cuisine at its finest.  Serves cocktails so terrific they'll knock your Uggs off.
