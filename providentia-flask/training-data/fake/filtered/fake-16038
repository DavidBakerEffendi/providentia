First time in New York, wanted to try something new...this place is awesome! Alex, Vlad and the rest of the staff were friendly, entertaining and the food was amazing! Highly recommend to anyone to come here! They are in Soho, great atmosphere, very attentive. Appetizers were yummy, the beef tongue and kiev pork loin was fantastic. Food was to die for, Aliaksandr our waiter recommended the sour cream cake, it was so good had to order a second piece to go! Loved loved loved this place and will definitely be back!
