We had heard great things about San Sai, but this place was pretty disappointing. Everyone had been telling us "it's just like New York sushi." Well, let me tell you, after living in New York the better portion of my sushi-eating adulthood, because of the slowwwww service, this place wouldn't last long enough to hit Zagat. The fish was pretty good, but nothing to write home about, in terms of quality or selection, and the prices were kind of ridiculous. More importantly, our meal took THREE AND A HALF HOURS. That's right- 3-1/2 hours. Note to Mr. San Sai: if I'm sitting in your restaurant for 3-1/2 hours, you had better be plying me with *extraordinary* food and drink on a continual basis, or I am going to get very, very crabby. I think there were only, like 2 guys in the kitchen, because the restaurant wasn't even half-full, and yet it took a full hour to get our first appetizer, which consisted of 4 raw oysters (??). Another hour passed before we were presented with our entree, a plate of microscopic sashimi. We ordered the usual amount of fish, but were foiled by the tiny portions. After 2 hours of sitting there, drinking sake, we were hungry, wasted, and pissed. We considered eating the fish, then going up the street for a hamburger, but were lazy and instead ordered another plate of sashimi. As expected, we waited yet another hour for it to come. So, really, the 3-1/2 hours is our own fault, since we ordered more food, even though we knew full well how long it would likely take. And now, so do you :)
