This is a great place to grab lunch if you are looking for healthy options. The lunch special for $8.95 included an entr√©e, miso soup and a drink. I tried the Bibimbap with brown rice, your choice of assorted fresh veggies, tofu and the soy lemon sauce. All items except the sauce are added to your bowl and brought to the kitchen to be quickly cooked. Sauce is added at the end right before it's all packed up for you. The veggies were very fresh as was the rice, and the tofu was crispy on the outside and meltingly soft on the inside. The soup was good but a little plain with no bits of tofu in it (the way I like it). Just broth and miso with some flecks of green floating around. I tried the steamed vegetable dumplings that were okay. The soy lemon dipping sauce was the star for those little packages! I asked for kimchi, and that was so very good, not spicy, but packed with flavor. You must ask for it though, it's not on the menu but they give it out gladly for the asking, and it's house made. I wished I could buy a larger container of it! The staff are very friendly, knowledgeable about the food, and seem to really want to make the customers happy. I'll definitely be back!
