I can't say enough good things about this place - people who leave a bad review for a busy weekend night are just a-holes. I have been here on some of the busiest nights and the bartenders got to me as quick as they could, they work fast! If you want a big smile and a ton of attention better come on a night when there's not like a hundred people trying to get drinks at the same time! The music is always good - Â Radiohead, Cure, other 80s stuff with good stuff from now mixed in. We were there for a long ass time last weekend and the bartenders worked their asses off. The tab wasn't even that expensive. Definitely coming back here!
