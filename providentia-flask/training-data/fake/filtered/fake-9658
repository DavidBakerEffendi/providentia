I LOVE Andrew's Cafe! I eat here at least once a week. I want to give you some recommendations but I'd basically wind up recommending the entire menu. There is nothing on this menu that you will not enjoy. All of the soups are incredibly flavorful and HEALTHY, the salads are FULL of fresh and organic veggies..he does not skimp AT ALL like other places do with salads. His homemade salad dressings are incredibly delicious and the sandwich's / entree's are crave-worthy to say the least. Â Everything is EXCEPTIONAL. Try the Vegan burger, your mind will be blown. and the swedish meatballs, and the eggplant rollatini..and all the soups..and all the salads...I could go on forever! Vasantha, the owner, makes everything from scratch and puts his heart and soul into his business. Even if there is something you want that isn't on the menu, he will make it! I recommend calling the order in or placing an order online, as this is a one man production and it may take a little while to get served. You must try this place. It will become your favorite. Nothing in Bayonne compares!
