PF Market is one of my family's favorite places to eat.  We are seafood lovers.  The restaurant serves fresh and very tasteful dishes.  We love the atmosphere and the service.  One of the things I love most is that we are greeted as friends.  We always feel at home.  PF Market will always been a place near and dear to our hearts.
