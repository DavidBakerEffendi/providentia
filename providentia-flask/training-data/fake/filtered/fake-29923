Best in the area. My family and I have been there at least once a week for over 5 years. We cannot get enough. In all that time we have NEVER had a bad piece of sushi. It is exquisite. Chinese menu is nice, Thai is very good Â - but we are sushi lovers and Jumbo is the best. New mobile VIP plan started and makes it more fun when you get a discount before you even get there. text JUMBOPALACE to 90201 and get on the list! Last word: awesome!
