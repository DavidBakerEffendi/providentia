I've been traveling to China at least once a year for the past seven. This place is REAL Chinese food. If you want Americanized fried chicken nuggets with sauce on top and a side of fried egg roll, don't go here. If you want fantastic, spicy and authentic Sichaun, this is the place. The Chonquing chicken is my favorite, though be warned it features wing joints, and so not much meat. It is a family place and is small. Kid friendly. The owner even plays with our child when they are slow, so my wife and I can eat together!
