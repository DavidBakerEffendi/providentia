I am sometimes embarrased by how often I go to this restaurant. But everyone I take there understands -- it's delicious. The owners are super nice and diligent, and the service is always fast and friendly. Their regular menu is pricier than their brunch (expect to spend $13-18 on an entree) but it's worth it. For brunch, you get a drink (like their spicy Bloody Maria) and seriously yummy breakfast or lunch for $12. And they have the best mojitos in Brooklyn. Try the portobello quesidillas, the cilantro mashed potatoes and the mangu (mashed plaintains). Actually, try everything, it's all good. I love you, Bogota!
