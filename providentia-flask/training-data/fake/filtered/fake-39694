Our party of 6 went to dinner at Lithos Saturday night.  It all looked good, but our waiter had difficulty with English, so we didn't get what we actually ordered.  Then the kitchen ran out of the very expensive shrimp special, and instead of allowing us to choose something different, they sent out a substitute dish, that had to be fought with, and at the same high price. Terrible service, which was a shame, because my meal - though not what I ordered, tasted good.  Very very highly priced for such non caring by the staff and the owner, who couldn't care less that they were not serving what we ordered.  On our way out, we passed several more tables complaining.  Needs better management if it hopes to stay open.
