Let me state that I have always had a great time at Katmandu and Rho before. However, despite the fact that several people from my group called the night before to inquire about the cover charge policy, management did not honor the time limit.  We were all told that a cover charge would not be required if we got there by 7 pm.  We got there before 7 but was then told that the cover charge was now being taken at 6:30 pm.  One of my friends who had gotten there earlier, spoke to the manager who refused to rescind the charges.   Then I asked to speak to the manager and the security guard lied and directed me to a female employee who was not the boss.  I said that that wasn't the manager since my friend had already spoken to him. It turned out that the manager was standing behind me, without identifying himself.  When I protested the cover charge, he said he did it because it was raining and the band was being moved inside. I told him that that was bad business practice but it did not matter to him. He said he couldn't do anything for me and still refused to refund the money. My friends and I had a great time with the band anyway but it left a very bad taste in everyone's mouths.  I have never gone to a club where the management arbitrarily changed the time of the cover charge.  I told him that it was wrong, that he could have noted the change on the club's website and that he should have inform his employees to state that the cover charge policy could change when people called.  I also told him that everyone would be telling their friends about this too.   Therefore, It appears that although the restaurant is repositioning itself for a more upscale clientele, its attitude towards its patrons is disrespectful and unprofessional. I am disappointed because Rho has so much more potential but will turn off people it this situation continues. If you want people to come, you have to be consistent and fair.  What a shame!
