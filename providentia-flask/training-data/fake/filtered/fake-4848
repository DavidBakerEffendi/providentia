We stopped in to the Red Stone Tavern last week.  It wasn't terribly crowded so we got a seat right away.  The service was prompt and attentive.  The decor is clearly brand new and very nice.  I had the jalapeno chicken club sandwich and it was delicious!  Nice and juicy, the bread was very fresh and the flavorings were perfect.  Not too spicy but certainly many flavors to enjoy.  I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My husband had the lime grilled chicken with vegetables and rice and he enjoyed it very much as well.  The Bloody Mary I ordered was nice as was the wine and beer.  The bill was very reasonable.
