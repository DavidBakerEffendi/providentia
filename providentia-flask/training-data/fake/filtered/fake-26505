I would like to write here that I enjoyed great service and food at Oaxaca Kitchen in New Haven, however this is not the case.  My wife and I recently went to the new restaurant for the first time to have a quiet drink and possibly an appetizer or two.  After seating ourselves at the bar we were quickly served complimentary chips and salsa.  After that it was all down hill.  There were no less than three servers and bartenders waiting on customers in the empty place (it was 7 and Memorial Day weekend hence why it was slow).  I watched for 15 minutes while the bartender stocked the bar, filled the ice buckets and chatted with the waitresses.  After about 20 minutes my wife and I decided to leave and go down the street to Geronimo where we received the normal EXCELLENT service there. To add insult to injury I left my keys on the bar at Oaxaca and went back.  A server said that SHE didn't find them and "she was there all night." Then said for us to call in the morning to see if anyone else found them.  HELLO they were my CAR keys, how the heck did she expect we get home?! Having worked in food service I would have asked every server and bartender if they'd found a set of keys.  We even checked back at Geronimo when finally my wife went back into Oaxaca and asked every other person there until the original bartender who never served us came up with them. While I may check the place out again for dinner to try something there this was a very BAD first impression.  Being from East Haven and living here for over 25 years I know the restaurants in the area are very competitive.  Hopefully this place will get its act together.
