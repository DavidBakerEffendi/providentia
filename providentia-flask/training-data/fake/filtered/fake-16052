Just wanted to post an actual review other than my petition... heh. Tampopo is delicious and well-priced. I've only had the fresh tuna bi-bim bob (bop?) and it is so fresh and so good! it is all raw and has sliced pears, avocadoes, cabbage, and rice with a tasty spicy yet refreshing sauce on top. I recommend it with brown rice as opposed to white, which you might have to ask for specifically. The gyozas are also delicious. The decor is bare bones but spacious...I think they could do more. They also have these weirdo buzzer things to tell you when your food is ready which is completely unnecessary since the spot is so small...but with food so tasty, it doesn't really matter that much to me. I just, as I said, want sushi, as their other locations have. See my "review" below to sign the petition to get sushi there!
