Love, love, love this place. I consider myself a pizza expert and I put it up there with Grimaldis in terms of sit down, thin crust pizza. The crust is amazing and they always do it perfect when I ask them to burn it a little. :) The toppings are fresh and the staff is friendly. My one piece of advice would be to hold off on toppings when getting it delivered. The crust gets a little soggy in transit.
