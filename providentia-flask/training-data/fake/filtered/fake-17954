First time I had this place it was really something special.  The food tasted fresh and delicious, and to boot it was inexpensive and had a friendly staff. The second time, not so much.  As if I was eating at a completely different restaurant.  The soup that I had enjoyed so much from the previous time tasted incredibly off, as if they had dumped an entire bottle of vinegar in the pot.  After a few very unpleasant bites, I threw the container in the trash.  The chicken in one of the dishes had a strange consistency, very rubberlike and several bites were hard and stringy - something I absolutely LOATHE about cheap takeout chinese food.  The meat in general tasted very low quality.  The noodles were bland, tasteless and had an off-putting fishy smell (yes I realize there are shrimp in the dish).  When all was said and done, I could only stomach a few bites of everything before I threw it all in the trash and resorted to some left over thai in the fridge I had from the previous night. The positives of this meal remain the friendly and accommodating staff and the relative inexpensiveness of the food.  I liked the rice a lot (maybe cause everything else was so bad in comparison). However, I woulda've easily sacrificed these qualities if it meant the food had actually been good. Perhaps, it was an off-night, and I really did like it the first time, but tonight's meal was so bad, it'll take a lot of convincing to get me to go back.
