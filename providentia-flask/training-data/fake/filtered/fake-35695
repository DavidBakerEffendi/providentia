Bocca rossa is a perfect place to Unwind......As soon as you walk in your greeted by friendly people !!!! It's has the New York feel with a taste of Italy. Â The happy hour specials are unbeatable...can't go wrong with 1/2 price bottle of wine an prosecco !!!! The food blows any italian ristorante outta the water, true authentic Italian cuisine at it's best !!!!! I highly recommend to anyone visiting or going out in hartford !!!! Perfect location with the perfect people !!!!!
