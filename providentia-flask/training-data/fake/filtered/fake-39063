Disappointing... Good starters and good wine, however main courses mediocre (striped bass and risotto), poor attitude and over priced. We had seafood risotto which was one of the specials of the day for a price of 32.50 usd (we were not informed about the price beforehand) where fish main courses were around 25 usd, so this was over priced! Â Special dessert of the day was more expensive than the rest desserts for an unknown reason too. And the worst thing happened at the end, 18 % tip was included in the bill! When we asked why they did that, they said tourists may not know the system in NYC. We live abroad but travel here often and stay like two months each time and dine out a lot, this is the first time we have seen such a bad attitude! Felt like this place is trying to make money by fooling tourists.
