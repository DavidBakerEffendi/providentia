Came up for a visit I live in Mn. I asked where is a good soul food place to eat. They suggested Sandra's Next Generation. The food was soooooo good. The servings were healthy sizes and that watermelon mint tea was awesome. The price couldn't have been more reasonable. We left there saying to each other how great that food was. I told my server I couldn't wait to post and boast about my visit. If you are in CT. and want some soul food this is the place to go.
