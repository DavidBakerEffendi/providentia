Resorts World in Queens is DEFINITELY STINGY with their comps no doubt. The valet parking is expensive as well. At Maryland Live the valet parking is $5 dollars, and its a much classier casino! Another comparison between the two is Resorts in Queens machines take single dollars, and Maryland Live does NOT only $5 bills and up!
