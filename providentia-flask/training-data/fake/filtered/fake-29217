When this place opened up my wife and I just had to try it. The place is clean, the staff are very nice. The owner goes out of her way to make you feel at home. I can't say enough about the food the burgers are great and the fries are the best. They do delivery in the ridgewood area. Nice little place and in the warm months the back is open.  No liquor license yet hopefully soon. Prices are fair there tacos are hot  and there burrito will have you taking some home.  You can taste that the food is fresh. The layout make your mouth water. I love that it's right down the block from us.  If you in the area and would like some great food please check them out. I promise you will score big with wifie,girlfriend.
