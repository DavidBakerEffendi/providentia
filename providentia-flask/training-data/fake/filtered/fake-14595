I used to travel all the way to West Hartford to visit Plan B - my very favorite burger place - and now that there's one in Milford I don't have so far to go! I've never had a bad burger there - my favorite is the Pretzel burger... they always have a great selection of micro beer on tap. A flight of beer and a Plan B burger is my go-to favorite meal.
