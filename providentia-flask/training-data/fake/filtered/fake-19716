I went to Peaches for Sunday Brunch and I had a great time! I didn't quite know what to expect because of the mixed reviews on yelp so i decided to check it out for myself with an open mind. It was pretty busy and crowded when I walked in and I was offered seating at the bar which I didn't have any problem taking. The hostess was nice and very helpful. I was immediately given a menu and it didn't take long to choose from the delicious options that were available. I ordered the sausage omelet with a side of sweet potatoe fries and coffee. My order came so quick I thought for a moment that the bartender had made a mistake and brought me someone elses food. But sure enough it was my food and everything was hot and delicious. I love the fact that they have TURKEY bacon and sausage and OMG the music is spectacular!!! Everything played from Sade to John Legend and Stevie Wonder. The music was a wonderful topping to a comforting, hip and soulful environment. The staff was attentive and prompt. I wanted to stay longer just to take in some more of the great music and to take advantage of the free refills on the coffee but I had to continue with my day. I went by myself but its a great place to go on a date, on a family outing or out with friends. I can't wait to go back!
