The food was ok. Once it finally arrived. Even though there were only two other tables seated it took about 30-35 min to get our food. After being seated we were completely ignored until I had to go and ask for someone to take our order. After placing our order, it took 26 min for it to be served. We timed it. And once finished, we had to go up to the hostess station Â to pay the check, since we were ignored again. Not going back.
