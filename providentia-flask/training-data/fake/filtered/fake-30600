Food was amazing.  Pizza is thin crust and have several choices for great toppings - not your ordinary style pizza. Empanadas were something I never had and decided to give them a try. Two per order and very filling. Delicious. For dessert I had the Tiramisu and I can honestly say I have never tasted one as fresh as this.  I've also tried the MIGA sandwiches. Bread is fresh European style loaf sliced and flavor of sauce on sandwich is yum.  Atmosphere is pizza style restaurant with brightly colored décor and great Argentinian photos on the walls.  They also have a TV.  Staff were friendly and helpful. Service was good too. On my last visit took the menu to place take out/pick up order and noticed they cater too!
