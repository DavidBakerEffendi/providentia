I love this sushi restaurant! Some of my favorites are the traffic light and anything with smoked salmon. Everything is very flavorful and fresh. The service is always wonderful. They even have a few tables outside which are perfect on the beautiful days. I had the most amazing real iced too. And you can't beat BYOB. I can't wait to go back.
