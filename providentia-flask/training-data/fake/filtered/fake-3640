Rye is a beautiful restaurant - atmosphere, food, and service included.  Time and again Rye hits the mark. I've been probably 5 times, and each was a wonderful experience.  Chris has been our server most times. He offers the best recommendations and will happily chat with you about the food. You'd be hard pressed to find better service. He first recommended to me the Havemeyer cocktail - it is perfect. The short ribs and duck breast are excellent, as are the brussels sprouts, salmon and quail egg appetizer, and the scallops!! Rye is probably my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn. DON'T EVER CHANGE!!
