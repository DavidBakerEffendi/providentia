Came here a couple of days ago during lunch time and wow. My friend warned me about coming here on an empty stomach and I did not listen. The entire time I was looking at their menu and all I could do was hold my grumbling stomach at bay with the thought that my sandwich would arrive on time to curb the grumbling little beast. The meats and cheeses were oh so fresh, I got the Lamazou Favorite and it was mouthwatering from the first bite to the last. The moz's and roasted peppers, oh. I'm dreaming about them now. The only gripe I had was the price to meat proportion. They could have done with a little more "stuff", hopefully next time I come back, I will get more. Here's to hoping.
