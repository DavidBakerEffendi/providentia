I love the food especially the macaroni salad along with the pricing but HOLY COW, who ever answers the phone when calling to place an order is super rude! I understand people occasionally have bad days, and that's acceptable... But this is all the time. Not only is he rude with me but there are other people who I know order by phone from there and think the same. Honestly, in order to have a business you shouldn't be that way to you customers. They should seriously invest in some course or seek help from professionals on how to run a business and manners . [ no exaggeration ] sorry, but I'm only trying to help you succeed.
