I've been a loyal customer of Posto for years - the pizza (and salads!) is outstanding, the atmosphere is fun and the music is great. However, what keeps me coming back? The staff. They greet you the minute you walk through the door and make you feel welcome. Even on Friday nights (the night on which I most often frequent Posto after a long work week) when the restaurant is packed, they acknowledge you with a big smile and 'hello' the minute you arrive. They offer you something while you wait for a table and they keep you apprised of where you are on the wait list. When they seat you, they are attentive, helpful, friendly and fun. Then they bring you the best pizza, thin crust or otherwise, in town. From the first time I visited Posto, I was won over. I moved out of the neighborhood 4 years ago but still go out of my way to visit this location of the Grupo/Posto/Vezzo family weekly for dinner because it's the best, most inviting, and has the nicest people working there. The owers did a great job putting this place together and I hope the winning combo of food and staff never changes! I love this place.
