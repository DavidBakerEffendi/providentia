One of the best meals I had during my stay in NY.  Joey was a delight to chat with and makes a mean sangria besides!  The salad and rigatoni Bolognese were the finest I've had outside Italy.  It would have been nice to have a second stomach, there was so much I wanted to try.  Clearly a family joint, not a tourist trap trying to hawk you in off the street.  Loved it!
