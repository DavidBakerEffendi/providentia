I am a New Wave fan usually and have been frequenting this spot for the last two years. My experience today, however, made me upset enough to write this review. Prior to today, I would have rated New Wave with 4-5 stars - please be sure to take that into consideration when reading this review further. My fiance and I went for brunch this afternoon. He ordered the bleu burger medium and I ordered huevos rancheros. When our food came, my fiance's burger was pretty much rare and half of his fries were frozen. My order was 1 egg short, had no cheese, and absolutely no seasoning on any of it whatsoever. It was two charred tortillas, plain white rice, half of an avocado, three slices of tomato and a few forkfuls of bland pulled pork. They didn't have two of the beers on tap that we ordered at first. Overall, it was a pretty disappointing experience. It could have been an off day or a new cook. I hope that is the case and that it gets better. When the bill came and we paid over $50 for that meal, I wanted to cry (not really, but I sure as heck wasn't thrilled about spending that kind of money on our meal). I know that we should have spoke up but that is something I truly don't enjoy doing.
