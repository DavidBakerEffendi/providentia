I have a mixed review.  I was with a date, but not one that I had to impress.  I was really hungry, so when the only table available was in the bar area, I jumped on it.  So here it is:  Wine will not disappoint.  They serve by consumption, which means you can start a bottle, drink as much as you need to make the conversation slide a bit better, and they will weigh the bottle and charge accordingly.  Great option to pair wines with different courses.  Food:  I'd have to go with bad.  I go to italian spots for one reason, PASTA only.  Pesto was really subpar, actually unedible.  Gnocchi was so/so, salads, eh. Go just for the wine, its worth it.  Try a new dish (not the pesto) its so well priced that you can try a few things and it wont break the wallet.  Me and a date were $75 with who knows how much wine.  Give it a shot.
