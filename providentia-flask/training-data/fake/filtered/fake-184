We always go to Jim's steaks when in Philly  but today decided to try the hyped up Gino's what a disaster we would never go out back we actually paid $27 for three sandwiches and after one bite threw them in the trash not only was the food disgusting but the staff was extremely extremely rude again don't go there go to Jim's not worth the price the hassle or the rude staff.   The man at the counter was so rude that when we returned to the window to explain that one of our sandwiches was made incorrectly he actually argued with us. After leaving Gino's we went back to our tried and true jims steaks and had a fabulous lunch... So Gino's take your steak sandwich and stick it up your ass!!!  I will really wish Yelp would allow me not to choose any stars because Gino's does not deserve the one I left.
