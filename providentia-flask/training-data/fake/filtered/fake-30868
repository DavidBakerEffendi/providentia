The owners of his restaurant put a tip jar on the counter. They take the proceeds from the tip jar. The kids who work there do not get any of the money. I don't know if it is illegal but I certainly is unethical. If they are dishonest about this and are screwing high school kids working there then what else are they doing? Can't support them. They should be exposed on a front page of a newspaper or on the evening news on TV. Is it worth it owners???
