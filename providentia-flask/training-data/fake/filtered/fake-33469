We finally went to check out the aestethically enticing Spritzenhaus in Greenpoint last Thursday after work. The minute I walked in, I thought I would love it. The decor is fantastic, the more you look, the more there is to discover. The designer definitely has an amazing appreciation for pulleys and now, so do I. But, 2 things: Although we planned on only having a drink each, within an hour we spent well over $100 and, no buybacks! Maybe we just got used to The Whiskey because they are great with buybacks, but we were a little surprised and disappointed that this new possibly awesome place was in this case, not so awesome. THEN, as we were leaving, I literally barely had my foot out the door when this guy, a bouncer??, started demanding that we move along and not "congregate" at the door. Uh, there were 3 of us, and we were not "congregating", we were WALKING out of the establishment which we just heavily financially patronized. And like I said, I wasn't even through the doorway when he started pushing us along. Might I mention that it was also POURING RAIN at that moment. Really. We were stunned. I'm only sorry that I didn't go right back in and mention this to management. They might as well have stood behind us and kicked us down the stairs into the rain. The decor of this place really is great. The atmosphere, on the night we went, was pleasant. I really wanted to like this place. But wow what a crappy way to end our night, and our impression of the place.
