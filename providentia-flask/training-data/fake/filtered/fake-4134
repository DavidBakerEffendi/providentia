First of all - they should be commended for their success in removing that god awful stench in the weird faux health food place that was there prior.  I really thought it was there for good.  Kudos.   This place is okay.  It really is the only restaurant like it over there so it does well.  I like the cocktails and the bartenders.  There are too many kids here during the day but that just comes with the neighborhood.   Ironically enough, while most of the food is on the blander side, the Squid was insanely salty.  I'm talking, my blood pressure went through the roof as I was eating it.  Tender though. The farro salad should be called arugula salad with farro because well, farro isn't the main ingredient.  It's good though, for lunch.   I noticed one of the guys from Chinos works there now.  He's THE BEST.  I appreciated that his boss wasn't up his butt when he came out to say hi and chat for a lil :) Oh!  I left my phone there once and they took care of it for me until I picked it up.  Friendly neighborhoody staff.
