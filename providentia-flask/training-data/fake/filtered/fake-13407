My lunch (Lobster/Shrimp) pasta was barely seasoned, overly-sauced, and both shellfish were way overcooked. More importantly... the waiter was so rude. He rolled his eyes 5 times too often at people paying $14+ for teensy lunch salads. The atmosphere is also overwhelmingly WASPy. Staggeringly, suffocatingly, severely uptight and condescending. Go to the Indian Restaurant nearby and enjoy immensely better, less expensive food in a place that doesn't fault you for having the gall to show up sans loafers.
