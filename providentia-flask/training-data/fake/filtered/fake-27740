DiFara's makes excellent pizza, every pie is handmade by owner Dom DeMarco, everything is fresh, there are no heat lamps here. If you are the impatient type...wait, its worth it to wait for a slice of heaven from this master pie maker. Definitely go midweek, its not as busy as it is on the weekends.
