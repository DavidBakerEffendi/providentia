They said they are famous for great pizza, well I tried one. I couldnt concentrate on the taste, since I was suprised how small the pizza was for almost $20+tip. Didnt expect that in Brooklyn. After all, I was still hungry. I had two beers ($12+) just to wash it off and that's it. We went to another bar cause this place is very overpriced. The nearest train is two long avenues away, plus it is local subway. It's very quiet neighbourhood, so forget about catching cab over there.
