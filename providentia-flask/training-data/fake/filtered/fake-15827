To be honest, fromt he outside it's the kind of place I'd normally psss on by but it was highly recommended but a family member and we gave it a try yesterday (11/26/12) for lunch.  The pickled beets, cole slaw and pickles were a nice touch to start the meal.  I ordered a reuben which was delicious though missing the saurkraut but I did not even realize it until the NEXT DAY. It was good anyway.  Love steak fries, so I was happy.  The onion rings look enticing but they're more batter than onion by far, we were calling them onion doughnuts.  Overall, great lunch spot.
