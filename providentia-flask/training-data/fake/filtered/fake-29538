A menu resembling a standardized test form is the last thing I want to figure out after a long day of work and navigating through OWS/NYPD traffic. The concept seemed gimmicky to me, and overly complicated. Fortunately, my dinner company made it worthwhile, even with the rockhard cookie ice cream sandwich. Not worth visiting to merely satisfy your curiosity; go only if you are a meatball person.
