First time I came here I swore never to come back. The lobster bisque was cold and the pot roast underdone with a detestable gravy. The lunch was another expensive fail in a chronicle of culinary disappointments. Fast forward a year later I'm dragged back to give it another go. I skeptically order just the sesame-encrusted tuna steak with bok choy and a ginger veloute. Admittedly, it was one of the best dishes I've had in Princeton. I became more confused when I came back to order the same thing only to discover that it was this time just a little better than mediocre. I might be willing to go back a fourth time and try something new but I am put off by a combination of inconsistency in the food, a pretty pricey menu, and ice cold staff with a clear distaste for university students.
