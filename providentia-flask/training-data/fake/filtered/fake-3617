For those who haven't tried a bahn mi, this place will exceed expectations!  I had my first bahn mi here and it was an excellent combination of flavors (delicious pork with vinegared vegetables, lettuce, etc).  The bread is also very key and this place usually has fresh bread.  I'll usually go for the Classic - Spicy and it nevers fails to be a good quick meal.  Also have tried the vermicelli salads (plain and with shrimp) and they're pretty good.  I like their fish sauce as it's not overly fishy but more nuanced.  Have yet to try a bubble tea - they look ok.  But just note - it's not much for atmosphere.  There's 5-6 tables but it's pretty bare!
