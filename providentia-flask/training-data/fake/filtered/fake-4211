I rate it a 10 out of 10. The food was delicious, the music nice to dine by,the ambience tranquil ane the decor hot and spicey neon pink and black.. The staff were really friendly,beautiful and patience. We were not rushed even though the place is small. I had the Massaman Curry Chicken and it was the best I ever had. I especially enjoyed th eatable bow tie presented with the food. I would definately travel from Brooklyn to Manhattan at 9.
