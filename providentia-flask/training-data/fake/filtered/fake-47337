Fresh and AWESOME! Soft Shell Crab (in season), Stuffed Sole, Crabcakes, Stuffed Lobster Tail, Real Lobster Rolls, Stuffed Portabella Mushrooms. Everything is so good. Their cole slaw is typical, but their sea food is excellent. Nice sitting outside on the picnic tables across from the beach. Not fancy, wear shorts and sandals. It's like a drive-in. Small parking lot. Worth the trip.
