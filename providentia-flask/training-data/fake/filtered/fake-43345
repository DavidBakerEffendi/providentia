In town for work I checked out what is now called Sunny Buffet. The sun was no longer shining on me after having eaten there. I like to keep my expectations realistic when going to a buffet style Chinese restaurant. However, this place failed to meet, let alone exceed those expectations. The food wasn't horrible or inedible, it just wasn't good, well actually it was rather bad. That being said, I was able to eat slightly more than one plate and live to complain about it. The "best" part of all, the utensils are plastic. What the hell is that? Not compliant with steamed broccoli. Don't waste your time, go elsewhere.
