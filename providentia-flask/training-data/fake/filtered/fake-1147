honestly this place doesnt even deserve a star! i walked in without any reservations because i had conviently passed by and wanted to eat dinner with my boyfriend. the restaurant was almost completely empty and it was no where near closing time. as i entered i was greeted by the manager asked if i had a reservation and the moment i said no this man, apparently named nikos, was so rude to me and made me feel completely unwelcomed. he then sat me at the bar like was i not good enough to sit at a table in the empty restaurant?! i then asked him if we could have a table because i had no interest in having an alcoholic drink..as im talking to him he begins to obnoxiously blink and stare at me in such a manner that i felt so uncomfortable. i had to fight the urge to ask him if there was something in his eye. needless to say me and my boyfriend left. i dont know who decided to hire this man who apparently has no customer service skills and might have cataracts. but i will never come here again and i dont reccomend anyone eat there under this man's management.
