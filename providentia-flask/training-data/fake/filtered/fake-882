My girlfriend and I stopped by for a quick lunch today, it was our first time visiting this hidden gem. I had a two chili dogs and she had the chicken quesadillas , the food Â delivered with a smile in less than 10 minutes!!!! And it was really good! The smoothies were delicious, not to sweet , not to filling and very smoooooth. The restaurant is super clean, which to me is very important to me. I highly recommend,
