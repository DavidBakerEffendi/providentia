I don't think it's always fair to review such a new restaurant, though I've been three times. What really bothers me is the layout of the bar/bottles. There's such a huge bar, and so much wasted space. An entire side of the bar is taken up where people could be sitting, and it happened more than once that I continued to walk past seeing there were no seats at the bar. Although I understand why bottles need to be properly displayed, it felt cluttered and almost unnecessary the amount of stuff they have behind there. The dining room is nice, and felt spacious. I felt like they could fit more tables, but maybe they just arent' ready for that. t felt like they cared more about the decor that the flow and layout of the restaurant. Why is there a bike at the bar? Why is there not a place to sit by one of those awesome windows? The food came out in a timely fashion, and was good. Not the best I'd every\ had, not the largest, but good for a recent open restaurant. Service has been spotty, but I can deal with that for now. A new nervous staff is allowed some slack in the first few months...however both times I had interactions with what I assumed was a manager, well let's just say she was not very nice. I'll go again, but probably not for food until they've got their legs....
