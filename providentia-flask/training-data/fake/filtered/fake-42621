Excellent food at reasonable prices. Top-notch service from a dedicated staff. I love Indian food and we're lucky to have a terrific selection of good Indian restaurants in New Haven. I've tried them all (and liked most), but Sitar remains my favorite for overall quality. Great delivery service covers East Rock. Try the Navaratan Korma, Lamb Saag, or Tandori Chicken for main courses. Great Parantha bread.
