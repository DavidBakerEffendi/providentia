My husband and I ate here on Saturday May 5th. The place was busy, our waitress was great but overall not a great meal. We have been here before and loved it but will not go back after our last meal. My husband ordered the fish special and he got a piece of fish swimming in a bowl of stock with a few greens. it was not worth $32.00. And the women's room had no paper towels and the trash was over flowing. The servers were slow to pick up our dirty dishes. I am not sure what was going on that night, but I was very disappointed in our meal.
