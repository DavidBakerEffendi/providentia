The service provided by Kelly our waitress was nothing more then excuses. Nothing was served together (meaning the 4 of us). The clam chowder was luke warm. The bacon on the burgers wasn't cooked. The chicken burger my wife ordered was raw and had something green in it. Nothing as far of customer service was offered. The place also needs a bit of a makeover. My first chair was so loose I took another chair from another table, the floors are in need of refinishing. But, my main concern was the horrible food. Stay away from this place. Horrible simply horrible. The fries were dripping with oil the best part of the meal, the macaroni salad. That's really sad. We were eating there because is was recommended by a friend who lives on SI. But if you know the saying Happy wife, Happy Home....my wife was Pissed Off, so do you have any idea how my day went ? My wife didn't even eat her food after the green stuff was found in the burger.
