Super fresh seafood, flaky buttery spinach pie, succulent lemon potatoes, and amazingly delicious tzatziki sauce that goes great with everything. Get the "Kyclades" Special platter so you can try almost everything on their seafood menu. Get here for lunch in order to skip the crazy dinner menu. Portions are big enough for 2!
