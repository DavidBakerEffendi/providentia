Went with my mom and sis to the Firebox to have some catch up time with the girls and some good food. We were not let down! The waitress was so friendly and did not rush us. We spent about 3 hours there (by choice!) just talking and enjoying the fantastic food, ambiance, and service. I ordered the cheese plate for an appetizer which was very elegant and creative. My sister teased me for ordering the french fries but put her foot in her mouth (as well as half the bowl of fries) after trying them. By far the BEST fries I have ever had! The duck was delectable, so juicy and cooked medium to perfection just as I requested. My family and I will be returning and we just love how the Firebox is "Farm-to-Table" using only fresh local ingredients. Definitely worth the money and drive.
