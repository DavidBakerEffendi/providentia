This has only been Lunellos ( according to the manager) for three months, so any reviews before that are not correct. We sat in the bar area at a high top, 10 minutes before anyone came over. We ordered the musels for appetizer, the smallest mussles I have ever seen. I had the linguine with clams and my husband had the papperdelle. He was set on the Orecchietta but they were out of broccol rabe. Oh well. The waiter never asked how our meals were. Mine was rubbery and my husbands too many onions. The dessert of apple crisp very runof the mill nothing special. The manager walked around and around watched the game at the bar and never once came over to see how everything was. On the other hand if you were I guess a regular, he was all over you. Lots of hugs and kisses for those folks. Not very warm and friendly. Would not go back, too many other restaurants that are interested in making guests feel welcome and better food.
