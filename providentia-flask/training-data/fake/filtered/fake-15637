the pie is really good, especially banana cream and key lime. the sides are good, especially the mac n cheese with a lot of Frank's. the atmosphere obviously sucks. it is obviously overpriced. One time when I was in there a waiter was wearing a Boston Red Sox hat. for quality fried chicken for 1/3 of the price, hit DONUT CONNECTION on Broadway.
