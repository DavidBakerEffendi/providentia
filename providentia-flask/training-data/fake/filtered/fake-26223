Really good food!! An excellent variety of vegetarian options, and pretty consistently good, but like anywhere it has its ups and downs. First the setup: there are maybe three long tables that they just sit everybody at, but there was more than enough room when I went there on a Wednesday night. The service is good - though the water glasses were small, they filled them pretty regularly, and we got the food in good time. THE TOFU WAS FANTASTIC. It's probably the best tofu i've ever had. The fish quality was also good. The rolls were well-put-together and tasted crisp and interesting. Unfortunately, their cooked dishes were not so hot. The dumplings were bland and unappealing - I got the pork and a friend got the veggie and they were uniformly tasteless. Â  Overall, a good experience! Great selection, good food, pretty good prices, and I at least didn't have a wait. Not so easy to get to, but worth the journey if you live in Manhattan.
