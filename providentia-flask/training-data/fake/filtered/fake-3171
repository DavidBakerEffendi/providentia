Terrible reservation and waiting system.  We ended up leaving after waiting for nearly an hour after being told the wait was going to be 45 minutes.  Asked the host how much longer the wait was going to be and was told that there were reservations for 9 pm (it was 8:55) and we would have to wait for them to be seated and those tables to finish their meals.  I had also noticed many people with reservations actually ended up waiting for about 15-20 minutes before being seated.  Based on there seating system, I would not return to this establishment.  I am sure the food is pretty good but I will not be the one to find out.
