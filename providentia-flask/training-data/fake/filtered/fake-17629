This was not our first time at Jane and will most certainly not be our last! For starters we got the gnocchi and goat cheese flat bread. Let's just say the gnocchi was truly a mound of gooey cheesy soft fluffy pillows that were absolutely heavenly. Have never had a better plate of gnocchi and cannot wait to go back for more! The goat cheese flat bread was also delicious, covered in sauteed onions and a TON of goat cheese. Warning: the portion size is pretty big and definitely has plenty of goat cheese on it. Good thing we love goat cheese but we were also glad that we decided to share our entree after we ordered this! As if these two apps. weren't enough the waiter was nice enough to bring us out a sample of the scallop special and a taste of the meatball appetizer. The hash which came under the scallop was delicious and the pine nuts mixed in with the meatballs were a nice touch. While these were great, the goat cheese flat bread and gnocchi appetizers still stole the show. For our entree, we shared the Jane Burger. The burger was done just right with a crusty bun and absolutely delicious crispy fries. Once again the portion size was very nice and we really enjoyed the rosemary that was mixed in with the fries. While everything was delicious, make sure you save room for dessert! The milk and cookies was by far the best thing of the night. We were served Â 3 LARGE warm chocolate chip cookies which were sweet and perfect. Next to the cookies was a tall glass of cold milk with a scoop of vanilla ice cream inside. Truly a match made in foodie heaven!! Overall, this place gets a 5! The service was wonderful and food was just divine! We can't wait to go back!
