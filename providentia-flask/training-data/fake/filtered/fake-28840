A bizarre location for lunch cuisine of this caliber; it's spectacular! Interesting dishes often with a Jamaican flare. Absurdly inexpensive with a  friendly staff  to boot. Easy I-84 / I-91 access as it's located right across from the LOB (Legislative Office Building) with scads of parking right on Oak street.
