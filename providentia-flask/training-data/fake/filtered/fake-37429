15 Fox place is A HIDDEN GEM in JC!! FORGET NYC OR DOWNTOWN JC for good food!  Special occasion?  You will NOT be disappointed!  Fabulous food, many many courses.  I leave full and  take home leftovers for another meal... there is SOOO much excellent food!  Home turned into a beautiful and warm restaurant.  YOu think you're eating in someone's home, because you are.  Kathryn and Richie are by far the most caring, wonderful owners and are always there to talk with you and make you feel  so special! . MaryLou will cater to you ... best service I've ever had!  DO NOT MISS THIS RESTAURANT!! YOU WILL HAVE AN EXPERIENCE YOU WILL NOT FORGET!  spend time walking around and enjoy each room's decor!    doesn't get better than 15 Fox Place!!!!!!!
