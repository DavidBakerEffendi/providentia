I stumbled upon this place after a visit to the Tenement Museum. The Liverwurst was the perfect starter, served with red onion marmalade, the perfect compliment of condiments, and toasted rye bread. The Herring Salad was a bit overdressed and vinegary. Tasty but in a smaller portion. The entree was a perfectly cooked sausage served over a bed of delicious not-so-sour sauerkraut But, the best part of the meal was the sample I received of Spaetzle. It was my first time tasting it and I was blown away by, not only the intense flavor, but the simplicity in the dish. I can see how you can eat an entire bowlful! Excellent treasure in LES!
