Not the Koch's I remember from back in the day. The meat was just cold cuts that you would get at some grocery store deli counter. There was a decent amount of meat in the sandwich, but who cares when the meat isn't anything special, and certainly not close to real Jewish deli. Nothing else about the sandwich was particularly good, as if that matters. Well, I guess the bread was OK. What a disappointment. I wish I would have read more yelp reviews before going there as I see someone else wrote about how Bob Koch passed away and the store was sold back in 2005. I knew Lou had passed away, but I thought the deli was still in the Koch family.
