We had a great dinner at Monument Lane on a recent trip to New York. My husband couldn't make it this time and I'm very excited to have him try it next time. As others have said, the pretzels with Gouda and pork cracklin are fantastic. I could eat several helpings myself! Maybe not the healthiest thing to do though. Â I'll stick to sharing it as an appetizer. I had a little bit of everyone's main course at our table. My personal favorite was the burger. I don't know what they do to it, but it's awesome. Maybe the best burger ever. I'm not much of a lamb person, but I had a bite anyway and was pleasantly surprised. Very tasty and wonderfully prepared. I'd even considering getting it as my own entree. The decor is fun and very well thought out. Even the bathrooms were designed with the whole colonial theme in mind. The one I went into had a pull chain toilet. Very cool. Try the cask beer. It's meant to be served warmer than most beer, but was great and we all had a couple. Cant wait to go back!
