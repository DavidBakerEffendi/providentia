I would not recommend wasting your time. You will be waiting to be made fun of at this restaurant. My wife and I have been coming to NYC from Louisiana for 5 years to visit my daughter who lives in Manhattan. We look for all the top rated places to eat each time we come to visit. We have always loved the people and the awesome food all over the city, but we've never been treated so rude as we were the morning of Tuesday March 26, 2013 at this restaurant. Waiting an hour and a half for a table is not a problem for us, but once we got inside we were laughed and gawked at by the two waitresses and the water boy the whole time. All because I asked for a glass of water. If the owner would have been monitoring his servants that day he would have fired these 3 people. It all got started when I asked for a glass of water after the orange juice had been delivered to the table.The italian in me wanted to lash out at these people but I am not about making a scene in a restaurant. The highly rated taste of the pancakes does not reflect the attitude of the servants in this place whatsoever. I was so ready to leave that I could not tell you whether the food was tasty or not. I ended up spending 75 dollars plus a tip for 3 orders of pancakes and orange juice for my wife, daughter and myself. What a huge let down to my daughter who wanted my wife and I to be treated to a place she has been a few times. All of us were telling friends at a social the same night, not to waste your time going to this place. But if you are ok with extremely poor service then go ahead and give it a try.
