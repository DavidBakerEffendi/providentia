My husband I loved this place. We had dinner on April 07, 2013. The chicken paprika and the beef goulash were great. We had crepes and strudel for dessert. I was quite tasty. We live in Staten Island and this is a bit of drive but it is worth it. Wish it was closer to us. We will be back, not as frequently as we would like due to distance. Delicious!
