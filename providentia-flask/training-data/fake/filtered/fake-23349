If you want the best burgers ever, after Burger King (hehe, just kidding), come to this place. Desserts are like heaven (or limbo for some of us, hehe). Especially their yummy apple pie. And staff are much friendlier than in Whisk or than in any post-gentrified establishment Â in pseudoanarchic Cortelyou Road... PS: I finally know what s brewing in Brooklyn! An amazing Brooklyn Lager and a freakishly red Coney Island Freaktoberfest. Thank you, Brooklyn. Totally love and respect you for your warm welcome!
