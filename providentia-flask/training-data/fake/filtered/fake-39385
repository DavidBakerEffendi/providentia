An okay neighborhood restaurant. I went a couple times, and I'm less and less of a fan. Okay service, okay food, but the pork was way too fatty (some fat would retain flavor, but too much fat is just a sign of poor quality control on their ingredient). I would rather go do Ippudo or other Ramen shops. And honestly, quality/price ratio is slightly lower than average.
