I live right around the corner and saw this place being built for a while, so when i saw it was open, i figured i had to try one of their cheesesteaks.  I was hoping i wouldnt have to drive out to delassandro's or down to john's roast pork anymore, but i was very disappointed with this place.  the roll was great, but the meat was not sliced thin, and it wasnt chopped up like it should be, also the cheese should be mixed with the meat instead of just placed on the roll.  also, places like delassandro's give you plenty of meat, this place, the meat didnt even come close to covering the whole roll.  the decor is nice and its clean, and dont know about  the other food, but there cheesesteaks need tons of improvement.
