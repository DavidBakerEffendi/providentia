Pat's steaks...The only reason it doesnt get a one is because of the price the speed and the employees. The price is fair for a cheesteak, the epmloyees are always kind and you never have to wait too long even if your at the back of the line. Pat's is simpy a reputation place. The steaks arent the cream of the crop, they arent even close. They are not chopped and they taste like rubber tires. Maybe older people like the taste of rubber, because anymore they are the only ones that will ever say anything good about a pats steak. Not to mention the fact that pat's didnt donate any of the money to the mummers parade when its own city needed it. Pats is not the place to go, if you can avoid it. But if your up at three in the morining and want a steak go to genos right across the street
