we went there because a friend told us that they just came out with a new menu. its a little hard to find but all the locals go there. they are byob so me and my wife brought a nice bottle of wine. she had the new athena pear salad(she normally would get the canal salad), and i had the sweet potato encrusted crab cakes. everything was really good.................our waitress peggy even remembered our names from the last time we were there! warm and cozy all around. they just repainted and my wife kept talking about using their decor for when we redo our living room. they have a new chef too, who was out in the dining room lighting up some flaming cheese dishes for the tables that ordered it. the whole thing is a fun experience......love the fact that they do takeout. its great when we dont want to take the kids out and can just order and pick up
