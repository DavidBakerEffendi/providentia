Good food, bad service, and usually slow service. They really need to step up in this department. Â I called a few times last night and the phone was busy (what else is new, there's always some issue with this place), so I ended up ordering from somewhere else. I've tried a few of the dishes here, and they've been great. I like the dip they give you when you sit down to eat. I like the Guayanes arepa, good choice for vegetarians. The empanadas should not be overlooked either! If whoever is running this place gets their shit together, this will be a solid mainstay in the area.
