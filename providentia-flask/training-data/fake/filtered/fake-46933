I just left this restaurant and in the three years I have lived in New York City I have never had worse service. We had about 4 different people come up to our table at different times. Our entrees we're served while the plates for our appetizers were taking over our table. We couldn't get anyone's attention to pick up our empty plates. We couldn't get anyone's attention to place another drink order. We got our menus for dessert very quickly, however no one came over to see if we wanted to order dessert or get our check. I had to call out to a waitress walking by to get our check. Then our waiter whom I believe was "Angel" but who knows, was talking to a woman for about 10 minutes before assisting the other person with getting our check sorted out. Worst service EVER. I would never ever return to this restaurant. Awful, awful, awful.. I can't believe this place is still in business.
