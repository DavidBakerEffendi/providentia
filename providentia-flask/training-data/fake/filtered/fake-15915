My boyfriend and I decided to eat something "different" and stopped here, so glad we did.  For apps; I got the french onion soup and he got the wings.  The soup was very good, the wings were average.  Not bad, but nothing special about them.  For dinner we both got the Haggies and Tatties (he got the regular and I got the vegetarian), they were very good.  Neither of us had ever heard of this meal and now we are inlove with this meal!  One of the owners waited on us at the bar, he was very friendly and was willing to explain the meals to us as we didn't know what haggies and tatties were.
