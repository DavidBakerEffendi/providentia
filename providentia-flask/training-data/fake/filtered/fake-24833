If you have an affinity for all things German than this place is like heaven!  If you enjoy good times and good beer than this may be your new favorite spot!  The beer selection is vast with plenty of german wheats both light and dark and just enough pilsners to satisfy all spectrums of your German beer experience.  The Krostrinter Dunkel and Fransekaner Dunkelweissen are 2 exceptional options but there are plenty of lighter beers if you are so inclined.  Go for the Das Boot if you want the whole table to enjoy in on the fun.  Add in some half liters and liters and all your worries will subside. As for the food the spetzel, the wurst platter and the potato pancakes are exceptional.  It does get mad busy during the dinner rush so be cognizant of that when ordering in large groups.  But the food is certainly worth the wait.  Prost. The staff is both fun loving and knowledgeable about the German food and beer, and all make solid recommendations if you are indecisive about the intimidating menu.  If you have had high school German or have visited Germany this will be fun chance to use some of the basic German phrases you have picked up.  FYI most of the staff's german is pretty good and asking them to translate is not a problem.   This place rocks!
