I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. I live close by and order when I'm too tired to cook. I've eaten their pepperoni, margherita, and meat pizza, but their clam pizza is my favorite. I can vouch that the pizza comes out better if you order it in a size medium or larger. I've also tried their eggplant parm and calzoni (large means large!) and the buffalo chicken sub is surprisingly delicious. Although delivery is free, try to pick up if you can because it will cut the wait time in half.
