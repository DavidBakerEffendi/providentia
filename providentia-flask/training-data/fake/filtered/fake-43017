So I visited this restaurant on a Saturday at 6:00.  The waiter was very good and efficient, and when my wife went to the restroom the waiter even re-folded her napkin.  The food was great.  There were 4 of us, I ordered the sushi/sashimi combination and it was phenomenal.  My wife ordered the sea bass, and our other two guests ordered the Halibut special and the Dynamite roll everyone was so pleased with their selections.  It was great.  We also ordered 4 appetizers and had a reasonable amount of drinks.  The bill was surprisingly 237.00  not including tip, but we were stuffed and everyone but me had a nice buzz going on by the time we left.  Great for a date night out.  I wsh they would have served a salad or miso soup with the meal but it is what it was.
