This is a Japanese noodle chain, this being the NY variety. I went rather late at night and enjoyed a steaming hot bowl of pork ramen with egg. I can't really complain - the ramen was fine - and the atmosphere was reasonable. I guess I just had higher expectations having dined at the originals in Japan. Still, for ramen fans looking for a solid outing, this is a good spot. Be prepared to wait, though - it's generally extremely crowded.
