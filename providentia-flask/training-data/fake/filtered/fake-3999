Our family has been going here for over 50  years.  Although we don't live in the area any more.  We always stop in for pizza when we are in the area.  Park Tavern has been a area favorite since I was a small child. Their other food is very good also but we always order the pizza.  The pizza with eggplant is great with very thin slices of fried eggplant.  But the best way to enjoy this pizza is a plain cheese pizza, thin crunchy crust, tomato sauce & cheese.  The best purest tasting pizza ever!!!!  I can't wait to visit relatives again and get some more of that yummy pizza.
