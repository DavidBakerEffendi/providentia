MY nephew selected Sazon for his graduation dinner.  My initial apprehension (I had heard it was BYOB & cash only) soon vaporized as we were warmly greeted upon arrival (even though the 9 of us were 1 hour early).  We also entered with a cooler filled with our wine/liquor selections! The owners/hosts were too kind!  We experienced very friendly service, without hovering or disturbing our conversation. It was great hearing their story first hand and then experiencing the fruits of their culinary skills. Our family has Latin roots so many of the dishes were familiar.  That also means that we were a little more discriminating.  No one was disappointed! As a new vegetarian, I was also pleasantly surprised by the selections available for me. I now have Sazon in my smartphone, and will be returning to enjoy more of their delicious food, atmosphere and service.
