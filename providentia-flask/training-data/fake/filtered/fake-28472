2 Adults had dinner on Thur. 10/28/10.  The food was very bad! I doubt that they have a chef. My duck was OLD and stringy. The cold lumpy risitto it was placed on top of was strongly flavored with something like blue cheese. It was garnished with Asian flavored thin strings of what must have been dried vegetables. All the flavors clashed and ran into each other. My guest had crab cakes.  They too were warmed up after frying. He had lumpy cold mashed potatos with the vegetables strings.  Both meals were skimpy and nasty.  This place specializes in microwave leftovers. The bread was stale and rewarmed. It was served with a bottle of oil...no butter. Never again! This place needs to close.
