This restaurants is far one Â of my favorites places to dine with friends and solo. The food and relaxing atmosphere sells itself !!! I always eat breakfast but next time I'm doing lunch because when I see servers serving lunch dishes I instantly want what they have. You must go if you never been or new to the city. I took a cab because it was cold outside coming from the downtown area.
