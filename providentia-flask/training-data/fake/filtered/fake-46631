My daughter and I have eaten here a few times, I can't lie but their food is good every time I've gone but unfortunately the service stinks, you get a weird sense that the employees  including the manager are a bit bias; if you don't look like a local your pretty much guaranteed to be treated like dirt.   It's a shame, the food is good but I feel this was my last visit to this prejudice run local inn...
