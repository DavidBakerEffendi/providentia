I have been checking this place out on a regular basis over the past 6 months. It's got a very upscale, chic, and trendy look, and quite a nice feel. The food is genuinely good and surprised me by how much I liked it. In particular, the Gulf Shrimp w/ vidalia onions. The service has differed. During the happy hour it gets pretty full, so it should come as no surprise that the service deteriorates a little bit, but the serving staff is very likable and try. That leads me to the flip side of this 'restaurant'. It gets loud on Thursday and Friday due to a DJ at night. This is far from a bad thing. For once it's not some horrid DJ playing the same thing I hear on the radio 20 times a day. One day they play mostly house and older funky music, and the other has another guy playing a great mix of everything. The bar staff is also super friendly. Definitely shocks me we have a place this cool in Hartford. Usually have to go to NY to find a great food and equally great night scene too.
