Got the $12 for two appetizers LivingSocial Instant Deal. Chose the shortrib mac & cheese and the scallops. Great service by the bartender and friendly cook/owner. The portion of mac & cheese was a good size, it was rich and very tasty.  The shortrib chunks were solid, but nothing amazing. The scallops were 3 scallops, cooked perfectly on top of basically a fig jam/jelly.  While not a massive portion size, they were extremely tasty. Saw the cheese plate being served and it looked great and very big, with almost a whole loaf of baguette, honey, etc..!
