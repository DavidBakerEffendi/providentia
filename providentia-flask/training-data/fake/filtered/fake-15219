We came here from out of town. Was told there would be a 20 minute wait... Was not sat for 58 minutes. The hostess clearly did not understand how to manage a restaurant. Food was average at best. Not worth the wait and poor service. As someone who is willing to wait for a good brunch, I would recommend finding a better alternative than waiting for this place.
