The food here is surprisingly good - highly recommend the artichoke dip and mac and cheese.  Freeman's definitely lives up to its reputation for hipsters (I'm pretty sure some of the male customers were wearing eye makeup), but it's good for a big group since they take recommendations and good for a date if your girl likes to see and be seen.  But the wait might kill you.
