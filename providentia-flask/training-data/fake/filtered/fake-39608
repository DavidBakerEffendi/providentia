I love this place, I live 1 block from here and I just go pick up food all the time. Food is awsome, spicy and the service is very quick! The duck is amazing here and so is the massaman curry. One negative thing is that they do not take CC, cash only, Easiest way to get here is take 7 express or local and get off at 61st street and walk.
