I came in for the lunch special and the waiter ignored me when no one was even in the restaurant. Then, he was busy talking to the other employees and finally came to my table after being so kind. He then took my order, and sat in the back yapping away and not even checking on my food after 25 minutes! He then proceeded to slam my food on my table, when I asked for more sauce, he said, "it is already in the dish." Instead of being a good waiter, he argues with me,so he can avoid the ten step voyage back to the kitchen. While I am eating, the whole staff is having a loud and obnoxious conversation and not once did he check up or fill my water. Not until, the bill was handed, did he say,"Oh, ten dollar minimum. " I told him to charge it for the price. He then said, I will charge a three dollar tip. hahahah...wow, some nerve. A tip for his lazy and unprofessional ass.. I told him to charge me for the price of the meal and no tip, because it was horrible service. He gave me the check and I signed it with NO TIP. Dinner time might be more pleasant, but lunch time is atrocious. DO NOT GO THERE FOR LUNCH!!! RUDE and NO CLASS!
