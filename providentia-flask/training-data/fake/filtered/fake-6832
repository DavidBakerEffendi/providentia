I made my own potato, it was great tasting. Only recommendations is that the menu is so big to choose from, I would've liked it if they had more options in the "signature meals" section so I could just choose something they know tastes good. I'm really indecisive and was a little overwhelmed by all the choices... Not really a bad thing. Also, I think the portion size needs to increase a bit. Made my own with bacon and 2 sauces, and the total came close to $10. I just think if I'm paying Chipotle type prices (I get the same vibe) I should be getting more, like chipotle size portions. It's not McDonald's but hey it's still fast food! And $10 is steep.
