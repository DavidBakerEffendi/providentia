So, I bypassed Vanessa's (my staple) and tried Prosperity due to user reviews.  Ergh.  The "fried" dumplings were hardly fried & basically boiled in entirety, i noticed "gristle", and worst of all - they forgot (or possibly dont provide) the essential dumpling dipping sauce!  (This really makes the dumpling, my friends).  Vanessa's makes the best soy/ginger/vinegar mix of something for dipping.  YUM.  Sorry, Prosperity...Vanessa's it is.
