The small storefront opens into a long cavern with festive diners.  A little loud but that is the mood.  Their pizza is very good.  Their thin crust makes it easy to consume slice after slice.  Crust is not doughy at all and the sauce has a touch of sweetness. Good pizza at a very reasonable price. Service is reliable.
