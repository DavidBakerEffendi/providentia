We had lunch there the other day. Two adults, two children. We had NO appetizers, no alcohol, no dessert.  The bill was  $87.09. to make sure that you you read that correct  $87.09.  There is no lunch that is worth 87.09. the waiter had personality, however not $87.09. I said something to the manager. She said that they were "fine dining".  There is no place in the upper valley that is fine dining. I also informed her that fine dining requires a dress code and it is not blue jeans and a sweat shirt. They are a FAR CRY from fine dining. I will NEVER EVER return to Koto's in West Lebanon NH. Not for a lunch for 2 adults and 2 children for $87.09. Unless you have more money than you know what to do with than I suggest any of the other restaraunts in the upper valley that has faster service, better prices and FREE refills on drinks.   It won't let me post this with out giving one star they deserve 0 stars !!!!!!!!!
