Had a wonderful dinner at Vesta last night!  The food was amazing, the atmosphere was perfect and the service was top notch   Our server, Evan, made the whole night worth it.  He was so attentive.  He suggested the mushroom bianca pizza and he was right - it was amazing with a little flirt of truffle oil drizzled all over the top.  The calamari was good - not mind blowing but definitely fine. We will definitely be back and are happy to find a nice little cozy Italian place in Rutherford.  The price was a tad higher than we wanted, but we ordered wine, app, entree and dessert so it is hard to come away cheap!!
