Going for brunch we were looking for eggs. We got sold pretty heavily an omelet with eggs and potatoes by the server. How disapointing the outcome. Stodgy potatotes plastered on this bland base with zero taste of eggs. We ordered a side of beans (expensive) and what we got was beans and rice. When we raised it - we were told its the only way it comes?? So now we had rice, potatoes and eggs. Apart from that - again bland and clearly re-heated. The decor of the place is really drab and old fashioned. The booths are dark and the servers polite but very into their own conversations dissapearing in the kitchen for long periods. Overall - once in this palce is enough. Shame we expected so much more.
