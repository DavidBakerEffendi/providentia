This is the best Middle Eastern food in the area. Lot of fresh veggies, excellent salads, good juicy kabobs, and the bread you can stop eating it. Friendly service, perfect for groups. If you drink alcohol bring your own, they will not charge you for cork service. If you go with a lot of people order a variety of Â  appetizers and share. Good size portion. Perfect for vegetarian or meat lovers. You will love it. I am always pleased with my food and the service.
