Joe installed an outdoor Tantenna on my house in Brooklyn, NY.  I found him helpful, professional, efficient, courteous and knowledgeable.  Not only that but he was on time.  And he even called me the next day to make sure that everything was working properly.  I will certainly call him again for other projects.  I can't recommend him highly enough!
