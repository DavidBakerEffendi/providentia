Prime 16 has a nice selection of draft beers and a fairly extensive bar if you are into different whiskeys.  They do also have wine and large salads, wings and apps. Burgers are the star of the restaurant. Each burger came with choice of fries, sweet potatoes, or you could upgrade to parmesan truffle oil fries.  Nicely sized  portions and fries were tasty.  I have been to the New Haven and Orange location. I was expecting with a name like Prime 16 they would have steaks too, but they are all about the handcrafted burgers instead.   If you are looking a for a burger and drinks this is a good spot to hang out with friends, coworkers or colleagues.
