Used to be good. Now bad. Have had burritos where they've forgotten the beans - just a roll of white rice. How hard can it be to make a burrito? Tip: The ingredients are good, they just don't know how to make burritos. If you have to get food from them, buy a "burrito bowl" and ask for a tortilla roll on the side. You'll get twice as much stuffing for your burrito. But you have to watch them make it: I haven't had an order from them in 6 months where they didn't leave something out until I pointed it out to them.
