Food was yummy  ! Very tasty . I ordered the plantains with a spice that tasted like curry  with coconut rice .  Everyone at the table was happy with their food.. It was quiet when I got there but a couple tables filled in as the night progressed. Only complaint , as much as the food is good .. I felt like it was very pricey .
