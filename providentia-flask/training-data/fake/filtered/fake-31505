Parking is an absolute nightmare, a limo is highly recommended.  Or else you'll need to leave time for stalking past patrons for a spot. The legs at this establishment believe they are a step above a Don Coqui type, so they put on their best outfit and simmer down the accents.  For some reason they fluffed me about the unavailability of outside seating, I was sent to the bar for a drink while I wait.  When I finally got my table outside there was a plethora of available tables.  The mosquitoes do not stop!  They could have at least put some citronella in the candles.  It's hard to enjoy the meal when you're being ravaged by west nile.  Food was good, menu was limited.  Waitress was brain dead with a unibrow. The view was the best part of the experience.
