Really just bad. Looks nice, but not one real smile in the place & not one authentic dish. Enough is enough. Stop trying to copy people that really know what they're doing. This place seems like it's run by someone just trying to make money. There's no soul in the people or in the food. Will not be coming back here - then again, it was a friend's decision to come here in the 1st place - not mine.
