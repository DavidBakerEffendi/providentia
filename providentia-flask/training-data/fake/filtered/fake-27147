I've found that whenever I go grocery shopping, I tend to gravitate toward fruits and veggies that come with stamps attached. The fruit stamp, that "holy-grail-of-seal-of-approvals" is reassuring.... Finding the fruit stamp in my cooked food is not. Two stars.....one for each of the shrimp that came in my 'calamari and grilled shrimp' salad.
