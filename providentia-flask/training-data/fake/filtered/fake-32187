on tuesday evening i saw on the window about newsday review or something, so just went to try it. it looks like a typical mexican restauratn but very dark and cramped. the tables are so close to each other that literally you are so close to the next table that its hard to figure out which one is your table. so after a while i got my server i asked for tilapia and my husband got some chops it came after a long wait this restaurant is suppose to be bbq and my husbands chops were looked like have been baked or fried i am a bbq lover and nobody can hide it from me it was not bbq and from nowhere it tasted like mexican food. ok if the food is not good at least give a good service it was looking if the waitress is doing a favor on me the way she was puting the food on table without a single smile on the face. finally i decided it would be better to eat some taco bell i don't know how they hang this Â review or whatever thing on the window complete disaster
