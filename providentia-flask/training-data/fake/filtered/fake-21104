Went to Lunellos ,at the Montville Inn, this evening.    If you enjoy your glass of wine and sugary desserts, then this is your place to be.   Anything in between was not good.   Often went to Lunellos when it was located on Union Blvd. in Totowa.   It was truly an Italian restaurant.   What I ate this evening and what was listed on the menu was as far from Italy as Montville, NJ.   No one at our table enjoyed their meal.   The staff was friendly but time moved SLOOOOOOOWLY between courses.    Very noisy!   Also very crowded...and God only knows why!   Good luck, Lunellos.    Hope you last a little longer than the new Montville Inn!
