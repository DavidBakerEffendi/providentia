Myself and 4 co-workers were in Philly yesterday,4/25/12, for a meeting. We asked where the best Philly Cheese Steak sandwiches were in Philly. SOOO disapointed in what we received. A nice piece of bread with under cooked diced onions, 2 slices of cheese and a couple slices of over cook beef. This was less meat then a bologna sandwich has on it. After everything we were told and seen on Diners Driveins and Dives. The sandwhich that we received was less then 1/3rd as seen on the TV show. DO not waiste your time. We drove from Maryland. The service was great, product not so.
