This place has decent service, but mediocre food. I'd have to highly urge against eating here for anyone who values cleanliness, as there are cockroaches in the kitchen and many few health or sanitation regulations are followed. Also, a friend who ordered food for delivery had to send half of it back because he found a small white worm of some sort in two of the salads. . Most of the negative reviews listed below are very accurate, particularly the portrayal of the management staff. I mean, any place that lets their kitchen end up in that state, is obviously a little off and highly unprofessional. Super overpriced for the quality of food as well. You're better off going to any of the other lovely restaurants in the Montclair area. They may tend to also be on the pricey side, but at least you won't have to fear pests or disgusting germs being part of your meal. Ultimately, I'd have to recommend passing this restaurant up. Otherwise you'll probably regret it.
