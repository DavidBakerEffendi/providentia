I have to say at the outset that I have been here a number of times andhave been very satisfied with everything.  But, this last visit was very disappointing.  There were 10 of us there October 6 for my neice's birthday and I couldn't believe I was in the same place.  while the atmosphere was the same (and I like it that way), the service and the food was well below the usual par.  Our server acted like we were a bother and she just wanted us to go away, she was curt to everyone and seemed to want to answer no questions about the menu or the food.  A simple request about the soups brought us a "Here, you can read the menu" as a reply.  My wife's fish was cooked but cold - obviously having been left out waiting for another dish to finish.  Not the servers fault but a kitchen problem.  Our drinks took forever and our last round never even got to the table and at least never made it to the tab either.  It's no wonder no one ordered any dessert other than what my brother-in-law had ordered for the birthday girl.  Overall - not one of their better nights - no where near it.  I'm sure we'll be back but next time the manager comes around asking, we won't gloss over like we did this time.
