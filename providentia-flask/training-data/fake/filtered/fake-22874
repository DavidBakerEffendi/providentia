Wow, I'm so excited! This is my first yelp review and it feels awesome to write a positive one at that as a new yelper (after my friends kept convincing to sign-up since I am a Culinary Arts major~ok, you guys win.) I have never heard of Wishbone before until I stumbled upon it after going to the movies with the beau (Godzilla anyone?). Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from Wishbone when I first entered the restaurant. I was a little confused with how to place my order, but I got the hang of it once a fellow staff gave me a spiel about how things worked. Wishbone was described as a craft-fried chicken joint and indeed the chicken were craft alright! Although I didn't particularly enjoy the dark chicken tenders, the white chicken tenders were pretty tasty. I also had the chicken with a couple of sauces which were Chipotle Lime Mayo, Parmesan Pesto, and Madras Curry. Can I just say that I'm a big fan of pesto, but damn...that Madras Curry was good! I also had their biscuit and celery snap drink which the beau thought was ok. I found the food and decor above average, but I was most impressed with the staff. They were very knowledgeable about their products and sincere in helping an indecisive girl pick which chicken she wanted to devour. The verdict, food is 4 stars, however the service is absolutely 5 stars. It's not the food that makes the business great, it's the people. Great job Wishbone...I will definitely be back in the future! My next stop...Chocolate Con Cafe!
