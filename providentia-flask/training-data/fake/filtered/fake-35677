Uncle Moustache is a NYC feeling french-lebanese restaurant --akin to the wonderful Moustache in the West Village. Â Actually one of the owners was the fmr head chef there. Wonderful decor, atmosphere, service and of course the food is par excellence. The Moustache Pitza is my favorite, the Ouzi second and the Crepes w Nutella is an excellent brunch item.
