Wow!  What a great new bar in Old City!   So many places to choose from, but my sister and I decided to try Sto's for lunch today.  Couldn't have picked a better place.   Great beers on tap -- I had Troegs Dreamweaver, a wheat beer, and Walt Wit, a Belgian White.  Both were great, and the Walt Wit was a special so only $3.50 for a pint!  They also had a huge selection of bottled beers available and some nice drink specials.  The food was awesome -- lot's of bar food classics, but also some unique offerings.  While tempted by the wings (various sauces and a great price), I had to try something different.  Scrapple sticks = awesome!  I don't know if they have them anywhere else in Philly (you'd kinda think its a no brainer since scrapple is a Philly favorite), but I've never seen them.  Crispy and delicious with applesauce dip.  The cream cheese balls were also amazing.  I've had cream cheese in poppers before but never just cream cheese in a crispy coating with a yummy strawberry dipping sauce.  So good!  Their signature sandwich, the Stogie, was to die for.  Hoagie meats in an amazing crust (not quite calzone since open and not quite flatbread, but whatever it is it's delicious) with romaine, thinly sliced onions and the tastiest sauce ever!  Great portion sizes (thankfully the waitress warned us that the Stogie was huge, so we shared).  The staff was friendly and efficient, especially our waitress, Lindsey.  We even chatted a bit with the owner, who was a great guy.  I'm sure this place will be a great success. Great beers, awesome food, great prices, nice atmosphere and tons of TVs.  I know I'll be back frequently!   More beers to try, and I think the Stogie might be addicting, though I'm determined to try the wings next time.
