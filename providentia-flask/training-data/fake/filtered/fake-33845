Overpriced. The pizza was really not what I expected. My friend told me about the place and took me here. The service was good, it is a nice place too. I, however, love food. I am from NY and nothing makes me happier than a good pizza and sadly I was not impressed. It did not taste fresh and would recommed you try something else if you go.
