In order to get tapas and a small table you will need to wait at least 40 min on a Saturday night, but rest assure that you will leave a very satisfied customer. Try not to over look this place as you pass it by---its a little hole in the wall but the result will leave you asking for more! The tapas are very tasty especially the Patatas Fritas, bread w/fava bean spread and the pork sandwich. To drink I recommed their white sangria w/strawberries and to finish the night a nice dessert of cake w/dulce de leche ice cream. Enjoy!
