We have eaten here many times for breakfast.  It's our go-to place and bring out of town friends here also.  Decided to try dinner on a Thursday when they have fish night.  Well, never again for that.  The waitress came and took our order right away, but then we waited a very long time for the first course 3 shrimp cocktails.  Finally a different waitress did bring that.  Neither one offered us water or brought it.  then we waited 40 minutes for what we thought would be the second course, salad.  Well, they never brought that.  We got our dinner, which was overcooked Mahi Mahi.  Told the waitress when she brought that that we never got our salad.  She said she was sorry and that there was only one cook tonight.  Thought she would bring our salad at that point, but no, never received the salad at all.  I wanted to tell them to take something off the bill, but honey wouldn't let me.  Needless to say, will definitely not go back for dinner.  Better to stick with breakfast.
