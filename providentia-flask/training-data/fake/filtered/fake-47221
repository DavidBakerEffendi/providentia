I was very disappointed in Luca's.  We had read rave reviews and expected it to be great Italian food.  Instead most of the food the six of us  ordered was either tasteless or lacked any decent flavor. The menu and specials were limited and the chef didn't seem inclined to take requests. They seem to be trying to be different, but the menu isn't working. You  can get much better food all over NJ for the prices they are charging. The service was fine up until we paid the check and we're still finishing our desserts, which were also disappointing.  The fruit in the berry cobbler was undercooked and the gelato seemed store bought. We were told by another server to wrap it up bc there were people waiting for the table. I have never had that experience in a restaurant, fine dining or not. The only good things here are the "cocoa" pasta and that it's byob, but if you don't live close by it's not worth the trip. In my opinion, this restaurant lacks taste in more ways than one.
