Burgers that are absolutely, deliciously, sublime! The kind you take a bite of and go, "WOW!"  THAT good. Best sweet potato fries I've had in my life!! Chicken wings that are tender and flavorful. For the veg oriented, try the kale. Perfectly cooked. The special desserts that are made in-house change monthly, but I personally will weep if they move the Peanut Butter Cheesecake with Marshmallow Fluff off the menu... They have hit it out of the park. I've been here three times and have had excellent food and service each time!  All the servers are wonderful- Austin and Lucy rock!! The Yelp info says the restaurant is quiet- I'd say it has moderate noise-just right actually. Not too quiet, not too noisy.  Just right! The music is very cool groove music. OK, so here's the rundown- if you love great beer-craft beers, and want a fun, sophisticated  atmosphere with awesome food and service, this is the place to go!
