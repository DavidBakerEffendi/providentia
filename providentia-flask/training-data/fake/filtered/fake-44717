By land or by sea, Petite Crevette is a beacon. In fact, it seems rather appropriate to arrive by tugboat (or at least leave feeling like one), as the nautical ropes strewn from the ceiling, hodge podgery of wonderful knicks and equally charming knacks make this already small restaurant even more cozy. The menu is written down on paper and hung up on the wall, and everything that we ordered from that menu was great. The waiter recommended the Thai Cod Curry which we gladly ordered. My companion ordered a seafood mix in broth (I forgot what it was called); Â the lobster was buttery with that briney sea-taste still deliciously present. All in all, it's a good date place, especially if you enjoy wine, seafood, and leisurely conversation.
