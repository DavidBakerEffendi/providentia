Stay away from an evening fare salad unless you like throwing your money away.  You have to combine it with a crostini to push it beyond a very light snack.  Even then you may be in search of something to eat when you leave.  For the price, you get neither volume nor taste.  If the salads were anything like you picture them when you read the menu they'd be fantastic but, alas, they are not.  Expecting an apple wedge?  How about an apple shaving so thin it's translucent.  Does the salad include cheese?  I'm pretty sure the same shaver is used to create the 4 or five smidgens you get.  I didn't try an evening fare cheese plate.  Perhaps that would be a better bet.  If I go back, I'll go earlier and get a panini, which is not on the dinner menu.
