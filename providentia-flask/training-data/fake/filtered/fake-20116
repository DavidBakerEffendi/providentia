We enjoyed this place a lot. They make REAL Mexican family-style food with very fresh ingredients; this isn't like the Tex-Mex spicy food most mistake for Mexican.  The salsa is excellent, as is the guacamole.  I had the skirt steak tacos (real corn soft tacos!) and the wife had the deluxe burrito.  Both were tasty; I would order the tacos again. Prices range $8-15 per entree.  We considered it a good value for the amount and quality of the dishes.  So much food we rolled out! Service is very friendly, attentive, and fast. Only gave it 4 stars only because I have to be blown away (only twice in my life) to give 5 stars.  We will definitely be going back, as this has become our favorite Mexican restaurant in the Hartford area.
