I've been here four or five times now, once for a birthday, and socially with friends.  It's a great menu, I'd highly recommend it to anybody living in the neighborhood.   The upstairs is probably better than the downstairs, as they have a great open dining area and impressive wine room which you can book for special occasions.  I actually listened to a string quartet last time I dined there, which really made my evening.
