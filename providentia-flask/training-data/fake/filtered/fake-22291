Sorry, but this has been some of the worst pizza we have had in this area. The salad is great, and the crust is thin and fairly crispy. But where are the herbs? Where's the cheese? Where's the olive oil? Where's the flavor? For some reason the Bishops Corner Harry's just doesn't make it, though we have given it a try several times.
