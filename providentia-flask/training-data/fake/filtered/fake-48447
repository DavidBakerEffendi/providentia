It's Pat's Steaks. What are you doing reading a review for Pat's Steaks? They are a shack, they have meat, they have cheese, they put them together on a roll, and they are freaking delicious.  If your reading this to decide between Pat's or Geno's,  then stop being a moron and get one of each. They are across the street from each other. Get off your computer, get one of each, and start making your own decisions in life.
