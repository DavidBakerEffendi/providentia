So, I  never write reviews but this place has undergone so many changes over the past few months that I feel compelled to comment.  I've lived in South Philly for over ten years and have seen a lot of pubs come in strong then fizzle out.  To be honest, that was my initial prediction about this place.   During a recent visit I was pleasantly surprised!  They completely rehabbed the menu with exciting new dishes that are really unlike anything else in the neighborhood.  I feel like this place is finally discovering its niche in the south philly bar scene.  What better dish to pair with their already amazing beer selection than fresh, house made sausages?  Genius! However, I decided I was more in the mood for seafood so I went with the scallops.  I was so pleased with my decision- one of the best seafood dishes I've had in the city, and coming from a self proclaimed foodie, that says a lot!! I can't wait to come back and try the sausages and other new menu items.  Way to go Devil's Den!!!
