El Vez is okay... Mexican is one of my favorite cuisines, and while everything here is decent, nothing blows me away. The price point is a little high, but I still go anyway because the amount of Mexican to choose from in Philly is very limited. Margaritas are pretty good but nothing TOO special. However, the atmosphere is really fun and while nothing is ever AMAZING I haven't ever had anything that has been bad. But for upscale Mexican I would choose Distrito over El Vez. Only thing is it is pretty out of the way for most.
