Very rude! Acted as if they were doing us a favor. I used to visit the store on Oak Tree Road and didn't have any horribly negative experiences. But I recently tried to order through their catering service for a large event I am planning and they were incredibly difficult and attempted to shift the blame onto me despite their mismanagement and disorganization. Poorly trained employees do not know how to provide service. Customer service? More like customer INservice, as in it did not exist.
