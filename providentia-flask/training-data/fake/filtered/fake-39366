I'd lay down on Broadway naked for their date cake alone. Seriously. Eat it. Ever since I left Austin, chased a girl across the pond to Italy, and eventually wound up (alone) in Brooklyn, I've been seeking out small spots like Moto that make me feel at home. Loved even, with a happy crowd around me. Maybe it's the neighborhood, but it's my third time here, and I'm in luuuuuv. Now someone tell me where all the good Italian food is please?
