I thought this was a fabulous place!  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Service above average but I gave it five stars because of the food!  If they get outdoor seating it will be even better.  Very nice spanish wines...great place to socialize with friends but a little 'cramped'.  I am excited about going back!
