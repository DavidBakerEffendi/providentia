Finally got to eat here on September 3rd.  Ordered a BBQ Bacon Bleu and a Butterfinger Shake and it was a perfect day to sit outside.  The service was very good, my waitress checked on me multiple times refilling my water.  I probably waited about 5 minutes for my milkshake and 10 more for my meal.  The food was good, pickle was spicy and I only ate a few of the waffle fries because I was full.  Also couldn't finish the shake.  This was at lunchtime.
