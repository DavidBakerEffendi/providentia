I'm back again! To be welcomed by two gracious smiles as I enter. Seated quickly and as my lovely Crab Rangoon and Pad Sei Eiw lunch comes out I forgot to snap a picture of the crab this time, because I ate it before thinking...lol. The dishes are so flavorful and fresh! The staff an absolute delight and very accommodating. The restaurant is very modern, but the food is very traditional Thai style and very authentic. I asked the waitress about this today, and she told me the chef was Thai from Bankok and has cooked in several restaurants an that his aim was to keep the cuisine as close to the taste that he remembers from back home. I thought that was very sweet.
