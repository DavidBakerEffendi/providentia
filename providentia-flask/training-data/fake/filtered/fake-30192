Have been there quite a few times and they are big supporters of the Amity Community. FANTASTIC HAPPY HOUR! Their Filthy Goose Martinis are awesome stuffed with blue cheese olives. and the raw bar is great. One concern....all the bar tenders Â are great and so is the service ..except for one guy who gave me a " I don't own the place I just work here "when he couldn't figure out how to ring up a gift certificate I was trying to buy. He is totally all over the place ..very disorganized and appears frazzled all the time. I was told he only works one night a week..so I avoid that night. Besides that..GREAT PLACE!!
