This place took over an hour and forty minutes to deliver the food, which was cold when it arrived. On top of this, they messed up the order on everything delivered. Even if the food had been warm, though, it would have been in no way exceptional. Everything was critically under seasoned, the hash was especially bland and also a weird mix of over fried and under fried bordering on uncooked, the scrambled eggs were runny, and the bacon was chewy in a way that makes it hard to bite through. Would not recommend eating there, but whatever you do, do not order from there.
