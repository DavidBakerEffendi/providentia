Okay so let me tell you why they have a good rating. Its because of the price. $6 in manhattan is dirt cheap. The taste is a little better because they have more stuff in it. Its about the quantity and not the quality at this place. Yes, its a little dirty and a bit unclean but hey, what you expect? Very long wait in the line, this place has been hyped up. Their stuff is differently good but not the best.
