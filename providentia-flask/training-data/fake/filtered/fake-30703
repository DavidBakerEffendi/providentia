This is a great restaurant! The view and setting is superb, and probably the best in the area. Watching the small planes take off and land as you eat is a very unique experience. The service was excellent, and the food was decent. They have live music at night Thursday thru Sunday on the beautiful outdoor patio. Be warned, this place is mobbed on weekend nights!
