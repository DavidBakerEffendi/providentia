Horribly dry, meat has no flavor, and onions were nasty. They didn't melt the cheese, they just put 2 slices in the bread and put meat on top. My wife actually brought me on from a food cart once that tasted better.  I should have listened to the ratings everyone on yelp gave it. I hope this isn't representative  of Philly people and their famous cheesesteaks. I saw this on a tv show and came down from Baltimore to try it, never again. I guess the museums were very cool. Everyone just try the one across the street, the line seemed pretty long.
