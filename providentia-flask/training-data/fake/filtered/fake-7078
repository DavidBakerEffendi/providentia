Great place to eat out at for a quick and heavy meal. Its open late at night so its convenient to go to after a club or bar. Always have standard menu and a lot of different options. Great place for those vegetarian people out there. Price is average, usually it takes about 2 rolls to fill up on. They have also added new additional sauces and chutneys that makes the food even more flavorful. The atmosphere is great!
