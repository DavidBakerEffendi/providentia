Delicious! I absolutely had a good experience. The restaurant is in a nice area. Atmosphere is really relaxing. The stuff was attentive and very polite. I ordered short rib buns, tonkotsu ramen and coffee and donuts for dessert. Service was quick, everything went out in in a proper order. My ramen was wonderful and rich in flavor. Overall, it's a great place both for dates and big parties. I am definitely coming back! This is my favorite spot now!!! Oh don't forget to leave room for coffee and donuts :)
