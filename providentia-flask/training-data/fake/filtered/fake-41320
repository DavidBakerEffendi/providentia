My experience was similar to the other review.  We thought we would try a new restaurant in town and arrived a little after opening on a Sunday.  Another couple arrived just before us so we waited at the door for assistance.  The bartender just looked at us and said nothing.  The other couple went up to the bartender and asked about seating and we were told to sit anywhere in the dining room.  After turning on the lights ourselves we sat down and waited about 10 minutes and no restaurant staff came into the dining room during that time frame so we left.  With all the places to eat in the area competition is fierce so it will be a miracle if this restaurant can make a go of it based on my experience.
