I loved this place when it first opened, but have since witnessed the decline. The restaurant's standards have just gone downhill. I used to go there because they had the best Sauvignon Blanc at the offered price, and the food was pretty spectacular. Unfortunately, I will not return again. The last time my boyfriend and I went, we decided to visit them during Sunday Brunch. Big mistake. We sat outside, because the weather was decent, and it took half an hour for us to get waited on. When the waitress did finally find us, she was flustered and out of it. She took our orders, and it took another half hour for us to get water. After waiting, I kid you not, and hour and a half for brunch, I discover mold on my fruit salad. When I brought this to the attention of the waitress, when she finally checked back, she said she'd take it to the kitchen... another hour passes, when she comes to check on us again, I asked what the kitchen had to say. In an obvious measure to cover up the fact she had forgotten to bring the matter up, she said it was an apple core... An. Apple. Core. I am not a food snob, I tip 30 to 40% on any check, and I DO NOT send food back EVER. I work in the business, and have since I was a teenager, I know things happen, but to be blatantly disregarded and ignored like that really upset me. I asked to speak to her manager (another thing I never do) and she said there was none. I said, well can I speak to your head chef? (S)he wasn't there either. The bartender? The head waitress? No one was available. I was being dismissed because she did not want to get in trouble. I understand she could have been busy and the restaurant could have been understaffed, but that is inexcusable. I have since not returned after almost a year. It's not worth it.
