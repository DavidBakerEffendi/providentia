Not only was the atmosphere relaxed yet chic, the food was amazing.  I had the Yellow Fin Tuna, and my boyfriend had the New York Strip.  It's two months later and he is still talking about it.  He said it by far the most amazing NYS he had ever had in his life.  There was not even a touch of fat in it, which is rare for that cut of meat.  My dish was absolutely amazing, and melted in my mouth.  The sides of  the eggplant caviar and tomato compote really brought out a different taste from the catch.  Oy Vey! The desserts were overrated.  The doughnuts were similiar to the chain restaurant, "Smokey Bones".  And the server was not very helpful and took forever.  She also was rather pretentious.  That's the only reason I left one star off the rating.  Everything else was amazing!
