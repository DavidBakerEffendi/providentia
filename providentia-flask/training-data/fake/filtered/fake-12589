I love the farm to table concept...so, I was supposed to "get" this place.  I eat with my eyes as much as my stomach, but my experience was nothing short of disappointing.  In addition to cramped tables, our server addressed us when we were in the middle of conversation, and I had to ask for our 2nd bottle of wine to be opened even though there were clearly empty classes on the table.  While the presentation was very good, the food was just barely ok, and nothing compared to the taste I expected from this highly rated spot. When you offer an extremely limited prix fixe menu, everything on it needs to be outstanding.  Our soup seemed to be all cream and had a subtle, far too subtle, taste of cauliflower, our escargot were tender but lacking in flavor, and our goat cheesecake was heavy and felt more like a cheese course than a dessert...an odd offering since cheese was offered as an appetizer. The beef entree was successful, but the fish was nothing out of the ordinary and lacking the desirable crispy skin.  So, when the check came, I felt cheated out of a great food experience.  Too bad, the joke was on me.
