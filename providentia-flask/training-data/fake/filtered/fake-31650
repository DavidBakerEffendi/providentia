Had an excellent dinner here. The pretzel sticks are addictive (get more than one order if there are three of you, as was the case with us) and the meat loaf was the best I have ever had in a restaurant. The Manhattan cocktail is called something else on the menu, but well worth ordering if you're a bourbon fan. Service was friendly but not intrusive....we were having a lively conversation throughout the meal, yet I don't remember being interrupted once. Â Such a rarity these days.
