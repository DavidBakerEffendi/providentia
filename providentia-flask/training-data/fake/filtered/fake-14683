Overpriced. I bought creme brulee, which should have a crystallized top. Instead it was like soft custard.  The tiramisu was just mocha mousse.  The cannoli shells are always stale and hard. We got sandwiches once, and it barely has any meat in it. People rave about this place, probably because its the only bakery around. For great bakery items, make a trip to Gencarelli in Bloomfield,  Brothers Bakery in Kearny (the BEST bread), Calandra's in West Caldwell.
