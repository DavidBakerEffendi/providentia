The pizza bus is exactly like that. It's a nice escape; you feel silly and different on a bus full of adults there to eat pizza! a Pizza fanatic. I became a lot more knowledgeable about the different types of ovens, pies, slices, cheeses, etc. I enjoying three completely different styles of pizza and talking all about pizza from how to make it, ingredients, history, where to go and anything else you can think about pizza. If you enjoy cooking shows- specifically Alton Brown- this is a great tour for you. I enjoyed trying the different kinds of pizza and comparing notes with the other tour members.
