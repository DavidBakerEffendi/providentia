Awful. Bloody awful. Friends who live close by gave us a coded message after the opening week that it wasn't that good, but they were being polite. We tried Entree tonight, hoping that the opening jitters had been resolved. Food was dreadful - this place will be closed within a few months. The 5 star reviews on here are not legit.
