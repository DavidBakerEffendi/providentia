I often order the pizza for a pickup as the table service is not all that great. But being locked up all weekend at home because of the cold. My Husband and I decided to dine in and take a chance. Well, we were lucky to get an older experienced Italian Waiter (David) who really knows Beer, wine and food pairing. As to his advice we ordered a Margherita and the special pizza # 1 with this mild flavor panchetta. Both came out promptly. The flavor of both was delicious, especially the the #1. The crust was not too chewy but more along the line of what might find at Motorino in the city. Also our Margherita was a top contender too! For desserts he brought out their very own cheese cake to die for. Wherever you are, it's worth a trip to the Dumbo to taste their traditional Neapolitan pies.
