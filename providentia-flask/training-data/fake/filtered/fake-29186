I was intent on stopping in Clifton, NJ at a place I had just seen on a food network show on TV . But noooooooooooooooooo, I was talked into going to Annabella's. Â It is hard to satisfy an old traveling geezer like me, I have eaten Italian hoagies all over America and Annabella's ranks with the best ! I wasn't disappointed, I don't think you will be either!
