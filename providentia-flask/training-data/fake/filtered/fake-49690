We previously went here for open dining and it was excellent.   Don't go to one of there special events.  We went to the seafood bake.  It was a buffet set up.  We had to wait in a very long line to get the food and steamed clams were nearly gone when I finally reached them. Very disorganized in the way this was put together.  Almost seemed as if they never did a buffet before. Food was not at good temperatures and disappointing.  You get to pay a hefty sum for this package.   If I go back it would be for waiter served only.  They do well with that.
