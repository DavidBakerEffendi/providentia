Went there on a double date and had a fantastic time.  Decided to just go with the Chefs tasting menu instead of decyphering what everything was and having to make 12 choices.  Our waitress was very attentive and spread out each plate perfectly.  We were there for close to 3 hours which is exactly what I was hoping for, it seemed like the night was moving at the perfect pace.  Everything we had from the cheese plates to the final desert dish was an adventure and a delightful taste.   The only thing that I wish was included that we did not get was the white truffle soup, I had this once before at Tinto and it is truly amazing.  It was definitely expensive when paying for two, but well worth the atmosphere, great food and fantastic wine.
