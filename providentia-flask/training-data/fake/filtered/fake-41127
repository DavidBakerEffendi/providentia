after hearing the rave for this place I had to check it out myself to form my own opinion. the result is Totto Ramen is not good as people talk about. I had much better. Their chicken broth soup was too salty, can I say that I might get a heart attack from finishing their one bowl of soup. Also the meats was not tender. I wouldn't pay $13 for a bowl of salty soup.
