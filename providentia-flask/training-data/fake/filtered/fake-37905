Hands down, one of the best dining experiences you will have in Greater Hartford, especially if you appreciate locally sourced ingredients and dishes that are not drenched in butter and salt. Plus, it's got a funky, big city vibe, something along the lines of what you would find in the Meat Packing District in NYC. I also like their commitment to Farm-to-Table, which means a more limited menu that has some creativity behind it.
