as a native Los Angeleno, I never thought i'd acquire the most serious tan of 2010 standing in a pizza-line in Brooklyn.  90 minutes in, i was convinced i myself had been in grimaldi's coal burning oven. word to the wise: wear sunblock. i'm serious. okay, so the pizza was delicious.  we ordered a large pie with extra basil.  when trying "good pizza" i don't believe in throwing a bunch of toppings on it until i know how i feel about the basic version.  and suffice it to say that grimalidi's did an excellent job.  easily top 5 of my life... probably top 3.   prepare for a long wait and a slight burning sensation if you go during daylight.  the service is hurried and the line sucks, but i'm a big believer that good things come to those who wait.  enjoy.
