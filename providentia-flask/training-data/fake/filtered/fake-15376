nice touch of flavors, nice touch of style, the place is cozy and well set, clean and honest since the beginning. I like calamari and their sweet bitterness and the way the serve a rib eye, looks like a lot of experience in providing food and service, no fancy things , just real food and tasty meat. I'll be back for sure.
