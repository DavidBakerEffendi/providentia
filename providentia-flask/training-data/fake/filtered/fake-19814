If you are on a budget but do not want to sacrifice quality on one of the most important days of your life, then do yourself a favor and go with Guru palace. We had a small ceremony and reception (50 guests) so we opted for the smaller room because the bar area was so pretty and the color scheme was so warm. It all just fell together perfectly with our fall themed ceremony. The staff was a pleasure to work with, any questions/concerns we had were addressed right away and were made to feel like everything was taken care of. Also, we can't leave out the service staff. Our bartender and servers were so attentive and looked like they were actually happy to be there as well! =) Thank you GURU for making our day as Memorable as we had hoped for.
