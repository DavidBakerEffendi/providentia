I went to Gramercy Tavern for a Romantic diner with my honey. The experience was superb! The restaurant has a nice layout and high ceilings so it gives a really spacious feeling. We had the diner menu and it was plenty. I had the smoked Trout and I understand why people were raving about it; buttery and delicious Then the roasted and Braised Lamb. Perfectly cooked and a bigger portion than I expected. Last but not l√©ast, the Tarte Tatin. Not the lightest but definitly good! I appreciated the fact we were recommanded a good wine and not the most expensive one.
