What a gem of a restaurant! We have frequented it many times, and it is consistently amazing. The food is always tasty, authentic, and of the highest quality. The chef consistently comes up with new and creative ideas for specials, and he never misses. The place is co-run by the main chef and his wife, and they are always around to ensure the quality. I'm not sure how people can criticize the service ... we've always found it to be above and beyond, and so have our friends. Sometimes we do overhear the occasional diner griping unreasonably about wanting a specific table that is occupied, or a certain dinner special that was offered two weeks ago ... unfortunately, that's just not the restaurant's problem. :) But the servers are so friendly and attentive, and they really do all they can to make it a good dining experience for you. It's a great place for a private date, or for a little party ... we've done both! Some of the most amazing food in Philly. Check it out ... you won't be sorry!
