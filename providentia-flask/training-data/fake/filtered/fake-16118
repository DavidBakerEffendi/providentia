First off, I walked in and the host did not greet us or smile, she simply asked me and my boyfriend "for two?" She escorted us to our table, handed us menus and walked away. Rude. Our waitress came and spoke to us with little enthusiasm. I ordered and iced latte, which was gross; too grainy, room temperature, and just sub-par coffee. I also got the salmon eggs Benedict; pretty good. I've had better, but it was fine. Overall, I would not recommend Cafeteria; it's crowded for no reason and the staff is not warm at all. I read reviews on my way over and saw some raving descriptions, getting me excited, but I was let down.
