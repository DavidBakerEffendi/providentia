Terrible.  The service was horrible.  The head waiter was rude, and refused to allow us to sit in the place because there was a "no stroller" policy, even after our waiter told us we could.   This was at 4:00 in the afternoon with 5 people eating in the dining area and about 2,000 square feet of empty space.  We left.  I came from the upper west side with my daughter to meet some friends.   What a waste of a subway ride.  I will never go to this place again.  Stay away.  Stay far away.  Wish I could give negative stars.
