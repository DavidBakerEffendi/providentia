The Green Line is great! All their lattes and drinks are made fresh to order. They take the ingredients directly out of the fridge, nothing sits out like at some coffee shops. They usually just have one barista working who also does the register. It's a small shop so that works well. Sometimes you have to wait a minute if the barista is helping another customer but it is well worth it! They also have a variety of amazing teas and several unique flavors of ice tea that are great in the summer months! I usually get my coffee or tea on my way to work, but the vibe in the shop is great to sit and do work. I often see people working on their computers, reading or studying. It's a quiet place and seems like a great place to relax.
