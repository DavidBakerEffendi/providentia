I really don't like to give low reviews since I know how hard restaurants try with their ideas and food. We came here on a busy night. The fries were pretty good in texture and size but there was a really bad bittery aftertaste - this usually means dirty oil. Maybe they fried a lot of fries by the time we came so the oil was bitter by that point. I ordered the poutine. The gravy tasted like nothing. The cheese curds were pretty decent though. Maybe my expectations were too high? I don't know, I usually love fries from anywhere almost. I will give them another shot though, hopefully their won't have that same bittery aftertaste and I will definitely not order the poutine. I will probably try the Parmesan peppercorn dip, sounds good.
