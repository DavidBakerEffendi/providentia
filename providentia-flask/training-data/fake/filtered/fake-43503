Usually it is difficult to separate Indian cuisine from the rest, but Chatni did just that. Seated in the quaint back patio we ordered a starter and two entrees. The Chicken 65 - Indo Chicken may need a different name, but as a starter, it is definitely something worth ordering again. The lamb korma also was excellent. Perfect amount of coconut and spices. The only real downfall of the food was with the mixed tandoori. The shrimp and boneless chicken was overcooked, while the lamb and bone-in chicken were excellent. Be careful sitting outside, depending on where you are sitting, you can be forgotten. We unfortunately were.
