If you don't get the Sicilian pie, you're doing it wrong. This is the best pizza I've ever had in my entire life, and my grandmother is right of the boat from Italy. It puts her and my mother's pizza to shame. Best experience is sitting outside indulging in a pie during summer, then getting spumoni for dessert. Get the vanilla, chocolate, and pistachio mix to end off your meal with the right Italian dessert. Took my boyfriend from Maryland here after all the hype our NY & NJ friends provided him with and he was not disappointed.
