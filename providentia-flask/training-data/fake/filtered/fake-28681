The Malt House is one of my favorite places in the Village.  The rotation of craft beers is excellent and the food is great.   I came here on a weekly basis last year with some colleagues and, over that time span, we tried almost everything on the menu.  The burgers, fries, and fried pickles are very good, as are the fish tacos.  What kept bringing us back, though, was the Kentucky Bourbon Ale and the great service.
