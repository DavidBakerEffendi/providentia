The Grille just updated their menu last week, some great new additions.  My favorite two items on the menu for lunch is the Fish Tacos and the Lobster Pizza.  I usually get the soup of the day with the Shrimp Creole on Friday's always being a solid choice.  Wednesday nights are a bit crowded for the Club Cash night paired with the Prime Rib Buffet, reservations are a must.   Had dinner in Restaurant 37 last Thursday.  Started with the French Onion soup which was a little salty, but then again all French Onion soups are salty to me, I had the Porterhouse as my entree with Cream Spinich. The Porterhouse was as it should have been, the best of both worlds of the bone.  Both the Filet side and the Strip side was done perfect, I ordered it medium.  The Cream Spinich is fantastic, made with real leafy spinich in a delicious cream sauce.  I eneded this fantastic meal with Molten Chocolate Cake, it takes some time for it to come out, but it is well worth the wait.
