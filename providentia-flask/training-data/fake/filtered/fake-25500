Very nice atmosphere and wonderful wait staff, but expect to feel like you did not get what you paid for, despite perceived Burlington prices.  Entrees that where $26-30 where served cold and O.K. Filet Mignon and Salmon were really below par and Salmon had to be sent back to be reheated it was so cold.  The bar needs to send its bartender back to school.  Even basic drinks were not good and had to be sent back.  The wait staff was incredibly pleasant and made up for many of the shortcomings, but with all the wonderful restaurant choices in Burlington this one is off the list.
