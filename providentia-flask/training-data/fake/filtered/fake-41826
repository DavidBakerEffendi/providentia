Last night, I was hanging around Astor Place with a friend, and we were suddenly craving Pad Thai. Instead of heading to Spice, our usual Thai place, we decided to switch it up and try Bodhi Tree. The interior design reminded me of a classy Irish pub, minus the overactive chatter. It's the perfect place to go for a dinner date if you actually want to hold a decent conversation without shouting across the table. The food comes from your standard Thai food palette, ranging from a variety of curries to Pad Thai and ducks. If you're up for something new, try the Pumpkin Duck entree. It's a delicious, belly-filling winter dish that comes in a sizable portion for its price (around $15). If you also happen to crave something non-alcoholic to go along with your Pumpkin Duck, try the Mint Iced Honey Green Tea ($3)! A pet peeve of mine is when restaurants add tablespoons of salt to indulge their customers. Thai food already contains a variety of spices without the excessive sodium, so I usually water my food down when other people aren't looking. Bodhi Tree is much better than other Thai restaurants at keeping their sodium levels manageable. This way, you can concentrate on the food, the atmosphere, and your important dinner date without worrying about getting high blood pressure!
