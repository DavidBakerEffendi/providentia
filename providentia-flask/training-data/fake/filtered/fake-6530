I love this place! It is a 5 minute walk for me.I eat here at least  once a week. there pizza is always hot and fresh. I like their meatball, Turkey, and tuna grinders.. There tossed salad with homemade salad dressings are great! I also like their chicken wings, which  have a bit of heat. The prices are reasonable The owner Nick is a friendly  as well are the rest of the staff! I highly recommend this neighborhood Pizza place!
