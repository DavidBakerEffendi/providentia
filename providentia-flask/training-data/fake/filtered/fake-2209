Yes, these blueberry pancakes will probably be some of the best you'll ever have. The rest of the stuff is okay. But this place is VERY TINY and ALWAYS VERY CROWDED. The wait staff is too busy to be too friendly with you. Average wait time is between 1-2 hours. For me it's just breakfast, something you can get just about anywhere in Manhattan anyway. Good food, just not worth such a long wait.
