They recently renovated so we stopped in while passing by.  The food is really good.  We've been there several times since, and everything we had comes out hot and tasty.  The big menu offers lots of choices and you aren't confined to ordering a "special fish" of the day like some places.  The fish that you liked today will be there next month.  Love that!  Tip:  Try their lemon potatoes as a change---really delicious.
