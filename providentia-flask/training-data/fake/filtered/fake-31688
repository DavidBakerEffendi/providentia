I've been going to China Pavilion for over ten years now and I can honestly say that I have found seldom places that equal its quality. I like to think of myself as a well versed asian cuisine diner. Out of all the many places I've tried within New Haven country and outside, I believe China Pavilion in top tier! On top of their amazing food, the staff is very friendly and makes you feel at home. I can't speak enough of how well they treat myself and others who frequent their establishment.
