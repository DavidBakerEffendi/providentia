Excellent!!! I can't believe I've never heard of this place. Stumbled on it accidentally. Best accident ever.! This is a great late night stop.....during the day would be great, too. For those with a more refined palate, they also offer American and Provolone cheese, in additon to cheese wiz. They also have pork sandwiches. I will try that next week. I did find it odd to order fries at a separate window.
