I agree, we visited a couple times already and only open 4 days. My family and I had the fried calamari, stuffed mushrooms and eggplant rollitini for appetizers and they were fabulous. Our dinner choices were just as good, penne primavera, chicken marsala and chicken francese. We will deffinitely be regulars here !
