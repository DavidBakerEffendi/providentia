I have to admit that when I first visited Noodle Pudding, I wasn't expecting much. The place, however, I soon found out is a hidden gem. They may be a bit short on variety but for the prices and the quality of food one gets, it really is worth the trip. My personal favorite, and a recommendation, is the Tagliatelle Bolognese. The only thing I would like to recommend to people visiting the first time is be a bit patient; the wait may seem a bit long but it is worth it.
