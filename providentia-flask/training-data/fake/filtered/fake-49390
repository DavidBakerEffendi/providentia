We went here for one of my sisters Bachelorette parties, we did the fancy dinner before hitting the clubs in the city. I'm not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine in general so I wasn't super pumped when this was the chosen restaurant but I was just along for the ride anyways. We sat at one of their big comfy booths and it was a great way for a big group of people to actually be able to sit and talk to everyone. The noise is pretty loud in there but its to be expected in that type of venue. We got a bunch of apps for the table, and the guacamole was amazing, for my entr√©e I got the taco sampler but I really didn't care for it, however it wasn't an issue with the food as much as it was with my taste preferences which is why im not giving it a 1 star rating. I do remember shelling out quite a lot of money when the bill came, but when you have the Starr name attached to your restaurant in Philly you can get a way with charging out the wazoo for whatever you want!
