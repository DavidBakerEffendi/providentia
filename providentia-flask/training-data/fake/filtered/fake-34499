Great meal. Took sister out for dinner. There was a 20 minute wait so we played some bocce outside and I called from the bocce court and our table was ready. Our waitress and the hostess had authentic Italian accents. The artichoke bruschetta was excellent. We shared that plus and eggplant Parmesan appetizer and then split the ravioli appetizer. Perfect amount if food. We cleaned our plates.  All that plus a large pour of red wine (Montepulciano D'Abruzzo.) Total was $47.62. Service was excellent. Only 2 negatives. 1st bread wasn't offered but we had bruschetta and probably would have been too full with bread. It would have been nice to have a little piece of bread to soak up the yummy sauce. 2nd negative was that from my $100 bill they only gave $52.00 change. Of course the change would have been part of the tip but they shouldn't assume that.  I hope the waitress got it and not the owner. Anyway, great Italian food and I love bocce while you wait.
