My fiancee and I created an account solely to write about Kanella. It is one our absolute favorite restaurants and we continue to remind ourselves how much we will miss the luxury of being a walk down the street once we move outside of Philly. The food is impeccable to say the least. Everything is extremely fresh tasting and savory. When friends ask where to eat in center city this is far and away our first recommendation-but call ahead, this place fills up for obvious reasons! Not only is the food delicious, but the prices are beyond fair. Often times we leave a brunch having ordered an appetizer, two entrees, a dessert and two drinks (non-alcoholic as it is a BYOB), for $30. Dinner is a bit more expensive but still extremely reasonable for city prices. Â  We can't get enough of the hummus. This is a must-try if you visit- the vegetables are incredibly fresh and the pita bread comes straight from the oven, you would think you are in heaven! We also love the cyprus breakfast, Maloweh (puffed pastry), and the daily scramble, to name a few. Just tried the dips of the day for the first time and can't complain about them either- we wiped the plate clean! There are so many unique options to choose- you really can't go wrong! We would consider ourselves "foodies" if you will, and it says a lot when you leave a restaurant never having experienced a moderate to bad dish- if you don't eat at Kanella, you are truly missing out!
