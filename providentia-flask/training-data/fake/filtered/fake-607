I'd give it more but for what it is this should suffice. Its basically just an open hall (as the name would state) with some ping pong tables, cafe tables and picnic tables. Beer was pretty good, but not nearly the best in the city by any means. Food was ok but its a snack bar type set up. Its also basically a self serve place, meaning you get up and go to the bar yourself to get your refills. Good for groups of people. They also have card games there like Uno and Jenga. Not a bad way to kill a Sunday afternoon if you want to get out of the house and kill the day. Note; I think giving this place 5 stars is absolutely RIDICULOUS! Its just an OPEN area with picnic tables where you can drink beer. There is nothing there that you couldn't literally set up in your back yard. I had a blast there, but come on. You're sitting at a picnic table, getting your OWN beer, and playing Go Fish. I would say the majority of the 5 star ratings are coming from ex frat boys and Manayunk girls that still get amused by beer pong and guys with Ed Hardy shirts. Fun - yes. 5 stars - no.
