I have been to Giorgio's a handful of times since I moved to the area 2 years ago and I have to say - the food is always AMAZING. Everything I've gotten, from appetizers to entrees to desserts, is delicious. This place is known to be a landmark in South Orange. Really nice family, best mom and pop shop around for sure. Also worth noting that they have the BEST VEAL CHOP MILANESE I've ever had...Seriously its awesome.
