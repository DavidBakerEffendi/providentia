We were a group of 4 and thankfully sat in the dining area as the bar area became quite loud. Â The staff were super attentive. We were offered samples of any beers from the draft list to try before purchasing a full pint. They also had a large selection of bottled beer. The food was fine- nothing spectacular - and a bit limited. But the nice beer selection definitely made up for it. Would definitely go back.
