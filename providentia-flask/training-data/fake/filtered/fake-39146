The Duchess says: I was having a serious craving for a gourmet burger and wanted to try a new place.  The ambiance inside 500 degrees was casual and contemporary. Now for the food. I built my own prime burger, medium well.  Burger was cooked perfectly and the bun was soft (I like that they also toasted it on the griddle with the burger).  The toppings were good although I thought they were light handed with them.  I chose to try the fry sauce on the side. It was slightly spicy and great on the burger. We ordered the sweet potato fries. Good thing I had to steal a fry before walking out, because I discovered we were incorrectly given spicy fries instead. Gladly, the staff apologized and corrected the order. I'm not a huge fan of shoestring fries, but at least they were crispy. Overall, for the price 500 charges, Bobby's Burger Palace is a better value and you get comparable quality. I saw great reviews on the shakes, so I would go back to try one.
