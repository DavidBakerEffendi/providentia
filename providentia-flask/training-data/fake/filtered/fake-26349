The food is absolutely delicious and true Italian food. I'd put this in the restaurant category rather than pizza. The service is fantastic, you don't have one waiter, everyone will help. The owner is always at helm making a meal there smooth sailing. You can tell how good it is when not only does the staff speak Italian but so do a good portion of the customers. Real test- even the calamari is done well.
