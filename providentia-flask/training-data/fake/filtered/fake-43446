The location is obscure for others but completely close to home for me. And I am so happy that there is a bar/restaurant of this quality FINALLY within winter walking distance. I'm all about welcoming and friendly service - Rob,Joe, Annie immediately introduced themselves the first time I walked in. The food matches their service, its delicious, flavorful and interesting without a ridiculous price tag or silly wait like a close by restaurant. Â I like the nods to Spanish and Filipino food in this place. Maybe some plants or photos to warm the look up a little?
