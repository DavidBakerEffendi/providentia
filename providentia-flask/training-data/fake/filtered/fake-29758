Great meal at a new restaurant. Two of us shared the lentil salad, roasted beets, roasted cauliflower and green tofu Thai curry. Â Get the rice with the curry so you can savor the sauce. Everything was delicious. Very little to take home and we were stuffed. Try the vegan choc chip cookies really yummy and the chocolate mousse was creamy and delicious. Service was friendly and efficient and ambience comfortable. Lots of attention to detail.
