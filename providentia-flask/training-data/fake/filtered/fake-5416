We just went here after finding out that they were rated #2 best restaurant in America. We went with the "leave it to us" option which I definitely recommend to get the most value and a good taste of everything. There were 8 courses - to be honest, too much food for 2 people but we got the leftovers to go. I have to say that the food was really good, but not as good as I thought it would be with that type of ranking as #2 best restaurant in the nation. I would say top 20 in Philadelphia would be more appropriate...at the same time the ranking definitely sets your expectations to be really high when going into the restaurant. Overall, great fresh food and ingredients. Lots of value with the Leave it to us option to share, and the atmosphere with an open kitchen is really nice. Fun fact is that it is run by the same chef at Fork next door, but High Street is just a more low key version of it. Worth trying out for sure
