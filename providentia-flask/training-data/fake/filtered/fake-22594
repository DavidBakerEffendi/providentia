So i wanted to follow up on my review of this place.  The owner reached out to me and we exchanged a few emails.  He was helpful and genuinely concerned about our experience.  He has made some changes to his policy regarding the high top tables and has invited us back.   This owner is very concerned about his business reputation and he worked hard to win us back as customers.
