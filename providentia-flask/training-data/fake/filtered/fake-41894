We've been there twice. The first time was a busy Friday evening and we did not have a reservation but the hostess worked some magic and got us a table by the door within 10 minutes! Â We ordered the gluten free fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp both times and it was absolutely delicious. The second visit was for Saturday brunch. The brunch menu offers half portion on the pasta and they actually reduce the price! We shared the spinach and walnut salad which was great. We will definitely be returning.
