i love jadis.  it truly is my downtown wine refuge - very reasonable, friendly and reliable.  why 4 stars then?  i hate to say it but it's the MUSIC.  if i really felt like relaxing to the haunting refrains of will smith / beyonce / justin timberlake etc. libation and other assorted horrors are just a block away.  may seem picky, but it does take away from the ambiance of an otherwise perfect place.
