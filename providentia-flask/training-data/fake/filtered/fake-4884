WHAT HAPPENED??  This place used to have the BEST burgers in town, big and juicy, I craved them!!  I haven't been in over a year and last night I had the chance to get there.  What a disappointment!  The burger looked sad on its kaiser roll bun, as it was about 3/4" shy of the outer edge of the bun.  The burger wasn't the juicy delicious burger it used to be, it was average.  Out of the three of us, one person ordered it medium rare, and it was brown all the way through, it was so dry.  Unfortunately, my cravings for this place are gone.  On top of that, they were short staffed and we waited at least 45 minutes for our food, at 9 pm on a Thursday night.  Too bad.  Unless they make a change back to the way it used it be, I see no reason to go back.  Still a cute place physically.
