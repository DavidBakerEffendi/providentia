This place deserves a one star just because of the how the place look.  Overall, Their glass, plates and silverware were very dirty.  When my food came out, I saw shredded pork meat under my rice even though I ordered a seafood dish.  In my mind i felt as if they never wash the plates or they gave me someone else leftover.  When I approach the waiter about the situation, he looked at me like there is nothing he can do about. Immediately I was turn off so I left right away.  The staff are unprofessional.  You can go ahead and try it. It's your money.
