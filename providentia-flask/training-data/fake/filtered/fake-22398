I don't know why so many people gave this place 5 stars. It took forever to get my food even though there were only 2 other families seated. Some of the food was very greasy and cold when it arrived, but the chicken teriyaki I ordered was amazing. It came with a bunch of stuff like vegetables, rice, soup and salad, and it even came with sushi. The main reason I'm only giving the restaurant 3 stars is because of the service. The waitresses always seemed confused when I would ask for something and were a bit slow with bringing out the orders. EDIT: After dinner I spoke with two people sitting near us and they asked how our service was because they had a few problems. They told us that they've been to this restaurant several times before and they absolutely loved it, but on Saturdays they do a lot of take-outs and their wait staff seems to have trouble dealing with customers and over the phone orders. Another thing I was told is to go there for lunch because it is very good and the service is usually very good as well.
