Amazing!!! Hubby and I Â headed over to Kims after church and began to salvage at the smell of food as soon as we walked in. Kim peeked her head out of huge kitchen to get our ticket and began cooking. The food took awhile , but it's because everything was made to order. Support this business. Food is great and made with love
