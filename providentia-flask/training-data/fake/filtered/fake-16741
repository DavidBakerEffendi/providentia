My friend and I arrived around 7:30 on a Tuesday night and were informed that there would be a 30 minute wait - totally reasonable. In fact it was exciting to be visiting a place that was popular enough to be packed on such a god awful night as Tuesday. We were seated at the end of a communal table in a large wood paneled room, which was reminiscent of an Ancient Nordic Mead hall, or a lunch room in rural Arkansan high school. The service was overall on par with what one would expect of a crowded casual eatery. Â Our waitress was friendly and confidently assured us our every selection was "the best" or "[my]" favorite. The bus boy was a tad clumsy, knocking our silverware to the ground as he cleared our appetizers. The food, however, was good. So good. So very fattening - I mean good. We started with fried pickles and biscuits with fixin's. The pickles were hotter then hell and really only as good as the dipping sauce, but fortunately the spicy Red Mayo was a blast. The biscuits, however, stole the show, especially when paired with the Maple Syrup butter. As for our entrees, they stand out a little less in my mind. Whether that is a matter of quality or just the divine Brooklyn Gin cocktail, is up for debate. My friend's reported that his Catfish tacos were relatively authentic (like anyone from Massachusetts could know,) but underwhelming, and my Pickles and Cheese Burger was delicious, but visually and practically was a mess. My only complaints would be the slightly too long wait time for our appetizers to appear and the near complete lack of vegetarian options. Or rather that last one was my friends complaint. I'm a meat and potatoes sort of guy
