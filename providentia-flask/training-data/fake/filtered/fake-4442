Its a good value for the price. You can eat an unlimited amount of food, you will feel uncomfortable when your ready to leave because you've eaten too much almost like after a holiday dinner. The food is great and the service is very on point. You get to watch cute Brazilian guys walking around in costume pants, can't beat that!
