this is one of my favorite places food is amazing I always get the steak when I get there and the pitcher of mango mojito for 2 , wonderful atmosphere , some times its a long wait but what do u expect for a great place like that , it worth it , after I moved to NYC now I miss it there sooo much wish they have Cuban pete's in NYC that will be awesome im sure they would be extremely busy , come to NYC please !
