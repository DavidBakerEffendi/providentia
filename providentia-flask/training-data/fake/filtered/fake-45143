Mr.Subs is going down hill! I have been going to them for 3 years about 2 times a week if not more and never had a bad experience. The two guys that use to take my order I never had problems with. Always made me feel comfortable as soon as I walked in the door. The new people they have their are horrible! When I go in there the meat slicer is never clean and it looks like the meat has been there all day. The guy that took my order didn't change his gloves after I saw him touching other things besides my food. When I asked him to change his gloves and clean the machine he gave  me a VERY NASTY RUDE attitude. The entire time he was making my sandwich he was sweating really bad, his hygiene is really horrific! Another time I came in for subs for my wife and I that I had called in a head of time. The guy on the phone was completely RUDE and OBNOXIOUS! When i got home and opened my sandwich up our entire order was screwed up.  I will never be going back to Mr.Subs!! If it was possible this review wouldn't even have a star!!!
