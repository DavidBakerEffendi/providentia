Its your standard late-night drunk filled college diner... Good service for 2am and for the crowd (including myself) of people with a few drinks in them... Really disappointed when I could not order nachos. They were not on the menu and when I asked for them they said no... How hard is it to make nachos? The food sadly was not made with love, it was just kinda bland
