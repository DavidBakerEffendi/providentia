I booked Ofrenda for a birthday dinner after reading great reviews about it on chowhound and on yelp and I couldn't have been happier with my experience! The staff is so friendly and really went out of their way for us. We came with a two year old and they immediately brought over a coloring book and crayons. They were attentive throughout the entire night and the food and drinks were excellent, and all for a great price. It was our first time here and we will all be back. So, a big thank you to Ofrenda for making my birthday dinner a fantastic experience!
