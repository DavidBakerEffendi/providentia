The food here was surprisingly good.  I'm not sure why I expected it not to be good (I assumed it would be lame tourist food place), but what I got was solid British pub food.  Nice juicy hamburger for me, and my dad got a delicious beef pie. The servers and bartenders were extremely friendly and the beer selection was good.
