Going down hill as we speak. This place was good a few years ago. Since the time, the non-Indians have taken over the cooking and preparation, it's definitely gone down hill. The owner seems miserly. Neither does he smile nor is he courteous even if you smile and say hello. Agreed, our culture isn't about "Hey! How is it going or Hi! Welcome to Dosa Express - How can I help you? However, sans mannerisms, the food is not exotic that I can rave about. Also, there are only a couple of items that you can have. Due to the cheap prices, I guess this place gets loaded with Indians. Don't be fooled by the crowd. It's not the food quality but the price that attracts the Indian bees. I was again there last week and frankly speaking that was the last visit. The Hispanic population must not be entrusted to prepare Indian dishes. Also, you cannot tell the owner that the food is not good..Neither will he take it back nor offer an apology. It's time to try a better place. P.S. Wonder whether the chefs have been moved to Parsippany where the new branch of this restaurant is opening. Either way, the quality is not something I will endorse for any culture to try out. True Indian
