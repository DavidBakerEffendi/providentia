Went the other night & had Buff mac & cheese & classic hot wings . All i can say is that its AMAZING !!! Loved the fact that i can sit down & watch tv while eating wings ( just to get away from my roommates) , and the staff is exceptionally friendly . Both owners came over to greet me and actually held a conversation . They made me feel like i was a friend & not just out to take my $$. I also tried their fried pickles which were incredible ( never had anything so good ) also the garlic parmesian fries hit the spot . This place just got a regular because im 100% going back . Next time it will be a burger. LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!
