I had heard only good things about this place, so my office chose this place for our holiday dinner last December. We only have about 14-15 people in our office, so we figured this place would be a good venue. Since it was going to be a large group of people, my colleague called this place a week ahead to make reservations and was told that they could accommodate our party of 20-25 people (colleagues with their family members) if we arrived before the dinner rush. The person we spoke to assured us that we could all be seated if we showed up by 5 pm. Having heard much about this place, everyone was super excited. Since the dinner was to be on a Saturday, my colleague called this restaurant once again on the Friday before to re-confirm. They assured her that everything would be ready. Imagine our surprise when our party of about 25 people showed up promptly at 5 pm on the day and was told point blank by the restaurant manager that we would NOT be seated. I am not sure what his reason was, but he did not even make a pretense of trying to even seat us. And this was at 5 pm when the restaurant barely had any diners and several tables were empty! He actually went so far as to hold the door open and show my colleague the way out! If there was a reason for his rude and obnoxious behavior, it was not communicated to us. We are all in our early 30s, and everyone was decent and respectful, so I fail to understand why such treatment was meted out to us. It seems to me that this place has become very complacent with the good reviews it seems to be having, and does not care how it treats customers any longer.
