Two members of my party ran like an hour late, but the staff was really cool, Â let us chill out, eat some appetizers, listen to some AWESOME music, drink some beer and just chill. In terms of the waiters, they couldn't have been more awesome (even if we did annoy them a bit taking up a table for five in a place that may seat 30 people). The food was otherworldly. We got crab cakes as an appetizer. They were really small, but they were 100% crab. No filler, just crab. And they were spectacular. I've had a ton of crab cakes, these were the best. I got the sea bass diner, which was delicious, filling and CHEAP, like $18 dollars if I remember correctly. Two people in my party ate the linguini with clams (said it was the best they've ever had), and two had the lobster bake (ditto). They all loved the beer, as well (I, being a loser, didn't have any). The dessert whiskey cake was great. It was free, and you get a little slice of pound cake soaked in whiskey. I'm not a whiskey fan at all, but I devoured it. The setting (small, but always buzzing) was cool, the music (Weezer, Oasis, MGMT) was great, the small talk with the staff (one guy used to live in the town next to mine Upstate, which totally made the name of the restaurant make sense) was fun and it was one of the best meals I've ever had in New York. Go. Now.
