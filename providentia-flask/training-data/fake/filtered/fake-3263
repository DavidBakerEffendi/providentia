I really love this place, its a comfortly small bar. The wide selection of local beer is really impressive. It is really hard to find a good place to eat and get a beer in West Philly. The owners are very nice and make you feel like you are walking into their house. The only downside of the place is that when there are a lot of people the place can get very loud.
