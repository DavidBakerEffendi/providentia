Fortunately for me, they just opened up a location at the corner of 2nd ave and 14th street. I had walked past it for about a month on my way home from work. The long line forced me to buckle down one day and try it - and boy am I happy that I did! The chicken over rice is amazing. The pita they give you is really soft and delicious. And they give you tons of food for a cheap price. I highly recommend stopping here next time you pass it!
