My boyfriend and I wanted to try something new so when we passed by this cool, trendy Korean restaurant we thought: why not? We were not disappointed to say the least. We are both pescatarian and find it difficult at times to find food that is made with just as much flavor as those with meat in it. The sushi here is to DIE for. It was simply delicious. We also ordered the sauteed mushroom appetizer and I couldn't believe how well seasoned it was. It was full of flavor! The fries were hot and crisp and were served with ketchup and a sort of spicy kimchi mayo which I really enjoyed. We sat ourselves at the bar and the bartender was extremely accommodating and we were really happy with his suggestions with the food and drinks we were served. The staff were really friendly and inviting and they really make sure to check up on you to make sure you're being attended to. Bottom line: I will definitely be recommending this restaurant to friends and family and will probably be back the next time I go to the city.
