I was familiar with the Cabana in my neighborhood but never got around to trying it.  I was out one night around the holidays with my mother and sister and decided to eat at Cabana on 3rd.  I was really impressed with their food.  We got a side of sweet plantains as an app because we were so hungry.  This was a great idea, they came out fast and were so good.  For my dinner I got the empanadas entree.  Great idea!  I am big on sangria and got a glass of white but have to admit that theirs did not impress me.  I still give them 4 stars because any number of things can contribute to the poor taste of Sangria.  Our server was sweet and very down to earth.
