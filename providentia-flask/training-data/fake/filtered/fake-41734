"Downtown" Newark has slim pickings when it comes to lunch spots for the 9-5 weekday worker.  Thank goodness for Better Bites and its healthy, fresh take out (or dine in) menu.  The oriental chicken and salmon salads are particularly good, and the small salad size is actually pretty big.  It's a little pricier than the few nearby delis and Subway, but I find Better Bites's food filling, and the salads and wraps are substantial enough for two meals really.  Also, in the summer you can sit outside... and on Thursdays listen to the live music coming from the Farmers Market at PSE&G Plaza.
