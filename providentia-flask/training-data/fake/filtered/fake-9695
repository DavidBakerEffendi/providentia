I have traveled around the world and certainly the U.S. I ALWAYS go to local sushi restaurants. I rate HANA's sashimi, sushi rolls, sushi and creative appetizers as some of the BEST I have ever had! I am a tough critic on sushi and I would recommend HANA to anyone and frequent them about once or twice a week. Unfortunately they are a little off the "beaten path" of downtown Burlington and I HOPE they succeed but they need more business. They need more people like myself and others to get the word out. I would never think of having sushi at any other place in Burlington or the surrounding areas after eating at HANA. Their sashimi is always fresh: tuna is amazing, salmon and yellowtail melt in your mouth. They have two amazing appetizers the Luck Tree (spicy tuna) and their spicy squid are a MUST. They have some awesome rolls (and generous portions) and some new really creative rolls that include mango and jalopenos! Their signature roll the HANA roll is also one of my favorites. You can't go wrong with any of their rolls or sushi/sashimi and I hope the word gets out soon, because this is the real deal for sushi and it's great to have a place like this in our area! Please pass the word around so they don't go out of business before people have had a chance to experience their amazing menu!
