We were three ladies out to dinner that could not get a reservation at another restaurant, what a blessing!!!!! The food was just scrumptious and so reasonably priced, our waitress Jen was a delight! A manager stopped over and asked how our evening was the only thing I said was "I wish there was more wine in my glass"  jokingly of course.  She said she could fix that and was back shortly with a bottle of wine in her hand to top me off.  It was such a nice touch!  Who doesn't want more wine??? I meant nothing by it.  The food was awesome paired with Jen and Danielle.... extraordinary, ask for them you will not be disappointed, we sure werent!!!
