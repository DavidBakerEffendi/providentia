Pates Et Traditions is definitely one of my favorite spots to eat.  The crepes and coffee are delicious, the customer service is excellent, and the atmosphere is pleasant.  The shrimp curry crepe is yummy.  The only downside is that the wait on a weekend can be quite long for this small restaurant.  In my opinion, it is well worth the wait.
