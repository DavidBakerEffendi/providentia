that budino is amazing!  heaven in a glass jar.  transcendent, rich, creamy, salty, like silk. if the girl and her father weren't next to us i would've ordered another, taken off my shirt and shoes, stretched out and eaten it with my fingers and tongue. the first and last courses (the sheep's milk ricotta fig vin cotto country bread dish and the budino) were the best, with special mention going to the orgiastic bottom of the brussels sprouts cup: pancetta, garlic and the stray charred leaves of the brussels gladly drowned in oil. i liked the fresh veg and burrata cheese, especially the creaminess of the parsnips, but the salad could have used more, well, lubrication. same for the balls, the rice balls, which needed more sauce. i almost choked on the lardo. the pasta needed more meat (how my date wanted more meat!) tho the smoky flavor of the ragu plate conveyed the advertised six hours. barbuzzo should do innovative roasts and heartier mains, unless i overlooked them. great service, comfy place, also a great spot to order a bottle of red wine and that budino, and quit life for awhile. will definitely be back!
