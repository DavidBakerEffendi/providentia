Went there Friday. Not going to make a long post so I'll give you the basics. Yes, its cramped but theres enough white noise and chatter that you can have a semi private conversation and not be bothered. All the food was great, budino being the best. Pig popcorn was good but not great. Service was a bit slow at times. Took well over 5 minutes to get a drink a few times. I would go again.
