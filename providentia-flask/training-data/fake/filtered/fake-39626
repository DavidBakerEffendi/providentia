This is a great place to go if you want to try Thai food. Very elegant decorations, Nice place, Very relax and Very good Thai food. We went to Ploy Siam to dinner today. We knew how busy there are as they are very high recommendation for the Thai food lover, so we decided to go here today. Because of a rainy day and also Sunday night, so we pick the day and time that not so many people want to go out, that the reason, so we don't have to wait long time before we can taste their food. 4 of us ...we were order   For Appetizer : Thai Spring Roll,  Tod Mun Pla,  Fresh Rolls,  Golden Bags, Soup:   Tom Yum Seafood Salad:  Som Tum (Papaya Salad) Main Entres:  Pad Woon Sen,  Pra Nung Ma Noue,  Pad Basil Drink:  Thai Ice Tea, Jasmin Hot Tea They all delicious, As soon as the food came, we all jump out spoon to that food, after almost gone, we realized that we forgot to take all that food's pictures!!! Because food taste so good, no one worry about anything else... If you want to try Thai Food, put this on the list for your next visit.
