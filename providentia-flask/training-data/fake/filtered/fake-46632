This place has degraded over time, used to be reasonably sized portions and good service, we came to Penang for lunch with a group of people, the waitresses we FLYING by so that you couldn't even ask for a glass of water, the size of dishes that were served would probably not even be enough for a 5 year old let alone too small for adults. This was a GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT and I will definitely Not be returning back anytime soon
