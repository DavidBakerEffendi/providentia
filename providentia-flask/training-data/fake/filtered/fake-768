their hours are from 7am-4pm not 6am-4pm. Â I was highly disappointed going there to find that the store hours listed online are wrong. Please update your information. I was looking forward to some sweet potato pancakes this morning and now I had to settle for something else...booooo.S/N there food is amazing :)
