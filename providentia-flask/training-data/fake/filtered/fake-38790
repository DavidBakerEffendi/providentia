You all must have gone to a different bar than me!  Otherwise you work for the bar.  I simply can't understand your positive reviews! The bar was virtually empty and I waiting a long time to get my beer.  I thought the place was LAME!  The food was bland and almost insulting.   I can get good cheap food - but that food is cheap and not so good.   I was really looking forward to a new place in the hood and I'm totally disappointed.  If you're not from Red Hook, there's no need to go.  If you are, the Pioneer curse hasn't gone away.  Better luck next time.
