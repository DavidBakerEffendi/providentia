As you all may be aware, as a local, finding a decent lunch near Madison Square Garden (Midtown West in general) can prove to be difficult. I regularly find myself in this area and disappointed with all of the pub food/bar options. Search no more! I dined at Friedmans on 31st yesterday and had such a lovely experience. From the women who welcomed us in to Caesar who was our waiter -- oh and the food was excellent too. The dining room was great and the fresh apples at the end were the perfect touch. While Caesar was quite busy, he spent time taking us through the menu and made sure that we were enjoying every moment. For those keeping tabs we ordered a lamb burger at caesar's recommendation, a BLAT (and the bacon was burnt to a crisp just as I requested!), a cup of tomato soup and Brussels sprouts (these may need some tweeking). As a former waitress and customer service employee I am always sure to provide positive and negative feedback to businesses. Esp where service is concerned. I recommend Friedmans all around and look forward to dining in again.
