I've just visited this place about an hour ago. I just wanted to eat more and more but unfortunately, I was full so I took more food with me to go! Turkish food is great but you need to know where to eat and this is the place to eat! Â Everyone is very polite and helpful. It's definitely a "must go" place to eat in or take out. I love it and I happily rate Turco 5 stars.
