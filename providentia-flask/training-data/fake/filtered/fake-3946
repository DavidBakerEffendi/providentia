MOST UNFRIENDLY ESTABLISHMENT I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. I attempted to have lunch at Juventino on a quiet Thursday afternoon - not weekend brunch or an evening dinner. The restaurant itself was completely empty, with a handful of folks dining in the back garden.  The hostess or waitress immediately turned our party of 4 (3 adults and a 2-week old sleeping baby) away insisting we leave our stroller out on the curb.  Clearly we could not do that - we do not carry a bike chain and lock for our stroller.  We offered to leave the stroller frame in the front of the restaurant (the carseat could have been removed from the frame) but were told that was unacceptable and against the restaurant's policy.  Seeing the hostess was not going to budge, we took our business elsewhere and will never again attempt to eat at Juventino and will tell our extensive network of Brooklynites to withhold their business as well.   Such a shame - does this restaurant not want the business of young families in Park Slope?  Perhaps they should have opened in another neighborhood.  I wouldn't support a restaurant that is so quick to exclude and enforce 'policies' when they barely have any customers in the restaurant for lunch. Very disappointing, Juventino.
