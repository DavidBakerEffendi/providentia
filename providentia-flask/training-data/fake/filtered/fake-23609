Not only was all the food over salted but the service was horrendous.   When I asked the waiter why he hadn't told us that they had any specials he copped an attitude with me and told me it was my fault because a member of our party was in the bathroom when we ordered. This doesn't even make sense. And when  I told him that I didn't appreciate the way he spoke to me and he told me that I should be happy with the service I got.  I was simply shocked. I never complain in restaurants but no one has ever spoken to me like that.  Although the manger apologized there was no concession when the bill came and moreover he overcharged us for drinks. For the money they are charging I would never go here again. I love to go to nice places but the Spotted Pig thinks that they are so hip that they can dispense with customer service. News flash- when I go out to a nice dinner, I expect the entire meal to be enjoyable including a waitstaff who wants to give the diner a pleasant dining experience.  If you make a mistake own it- don't blame the customer. Incredibly unprofessional.
