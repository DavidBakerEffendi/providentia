Bluebird catered our wedding at out home. It was extraordinary. Tara, the catering coordinator was helpful in planning many aspects of the event beyond the meal and Chef Kevin composed a truly breathtaking feast. Three guests actually told me it was the best meal they'd ever had! I was amazed by how easy it was for us, how flexible and kind the staff were, and how close the final bill was to the estimate. All in all, we couldn't have imagined it going better.
