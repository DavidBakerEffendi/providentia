We ordered food based on these reviews!  We were so happy with the food!  It was delicious and plentiful.  Very affordable.  We ordered online three hours before we needed it and called up to confirm that we wanted it delivered another time.  The food arrived exactly the time we wanted!  We will definitely order from Tina's again while visiting tia in NYC!!!
