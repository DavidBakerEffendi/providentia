I went here last month with one of my friends. We try to make an effort to try every Starr restaurant to check them out and rank each one. The atmosphere is very hip and lively, which I loved. My friend got the pan seared sea bass with butternut squash and mushrooms and I was lucky enough to sample it. If you go here for one reason, go here for the dip sum donuts. One of the best things I've ever eaten! I wish Buddakan would open their own food truck and only serve these donuts; they would make a killing...mostly from me going every single day! It may just top my list of Starr restaurants. Definitely a great place and I can't wait to go back.
