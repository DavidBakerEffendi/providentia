I absolutely love this restaurant.  We were greeted by a beautiful young girl who was a delight.  She told us our waitress would be right over and she was.  She came to our table and her smile lit up the room.  She told us about the variety of water and also about the specials.  She told us there were a couple new items on the menu and what she suggest.  All her suggestions were AMAZING!  We started off with the shrimp and calamari app, then we got the steak special and the shrimp scampi and we finished dessert with cheesecake in a mason jar which was so different.  Our waitress Brittany was excellent.  We had such a great experience because of her.  My husband and I will be back and we will be asking to sit with her.  Looking forward to the next time.  Thanks for opening a great place in Westville!
