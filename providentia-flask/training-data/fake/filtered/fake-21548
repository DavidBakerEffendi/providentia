I hate begging to pee. I find it distinctly demeaning. I also hate holding my pee. I find that it hurts my bladder. That brings me to why I no longer frequent Claire's Corner Copia. As a paying client, the procedure for getting access to the public bathroom at Claire's Corner Copia: 1. butt in front of a long line of other clients to ask the barrista for the key 2. listen to the barrista scream to the kitchen that someone should unlock the bathroom 3. stand about waiting for someone to come out of the kitchen with a bathroom key 4. follow that person to the bathroom to be let in I find that procedure humiliating. And tonight, no one came out of the kitchen to open the bathroom for me. I stood about waiting and feeling embarrassed and having to pee until I eventually decided to sit down, write this angry letter and vow never to return to Claire's. Also, they serve their coffee lukewarm.
