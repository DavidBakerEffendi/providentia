Visited for the first time this month. As they say  "You only have one opportunity to make a first impression." While it may be a cliché, it is true.The staff was very polite and welcoming. Lance, the manager was very friendly and helpful. I visited for a dinner party of at least 30 or more people. He had it all under control from the minute we walked through the door. The service was great and Priscilla, our server, was very polite and patient with our large group. The food & drinks were awesome! The  ambience of the place was beautiful with a great view of the city. Definitely going back a second time.
