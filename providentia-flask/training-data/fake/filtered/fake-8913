After the remodeling of the diner, I had a terrible experience. I was first greeted by a waiter who did not even say hello, all he said was what do you want to drink? Then, I requested a coke and was given a sprite, so I said I asked for a coke. I was never brought a coke until I spoke to the manager. My order was messed up, there were a couple hairs in my fries, and seriously I do NOT reccomend anyone go back to this diner. It was awful and as a Greek, I was not impressed, especially because they got rid of the Greek flag. It is not worth it, you are better off going to McDonalds. Not even kidding.
