We had reservations for 4 for 8 o'clock on a Thursday night in early December.  I had asked on Open Table to have a table in the back room with the fireplace.  We get there, and the two women in the front hem and haw, and finally say that our table has just begun their entrees, and why didn't we drink at the bar.  For what, 45 minutes to an hour??  Turns out they had rented out the back room to a holiday party, and thus their reservations were jammed up in the middle room.  We made reservations for another restaurant around the corner on the spot (had a good time) while waiting for our coats.  Suddenly a manager appears with offers of a free drink and excuses about the private party was only supposed to last two hours, but what could you do.  I said that you could tell me when calling me to confirm my reservation that the back room had been rented out.  Never did we get an apology for not honoring our reservations until we were leaving, but obviously the place jumped at the private party, and kept everyone else hanging, and didn't care one iota.  The two women at the front door were clueless about how to handle the situation..  Attractive enough looking place, but there are plenty more fish in the sea.  Poor management...Not going back, needless to say.
