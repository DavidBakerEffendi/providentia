I have tried Sushi from San Francisco to Texas to New York and now in New Haven - and I have to say that Miya's is by far the best and most innovative that I've found.  While still having some of the traditional sushi rolls on their menu, Miya's pushes the envelope with flavor combos.  Best bet is to get the Blue Plate Special and have a sampling of their best.   Also try the Sweet Mother's Milk - artichoke with a pickled? jalapeno dipping sauce - - it's sooooo delicious. Beyond the food, the atmosphere is the other half of why this place is awesome.  The owner and staff really try to make everyone feel as though they are joining in on something fun.  Sake Bombs with the waiters are frequent and people will often join together and converse.  It's a super fun place.
