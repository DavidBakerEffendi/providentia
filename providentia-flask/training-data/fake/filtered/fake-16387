My husband and I visit Peppinos once a week and always enjoy the food.  I just wanted to let everyone know what type of people they are.  I know a neighborhood girl that married and moved to Breezy Point to raise her 5 children and has recently been displaced because of Hurricane Sandy.  When I mentioned it to one of the owners of Peppinos they immediately invited the intire family for dinner on them.  These are real family, neighborhood people ! God Bless them for doing such a good thing!
