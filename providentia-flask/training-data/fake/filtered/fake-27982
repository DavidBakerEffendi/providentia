In my opinion they serve authentic South Indian food. Home made taste. I would definitely return. Yeah sure the walls are bare but hey, I've come to eat not stare at walls. As long as the food and service is fine, I'm good. It is a little pricey but surely worth a second visit. I look forward to try out more.
