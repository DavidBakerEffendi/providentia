Heard from my friend- went there last week with my family.  Loving all of the FOOD ( spc the deep fried soft shell crab,papaya salad,catfish salad)- but not crazy for the Drunken Noodles -tasteless - the pad Thai is just OK, fried rice is tasteless.  Agreed the service is not great,but our waitress warned us the food will take times. 100% will come back next trip to NY.
