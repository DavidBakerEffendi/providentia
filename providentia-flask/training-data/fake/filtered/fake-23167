Went here yesterday and had a great lunch. My friends had the breakfast menu and I went for a main course - both great. Tea and coffee also great with a really helpful busboy who refilled out water glasses and coffee whenever we ran low! Annoyingly, the hostess had told us it was a 30 minute wait, but we actually ended up waiting well over an hour. It was 40 degrees outside so by the time we were eventually given a table we were frozen! A nice man (who I assume was the owner) was very apologetic though and did come out to tell us it wouldn't be long. Next time I'd have appreciated a more accurate time estimate from the beginning, as we probably wouldn't have even bothered had we been told it would be an hour. We only ended up staying because it became a case of 'we've waited so long if we leave now it'll all have been pointless'. Also, they only take cash, so make sure you have enough before you go in. Worst comes to worst, there's a chase ATM in the duane reade across the road.
