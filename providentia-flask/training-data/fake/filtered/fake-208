Don't fall for the hype.  Found Geno's and Pat's to be the worst cheesesteaks I have ever tasted.  Extremely long line, rude staff, greasy pile of seasoned wood chips, and the nerve to charge 9.00 for this disappointing experience.  The worst cheesesteaks that I've ever had, tasted way better than both Pat's and Geno's.  I would understand better if they competed for the "worst tasting cheesesteaks".
