Stopped in for lunch and everything started ok. I had ask if they could substitute one side for another and they said "the kitchen" couldn't. I explained I was willing to pay the difference in the price. The waiter ask if I would like for him to asks the manager and i said yes. I didn't get a response from either. The wider then avoided us and the manager never come by to see what the issue was. I guess NO means NO! and don't ask! If someone would have come to our table I and explained I would have understood. Why be Rude? I will never go back
