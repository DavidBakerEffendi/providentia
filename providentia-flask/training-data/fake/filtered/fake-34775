Really like this place! Cool ambiance, good service, and informative about the menu (Never had Korean before so I had some questions). Even won a free beer after getting to spin the wheel!. Bibimbap was awesome as well. Only complainant is that it is a little pricey for the portion size, but overall good experience!
