What a fantastic find for lunch.  In this time of pinching pennies, you can find good, healthy food for a great price.  The menu is huge with a great selection of wraps.  Something for everyone, whether you are a meat eater or a vegetarian!  My friend and I are on a mission to try every single wrap on the menu.  It may take us a while!  Also a great place for a quick bite when you have a demanding boss to return to in the afternoon! Service is quick and excellent, I always am out within one hour, if I need to be.
