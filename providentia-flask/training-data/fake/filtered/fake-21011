I totally agree with the positive reviews of Spice End! I went here for the first time after first noticing it a couple of months ago when it opened. I got the Chicken Tikka Kati Roll- delicious!! I'ts a good size and extremely tasty. Large, fresh pieces of chicken that you can tell were marinating for awhile in a delicious spice blend. The spice level was just right to compliment the chicken; it wasn't overpowering. I got take out: the service was super fast. The place looked very tidy. I wish they had a few Indian appetizers, as those are some of my personal favorites! Definitely recommend if you like Indian food. I want to try their rice dishes next. I can't wait to go back!
