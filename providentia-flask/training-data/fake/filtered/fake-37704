Kim's Sushi is awesome! Great service and great sushi.  Their menu isn't as extensive as other places, but that's OK. It's straight up sushi, no hot entrees.  Once upon a time the original location was in Lincoln Park and named for the owners wife Kim, The current owner (Mr. Kim....strange) worked there.  Then the West Orange location opened with Mr Kim running it. Then he bought it from the original owner, who then closed the Lincoln Park location for some reason.  Anyway, I found them in Lincoln Park and loved it then.  Mr Kim has maintained the great service and food.  Some of my favorites are the creamy salad roll, seared tuna app. and the BEST PHILADELPHIA ROLL ANYWHERE!!!
