Found this gem with Yelp's help. Small but vibrant. Yummy cocktails and bustling for a weeknight. Opted for the tasting menu - apps were dreamy, gnocchi course was from heaven. Main courses were average. Maybe we were too full from the earlier courses? Worth another visit. Call ahead tho to make sure there's room.
