I love this restaurant. The food is consistently outstanding. The prices are reasonable, the portions are large and, whether you order pizza, a sandwich or a full dinner, the taste is top notch. Their chicken parm, lasagna and eggplant are the best in the Trenton area. The owner is a very affable and upbeat man and he usually makes the rounds to see that the customers are happy. the wait staff is often family and they are friendly and helpful, always eager to please. The restaurant itself is oddly configured, and seating can be awkward. However, the food is so fine that the so called ambiance is of little importance.
