Three and a half. Vinnie's is definitely my go-to place for non-chain delivery pizza. There's another Vinnie's (re-named Venice pizza) they opened up by Wonder Bagels but it appears to be failing, unfortunately. If you want to sit down I'd recommend Stadium pizza, which isn't too far away (by K-Mart in the shopping center). But this is about Vinnie's. Their pie is around $10 and is exactly what you'd expect a slice to taste like. The sauce is good, cheese is good, but I'm not a big fan of the crust. They don't roll it out as much as they use to which makes the crust rather chewy, perhaps to fit the different pizza boxes they have every week that advertise other pizzerias. I have also had the Sicilian slice (much better value for a ~$15 pie), their calzones, parmesan sandwiches, and garlic knots. The calzones ($5-$6) are open-faced with mozzerala on top. There's classic ricotta inside the fried bread shell and whatever topping you choose (sausage recommended for 50cents extra) is melted into the mozzerela. It comes with a small cup of marina. Â The sandwiches are rather average. I believe they get the bread possibly from Elio's bakery on Westside. The sauce and cheese are the same they use for the pizza and the meat (chicken, veal) are rather low quality but what you'd expect from a pizzeria. The chicken is probably bought pre-made so I'd go with the veal if you're in the mood. The garlic knots are tossed in parsley and garlic and I'd recommend them as a side to anything you get, but they are a bit oily (get them with marinara for 50cents extra). This place can get busy Friday/Saturday night because of all the deliveries/in-house pickups (what they're good for) so you might have to spend a few minutes on hold on the phone, and I'd expect about an one-hour wait. Oh, and on a side-note a lot of JC cops eat/pick-up here so expect to always see a few inside (isn't that a way to know if the food's good?).
