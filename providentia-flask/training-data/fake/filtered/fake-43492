My family and I went here last night for my mother's Birthday and from start to finish the food was excellent! I had a Caesar salad that was amazing. I know it's not hard to make a Caesar salad but the lettuce was crisp, the dressing was perfect and the shaved parmesan on top completed it. For my main course I had the pollo bianco which is chicken, sausage and peppers saut√©ed in a white wine, lemon sauce. It was phenomenal. It was light and didn't feel to heavy on my stomach. I was able to have dessert, there were 6 of us and we ordered 3 desserts and shared. I had the "Italian ice cream sandwich" which is hazelnut gelato and nutella between two pizelles. Again, amazing. My sisters ordered the chocolate ganache cake. Chocolate cake with a peanut butter mousse inside, covered in ganache. Do I even need to tell you if we liked it? I can't remember the name of the other dessert, it was ice cream covered in a chocolate coating. with a caramel center, very good. The owner gave us all shots of arancello to salute my mom's Birthday. It was a wonderful experience and I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. I will be back.
