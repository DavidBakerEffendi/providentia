Terrible service. My father-in-law and I went here with my 3 1/2 month old son.  My father-in-law was just going to have a beer and my son was hungry - so thus, I needed to feed him. We were told that we couldn't sit at a table, but had to be at the bar if we weren't eating... with a baby?  I've never been asked to sit a bar with him before... So...I said that we needed to sit at the table because my son was hungry.  The waiter tried to say that we couldn't sit there...I had to tell him that it was against the law to deny me from breastfeeding my son - his response? Something along the lines of: I don't think that's true After arguing with him, we were eventually able to sit down.  Meanwhile, my son had begun to wail from hunger...poor little guy.  The waiter who served us was extremely rude - I guess because we weren't eating there?   Just for the record - there were only 2 maybe 3 tables occupied...the rest of the tables were empty.  (Probably because it was around 5 o'clock ---not exactly the dinner rush)  We only stayed for about 10 minutes while my son ate (and my father-in-law drank his beer)...there was no reason to treat us in this manner.  It was a terribly uncomfortable experience.
