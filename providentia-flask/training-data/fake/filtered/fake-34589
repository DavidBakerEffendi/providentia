There are some days you want to tried different foods , foods from other countries and i just moved to Philadelphia and I wanted to try indian food . Me and my hubby went out to have dinner last night at chutney company and we ordered paneer Â dosa and chicken tikka masala with rice and one kathi roll and everything was so delicious and flavory with perfect indian taste and texture . Now that I found this nice indian resturant I will go every week.
