I'm from New York so I'm especially picky about my pizza. I've tried many pizza joints around New Haven and Oregano Joe's is by far the closest thing to what I'm used to.  I ordered a large thin crust cheese pizza and it tasted- Delicious!  Reminded me of New York style pizza, that's how good it was. This is my new go to pizza place- even if I have to drive all the way from West Haven!
