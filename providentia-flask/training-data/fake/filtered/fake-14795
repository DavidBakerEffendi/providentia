Finally! A worthwhile dinning experience that doesn't cost an arm and two legs in central Jersey. I tried Centro Grille last night for the first time and was blown away by the meal. Aside from friendly service and a cool atmosphere, the food was great. A big hunk of melt in your mouth fillet, a moist flaky Arctic Charr and a berry brioche bread pudding to die for sealed the deal on my date night. It seems every restaurant these days tries too hard to be creative and instead Centro Grille makes it seem effortless. I will definitely be back...again and again.
