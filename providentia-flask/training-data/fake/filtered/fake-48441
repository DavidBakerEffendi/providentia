Been to Pat's too many times to count.  I consider Pats to be the yardstick to compare all cheese steakks to, and yes, many are not nearly as good or should not even be considered cheese staks, and occasinally, some joints are better.  Over all, Pat's does not ever disappoint though, the bread is a big part of it, and Pat's rolls are excellant.  Great condiments too.
