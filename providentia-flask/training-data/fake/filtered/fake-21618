For the person that said this was a "mediocre meal"....C L......you are completely out of your mind. This has been the best carribbean food I've had and I've been to many carribbean spots. The spices and flavor used in every meal is ridiculously delicious. Coming from a hispanic background, I am used to lots of flavor in my food. Morgan's Island Grill does just that. And for those who complain about the wait, the food there is DEFINITELY worth the wait. All meals are prepared to order which accounts for the longer wait time, and quite frankly, I'd rather wait and know that my meal is being prepared fresh than go somewhere and have a meal where the ribs feel tough because they've been sitting out for too long. If you want faster service then you should think about going to McDonald's or Burger King. My husband and I have now made it a ritual to stop at Morgan's Island Grill every weekend. When you go to a restaurant that has the Chef come out and personally greet his/her customers, that really says a lot about the quality of service. You could read a bunch of comments about this place, but I highly recommend that you go try it for yourself. You certainly will not regret it. The food is AMAZING!
