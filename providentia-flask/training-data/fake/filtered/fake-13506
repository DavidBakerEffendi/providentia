I have been eating at Mexicali for years. The food is very good, not Authentic Mexican but Tex-Mex. I LOVE any of the Fajita dishes, Fajita Quesadillas, Fajita Salads...they also have awesome specials that they run periodically. The food is reasonably priced and you get a very good size portion. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good tex-mex meal. The Margaritas are awesome as well and they have a great selection of local Micro Brews on draft. VT Brews only $3.50 on Mondays, and House Margaritas are only $4.50 on Thursday! it doesn't get any better than that.
