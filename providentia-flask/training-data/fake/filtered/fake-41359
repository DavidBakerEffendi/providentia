My husband and I were looking for a new place to try and we had heard about the North End Bistro through friends. The overall atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice; we chose to sit outside on the patio that is adjacent to Nassau street. We shared the hummus as an appetizer, which was served with crudités and fresh vegetables- really delicious.  Our entrees came out quickly - we ordered the porcini mushroom ravioli and the fish tacos. Both were really fresh and and tasted fantastic. The menu was extensive and reasonably priced. Staff is very friendly, and our server, Jess, was excellent. The bistro is a new favorite - we will definitely be back!
