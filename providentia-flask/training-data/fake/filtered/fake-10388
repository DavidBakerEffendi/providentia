Food: Food is great, always tasty and my family is a regular customer at the place. Price: Maybe it's my innate cheapness but I feel like they've been serving less and less over the past few years for the same price they've always charged (sometimes - very rarely - I've noticed that dishes have gone up a dollar but the amount is still the same). I guess they have to do it because of the economy and also because they've had to recently renovate the place after a fire but my heart still hurts to pay $6 for a small place of something that is essentially fried dough covered in more fried dough and household spices. And pretty sure they're not paying over minimum wage to all the kitchen workers in the back. But i guess that's the situation for most places you go, Indian or not.
