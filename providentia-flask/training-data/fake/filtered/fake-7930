Probably the best restaurant I've ever been to - I didn't even think I liked Middle Eastern food that much until I went to Zahav.  Their hummus is to die for, their salad assortment is delicious and creative, and each of their small plates is done incredibly well.  I in particular recommend the fried cauliflower and the haloumi.  The pricing is very reasonable for what it is - $36 a head for dinner that includes the hummus, 8 salads to share, and two small plates and one larger entree plate per person.  I try to go to Zahav every time I am in the area because it is just plain awesome.
