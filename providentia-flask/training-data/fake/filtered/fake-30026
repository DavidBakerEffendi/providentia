When it comes to restaurant, nothing is important to me besides food quality. We catered from this restaurant for a small party. First, they made custom order for us since we did not had the minimum folks for tray service. Second, and most importantly, the food QUALITY was A+. We are very picky when it comes to indian food and therefore have not liked any restaurant in West Windsor Area besides this one. Keep it up guys!!
