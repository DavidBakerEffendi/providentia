My husband and I love Fiorino. We take everyone there - our parents, siblings, friends, and even our 2 month old baby. The environment is warm and welcoming and the food is excellent. I always feel like I am back in Italy when we are there. Franco and his staff truly love the neighborhood and all of their customers. Go go go!
