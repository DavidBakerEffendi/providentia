It's just the best pizza and everyone must try it.  Any New Yorker who isn't excited by the prospect of venturing to Midwood, Brooklyn to get one of the best pizza pies in the world, are crazy.  You can read a gazillion reviews online with all the details of the fresh ingredients, how they are hand-made my Dom DiMarco.  You can find video online of the DiFara's experience but you must go yourself, brave the mob and delight in the art of a true pizza master.
