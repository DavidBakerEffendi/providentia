My all-time favorite brunch spot with a potential death row meal (Moroccan Benedict). The Brooklyn location is bright and beautiful and I've never waited longer than 10 minutes for a table. Mogodor hits the trifecta of great food, fantastic service and amazing vibe (i leave that for you to decipher but eye candy is ridiculous). Make sure to ask for the hot sauce!
