Had a fabulous meal and experience at Sweet Grass! The host was warm and inviting. My server, Stephanie, was pleasant and attentive. Shared the fried green tomatoes and shrimp n grits....the bacon jam on the tomato should be bottled and sold separately- it's that good! So much flavor on one plate! Shrimp n grits was also full of flavor. Had the special of the night-sea bass and crab cake. Just heavenly! Almost licked the plate clean! Ended the meal with the pumpkin bread pudding as recommended by our server- it was the perfect ending to a great meal! Delicious food, beautiful and serene ambience, and lovely service. Will definitely be back!
