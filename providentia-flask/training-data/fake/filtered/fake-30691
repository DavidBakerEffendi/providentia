My family and I had two wonderful experiences when we came for lunch on Saturday afternoons.....we were just there this past Saturday and we will NEVER be back...the food was alright BUT the service was the worst we have ever experienced anywhere..waitress took forever to greet us and take drink order  then disappeared finally brought drinks 20 minutes later disappeared again...when we were finally able to order the food took forever  waitress never came by our table and when the food was brought we had no utensils we had to find someone to get them for us..our two small children were also miserable...we asked for the server that we had the other times we were there and were told she no longer works there ..I dont remember her name but she rescues dogs.....she was an AMAZING server who was friendly, knowledgeable, great with the kids, didnt leave us hanging no matter how busy it was..She was the type of waitress the all estblishments should have......Heres a tip we are not the only unhappy customers that were looking for her on Saturday...get rid of the young kids that could care less and get some people in that care.....The only reason it got one star is because I couldnt post without one.
