Cozy atmosfere, wonderful food and excellent service. We felt very wellcomed. You have to make a reservation because the place is quite small. I began with gf bread and olive oil with garlic, the bread was very good, not out of this world. Then I had the ravioli filled with funghi and ricotta, that was sensational, and the desserts are something special, I had the lima pie. Very good expresso to finish a wonderful meal.
